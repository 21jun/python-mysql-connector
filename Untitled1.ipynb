       "'cool you have such a good game 834 you forgot the weapons on the roof of that building this is just my check point for this video 13552 i find this game to be depressing should i skip this or ho staight to borderlands 2 this guy actually heard all of what marcus had to say hell hes worse than torgues grandma never stops talking shame on the developers though theyve made such a huge dialogue when you can quickly select the character like any sane person would and skipmiss it all out bl2 forever vaultyvaults maybe you should go to bed now good playing i like it when brick goes apeshit and punches everything to hell so after i beat borderlands 1 normal edition 2 days later they announced borderlands remaster so yeah here is another borderlands video lol hope ya enjoy  slack best game walkthrough presenter of all time great wt series slack can be followed with any character not just morty pistol build i have the goty enhanced version of the game but i could not get the violence revolver to spawn at the beginning of the game like you did after ten tries i just gave up and just followed the rest of the walkthrough with a repeater gun also thanks for doing these videos so i only get that violence revolver if i have the enhance version i currently have the goty version but not enhanced i followed slack1 yeaaaaheh slack your skyrim videos hooked me now im watching borderlands i just bought the handsome collection will that work with this playthrough keep up the great videos slack you never told us you had a channel for other games d whenever i hear the robot talk i think of invader zims grr does the goty edition come with all dlc does reloading the game mean starting a new character over and over or just exit and reload thanks in advance for any help if you dont have the loyalty weapons do the following 1 unlink the platform from your current shift account on the offical site 2 start first borderlands 2 or the presequel and create a new shift account from within the game 3 start borderlands 1 goty enhanced if you create a shift account on bl1 and then play bl2 or bltps you wont get the bonus weapons i know i missed it but i understand you needed to be at level 20 when opening the gift shop for legionaries  just one word for this thanks yes this will be awesome thank you sir  going for the giftshop now before the headlands as you said last time i hacked weapons there was a slight weapons level glitch in my inventory this should give nice weapons and no glitches i followed this power start from your last video but made a mistake at the hanging boat i jumped out instead of exiting the game and the assasins spawned at the new you pole what a hairraising run that was to get to scooters and safety my heart was pounding this is going to be such a fun walkthrough to watch i actually started a pistolero mordecai after watching your claptrap dlc walkthrough i must say it can be tough at the beginning but with the million dollar power start and a lil hyperion giftshop farming this build becomes insane arguably incredibly op at higher levels and i love it d gun crazy 55 relentless 55 a good gunslinger com and a pestilent defiler the lance are doomed d awesome work as usual slack thumbs up borderlands the handsome collection is free for playstation plus subscribers this month d ah man the wait was worth it this is gonna be an epic run i even started watching your original borderlands 2 walkthrough just to keep watching slack doing borderlands you are by far the best persons not following both msv and msa are not true hard core slackers back with the slack cant wait to see this walkthrough thumbs up  great to have you back missed you slack as of this moment i am player level 39 and on the crazy erle main story mission and have gotten past moxxi in the general knoxx dlc for a level 37 mission perfect subject choice for the walkthrough i find the whole dlc leveling issue frustrating ok slack starting from scratch looking forward to this mordecai pisterlero walktrough got the violence and the gearbox shotgun thanks yes more borderlands and a great real walkthrough on major slack attack gonna be hard to keep up thumbs up as always cool looking forward to watching this walkthrough borderlands is one of my alltime favorite series ive been there from day one im really excited for borderlands 3 it looks so good will you be starting a borderlands channel and will you buy borderlands 3 when it comes out keep up the borderlands videos ive been wanting to see your play the zombie dlc and all its side quests oooo for some reason i think for a pistolero build through the desert wastes the gun slinger should have the last name be desperado especially if his first name is gunsmoke looking forward to this entire walkthrough slackbabble ahoy glad youre back slack i missed ya this is going to be great holy moly were in for a treat i play it now and i dont see much difference except dx11 render instead of dx9 fxaa antialiasing support i used smaa injector before but it also blurs text and ui also there is a bug that aniso filter resets to trilinear after game relaunch but you can easily notice it by blurry distant textures and turn it on again other than that it works good no crashes and its free for me probably because i own original already they just added it to my account without any notification so i didnt even know about it they made it more expensive lol bro you sound like kermit thats awesome i was wondering if they were gonna remaster this i figured they were pondering paying the licensing fees for the theme song and credits song just for a remaster nice i just noticed enchanced version in my library i had no idea it exists but why havent they add more details to lilith plot features the light is brighter on clap traps eye in bl1 enhanced and the explosions sound better in enhanced you play on yhe highest settings without lag i play on lowest settings under 60 fps the question i have does this run in 169 now i remember the original didnt like 169 mode monitors and i not want to play with bars at my side  the shadows on the characters shouldnt have been removed weapon firing seems to have a deep bass way amplified the explosions are more crisp and the barrel animations shouldnt have been messed with outside of the way the light up when they are about to explode i dont think most of them should have been improved so much im also not a fan of the ui highlighting as it takes away from the overall feel of the game the higher resolutions textures aa fxaa and minimap do make the game look overall a lot better pandoras moon now looks like the moon we see in borderlands 2 in the old version it looks like a planet with its own atmosphere however thank you for your video enhanced version has been in my library for awhile now unplayed i think ill go play it now the audio itself sounds like the same sound clips however i do think that the goty enhanced has less compressed audio than the original it sounds crisper i dont like the fluid particle effects like acid and blood they used in borderlands 2 thank god they didnt add them now this game looks newer than borderlands 2 hmmmmm very interesting also i think i watched this already it would have been so gross if borderlands used the same colour palette as borderlands 2 eww the game has got such a great environment and borderlands 2 ruined the entire atheistic pandora feels so hostile and wastelandy compared to borderlands 2s beautiful landscape borderlands 1 looks so dead and lifeless which is the entire point how could there be treasure there whereas borderlands 2 screams vibrant landscape explore me i have treasuresz it goes against the narrative why couldnt they do this to bdl2 something i also noticed is that the cutscenes relating to the destroyer were changed he actually has an intro card now i have it on ps4 but i bought it on pc as i heard its better on pc especially since i can play it 5 hours a day and take a break my oled tv is amazing when it comes to games but i keep taking breaks in between to prevent burn in excessive but great comparison and great game the biggest improvement is the minimap lol i only bought it because of the field of view im sorry but the sirens sagged tits put me off playing the first borderlands i was gonna play it for story reasons but no lmao anyone else think that bl1s hud is really hard to look at i played bl 1 today only 9 people were on ps4 makes me sad to see it go the thing is the goty is a epic exclusive makes me sad can you still decapitatedismember shooting the enemies in this one the only issue had with the second one as they just simply explode 432 wait that gun in enhanced looks worse so the goty enhanced is just a upgrade of the original i can uninstall the original and just start with the enhanced  this game is really modern to be so bad as it was i mean anything in directx 9 and above should be just fine i thought i had to buy enhanced version because i have original borderlands on steam i found out i got it for free today i dont see much deterrents in it the original could have had a minimap they added so little but took out lan play gg this is honestly laughable not worth it or did they balance it too i mean lilith was op compared to the other 3 borderlands 1 now have a map this is a great complementation compared to original one enhanced this is how i remember borderlands but while i launching original borderlands i saw some soap i have found several changes one of the biggest is there is a box in fyrestone which makes it different to get the chest under the water tower then after bonehead before in the first you could drive a car into that area and run him over in the enhanced you cant they added some supports then there is a large pipe in new haven those are the ones i have really noticed the only sound effect i heard differently is how loud the enhanced version is i think the improvements add up to a nice modern experience makes the game much more user friendly the sound is i little deeper in the remastered version who cares using reshade on the original is way better this is just a bullshit gimmick the angel scenes have been completely raped i went back to the normal goty because of it lol imo the sound did improved a little echoing sounds susbtantialy better on the gotye but that could be just my imagination this game is good if u never play the old one if not the changes are  the remastered seams to have a better echo effect after a weapons been fired why didnt they just update instead of having enhanced the original still ran my pc down to 20 fps even on my rtx 2060 in certain places borderlands 1 but with borderlands 2 graphics i love your intro this is complete bs i play on xbox one x and is no where near what your pc should be the graphics on claptrap are so much better there is shadow on the characters on the bus but thats possibly because i have hdr the sounds of course arent gonna change thats not what the update was intended for maybe you should upgrade your pc before you continue to do more videos or should i say to console players with 4k and hdr it will be a huge difference sekiroshadows die twice vs niohdirect comparison two samurai felt both similar betweens this two games remasters are meant for those who never played the originals the original vision will always get detracted a little but that doesnt matter for those who wouldnt know the difference for me the borderlands that got printed onto discs in 2009 after how many years of development will always be my definitive edition honestly i like the original much better the audio though subtle is enhanced slight changes to reverb as well as altered shot sound effects for more complexity this is lame even for a remaster they change so microscopic level that its very hard too compare you have too stand and zoom in to see what have been improvedbtw love nick930best comparison channel in youtube idk in some ways the og looks better for me it would not go 144 hz it would change back to 60 every time i exited the menu also wasd stopped working and it forced me to play with a controller is there a mod that fixes this hi nick930 can you do a comparrison between rust ark survival evolved they added fov slider for me that is already enough to play it they didnt even improve the guns textures most look as blurry as in the original game no significant changes free for previous owners but only to promote the third game that isnt even on steam at launch actually the sounds feel slightly different feels like there is an echo added the audio changes from what i can tell have been cleaned up slightly in post on the enhanced edition everything is frame by frame accurate with the original though so its not a complete rerecord this is a nice analysis however i noticed some clipping and distortion with some of the dialog in a few of the cutscenes especially in the dlc maps i was wondering if you or anyone else noticed this or if it was just my brain playing tricks on me could you at least make it the same time of day beautiful game first played it when i was about 9 years old good times i just checked to see if i own the goty remastered edition on steam and wouldnt you know so downloading it now as the urge for a replay became too overwhelming thanks for the reminder  i always love your direct comparison videos keep up the great work  i hope you have ac iii remastered in the works i know theres other videos but your content is way more thorough and it answers any questions i might have for some reason for me on the pc version the character voices and some sound effects are really weird and when you look straight at them you can hardly hear them but if you turn to the side you can but this doesnt effect anything else correct me if im wrong but it definetly wasnt like that in the original he forgot how they added the golden chest to fyre stone and how they completely changed angels visual it is nolonger a white face at the top and is now a blue cartoony look best i could describe it looks nice 300 id just like to point out the game does not use a celshading art style at all they tried to replicate graphic novels and comic books in motion do you have a suicidal and an alcoholic green puppet frog lying around somewhere the new games sound is crisper lighter so not jarring and has more of an ambient feel i must be missing something because i only saw maybe a 12 difference looks like a cash grab to me thinking about the sound comparison id have to say that when closing my eyes and just listening rewatching and knowing when happens at what time that the enhanced version sounds give a much more bold echo and harder hitting sound and making the area feel large unlike the original where the sounds only feel confined to your character instead of the world around you enhanced is buggy sounds are practically identical deeper and slowed down did claptrap lose weight i think the sound in enhanced is a little bit crisper and clearer i prefeer the original hud dos not matter as the games great mate game play still the same you have a great week my friend theres a very slight change in the gun sounds im not sure if its just me but it seems bassier and a little less flat echoes resound more and have more of a bounce back effect the rest seems the same so it may just be a change in gun sounds used or very slight location differences heres how you fix the bland color palette go to cusersyour usernamedocumentsmy gamesborderlands game of the yearwillowgameconfig open willowengineini ctrlf posteffects change posteffects uselegacydesaturationfalse enjoy have they improved the texture popin issues from the original version havent played any borderlands so i should play og or goty en is it really worth 30 though they also gave lilith some better bitties wow finally i can try these enhanceovision goggles everything looks the same with the gun sounds i notice a very nice echo in the remastered version giving the sound much more depth specially when it comes to explosive barrels and snipers there is a bug which resets anisotropic filtering to the lowest option each time the game is launched just a heads up my biggest grip replaying bl1 on ps4 is that the sound engine for that game has aged terribly and the soundtrack is dogass looks the fucking same i am absolutely loving the enhanced goty edition of borderlands playing it for the first time in years and although i remember exactly what to do at what point ive forgotten just how great it is and why im such a fan boy  is it wrong that i like borderlands 2 more than 1 looks completely identical unless you are specifically told what to look for what i noticed in the audio of the rm the sounds was are faster by a tiny bit lmao is this video serious i see nothing different trash will always be trash it alwaysed looked terrible just going to put it out there that if you buy this expecting it to look like a new game you shouldnt buy it i bought it just to be able to play bl1 on ps4 not because i expected anything else honestly i think the original other than its 30 fps720p resolution holds up really well on consoles just the ease of access for ps4 to play it makes it worth the 30 i know its also on ps now but i dont want to have to play game through that the new one is just mostly bug fixes and glitch fixes it seems god these gamers these days want graphics yall sound like your dissecting a painting it honestly bothers me i wish we could all go back to gamecube and n64 days that why the games get smaller the graphics probably take up so much 72 gb update and honestly didnt even notice any improvements if you guys think the small changes is worth 60 bucks then your just a borderlands dickrider i dont really care about the looks or sounds but the game itself plays so much better than it did before making the gameplay more enjoyable what i care more for than the graphical changes is all the qol changes like the minimap auto pickup on ammo and money fow slider in the options and the new inventory menu etc my ame has this weird lag looking effect when i look around and the mouse moves really slow can someone help money grab i re played this game in 2160p like 3 years ago basically was playin the best version a longtime ago lol its almost like borderlands didnt really need a enhanced version at least they gave a free copy to those who had the borderlands goty on steam videoborderlands enchanced vs orignal youtube its borderlands 3 borderlands enhanced its the same as the original but we want your money i like the old claptraps eye more it had a lens which in the remaster is just a light the outlines are way much more pronounced than it should in the ehnanced version on the original it gives the borderlands look and in the ehnanced version it makes things look out of place and thin narrow objects look really bad specially characters broken game not play tested at all lmao multiplayer broken game settings dont save save files dont save for certain people and a lot more bullshit i meangearbox have made good games but they really use the term remaster very very lightly maybe its just me but i feel like the sounds are different like in the remaster there is more bass to each sound playing with friends we noticed that the sound hasnt changed much from the original but the sound altering effects had been touched for example shooting in a cave seemed more echoy and louder than it did in the original version no mention of the improved shadows on clap trap what an incredibly dull and uninspired video unsubbed while i am here does anyone know if the upload character actually works i dont have my ps3 with me but i would like to import my old ps3 character into this just like i did with bl2 and presequel original did have lots of blurry and messy textures and models glad they improved that but im bothered about that lack of lighting in the bus part im afraid in some other places it may look like that too bright and without shadows those stripped shadows caused by curtains are quite an atmospheric touch in anywhere imo omg new rocks on the floor im so buying this game again hardly seems worth it i paused at 056 and the original has more little details theres grass and mushrooms on the ground both are missing from the remaster all though there are some rocks missing from the original personally i find the grass and mushroom are better details it looks like they thickened the border line in an attempt to hide the jagged edge i think there should be an option to revert back to the original texture pack but just with the added resoultion upgrade and frame rate this option would make the borderlands goty edition pointless on pc but on console it would be a pretty neat option remade or not give a me a copy of any borderlands game and ill play it for hours please do minecraft vs minecraft 2 still didnt add triple screen support much more significant changes much more expensive price crisping up everything is much better than changing everything yeah the sound effects dont really seem to be changed at least not a lot that lest test seemed to be slightly different goty edition seemed to slightly longer and deeper but i could just be crazy ahhh yes time to play back while waiting for borderlands 3 i dunno but the game seems alot more easier in the enhanced version all major bosses go down without much effort i was shocked i killed sledge very quickly on my first go at the normal character lvl for the mission even the giant versions of monsters like skagzilla and mothrakk were a push over why arent you showing the fov slider its literally the most important thing added to the game d is there an option for fov also tk baha as dlc vault hunter pls lol gotta say i prefer the original can inject fxaa and other settingstools myself lol looks like an overall improvement except the bus shadows those would be nice does anyone know how to make bordelands 1 not look so blurry in distance  whats music playing on the background i realy like it now we just need an rtx implementation  why did they even do this arent the changes in fyrestone to be more like the fyrestone from bl2 the new sound effects have an extra reverbecho layer its difficult to notice but it is there you forgot most annoying change the lady that helps you now is pixelated to hell and it looks weird every time she is on screen i dont like how they implemented non optional ammo auto pick upto me the scavanging and looking for just the right ammo type was simply part of the game why is no one mentioning the horrible item menu the old menu was simple compressed efficient and easy to navigate this one has to include image of every gun in a tiny box its horrendous to scroll through everything once you get enough inventory space easily the worst part of the remaster borderlands gotye is cencored at the beginning zed doesnt cut the dudes legs off wtf is there more cencored stuff seriously cant see any difference just brighter now when angel pops onto your screen she also looks different compared to the original i love new smoother aiming its much easier to use scoped weapons now and weapons in general nice vid  so the original looks better than the revamp i bought bl1 remastered this was the first time i played it im a huge fan of bl2 and im shocked at how much better 2 is makes me realise how good 2 really is looks much nicer but honestly i cant tell the difference between the old and new sounds the original is awesome as it is nothing is a big deal until you make it a big deal 4real vanilla version with sweet fx and a few texture packs and mods look better wtfshitty way to make an enhanced version kinda feels like a cash grap idk doesnt look that much better to me tldr they added a fov slider some shadows have been improved removed and they made a texture pack thatll be 30please yeah audio is the same they are just selling the same game twice its the same game juat cause they change a little texture and add a rock here and there sick of how the game industry is rushing on this remaster games its sad how rotting the gaming environment is you assholes that make thumbnails like this dont actually show two different versions n its just the same picture pc install original is 12gigs enhanced is 19 no corsair rgb support maybe its just me but i prefer the original graphics the sound is like a hint more clear where the original is slightly muffled i assume the remaster has settings for fov and other more modern settings that was the biggest issue with playing the original i neither see or hear any difference between the versions the remaster has subtle but better sound it sort of blends better with the environment and i think i hear a few added bullet klinks as they hit the ground but that may be from it being a bit louder in the remaster stop new update new update a bit of new grass theyve also improved the muzzle flash fov slider was enough for me tbh its hard to remaster graphics like this i just got to new haven today in the enhanced version theres a lot of subtle changes there as well they added quite a few objects to fill in empty spots i get where this is going but its not epic see you guys next year april its not cel shaded i also like how they changed elpis pandoras moon to look more like the one from borderlands 2 as that design was changed to be cannon unlike in borderlands 1 it looked more like a terrestrial planet the level up bar is now blue not white its a simple change but that wasnt mentioned so it looks little better and somewhat worse hmm so now the goty enhanced edition officially looks better than bl3 haha its the same audio is a bit wider with physicsbased return ie how sounds reflect off of hard surfaces at varying speeds depending on location wait did they remove the horrible dhal vertical rectangle scope which took the whole screen up but you couldnt see anything out of this game was just a money grab claptrap has a bigger eye i cant decide which i think looks better such a minor change i cant believe they rereleased it for so little of an upgrade youtube thinks this is a video on borderlands 3 according to the description people seem to be ignoring the one important thing an fov slider ive not booted the game up yet to see if it actually works but oh maaaan itll be nice actually being able to play the game without eye strain from that awful fov and the old gimmicks to get around it in the original were nooooot fun to deal with still way too many jagged edges i really hope they bring back the diegetic character selection for borderlands 3 while i love bl2 having a boring grey background when selecting your characters was lame this just showed up in my library 2009wow time goes by its slight but the sounds are more crisp and defined in the remaster hey nick congrats for hitting 100k subscribers to bad you cant connect to friends on ps4 looks like they gave lillith fuller breasts too im sold man as a console pleb playin it on ps3 then ps4 was a godsend for me borderlands was hella fun to play with my buddy on split screen back in the day so many hours lost to this game but not as much lost to borderlands 2 hehe it really wasnt needed borderlands art style allows it to age well instead of receiving a remaster on steam id rather have borderlands 3 great video loved the commentary which was a nice change of pace from everyone else who just shows the comparison itself there is literally no improvement in the new one on steam i have both not enough of a difference to justify it in all fairness theyre not going shoot themselves in the foot and bump the quality up to borderlands 3 level a more comprehensive look at the game post fyrestone even would be cool and im not even really talking about the entire game just the largest standout points the sound in the enhanced version seems a bit more bass heavy only pixel counting nerds will notice the difference fact sorry but thats a terrible remaster this is something a single modder wouldve done in a few months cool looks exactly the same its probably big coming from a 360 but not pc nice video but i would have rather seen the differences on console as it was originally intended to be played on you forgot to mention theyve added a mini map to game of the year edition this makes a great improvement  im not sure if id want to purchase the enhanced edition maybe when it goes down on price still a good looking game  for console players this is a huge step up from the original considering it also has true ultrawide support and a fov slider in the new edition i say its well worth it for the quality of life improvements i swear the blood and gore was better in the original compared to all the other borderlands shame they didnt keep that with the remaster borderlands enhanced edition the menu looks nicer  the fire coming from the barrel of the guns looks alot better also i got an ad from borderland 3 that muzzle flash is greatly improved the overall clunkiness is gone smooth mouse turns forever you should had added angel in the special effects category she is incredibly different in the remaster is there a mod that get rids of the black borders anyone play this new version on console when i played the original after borderlands 2 it felt like moving and aiming in a world drowned in custard the shadows on the bus at the character selection is a bummer it was removed gave it a good feel of in depth like ok lets get this over with along with a mystery slightly to the characters so 10yo game got texture pack and reshade i would like to say that those are thing you could get for the original for free for quite a time now even without enhanced version at least on pc but i agree that this game with its caroonish look doesnt even need any of those enhancements what a comedy of remake xd could you do a comparison of the 360 version vs the new remaster i went from playing the 360 version on my xbox one to the remaster and im curious just how big a change there is this game needs to be completely remastered in another 10 years almost cant tell the difference in texture quality meh and whats with the missing shadows on the bus looks worse in the enhanced edition one of the best things is all the extra video and gameplay options like an fov slider and more for 10 years a dont see any major differenceold looks better very good video good job you missed the rocks in the ground for me the main problem is for this version of the game is i think gearbox using this rerelease to test the engine for bl3 at the first launch the application is warning me that my vga is not supported which is a radeon rx480 i started up the game anyway i got butter smooth frame rate also there is quality of life improvements in the game such as looting changeable fov slider but the golden keys in the first game is unacceptable i liked it in the second game because these keys can be obtainable by codes from gearbox twitter and in some situations you got a very good weapon for your level the game is essentially is the same but i recommend the original gotye package walk cycles on different terrain combined with shooting would be a truer test of the sound quality and design its likely they wouldnt changed much as theyd have to go about recording totally new stuff all they did was upscale some of the lower end textures and then added thicker cell shading to hide the aliasing im sure i could make the original look way better than this crap simply with a reshade at fairly low resource cost the only thing i could improve is shadow res i guess my eyes are too old to see the 30 price tag and to all the get a job comments i say get your own money didnt mention new fire also has heat wave distortion on the sign behind it sound is deeper and reverb is a little better in the remastered version didnt know jack mcbrayer had a youtube channel even remastered this shows its age and its not looking good ive been waiting for this for so long the only thing i wanted is what i got fov slider  so this is actually real everyones favorite talking robot is obviously glados guh this fucking guy sounds like kermit and its awesome the new sounds for the guns have more of an echo then they did before but its very slight or im deaf were playing a telltale game now i doubt ultra high resolution makes a massive difference with this style art this aint rendering its colored sketch ish looks like contrast and focus is raised a little id especially appreciate less of the muddy short cut art i like the style but lets face it lots of mud not a big difference but its free and appreciated maybe if i upgrade computers ill see a change itll have to do im not paying full price for 3 or risking spyware not even sure ill like the satanic religion emphasis villian is one thing satanic baby doll is a little too far for me the sound is clearer lmao modern gaming and gamers are weird its not too different compared to the original i was expecting bl2 graphics why isnt there no switch version  you have to remember tho theres improved frame rate fov loot and much more and the visual improvements are more substantial on console where you cant uncap the frame rate or anything like that are you serious you wanted this to look like bl2 this game is already a classic by todays standards and i like it the way it is this is not an angry comment but more of a fan and a classic guy so no hard feelings i hope i liked the video which is great and informativewell done  does anybody notice that the players voice seems incredibly low when jumping or when random quips are voiced after kills compared to the grunt from a melee attack or is it just me did they fix the fov guns sound slightly differnt to me anyone else or am i just having a stroke played bl1 on ps3 for a very very long time and when i got remastered i noticed huge differences it looks like bl2 now which is a great change youtube thinks this is borderlands 3 clouds in fyrestone the change is really biga video cant express that some of the rocks and things they added really piss me off because the cars get stuck more often i played as brick in the original in my new playthrough i played lilith and it feels way more fun also the textures are much better than the bl2 4k update sans the physx this is the best looking borderlands game at the moment about the sound a little tiny more bps kinda 320 bps but the samples are literally the same nothing noticable got an ad for borderlands 3 trailer what a coincidence basicslly they pulled a dark souls remastered im just happy i can adjust the fov everything else is just a bonus damn i bought borderlands goty with all the dlcs and stuff for like 8 bucks and now theres an enhanced version 2 months later mom mom look no difference do one with dying light original vs enhance edition this crap lies the real comp is if you would do this with xbox 360 and xbox one x why am i watching borderlands 3 ad before this video the original looked better to me the remaster did away with any bit of subtlety there was to the aesthetics maybe the grass is placed randomly amazing to me how many times theyve milked this game for consumers one thing i noticed was that sprinting is different the original had a slower sprint motion whereas the enhanced has more of a cod sprint all of the ambiance in the game is much more defined now and it seems like they have improved the sound quality in general and mixed thing to bright light to more of the small sounds and overlooked ambiance as a mac user this update totally screws us over now no mac user can play with a pc user that has this update and no pc user can play with anyone that hasnt installed it either this is really throwing a monkey wrench in online play i appreciate the effort by bl developers but this breaks the game for tons of people for a marginal graphics upgrade how about that mouse sensitivity nice video i know that the objective of this video was to show the sound and visual diferences betwen the games but i think that you should also have mentioned that the netcode is broken in the enhanced versionand they removed the multiplayer lan compatibility so at the moment the game is a single player experience and thats sad  how about how angel is a different person thanks for this comparison it was exactly what i needed please do this as well for borderlands 2 and the presequel every other graphics comparison just puts shots side by side with no explanation so i thought i was going crazy by not seeing a difference im on ps4 never played a borderlands game if i want to start at the beginning i should play this first then move on to the handsome jack collection correct still go back and play this every year or two i would buy it if it only added an fov slider instead of making me play around with ini settings the graphic improvements are nice but i did like the shadows on the bus from the original instead of maxing everything out can you just put it to where the game has it set due to some people not having a really good graphics card and for people who dont play this game on pc i think there wouldve been alot more changes just mytwo cents i just wish they put toggle aim option i dont like to have to hold the mouse button so when i run this game enhanced for some reason the game has a major drop in frames why if your gonna compare do it on pc was confused on why it looked worse then my experience gun sounds are more thumpy sounding in the new version imo could just be me though its kinda impressive how little was changed maybe it looks better in 4k with a 4ktv but if you still have a 1080p screen i see no reason to buy the remaster other than the 60fps and that isnt enough imo to warrant 30 if you have the first game on last gen or backwards compatibility on xbox one i like the new color added to the xp tracker you forgot the fov that was changed heres another difference you can play multiplayer in the original but not the remaster anyone else getting screen tearing on xbox borderlands 1 is the only one that truly feels like a complete wasteland where you wonder why are these people even here and what are you even looking for in this dump then the gateway opens and suddenly borderland isnt really borderland anymore its populated with robots and more sophisticated creatures theres so little difference i dont know why they even bothered whats the point of enhancing a celshaded game being able to age better is one of its advantages i think the borderlands 1 graphics hold up 50 more then the enhanced edition on the bus scene liliths hair in the enhanced edition looks too detailed and distracting to the point where it isnt soft and looks like hair liliths hair has been changed that the lower part of her hair has being cut into a flick style then than original one they put too much outline thickness on the characters background it just looks distracting to me obviously gearbox wanted a more cartoony comic book feel to it then the realistic drab comic look in borderlands 1 i prefer borderlands 1 feel a lot more its a shame you cant switch the graphics or toggle what you like or off with their textures like i dont like the lighting texture can i turn it to the original or i dont like liliths texture etc let the players change what specific textures lighting and object they seem inferior and see it there way i guess that would disrupt online play though this is just my ideas and i waste of  i know its an unpopular opinion but because of bls unique graphics design i feel bored all the time when going through locations because there is nothing to look at that is interestinggood looking unlike more recent games maybe im just spoiled after playing assassins creed odyssey i dunno i have played this new version and i recommend playing in 2k or 4k for the best experience with this games new textures it runs better than the classic and the quality of life that was added really made it a true enhance experience i played it on pc so i have no clue how it turned out on console nick930 i would like you to know that from the screenshots you provided we can definitly see multiple improvements done on claptraps model look closer  audio samples used are of the exact same lossy bit rate from the original some minor tweaks to certain reverb zone effects but if you look in the audio packages using ue viewer or even just a hex editor the vorbis files are the exact same rates someone smoked too much weedhey duude lets make no shadows and change the contrast in the textures yeah we make a million dollar dude why does youtube say this is borderlands 3 and all of you making mean comments and also because you forced me to start a sentence with and youuuu shuut yo dammmm mffffffin mouff beach literally cant tell the difference watching this in my phone the main issue i had with the first game was the animations oh my god the nostalgia i played the entire game on xbox with a friend in his house and it was an amazing experience i played tt borderlands it was wonderful now i kinda want to buy the handsome collection and preorder borderlands 3 so not much difference lets hope 1440p becomes the native resolution all round its the best in between where clarity is max and performance is max as well 4k is a bit much for any game no sense in playing that high of resolution until we get better performing parts haha great video by the way highest settings fov on 75 the only difference in audio quality outside yt compression is that the highs and lows are vaguely more distinct which to me would make me assume the files have been less compressed than original release though to what degree is anyones guess really nice to know something they did caused it to be completely unplayable on my pc which should easily be able to play this the game was trash i have the old ones i guess i will just keep them sooo they improved it by adding darker thick lines you know what i think if you gon make a game all that realistic and blow up my playbox anyway then make it realistic like the list piece of paper on the ground meant to add detail should have at least blown in the wind or occasionally the wind should blow codeing wise it was like add a thousand little none transparent boxes that move across the landscape not exactly wind but it will do because you cant see it that right there gives me something to do like i got angry walked around for a little while after failing to beat the boss and attempted to shoot the little floating piece of paper instead of stopping to this game suckssaysaddictedtoborderlands that and also a destructible environment goes a long way assuming you do it right keep in mind realism oh and proper sound affects give people heart attacksnot really pes if i find a way to get into space via your glitchy engine and there is nothing there you shall all ruu ps spelling era sencurly yours c gah so conflicted haha i loved it before and after for different things graphically the only auditory difference i noticed was when the barrel exploded ultimately i think theyve done a decent job of remastering it not spectacular but decent i was also hoping for physx that moment when you find the stroke setting and go full potato to your comments on the sound effects there is an improvement to the sound effects but very minor ones its looks like they up the gunfire on most of the guns to sound a litter meatier and heavier than the original barrels are the same but sound a bit crisper than the original other than that i have to hear the rest of the effects the engine sounds the walking sounds etc to see if they upped it as well but it does look like the quality of the sound effects was improved claptrap looks exactly the same because you cannot improve imperfection im wondering if they improved the weightiness of firing and if there are distinct hit markers they are charging near full price for exactly the same game there is little to no difference the sound design is very subtle but you can hear the change if you really listen its hard to describe but i think the remake is a bit slowed down another olsen twins type remaster i dont really like the removal of the shadows in the bus but its unimportant i guess i dont think they changed the audio at all i would have made the gunfire sounds a bit more bassey the more to like than to dislike as someone who does audio work on the side i did notice that theyve tightened the audio up a bit to give the explosion a little more exciting and not clutter the audio stage a bit didnt seem to touch muchthis is very welcome in my opinion sooo thicker outlines cool i noticed the pistole has a changed soundeffect the background has a new distortion when you listin precise enough for some reason playing borderlands 1 made me want to kill myself i have no idea why so depressing wonder if the remaster would change that lol not worth the money when we have had all this with mods for years imo nice video tho does the ps4 hd pack work on a regular ps4 i dont have the pro im either getting this for my 18th birthday or im going to buy it myself kermit plays games awesome ill stick with the none enhanced game the visual differences are so small only those with the most severe ocd would even care i dont know if it is just me and my crappy pc but the enhanced edition for me does load a little faster i feel like the jagged lines were replaced with thickerjagged lines also for the sight lenses has been improved you do see through them now while not aiming down sight some high tier weapon textures is more crisp in short just buy bl1 its incredibly cheap and there is almost no difference how do i get the free upgrade it is literally the same game sound design the enhanced version is just a little clearer and bassier but its still all the same with the sound i hear a sort of echo in the enhanced version as if you hear the bullet hit the stone far from him which i dont hear in the original why are there no comments about the unforgiving fov when you shot the rifle the sound sounded more blunt and slightly muffled the amount of the burst went from 4 or 3 to 5 or 4 you should do a comparison with the borderlands enhanced color mod seams to make the colors closer to bl2 like you and i wouldve liked to see glad the choice is there how can you release this without waiting for roland to get here hes just a little late i was hoping for a real master  does anyone know if the enhanced edition makes any improvments to online coop i havent played the original yet just 2 and tps but what i am noticing is subtle font changes specifically when looking over an enemy the font used now is a little easier to read im not impressed at all pointless remastered you say that there is no difference in the sound but there is a difference between dialogue quality and echo quality it seems like youre reviewing a game youve never played i was really hoping the game would look a little better this was barely a enhancement 60fps vs 15fps though i actually much prefer the original edition oh you have fxaa on what a waste of a video you said you would cover some changes to gameplay that streamline the experience but i didnt hear you do that sad day wtf it looks the same this is not the remaster i have been waiting for wowactualy every single shot is better before than after loli mean like everything is worst on the enhanced  for me this is to small changes for a 30 price tag wheres the shadows gone  pixelated fire that was just too funny lol man that music in fyrestone is so epic and adds so much to atmosphere of course you get bored from everything eventually but this soundtrack is iconic nonetheless this game looks like dogshit for 60 if i played the hell outta the originalis this still worth buy there seems to be more echo to the guns this could have been done in an update 525 most depressing gun ive ever saw in a video game  i think there was more than that i think any gameplay difference though the colors in the enhanced version seem more washedout and desaturated possibly related to changes in contrast i cant figure out a way to correct it like the critical indicators that appear above enemies are a pale pink rather than a bright red these changes were incredibly weak also the handsome collection looks damn near identical after a 15 gig download this halfassed effort was a ploy to add a bl3 ad on the games with a link to preorder and have more people look at it i was skeptical after years of nothing from gearbox and im a mega bl2 fan the last great thing they did was tiny tinas dlc its been bs ever since that said it got my blood going to see that bl3 trailer and i was ready to throw my cash at gearbox somehow theyve already made me a tentative skeptic again is this the gearbox that made tiny tinas assault on dragons keep or the shitheads who tried to sell us head hunter packs the only reason i never finished bd1 was the lack of a mini map now ill go back and finally finish it pc versions might not have seen much of a huge difference but when comparing the ps3 version to the ps4 pro version theres a huge difference itd be a must buy if a vr patch gets added later on dismemberment is there but blood textures around wound have been removed on bandits and midget bandits anyway not sure about the berserker guys that say hi little one time to die the same was done for the resident evil 5 remaster i thought it was just going to be a texture pack and was fine with that but it actually has tons of quality of life updates from borderlands 2 and new animations and some updated models did they update the menu ui for weapons what about movement aiming and mouse stuttering there was a lot of problems with that in the original version you had to modify the game files a lot to get a well running game they also added shift keys i think they rushed this out to pay for finishing the development on bl3 there is no much improvement tbh the firing sounds are identical overall but there might be a slight eq edit bringing lower bass frequencies louder the reloading sounds were clearly crispier and snappier possibly an eq adjustements again but on the middle and high frequencies borderlands is one of the best and one of my favorite series alongside fallout games borderlands line thickness enhanced edition pretty sure i got the same results by forcing aa on in my nvidia control panel this may just be me but after playing the original for thousands of hours the remastered versions audio seems to have more bass which was really lacking in the original the firing has way more depth to the sound on the bottom end which is more realistic the upper register stays the same because even in 2009 the sound quality would be pretty good today on the upper range of sounds so when it comes to the sound i noticed a very small subtle but very needed change it sounds to me like they added 3d surround sound and environmental effects like an echo from the canyon youre standing in while testing the gun sounds in the video and im pretty sure the original didnt have any of that i dont think they altered the sounds themselves in any way they just modified how the sound is impacted by your environment like homeworld remake they just added some sharpness and played with contrast as some ppl say modders do much better can we talk about the difference between the xbox versions lol i could barley play borderlands 1 on the 360 because it would give me a headache a good move easy money with no effort i think that you can do more with fxaa enb or some reshade for example subtle reshade not celshaded was going to pick up division 2 but instead i have a feeling im going to spend the next 46 weeks playing a 10 year old game i have 400 hours in already why would u use pc u can barely tell the difference u shoulda use console dumbass so that u can actually see the differences needed this video lmao youre using the pirated version labeling this video as borderlands 3 dislike for clickbaiting people love so much borderlands that they dont realize that this enhanced version is just a cash grab lol almost nothing has been improved or even slightly altered and only a few textures have been resized this is ridiculous the definition of a cash grab good to see they kept it true to the original feel 530 sounds like chopping a tree or something lol the second you said epic game stores you lost my money the shadows on the character selection screen on the bus looked much better before they should have kept them and just use the new highlight i think what is going on here is a shader settings swap and a few texture changes the moon looks like a freaking ugly jpg 430 i dont believe they could easily implement the nvidia physx since they would have to modify the engines structure which would lead to biggers costs and the fact the game is given for free if you own bl1 doesnt help them at all i have only played borderlands 2 and i loved it is borderlands 1 just as good as borderlands 2 or should i just wait for borderlands 3 it a celshading game they fixed the crashes between loading and gave me a fov slider plus improved loot so i am happy about this free update i mean unlike dark souls 1 remasterd i didnt have to buy this one eh ill buy it eventually i had the game on 360 but never beat it so im looking forward to finishing it i kinda figured that one of these vids might have been created soon almost the same lol theres a difference but its small and makes the game feel slightly updated but the minimap change makes up for all of it so in this direct comparison video you failed to compare the user interface changes the biggest one being the newly added minimap in borderlands goty enhanced same exact sounds i dont like how the new one looks overall its cleaner to the point it lessens the overall look certain new details are distracting in a bad way i have similar issues with re4 in current gen and tomb raider definitive edition sure some individual things look better but dont take into account how it was meant to look as a whole skipping this one for sure the sound on the enhanced version has an echo when guns are fired in canyons and theres a distinct sound when bullets hit the barrel not really worth 25 i wouldve payed 30 to play this game out of 70 field of view  so theres no difference haveing to open up the map to figure out where i was going was the most annoying part of bl1 im so glad they added a minimap kinda hoped youd also cover what changed like possible qol changes or fixes or ui changes etc etc the sound in the gotye as some small bass on it but no much is it me or did they change angels cutscenes in the original it was a live action clip but from what ive seen in the remaster its a bunch of dots what about the nvidia physx i think the old one has cool shaders while the new one has cool textures once i saw they added a minimap i couldnt care less about any other additions they made is it just me or does the game look better in the original the enhanced version makes everything much more sharp and less smooth even the gun salesmen lost his smiling charm since he looks angry in this one i could tell the sound delta physx cause nothing other than lag if they cant fix that they better dont include it kinda wanna buy it again after playing destiny and a couple other games a little to much even if the game is enhanced you cant escape claptraps 3fps what a nice scam i think this is great and if owned on pc from sites such as steam an etc its free the ai is defiantly harder the graphics well really there isnt a comparison to the original to me looks as good as bl2 2k give you a couple of nice weapons to start and 75 free gold keys if you havent played it i advise you toits hours of fun with either yourself or with friends also i forgot there is bazillions of new guns and loot is plentiful the best part is the remastered version is actually playable mouse have been fixed and a fov slider has been added i fell like this is so pointless in a cellshaded game but it definitely made a difference fewer jagged edges its fewer for individual things like people or objects and less for mass like water other than that great vid you only pay 30 for it can you honestly complain about that its probably the cheapest remaster if ever seen i see your criticism at the end that it could be much better done by todays standards but keep in mind its free d i own metro 2033 and metro last light and guess what the redesigned versions were sold and the old ones scrapped so no improvement for me unless i buy the game again for 50 less which is only fair considering that 80 people worked on this for over a year and the old games were unable to be patched since they had only 32bit support and an old engine well at least borderlands game of the year has noticeable changes cant say the same for handsome collection unfortunately just a cash grab field of view option i felt like there were a lot more differences when i first hopped inthen again maybe its because i havent played the game in years making it feel more drastic in changesglad they did a lot of touch ups and quality of life improvements like fov sliders seems you didnt mention it but selfshadowing especially on your firstperson weaponry appears to have been removed you can easily notice this in 310 in the original you see minor but highly detailed shadows around the gun while in the enhanced version its just a whole blob like it switches between being light and dark in brightness this is sad for all the enhanced version gives what i miss terribly are the selfshadows i wish they could add those back in a patch but its very very doubtful theyll care enough for it no mention of the fov is there a slider its nice on the sound that they have added a slight delay to the echo from gunshots sounds alot more realistix shouldve fired the elephant gun that makes a noise youd easily tell if it was improved or tampered with in any way i cant wait for you to make a video on ac 3 remastered  sound design is just the travelling sound effect like an echo but is very subtle this is sooo much bullshit in australia apparently hasnt come out yet theres apparently a bunch of talk about the game and that it hasnt come out yet it says youre playing borderlands 3 no change in the sound effects at least nothing i can notice nearly 100k my dude good luck  the sound from the new version seems to have a higher pitch with a more crisp tone to the guns i noticed the remaster pistol has a bit more presence to its sound they might have changed how the original sounds were mixed for those on pc it might not seem like all that but playing it on ps4 from ps3 its like night and day really happy with it i skipped out on prom to play this back in the day not that i had a date anyway  ironic how most remasters eg batman arkham darken their brightness so you dont see much of the new improvments but here its brighter the reason grass was removed from behind claptrap and rocks added to the side of him is to better frame him in the picture while hes giving you the intro speech the biggest difference is on console ps3 to ps4 or xbox pc you can get the hd mod etc so very little difference imo if you havent played the original then yeah go ahead and play the new one if you have then its not worth it sadly you still have to go through inis to disable mouse smoothing i guess they never can do a complete job claptrap lost some weight when he got famous smh other than the enhanced version being a bit brighter they both look the same because the original was so amazing anyway i didnt really need much apart from a few quality of life changes despite what might seem like is the case borderlands is not celshaded its just tweaked phong shading sound quality been improved a bit but not huge i cant tell alot of difference weapons have more umf to their sound quality you forgot one of the largest improvements goty enhanced edition gives you a mini map in the corner how did you miss that did they add anything new like guns perks cosmetics etc i fahkn hate remasters where they just throw some hd sparkles on it im on ps4 with 1080p and when i downloaded the updated graphics on the handsome collection the borderlands 2 game is noticeably better it feels smoother more clear and just plays nicely it feels like a new game and im loving going back to it after so long its all good and well but can we have 4 players split screen on pc this be good better reloading sounds in enhanced its nearly exactly the same mods do a better job than this should have showed the hdr and 4k enhancer on xbox one x i played on ps3 originally and ohh boy you can tell on that can you change fov from settings in the remastered version sound for the rifle seems to be matched to the fire pattern better and the explosion has more of a reverb which is nice i have no complaints really ive played the original game since 2009 and seeing it now enhanced with this new version brings smiles to my face 3 the game looks beautiful everything is basically the same from the original this new version brought some big improvements that i gladly appreciate overall i so highly recommend this game its still good today as it was when it first came out good job gearbox considering the price this has got to be the best remaster ever shity graphics its not cel shading educate yourself instead of parroting what youve heard others say did he really call corrosive poison motion blur sucks nice commentary and comparison its out already the light in the bis scene has been removed because this is a quick cashgrab made without any love details that made sense in the original are overlooked in the update look at shittraps eye at the beginning it looks brighter in the new version but the original was made in a way that created a fine illusion of his eye having z axis depth these remakes are just fucking awful and needs to die make new games you lying thiefing manipulative greedy lying sacks of human poop im sorry but i cant focus on the video because my head keeps on imagining kermit the frog i feel like a better comparison would be going from the xbox 360 or ps3 version to the new console version as that was where the game was limited the most not on pc ive been playing the remaster to death and im having so much fun its not borderlands 2 it came out years before it would kill the remaster by turning it into something its not they did a wonderful job with this and i cant understand why people want such change look at saints row turn 1 into 4 itd be crap kermit is that you we got this for free if you already had the original borderlands you probably got the goty enhanced version you can barely tell the difference the remaster just looks brighter closing my eyes and listening careful i felt that the original borderlands had better sound very slight differences that could have been just been my mind but the last demonstration seemed to have a noticeable amount of difference if you listen carefully and it sounded better in the original maybe someone can take the sound files from both and compare the two with an audio visualiser to see if there is any difference gotye sounds a bit better no chances with the sound assets but you can definitely hear the clarity and reverb changes 2009 gearbox all future assault rifles look the same and have side fed magazines looks like gearbox decided to milk us one more time before bl3 is officially released and please dont allow 2k to screw up bl3 by hiding loot contents behind microtransaction paywalls the only comparison not made here was that the originals multiplayer worked where the enhanced editions doesnt soulless cashgrab if im correct some characters have more voice lines know then before some dumbass decisions on the bus lighting and highlighting the character yellow that youre selecting xd cmon my laptop can run almost max settings for this game so should i be able to scoot by later on ah kermits commentary is decent am i the only one who hates every kind of blur including depth of field your name is using nickeh30 for attention im guessing they are using a lot of texture for this uhd handsome collection as they were created for borderlands 3 i feel like they shouldve added a bit more color to this game like in borderlands 2 cause like a problem i have with fallout 3 the constant grey coloring looks very bland and boring and is almost a huge turn off for me dont get me wrong i still like borderlands as a whole its just the lighting and colors that disappoint me when you did the sound comparison i think the game of the year edition has a bit more echo to it id say the sound in the remaster is a bit better they sound more deeper and actually feel like someone is shooting a gun the textures is actually what i remember from the original like when i played it i thought the remaster was the original from i guess a nistolga perspective i am enjoying the game also you forgot the ui cant wait for borderlands 3 the visual changes are more noticeable on the xbox one x from the 360 compared to the pc the rifle defiantly had a deeper bang in the remastered version on ps4 im just happy its here my ps3 died over 7 years ago and i havent been able to replace it quite yet still or rather find a trustworthy one to buy im very happy its on ps4 for the fov and the 60 fps alone and all the dlc i got the game of the year cheap on ps3 so 30 on ps4 i dont mind again honestly so this is just a cashgrab for fans exactly what i was expecting game has screen tearing not impressed at all in a game where you have cartoon like characters and everything looking like it came from a comic book a remaster would literally add nothing the better graphics here would be better used on something that is already trying to look real borderlands remastered offers so little for the money you spend is amazing how much it gets away with i honestly dont think that the differences shown here justify a purchase for the more expensive version of the game and some of these graphical changes are actually somewhat subjective and with the borderlands remastered edition missing some shadows and even some props that were actually meant to be in the game and yes if you go looking hard enough even some missing textures too in some places here and there while adding those same textures and re made textures to the environment its all kind of lackluster in the end is the same game and it really doesnt matter too much if 1 looks slightly more colorful then the other ffs is borderlands its a i think they should add fire effects to red barrels that can burn after it explodes like in bl2 i cant wait to play the zed dlc again tho great video the biggest changes are on console while both pc and console share the great quality of life improvements and those mentioned in the video console players enjoy a nine times graphical resolution bump a doubling of frame rate and hdr lighting when compared to the original it sounded like the enhanced version sounds seem more pronounced and the guns sounded a bit punchier what about stuff like gameplay changes or fov  though there are without a doubt some improvements this seems like a relatively lazy remaster almost as if they were tryin to grab some quick cash to finish out borderlands 3s development  all im going to say is 144hz support nuff said something wrong with your game i have shadows in character selection on one x the field of view slider is huge for me i play on a 219 monitor and the old version was completely unplayable so now im playing through for the first time the mini map is a nice touch as well who here thoughy he was comparing borderlands and borderlands 3 do the red faction guerilla remarster please do one on ac 3 the power of ms paint i think i wont be getting the remaster i dont see a reason to buy pretty much the same game the cel shading look does hold up do comparison of insurgency sandstorm and escape from tarkov old weak graphics regardless in my opinion good game weak graphics you forgot the minimap in the top right corner  i think the guns sound a little more punchy in the enhanced version would have been more impressed with a 360 vs xbone x comparison wow that is practically un noticeable wow so they basically did nothing and released a decadeold title with promise of it being a remaster to make more money and milk their franchise even more i think rage 2 will be better than borderlands 3 theres a definite difference in the sound goty has a sharper clearer tone to the gunshots and the reload sounds have been improved just looks the same i guess my only concern are stress tests for major fps drops like try finding a ton of enemies and spamming the health grenades lots of particles going on in there and also try using different elements with bricks punching i remember launch on x360 the game would chuuuug hard when brick used the corrosive punching and they had to patch it enhanced if apex legends had a story mode i really like the fyrestone music you put in there it fills me with a sad kind of nostalgia they look the exact same missed a few new textures not to mention ui system being overhauled to pretty much bl2 style prolly should check out the difference in guardian angel as well she looks completely different between the two versions of the game on the sound comparison the pistol muzzle flash seems different on the enhanced edition i love it the game runs smooth in 10240x4320 on my lg 5k2k cant wait to play this again theres a chest in the start after you get out the bust go left on top the shack is it still there  well inventory is really better for all people who have retail version on pcwithout steam no chance to have enhanced free looks better with the shadows playing gaming 4k at 144hz definitely worth the revisit one of my favourite games cant wait for the 3 game dlc is definitely worth playing if you havent played in the past halloween ones my favourite keep it up nick enhanced only slightly the game is 60fps and 4k i think or just 1080p its amazing the difference my theory is that this is actually bl1 remade in the bl2 engine since before they couldnt port the game do to issues with it i think the remaster was done well considering they wanted to keep newer players having the same experience that we did i would have liked to have seen some of the dlc integrated into the main game somehow also some mention of handsome jack in the claptrap revolution when hyperion has a strong presence overall i feel the game is more crisp in some areas and playing on console the 60fps feels nice you make great comparison videos in all your games i really like your content and have subscribed goty has less foliage i see to say truth theres very small deference because its cartoonish so i dont really care about the graphics in this game or even 3 i was just waiting for your version of comparison to arrive other youtubers do great aswell but you dive deep and explain each difference with details you rock nick these direct comparisons and your reviews have given me a deeper appreciation for lighting and graphics in my games once i was playing red dead redemption 2 and i said volumetric lighting when i noticed it lol its borderlands i loved it back then but i dont know if id want to play it again so basically no comparison bet new one gonna suck you should do assassins creed 3 vs assassins creed 3 remastered almost 100k congrats brother im so happy they released a better version of bl1 and for free i started playing it again today and really enjoying all the changes they made to the game 3 a welcome edition for new players nearly 100000 thousand subscribers good job nick been here since beginning of december keep making good videos i can never tell the difference on these videos haha thats whack how they didnt include this in the handsome jack collection i love the game but it looks like it was copy and paste and brighter with some improvements wow more rocks in a 4k tv it looks incredible especially the second games update surprised you couldnt really hear much of a difference in the sounds the enhanced versionwell the sounds are def enhanced lol theyre more complex less flat sounds so glad you did this the original game did not hold up today i tried playing it a few months ago and it was a rough time since youre comparing remasters would you mind comparing assassins creed 3 remastered with the original one can you make a video showing the differences between the bl2 4k uhd addon how about fov were all know bd1 is suffering from fov even i fps player can feels dizziness after playing this game only sominimal difference thanks for the vid i guess muzzle flash is different and the new sound has more weight to it you failed to compare all the options in the settings you forgot to mention angel angel in enhanced edition suuuuuucks so no real change still looks the same to me borderlands game of the no improvement edition i heard they changed the visuals for the angel who talks to you throughout the game as well kinda bummed to be honest because i like the original version using a real life model the new one is just pixelated data great vid looking forward to a bl vs bl2 next  dunno about anyone else but i fucking hate angels visual change doesnt match the game at all ive been watching your videos for a while now theyre really well made videos i enjoy all videos you make i dont understand why you only have 99k subs you deserve way more should i play this would be great to see borderlands 2 vs borderlands 3 when it comes out the only reason i want this remastered is the god damn fov slider playing the original borderland gave me severe headache because how tiny the fov is you didnt mention anything about the new heads and legendary weapons lol hard pass i hate what theyve done to the inventory menu in the game i preferred the list of items as opposed to giant oversized icons really annoying to use especially when purchasing new sdus do a direct comparison of half life 2 and half life 3 nothing too substantial but its free for everyone on steam who has borderlands already so i wont complain about this free upgrade you should do elder scrolls blades against elder scrolls skyrim those are just the graphical improvements they also improved the ui inventory system customization minimap and lootgolden chest great comparison though one step forward two steps back not bad but very underwhelming and definitely not something id spend money on definitely the weakest remastering in recent memory imagine a borderlands with red dead redemption 2 like graphics got to try to hard to see diif not worth it reinstall original and play it in 4k now its seems this remaster is give and take example better detail on characters but worse lighting effects hmmm not sure this was at all necessary playing this game on a 4k tv on my ps4 pro knocked my socks off it runs so smooth im loving it cant wait for borderlands 3 during the clap trap comparisoni see the texture quality has improved but the detail has been downgraded on claptrapthere isnt any dirt and is replaced with a clean texture its the same thing hello someone gift me this game im a broke college student i dont have time to work my steam id is yussufaesthetics or search by my steam profiles nickname which is love me aesthetically  do you watch neebs gaming  thanks was really hoping for this one not worth the money at all borderlands 1 is boring borderlands 2 is amazing tho damn we early hey nick can i get a heart the sounds are better however the lighting is bad i also noticed that they blur the midrange distance objects a bit more adding to the depth of field it is more pronounced during sidebyside the comparisons that include claptrap i dont know if this is throughout the game though the ps3 version its ok for me thank you for this video please do the same for borderlands 2 theres actually a good difference in texture with the hd texture pack trump card revolution 2019 cmgylogr ephesians 612 cmgylogr play the trump card they should make sniper have more zoom and make rocket launcher stronger any 1 on borderlands goty ps4 wanna help me with the underdome moxxi madness level 4 5 6 100 a level 300 in all if you have the time join me psn darkd4444 thanks for this nice video i have a lvl 22 hunter and i found a class mod 550 sniper that is for lvl 22 hunter the thing is that when i wear it my skill tree is not changing it is supposed to add several points to some skills i made sure i had already at least one point on these ones but its not working am i missing something thx a lot thanks for this nice video i have a lvl 22 hunter and i found a class mod 550 sniper that is for lvl 22 hunter the thing is that when i wear it my skill tree is not changing it is supposed to add several points to some skills i made sure i had already at least one point on these ones but its not working am i missing something thx a lot im so lucky sometimes i refuse to play certain games so when i do omg im i enjoying it sad thing is less people are playing it but damn for 10 bucks u cant go wrong never had a chance to play this game before looks pretty fun the biggest improvement for me as a console gamer are 60fps and fov slider kudos gearbox remember the first time i plugged a hdmi cable in to my ps3 total change of look that is when you realise how much a good resolution can matter and make a game more alive but borderlands had such good gameplay and played through it without hdmi on my ps3 it still was great so it will just spice it up with the better resolution will be fun to come back i could care less about 4k blah blah blach i want to know about game improvements the story is good until the last boss its the easiest boss ive ever beaten and i wasnt satisfied at all how do you get the enhanced borderlands gory version because i didnt get my 75 keys from the start for some reason can someone help me 1150 really bruh gor borderlands 1 ran like shit even tho i could play 2 and pre sequel i wonder if they fixed it on goty keep in mind i was in windows 10 looking forward to more videos like this thanks was playing the og randomly because of the bl3 news and found out later that this game was sitting in my library for free it runs way better than the original which seems to have issues on some newer hardware had huge fps drops in fyrestone but the enchanced version has run perfectly everywhere dude the whole magic of borderlands 1 was the wasteland it felt whole not fictitious the open world felt vast like a planet while bl2 1 location snow another one desert another one something else thats totally nonimmersive did they not fix the fov of all the things except online multiplayer is broken rn nope i was replaying bl1 when enhanced came out they did some balance changes the skag infested dump on the way to the mines was hell in oldlands in ee it was fairly forgiving good video your jokes are cringe though d hold the hell on someone please tell me how i get borderlands goty free if i have borderlands 1 i hate the amount of waypoints theres one on the map compass and a big one in your face at all times i wish we could remove that big one in the overworld is it worth buying the new edition or buying the original which is much cheaper my game fucking tanks when there is loot on the ground like what handsome collection is 15 bucks in the ps store i am commenting because i was told toand have nothing to say had no idea i had the goty until i checked my steam library loved borderlands 1 and im gonna play it again haha i bought the original goty on steam but it dont save the progress now with the enhanced edition i was positive because they could fix the issue but they didnt i am absolutely loving the enhanced goty edition of borderlands playing it for the first time in years and although i remember exactly what to do at what point ive forgotten just how great it is and why im such a fan boy  say no more purchased it stat d love it didnt care about the rehash of what the game was all about only the differences between the remastered vs the old my problems with this game is that it wont save cause i moved the my documents directory lost the 75 golden keys with out spending them on anything dosnt support 1280x1024 resolution like the old game did unless i force it anyone else got giant desync problems in multiplayer when youre not the host just played this for the first time tonight kind of mad i missed this when it came out a decade ago just started playing bl2 last year and was hooked didnt care for tps but this is really good reminds me of many of the old shooters im replaying them in story order 1 pre sequel and finishing with the absolute best one 2 i own all dlc for all 3 games so this should keep me busy for the better part of the year of wait i have before i can play borderlands 3 on steam story wise the first is pretty much the worst of the 3 but its still a great game at its core and im having an amazing time shooting my way down memory lane plus the enhanced version is just so much better the original port was shit on pc im glad i get to experience this game again but better looking without any screen tearing its buggy as fuck i love bl2 maybe i should try bl1 anyone else having trouble joining a friend for coop we cant get it working why is there a bl2 character on the video thumbnail yeah knowing hard copies are only available in america would have been nice and saved me a trip  on my steam i have borderlands goty and borderlands goty enhanced can someone explain the difference to me is the standard borderlands goty the game with the old graphics but but epic store lol did they remove mod weapon item there was class mod were you put on and steal weapon friend random ppl that mod was bad people hate it this or generation zero why is kreig in the thumbnail i prefer the original anyone know how to get it on xbox one i already own digital version of borderlands awesome review dantics but the jokes are cringy bro lol what did they do to angel i just started a new b2 run since i will not getting b3 for another year new sub and i havent played this before if i was to win the giveaway could i get borderlands lol i have yet to receive any shift keyswtf this is by far my favourite game in the series sure it doesnt have the same story or colour or the high amount of content that the others do but hot damn the shooting just feels fucking amazing without that retarded levels of gunsway in bl2 wait i have borderlands goty enchanced edition too but 2k games dint contact me or anything dantics has all 5 gamer girls who play borderlands just to note on pc the old game can be played in 1440p and 4k its just the textures were still crappy low res so although it was sharp in terms of edges and outlines the core textures were blurry and ugly i know because i installed borderlands 1 a week before the release and played on my 1440p hdr monitor and sure it was sharp as fuck the textures looked like blurry ass now the textures are 4k so the detail is extreme that pesky youtube algorithm just recommended me your video ya got one more subscriber  o just want a bigger fov hey guys just want to let everyone know that the ledge glitch and armory glitch still work btw the vault insider program is open to public on the borderlands website use this link to earn easy points and redeem them for rewards for things like golden keys httpsborderlandscomenusvipctsyg66c2hn borderlands is still not cell shaded no matter how many youtubers say it what i dont like is there is no sidestep etc really wanna get it and play all of them to the build of of borderlands 3 want that sweet sweet switch didnt know you were still making content dantics hey dude i would love to have a nintendo switch havent had a chance to get one yet i know its been out 2 years lol what has been enhanced  damn ive finished it on every console its come out on with every character and on two different ps3 accounts and pc and yeah im getting the new release rip bloodwing ill never forget you should of covered the multiplayer its broken as hell which is annoying as you would wanna play with friends how do you get borderlands game of the year edition for free so i own borderlands 1 and all the dlcs when when i go to borderlands game of the year edition its popping up with a price and its not allowing me to get it for free is it just me or does gunplay feel different more modern but less retronostalgic the way i liked the original borderlands i see spoiler free and want to just punch you in face its an old game it doesnt deserve the spoiler warning i love how you refer to those who hate cl4ptrp online  just a quick fix its 30 on pc as well i got all excited when you said 20 lol why cant i join people online or friends it just wouldnt connect shooting seems to feel a lot more satisfiying than in bl2 especially weapon sounds imo bl2 has some bad gunplay much is a loved bl1 it didnt age well for my taste not saying its not good but after playing so much bl2 and pre sequel i got used to a lot of qol things and i miss them what about the glitch on the armory was it patched out borderlands 1 was awesome but borderlands 2 made the franchise legendary handsome jack was an brilliant antagonist my only problem is the new inventory its not badjust different will the old save transfer to the enhanced edition nice video by the way will a hard disk copy of the game be released in stores i remember the borderlands final boss as one of the easiest video game bosses ever i literally stood in one spot and shot it until deadi couldnt even figure out what was meant to be a challenge so i sure hope they changed it up added new stuff and updated visuals on the single best bl title everyes please i took on the destoryer yesterday with an imported character that just got to baron flynt i even thought the boss fight felt easier the purple spikes didnt hit as much the pillar you can hide behind you can still do that and the rakk minions that spawn just make for easy second windskill abilities i cant even tell how many of them i have killed without noticing sledge to the safe house roid rage psycho boss battle exploit patced in borderlands goty enhanced edition you can no longer just snipe him through the fence posts i knew it would be less single player friendly i think i will get both borderlands games i want to get into the story always watched and saw other people play it but never really played it myself so i think ill be getting it borderlands 1 is probably the best game ive ever played and im still enjoying it to this day d um i guess i hope i win the console giveaway i didnt wanna kill handsome jack i thought he was such an amazing character i wanted more insults more stories more lines i love the presequel because it shows even more of him he has such depth he is honestly trying to be a good guy he just gets lost along the way you see in borderlands 2 he is doing what seems to be evil shit but it isnt yeah its cruel violent over the top but he is only returning the favor the people of pandora attacked helios for no reason and they killed so many innocent people they ruined jacks face they did worse honestly jack just wanted to destroy the bandits and you just happen to get in his way because for some reason bandits are worth saving he wants to bring civilization to the planet why is the physical version exclusive to only gamestop i mean really what happens when they go out of business followed the channels pumped to see some more of your content thanks for the vid man side note i hate how borderlands 2 removed the headshot explosion from kills nice to see bandit heads pop again it has not aged well at all you gotta a lotta balls to take about american politicians be pedos when the uk surpasses every county in pedo crimes in politics you ever jimmy saville the queens guards and the hundreds of raped dismembered children found dead and the the queen and tony blair covered it up for saville because he was knighted not to mention they were all pedos as well in short before you talk about another mans country men you need to know whats going on in your own back yard soyboy  generation of shit that lives doing remaster of shit i was just given pax codes for this and the pre sequel and ive never played it looking forward to checking out what its all about in 4k sad b3 is gonna be epic exclusive for 6 months curious what if you have borderlands installed and have high level characters can you transfer progression is anyone else getting really bad fps and enemy lag even with all video options turned down to lowest enemies movement animations are really choppy which makes it nearly unplayable anyone else getting the bug that after switch to say 165hz for example the settings automatically switch it back to 23hz detail from what i am reading the boss was made harder only in the enhanced edition but not in the game of the year edition although that detail is not important on steam as currently both are the same price or free and i think you automatically get both and all its dlcs whether you buy one or the other i bought it just before the drop im so glad reeeeally wish when you changed weapons the manufacturers name would show the rarity like it does in 2 where the fuck is the pc split screen yay more trash console port developers i wish this update was on 360 im enjoying it i got the 360 copy but went and bought the remastered i like the changes because 1 the didnt go away from the formula that made bl1 unique just subtle changes like map and graphics 2 for those who have 360 copy of bl1 your characters can be exported over to the remastered edition and 3 golden chests are added for those who like golden keys am i crazy or is it harder than i remember just bought and downloading now where to purchase  can we transfer a savegame from the original game to the remaster wait i have borderlands goty and borderlands goty enhanced i have some gameplay on goty so why do i have an enhanced version do i have my progress in the enhanced or what shieet unplayable for me too much lag  handsome jack collection is on sale for 15 until april 9th as well so its a great time to play through the series again on next gen consoles or if youve never played them anyone else having trouble enabling 1920x1080 144hz240 hz mine is locked at 50hz got unlimited framerate its actually on steam for 2999 usd at least it is when i look at it if i have to start over no thanx if its just a graphical update to my previous saves then ill check it out didnt play borderlands for the loot not here for validation but if you are saying thats why you played these games beforei believe you are lying you played them because they were fun games they were humorous i dont really care either way but all the hindsight perspectives are kinda lame 90 of the loot in borderlands was something you already have with a different or rearranged stat the other 10 are a symptom of a cool system that throws pieces of weapons together randomly making new weapons this isnt a bash at the game the games are fantastic this is an opinions basedreality check for the loot whiners how do i get the mini map on how do you get it on pc if you already have borderlands goty does it update at a certain time is it borderlands 2 or the pre sequal in the goty edution or both its a shame that its digital for now for some reason i dont got the borderlands remastered yet for free idk why pls help aww man i wish you had shown the new guns cant find any info on them yet p you cant go wrong with borderlands its flipping borderlands im gonna love playing through this remaster on my ps4 and getting nostalgic wet dreams of the original on my 360 looking forward to borderlands 3 i have the borderlands on xbox but i havent got the option to get the new one for free is it only free for pc damn its been 10 years since this game came out still no quest name above the objectives what time are we supposed to hear more about borderlands 3 today i cant get it anywhere in the uk not on xbox store or anywhere else online where can i upgrade my game or download enhanced edition i love this game its so charming and addictive my first character was roland and ive done playthroughs with all the others so its time for me to choose roland again whats going on with this game in uk still not on the ps store could you get it free if you already have it on xbox snoop dogg levels of high well played sir well played i am with borderlands from the very beginning it became ma faworite game franchise bl1 where it all began im glad they remastered it so your saying i will have it when it drops if i own borderlands 1 ive never owned a borderlands game ive always played it at friends houses so hearing a new one is coming out is super hype why isnt it in my steam store yet tt sweet vid bro i just brought and downloaded bl2  solid in depth review cant wait to play it bl2 was my first borderlands game absolutely loved it krieg ftw played the presequel thought it was meh but fun i got bl1 on steam but was never really able to play it well too used to controllersnow i can finally experience the origin of the firehawk in all her hd glory x3 bl1s loot system is best part so its the 3rd and i cant find the goty edition anywhere so stoked about this i unfortunately didnt get to play it when it first came out but a couple years later i got the awesome chance to fall in love you have alot of imaginary ladies good for you oh borderlands goty edition for the win where can i get one can you send me a copy thanks  i prefer the cast of borderlands 1 2 was ok tps i only cared about athena ah i remember my first time playing borderlands my brother brought when he was visiting though i only got to play through the first few missions before he went back to our father it wasnt until years later that i really got to play through the entire game i only found the title by watching a top 10 game list i have had bad memory for remembering game titles from back then but i did fall in love with the game and i got through it a few months before 2 came out so sad that this game has no release in the middle east does the game still have the problem where you aim at an enemy head and miss due to weird hit boxes also what time should i check steam tomorrow to download the new one anyone know exactly when it will be available on xbox one store for the digital download i keep checking the store from my xbox but still cant find it anywhere already played through thjc ill be spending 30 on this simply because i want bl in my life so potato friend i wanna get the remastered but i want hear the best selling points and the differences of it and 2 sides the bazillion guns and i played the latter multiple times and never touched 1 before does the update include an autorun feature i have been messing around with the game and have to continuously press the w key especially on those long runs is killing me other than that i am liking the game never played it when it came out was too focused on the mass effect games and wow dantics is right about the beginning being slow glad to hear it picks up however i love how they did the opening sequence aint no rest for the wicked is the perfect song for it craig was one of my favorite characters to play as borderlands games are very fire best game as handsome jack would say looter shooters before loot boxes were awesome fingers crossed that borderlands 3 will not have the loot without the boxes i have it already so i get it for free and will play through everything including 2 and pre sequel again can you confirm if its an update or a separate game on steam ahhhh goood times w this classic 2 was better but this has loads of fun memorable stuff first comment excited about borderlands weve heard your feedback and have added a spoiler warning to the description of this review and we apologize to anyone who felt spoiled by footage of the final boss given the age of borderlands and the widely known criticism of this particular fight it didnt occur to us that people interested in this series might not have seen it but with new gamers joining our ranks every day a warning certainly makes sense and is something well keep in mind when reviewing remasters going forward why the fuk you spoil can someone please explain the inventory i dropped a weopon and tried to pick it bakc up but it said there was no more room can someone please explain this clown seriously just spoiled the final boss  i hate how ign puts in spoiler gameplay there used to be a time when ign did a pros n cons list too at last of the whole verdict you didnt mention the improvment of tthe fov from 60 and now up to 120 hadnt played it in years and i missed out on 2 of the dlc campaigns so it was fun to go back in play through twice and get my siren up to cap now to play through bl2 and then tps and to wrap up with tales  no reason to return are you serious there are 4 characters thanks for ruining the final boss for me is this first part whats the differents from this and the handsome collection where the hell is the switch port 053 actually borderlands 20 october 2009 borderlands goty 12 october 2010 borderlands goty enhanced 3 april 2019 i just have a question is this the first borderlands ever i heard theirs three in total just not entirely sure ive played and beat borderlands 2 and prequel hey at least i know the end boss isnt any fun to play and will die if i just shoot him in the eye sigh yey thanks for the spoilers guys now i feel really motivated to play this game for the first time smh having an easy final boss is a welcome improvement ive experienced everything in borderlands 2 everything but never the 1st one im bout 6 hours in and its absolutely amazing so goooodddfdd as far as im concerned there is only one raid boss called crawmerax in this game i think ign really is retatded bro youd think one of the biggest networks would know not to spoil the final boss can ign make a decent review on a video game asking for a friend do you get also the original i downloaded the game off psn and beat the story now i cant find the dlc content its not on the main menu its not in my library anybody know how i can access it why would you play with a controller to review the pc version okay but is it worth 45 only a 3 minute review for a game and you still managed to spoil the game honestly thats pretty impressive wtf you just spoiled the final boss for me smh dude u just spoiled the whole friggin game if i buy this for xbox one can i play with others that have the original bl2 game minus the dlc content you dont have to literally pick each item up just hold the button down whichever system youre on played the second game and the presequel never played the first one though thanks for spoiling that last boss ign what a trash gaming site smh i have been loving this game on xbox when people say they dont make em the way they used to i understand it now i played about 70 of this game twice before on 360 and pc back in the day this update with the framerate 4k brightness and minimap addition i think are well worth it there is something about this one maybe its the commitment to the location being dangerous barren and daunting that distinguishes it from even borderlands 2 in my opinion i hope borderlands 3 has some locations that give me that feeling of being alone in a wasteland again the term professional and the word gamer never mesh at ign idc if it is the same game and that i platinum trophied on ps3 i am getting this game and doing it all over again this is still my fave borderlanda and ive played hundreds of hours in borderlands 1 2 and the presequel no switch port is a missed oppurtunity anyone else unable to matchmake a game on ps4 i just want to play some co op  has anyone run into an issue on pc where looking over a crate full of gunsammo the ui for it pops up but when moving left and right to look through the fps dips i posted this question on steam in the discussion board but only got one answer and that is the ui is currently 30fps while the resr of the game is 60fps not sure is that hold up but thought id ask and see if anyone knows what the issue may be and if they too are going through it the first time this happened to me was when i made a new game and the first box you get at the end of the gate area after claptrap opens it how tf does it not have the same rating as its original release as old as the game is were the final boss spoilers really necessary i guarantee 910 people dont read descriptions before watching a video angry joe was getting pretty bad for that too showing end game without spoiler warnings thanks for spoiling the final boss can i not buy this on psn you woke the wrong dog this game will flop so its still the same gameplay as the first pass actually its hard to spoil the final boss i get why people dont want to show the final boss but the game is like 10 years old and gearbox said they would make improvements to the ending but it seems like they didnt it needed to be in the review spoils the final boss review 80 and calls roland soldier no wonder ign gets so much hate ign always goes 1 step forward and 50 steps back with everything they do smh i am absolutely loving the enhanced goty edition of borderlands playing it for the first time in years and although i remember exactly what to do at what point ive forgotten just how great it is and why im such a fan boy  the auto pickup is the best thing they have added it was so disorienting on ps3 having to look down constantly to pick up health and ammo gave me headaches yet i maxed out lilith and mordicai i will be playing it until borderlands 3 come out loving every second of it just like last time downloading atm final boss wtf is this free cause it should be spoiler warning this video shows u the last boss maaaaaan all these years later and the last 2 months gaming all ive played in bl 1 n 2 why mine did not update it says i have borderlands goty but i have no minimap and nothing change  thanks for saving me 30 with that spoiler there 810 too much land not enough borders i wish they would of made it so u could at least crawl while in fight for ur life wtf its roland not soldier and spoiling the boss fight is like rule one to a game review also an 8 really is this on ps4 most important did they added the slot machines and do they added abbility to reset playtrough  pretty happy this came out was going to get handsome jack collection to pop my borderlands cherry but the fact that borderlands existed and i still have a working ps3 though i havent used it in years was giving me anxiety now i can play things in order just one of those series i never got in to and tired hearing how great it is the frame rate is still quite bad with alpha effects on screen especially the fire 30fps drops or more i doubt it will be patched save your money a boss fight is easy if you avoid its attacks and shoot its weak spot this shocks me who puts a final boss in a review too much borders not enough lands frame rate is worse for me used to get 100fps now i get like 60 to 70s this coming from the jackasses that wanted border royal humm never played the original i might give it a wait a minute is that the final boss well then that just scraped it for me before i even tried it best thing they said was the 4 player couch co op i dont even care if the fram rate has reduce transfer bl1 ps3 saves to ps4 how how video tutorial way to go spoiling the last boss when i just thought of buying this game immersion ruined thanks ign this port has more screen tears than the original no reason to return to the first adventure on pandora lmao dont install another borderlands game ever again please borderlands isnt a one and done game ign wheres the battle royale leave it to ign to do mediocre reviews on a great game i would play this game over and over and over and over oh an i have go back and try playing the original game on the xbox 360 and then tell me the 4k update doesnt make a difference yeah havent ever seen that boss now i have kinda disappointed i wanted to see it for meself i cant join anyones game or matchmake it is very frustrating 010 doesnt have a battle royale mode so literally zero replay value seeing solider with a handle bar moustache its roland you really gave fortnite a better review than borderlands how ive missed this game im not watching and videos just enjoying the play through as soon as i heard about this remaster i picked it up immediately playing borderlands on the ps3 with busted controllers was not fun for me and my girlfriend nice spoil on the final boss fuckheads you got to review a great game and did a shitty job congratulations id probably get it if it was on the switch great idea to put a spoiler warning in the video description that hardly anyone is going to read put the word spoiler in the title of the video ffs wonderful i gonna try it shouldnt a remaster get a better score than the original since you knowits an enhanced package with dlcs included hit or miss i guess they never miss yeah you guys need to work on not spoiling it for new people the real villain is the guy trying to direct hit the bruiser with a rocket what dic head ruins the final boss like that you are a bum boy mate level 35 at the end boss lmaooooo did you guys even touched sidemissions or are you just in for that early review cash 80 80 jesus ign youre disgusting also did nobody notice that theres now auto ammo pickup in the game its a huge change playing this in 4k with wider fov sick and tired of all these gruffy white male protagonists in this game we dont wanna hear your opinion about borderlands when you think borderlands is best being battle royale anyone know if you are able to reset campaign progress in tvhm like you could in bl2 if you have the normal version of the ps3 you can own the goty edition for free also only 30 lets be real tho who hasnt seen the destroyer yet why is ign worse than ea why waste money on this ridiculous would it be better to get borderlands goty edition or the handsome collection if given the choice did you really complain about the final boss being easy on normal mode its confirmed guys ign is full of video game reviewers that dont actually play video games more fun and content in this remake than destiny 1 and 2 and i have played destiny since its beta 80 not enough border too much land amazing but one thing online isnt working  ign is similar to gamestop they dont understand gamers why did ign buy shares in a vasectomy clinic because they kept dropping the ball since it was one of the things mentioned specifically by the devs to be changed i think it was important to share things about the final boss to previous players a spoiler warning wouldve been nice but i dont think the final boss was really special enough to begin with not a really a storydriven game borderlands is a great multiplayer lootershooter and thats what its meant to be just having fun with some friends taking on tough enemies ign blows the game review by showing the final boss fight without spoilers in the title really an a thing to do for anyone who never played the game thumbs down inventory ui was much better in the old bl1 tho bl2 ui was garbage in comparison it literally looks the exact same i dont think yall would get mad if they remade the first mario game and showed bowser in the review but it whatev borderlands 1 remastered and borderlands 3 making sure we have games for the holidays ok ign wtf really the score is suddenly lower now you also didnt talk about any of the dlcs besides a mention was sorta hoping previous owners got a discount or got it for free for consoles and youre level 35 going angst a level 33 no wonder he was easer  already max lvld and geared most characters cant wait to do that again they cant spoil a game that came out ten years ago  am i the only one having issues connecting to host if you own the original game do you have to buy the game of the year edition little reason to return huh hey crybabies roland dies in bl2 im so sad they couldnt let a borderland fan review this game guys remember when they review gta 5 it was perfect maybe cause greg review it lol polish long vey funnyand 4 players split screen8lame thanks for the final boss spoiler by the way this review was worthless if they cant tell the difference thats sad finally having a mini map and better inventory system is so much better we got new weapons to farm for too 010 not a battle royale borderlands 2 was one of my favorite games perhaps 219 so he didnt even play through the 2nd play through and didnt do the dlc as well why do they keep letting him do reviews he botched the re2 remake review and now this one ign is a joke no physical release its just digital only well i hope its not permanent no physical release its just digital only well i hope its not permanent wow only watching this to see if it is worth buying as i only played borderlands2 and you spoiled it already thanks wow  the textures are nightandday more detailed and crisper than the original thats worth it for me oh and end scopes not being pixelated anymore is a massive improvement too lol he did those who have yet to play borderlands a favour by spoiling the boss this way they wont suffer the same disappointment that we suffered when we played borderlands for the first time all those years ago if i own the hansome collection on xbox one does it just get upgraded no aliens colonial marines goty edition then pretty cool remaster for those who havent play it yet now is your chance im satisfied with my xbox 360 original i got the free upgrade on pc and its better than the original and has an fov slider which makes it better when playing it on my ultrawide monitor ign in 2009 gave borderlands a 88 but the remastered version a 8 now  he based this whole review on the end boss having a lot of issues on pc playing co op with friends level 15 enemies almost never drop items their level level 4 items yes seriously and when they do they do less damage than the level 4 items that drop also higher level missions have this issue level 12 mission for making a sniper dropped a garbage level 5 sniper super frustrating as i dont remember borderlands 1 being like that originally should i buy the original backwards compatible on xbox or should i buy the goty on ps4 if i were a betting man id say the first play through boss is purposefully a wash if youre a fan you know the first play through is basically a lets get this done kinda affair especially if youve played it already little reason to return ummm what if you love a game then you love a game and there is never little reason to return to a classic that will bring back nostalgic moments and satisfy you come on ign youre supposed to be a gaming company and should know that more than anyone wait this is new lol they just released the handsome jack collection and now they want you to buy just the original game remastered yeah no this is milking a product to the point of insulting ones intelligence yall ever eat deep fried african children as a tasty snack f how do you import characters from the ps3 to ps4 version did they even mention you get all the dlc too that alone for 30 bucks is a 1010 810 too many borderlands not enough 3 i havent finished the game still everybody n ign talks the same same voice weird 8 out of 10 lol its an easy 95 out of 10 same rating i gave it back when i played it on the ps3 still amazing on the one x ign would probably gave it 10 out of 10 if it had battle royal in it original review 88 remastered review 80 what my dude tell me ign didnt put the last boss in lmao every gamer knows to speak nothing of the final parts of any game thats gamer 101 i have never played borderlands and i was planning to play it but this dumbass just ruined the ending i know this game is old but i didnt know the story thanks ign for the spoiler does anyone know if there are still modded weapons you are the worst reviewer in the world damn spoiler i hate you did they skip the dlc portions of this review just to even check performance but damn no way this was efficiently reviewed all the way through in 24 hrs not enough battle royale 210 i played this game on ps3 platinumed it then i got a new account i created it on ps4 now i can replay it and platinum it psn davidnation69 oh i give this game a 8 out of 10 it was going be a 6 but they fixed the map so yeah i dont normally care what score is given to a game but if any game deserves a solid 98 its this game ign give the worst reviews way to spoil the ending for those who havent played it gamestop exclusive only no place else has it unless your going with steam gamestop in eureka only got 1 for each system just got rid of my powerup rewards card 054 didnt need a refresh are you joking it looks 100x better wtf please put the editor who approved of this warningfree spoiler video into a timeout let them stand in the corner and feel the shame of their failure is the game engine speed tied to the frame rate with this of course you can beat the last boss in less than a minute knowing the guys at ign they probably beat the game at the easiest setting destroyer a bullet sponge i have to disagree just aim at the spots not in the general direction 5 minutes and bam hes gone i mean its a final boss after all is anyone having issues connecting with friends on ps4 hey guys i have the game already from where i can find the free upgrade to download it please answer to me  is this still vertical splitscreen or did they get smart and make it horizontal is it comes with the dlcs is it comes with the dlcs whoa what character just got tentacles thru her wtf pssshhh and people still replay borderlands 2 to this day crawmerax was changed ya know the raid boss not the base game final boss he really called roland soldier hdr is going to be the best feature of the remaster and of course its not on pc is borderlands remastered goty edtion dlc or is coming later i am so confused 3 great thanks for showing us the final boss  is this only digital download i had the game already on pc but it doesnt updated can somebody help me when is the release of the remaster for ps4 can only hope they change the final boss then again to make it less of a joke when it is not so bad apparently why is this game not on the switch 610 not enough border how do you get this on ps4 the only way i can see is on ps now haha cant trust ign boss isnt better the destroyer isnt the proper boss the proper boss is in dlc general knoxx what is it with these piss poor employees at ign ill return just to platinum it again stop complaining about the lost boss theres so much better dlc bosses in the game whats going on with this game in uk still not on the ps store i bought fallout 4 on spring sale and it was my first fallout actually first bethesda game i really dont know how to play this game lack of tutorial and really boring gameplay maybe you guys know how to enjoy this game is it added already i thought it was sometime today the video was made yesterday 750 goty edition on gamesplanet and amazon pcdd for anyone who doesnt have it ultra hd update april 3rd httpswwwamazoncom2kgamesborderlandsgamedownloaddpb004m5hv5g httpsusgamesplanetcomgameborderlandsgameoftheyeareditionsteamkey12906 i hate this game already as they did not even took the effort and added a battle royale mode i mean that is a no brainer like duh why cant i find the game on xbox its supposed to be out by now spoiler alert the final boss in mario bro is bowser does anyone know why it not on the ps store yet if only this game was apart of the handsome collection i give this remastered version a 610 its a 10 year old game and the boss is well known you gonna get bent out of shape about darth vaders identity too for the few people that havent seen star wars its a game purely about gameplay we might as well not talk about anything for the small handful of people that have never seen or played something an actual spoiler would be spoiling character deaths in the other games or their stories you all realize this is a review about a rerelease thats toting about how they reworked the final boss and you didnt expect that to be covered in the review leave the internet please 055 i mean yeah theres clearly no difference this is not that boss fight it is the one in the general knoxx dlc which is another story just saying the original didnt have split screen how did he get to final boss in 1 day thought it was a long game not baby game do you guys ever review your own reviews why would you spoil the final boss nobody ign spoils ending cuz no battle royale g fuckin g i stayed up til midnight to buy but its still not on the store and its now 5am so what time is this released anyone know what time on april 3rd this is released its now 3am in the uk and it still hasnt dropped  why couldnt they release this and the handsome collection digitally on the switch  i have the borderlands goty edition already do i need to buy this one too 010 no battle roywle one thing ign didnt get to expirience is online coop after gamespy shut down gearbox patched the original to work with steams servers but it was a little unstable and there was massive amounts of delay on inputs for the nonhost players i hope goty edition fixes this issue making goty worth every penny bl1 is 20 as of right now so if you want to save 10 buy bl1 right now with out the dlcs you will get the free upgrade id say a jump from 720p 30fps to 1080p 60fps on consoles is a big enough leap plus the heads new weapons and inclusion of a minimap are very welcome changes how is putting a spoiler notice in the video itself not common sense at this point literally the final boss is the very famous for being bad in the gaming community literally the worst boss and very underwhelming did most of you just get into gaming this reaction surprised the hell out me wow havent beat the game before now i know what the final boss looks like and hes an easy take down  my question is can you carry over your save game from the old borderlands one to the game of the year the cons ign there are no battle royale in this game how u play this on xbox ok not gonna lie yall wrong for spoiling the final boss for newcomers what do you mean little reason to return you know theres 4 characters to master right even with all the dlc added in a single run through the game isnt enough to fully level up any one of them theres bosses thatll just down you instantly no matter how badass you think you are in the game he called roland soldier come on man that is the class but the character has a name why is it that seemingly all of games media doesnt care about this franchise just makes me sad casue i like hearing peoples thoughts on the new stuff ill probably be moving away from getting any info from ign in the future  borderlands game of the year might be a remastered game but it sure has hell got a lot more content in the game world for practically just 2 games in one is way better then eas awful garbage looter shooter game anthem cartoon style really quick question since they added the golden chest did they remove the chance of getting decent weapons out of the vending machines are we going to be limited to using the golden chest to get decent gear like in bl2 i cant find the game in xbox store wtf 80 not codlands ign this game really makes you feel like a borderlands does anyone know if it supports a cross save feature from the ps3 version why do remasters always get lower scores lol why is everyone surprised ign is a joke lol soldier his name his roland rest his soul uwu this game is over 10 years old and people are complaining about the final boss smh hi is this game on the edison no reason to play 80 i was surprised they didnt announce switch versions of the borderlands games i dont currently have a switch but would definitely pick up the borderlands games on it if they were there totally getting borderlands remastered goty edtion on steam tommorow maybe if it is on sale and if not i will wait 3 dont listen about some people calling it exclusive which is totally not and it is for all pc and console except the switch should i buy the game now that its cheap on steam ill pass on this you gets this remastered when you buy the handsome collection how many remastered versions are there when gearbox said the final boss would be harder i actually think they were referring to the final final boss in the dlc crawmerax the comment section wo how are you just going to show the final boss guys stop this is a 10 year old video game if its been a decade there cant be spoilers for it everyone has had more than enough time to see it and then some im sorry but this wont be game of the year imo everyones bitching him out for calling roland soldier but im just sitting here with 4000 hours in the borderlands series still calling gaige mechromancer krieg psycho axton commando and mordecai hunter and krieg and mordi are my second most played characters in their respective games first being both sirens you never show the boss ever that common sense enable hate comments of how he called roland as soldier also enables those who say well its not technically wrong because its his class name no dip sherlocks you guys dont call zer0 as assassin orguy whose a ninja do you why cant they do reviews of the game with people who actually play it or whose a fan of it its not that damn hard 80too much border not enough lands what is the final boss lol havent played the game yet ign 310 not a battle royale they shouldve gave roland a crimson lance helmet underrated ign again finished the game like 10times not worth my money typical ign  pretty freaking pissed that you guys showed the final boss to the game smh thats like a giant no no i was going to pick up the game cause i never completed it back on ps3 now i know the ending will just be cake walk and completely anti climatic and ill be looking for who ever got stabbed in that scene now could have at least put up a spoiler warning slightly brighter lol ign useless as always actually if you compare the last gen consoles to the new remaster its more than slight did they remove the mouse acceleration like with bl2 yup thats borderlands alright time to revisit this game after a decade  its a win win for people who havent played the game the game is great and these additions and remaster make it worth picking up for people who have played it the changes are well enough to merit another play through as its a free upgrade for you anyway remastered got an 80 youre welcome sooooi was planning on getting this but this mofo shown the final boss i honestly think borderlands wouldve sold so well on switch it seems like with the cell shaded look it could run well and there arent that many fps on switch missed opportunity is it out on xbox 216 are we just gonna ignore the fact he used a spin gun ign you dont rate a game based on the final boss final boss fight in the review you dont understand your own field of work huh lmao jesus whose idea was it to show the final boss in the review you already said people who played it wouldnt need to come back so you had to assume that newcomers would be playing this you guys are jerks guess i dont need to play this after all why review an old game how much is it i cant see it in the ps store i just cant go back to bl1 after bl2 although some of the dlc for bl1 is freaking awesome plays 14 of the game decides the boss on the easiest difficulty is easy and wants to go ahead and give a review for views how you get 20 hours its not like u got sponserd it doesnt come out til tomorrow so how i geuss because your a review channel and your better than us right why havent you guys yet not made vane ps4 reviews did they even mention the dlc ive never played borderlands should i start with the handsome collection in order to get the 75 gold coins provided in the remaster this has to be one of the worst reviews on borderlands series i have seen but hey thanks for end spoiler for people just coming to borderlands 1 so is borderlands 3 going to be epic store exclusive or not wish this was on switch 810 to much land not enough bad when will this be on xbox store pre download wouldve been nice how does the review go down from the original one makes absolutely no sensethis is why ign is straight garbage cant wait to play this game for the first tim oh thats the final boss then thanks ign guess its ign first because this review is poor its like you rushed your term paper if i was to grade you you get a g an 8 really wat a joke ign is the worst to review games this is an easy 9 considering all the improvements and at only 30 wow ign then you go and show the final boss not professional at all what a shame did you guys dock a point because it doesnt have battle royale so they released this game as a part of a collection along with 2 and the presequel but now theyre rereleasing the remaster again but just for the first one man we really werent meant to last this long huh edit nvm turns out borderlands 1 was for whatever reason exempt from the handsome collection seriously though why tf did they not include it to begin with another reason to call ign fools spoiler alert 200 randy was talking about crawmerax i just hope the ledge is still there because theres a whole line of diologe in bl2 about it  i dont know why i even bother watching these ign reviews i have to stop doesnt have hd on pc that we reviewed on 80 anybody know if the armory glitch still works split screen no 4 player split screen 810 too much border not enough lands doesnt matter how old a game is you dont spoil the last boss lmao can this version of split screen have the horizontal and vertical views changed nice video but next time please warn your viewers about spoilers before hand because why if someone is watching and it just getting into the series you just spoil for them so first time players this is a warning this video contain spoilers the most important question have they fixed that quest bug at the beginning where when the quest is in your log you cant get rid of it needed willow tree to edit the save on ps3 days 80 not enough border too much land warning to people who havent played yet this guy spoils the final boss its the journey not the destination did ya play the entire game just to beat the boss and leave exactly mr battle royale did he just spoil the final boss  firestorm review this first game was waaaay better than the sequels i finished it numerous times but the sequels i couldnt finish even one time too much boring calling roland soldier criticizing the remaster for being the same game as the original wtf did you expect and giving it a rating lower than most to all call of dutys this is why everyone hates ign and you guys are just memes at this point im super confused i own the game already on xbox 360 of course i play it on xbox one do i need to buy it again or is it going to be a free update steven obviously isnt a borderlands fan being a fan these improvements and quality of life is a game changer skins keys and map are enough reasons to replay until borderlands 3 comes out is there an fov slider on console thats my main concern spoiler warning for anyone just jumping in to the series the final boss is shown in this video just a heads up very funny claptrap humor is that sarcasm cool i never played the first game loved the second one though im just going to say that the dlc in the first borderlands is what made the game for me i wonder if they made the sprinting better in the remastered for the pc pc borderlands 3 announcement will be epic no release in europe on consoles just played it on nvidia shield and its awesome now playing 2 on the ps4 pro then the presequel bring me the switch version is bl1 or bl2 better i never played either why not put it on switch are we now able to adjust the fov on pc that is literally all i want call of duty 910 borderlands 80 wow youre better off getting the handsome jack collection cause you get all 3 borderlands games thanks for spoiling the final boss for those of us who never got the chance to play ign thanks for the inspiration i will meet you soon httpsyoutubejumagkncil8 one of the only titles that do the shooter looters right what year is it so borderlands goty would be great place for those new to the franchise or whove never played borderlands before to give it a go for the first time these people would probably want to check out a review to see how it is and then right here you show off the final boss and how to beat it wow i didnt know that it was 60fps im definitely buying it thanks for showing the final boss  to much lands not enough of the border he called roland soldier lol real big fan we have here very odd they didnt put this on switch feels like it would have done really well on the console his name is rolland you turd i started the game a week ago i left it to wait for the remaster so thanks for showing the final boss  claptrap is annoying tbh so whoever captured footage for this played on pc with a controller this is why you are a joke i learned to play with keyboard and mouse when i was like 6 years old in the 90s i just want it on the switch it would be perfect on the switch lmao right now without the patch borderlands looks blurry on my xbox one x on my 4k flat so this patch is much needed sometimes i dont understand journalists borderlands needs this patch wow like i get the final boss is not that big for this game cause its a mess but wow you really just showed it off  man its been 10 years already this or the vr version for a new player did you morons really just show the final boss i get that the game has been out and plenty of us finished it years ago but have a little common sense does this remastered version have offline lan play like in the original version i gotta pirate this arrrrrrrrrrrre mate will it be a digital or a physical release on consoles never played the first looking forward to getting this watching an ign review is like slitting your wrists with dull razors did he just call roland soldier  20 on steam rn free upgrade tomorrow to goty just sayin i got fed up with this game since i was too lazy to power up my character is it more in coop whats with the blurry background it hurts my eyes watch out guys theres an octane in the thumbnail i have the new game modes of the year on my channel borderlands 1 have the best menu design of the whole borderlands series light and without any clutter higher texture resolution and anything more wow they look exactly the same this is completely worth 10 extra might as well buy chanka on siege i dont see big difference between original and remastered versions that is not like aww i want to pass through that game third time i had the opportunity to see it and its a scam lan coop option was removed no lan coop no buy if you are using steam you have to install the borderlands goty enhanced game that is now in your library it doesnt replace your original game listing in your library so make sure you dont install the wrong version by mistake its really just a big patch for the original a good patch i love the original but it would have been dope if they added new dlc or some updated music sounds postfx or weapon models or something i played the crap out of the original before bl2 came out i feel like ive played it so much that the remastered version wont offer enough for me to buy it looking foward to bl3 though i cant see the differences o yeah good luck trying to use willow tree were fucked willow tree wont read the goty enhanced saves since i already had the original version i received the goty enhanced one for free on steam and decided to check it a week ago like how this video shows the actual differences are minimal but some meaningful points arent shown here visible minimap on screen automatic pickup of money and ammo the redesign of buysell machines menus the new hats you can now add to your characters the golden chest at fyrestone and the inclusion of the shift keys system from bl2tps other than these this remaster is pretty much the original version at maximum graphics with sharper textures higher resolutions and a bigger fov like its shown in this video and now it requires a pretty beefy machine to run smooth ill definitely recommend the goty enhanced edition to newcomers to the series or people who played bl2 and tps but never touched bl1 but for veterans i think the only good thing was receiving the dlcs for free not a huge improvement but does warrant an enhanced badge does certainly feel closer to bl2 though with minor tweaks which is nice is it worth it what a joke first they do an exclusive with epic and then they brighten up the original and call it a remaster first ac 3 and now this im so done supporting aaa developers and before you act all butt hurt i know there isnt too much you can do with the borderlands graphics but still add more foliage add more particle effects better sounds better lighting this its a pisstake and i dont think ill even be buying bl 3 when it releases on steam what the hell have you done gamers by buying a load of cash grab games and cod the 14th gaming is pretty much in ruins now days im ashamed to call myself one im ashamed that ive spent thousands of pounds on gaming equipment luckily i need the kit for music production and photography but still god damn shame cant wait for the second gaming crash it will kill off all the parasitic devs so the original didnt have a 4k option damn i dont remember the graphics looking that washed out cool that the enhanced version was free i dont see much difference so a bit brighter i like how the graphics are so neutral they cant even be improved remaster brightness so they just turned up the brightness looks miles cleaner and has a minimap who else is pissed that borderlands 3 is in epic exclusive for me the main selling point is increased fps and being able to change your fov in the game also some of the technical changes are nice like not being asked are you sure after buying every single piece of ammo or ammo and money being collected automatically it generally is a better experience for me jesus adding better field of view and turning up the brightness isnt remastering something they could have simply updated this to the main game for old gen so they increased the brightness of the floor the only differences that i could spot was change of white balance on camera some new and better textures no reflections in guns in the new version less fog in the depth of field wow the differences are so minimal i had to really try to see which was better anyway both need a reshade so the enhanced version is basically just the original but on ultra settings better than ac3 remaster no hesitation this should be entitled 30 fps into 60 fps not a remaster ui is not scalable in remaster correct i checked and didnt see it i survived some 15 playthrough without it so its fine if not there are not many differences between the textures v that is normal if we see that the videogame is based on cartoontextures v xdxd the thing is they didnt have to make a enhance version and also give ultra hd packs for bl2 and tps especially when bl3 is around the corner coming in september they are giving all of us one hell of a treat images look slightly sharper here not worth repurchasing in my opinion omg waited almost 5 years for borderlands 3 and now borderlands 1 remastered nearly the same improvement could be done just increasing the vibrancy contrast only major improvements that are graphics are fov options some model textures i had no ideia that this was released for pc i was just looking around my steam library an it was there maybe because i have the original i am absolutely loving the enhanced goty edition of borderlands playing it for the first time in years and although i remember exactly what to do at what point ive forgotten just how great it is and why im such a fan boy  can you make a handsome vs got enhanced mehh like more original u same fucking shit but with more lighting is there any point to having goty and goty enhanced in your steam games library or can i just delete goty when enhanced is finished installing a good way to test my rx470 i guess got this on steam yesterdayalong with every other borderlands game and dlc 4k now is how i saw the original game back in the day cant wait to see how crawmerax looks  i do better remake with reshade lol exploding heads need a comeback its it really a remaster its just cleaned and brightened up so its a bit clearer not exactly a major difference and thats why it was a free update if you already owned the games lets see how many of the commenters here have 4k monitor yeah i played the hunter too his skills and preferences worked best for me cant wait to play mordecai in 4k with an actual minimap already replaying i like the new features  sorry about your balls looks way better and have a fov slider still keeps the original feel the shutter is still there this is the reason of my motion sickness when try out bl 1  i couldnt really see a difference until i realized i was watching in 360p your awesome for doing these vids been wanting to see these comparisons all day long for all 3 of the bl games thank you d what about pearlescent very interesting thanx for sharing one question though when doing that dlc at say level 20 the missions there are locked at these levels so arent the final chests not locked too at these levels meaning when you come back at level 30 into the gift shop arent the chests not giving only level 20 loot thank you does dlc story missions count i was following your million dollar power start and was getting legendaries from the chests in tbone junction from just having a level 35 mission active i didnt play the game in order that it was made years ago so im not seeing anything at my level which is 56 now i still see level 30 and 40 weapons and shields the only place i see anything worth keeping is from the shift code chest and since those codes are being randomly issued it makes my weapons and shields difficult to come by just have to commend you on an amazing job as usual slack this walkthrough has kicked my mordecai build into overdrive one run through the gift shop after following the criteria and i snagged a double savior a liquid orion and a scoped pestilent defiler thumbs up you know slack its reasons like this that we love you so much although doing this in game isnt always as easy as you make it look i appreciate you doing the adventuring so we technically dont have to hi slack just wondering if you have ever played condemned criminal origins and if so will you do a walkthrough on that game ps just subbed hi major my name is marcel i live in the netherlands im a lvl 22 mordecai and i have done about 5o runs on giftshop 25 on lvl21 and 25 on lvl22 stil havent found 1 legendary how is this possible you got plenty i never get levels above my current level it maxes out at 40 i presume at play level 1 i went in the gift shop at level 41 and the highest i get is level 40 played the tartarus station except i went deeper in the main game switching back and forth to over level and all went well till i got to the last tartarus mission faced all opponents and won with ease but when i faced steele trap she was over two levels above me and i could not defeat her  i just did everything you talked about in this video and it worked i get legendaries and alien weapons  hey slack thanks for this followup video like a lot of people since the bl3 announcement im binging on borderlands so bought this after finishing bl2 again and the presequel previously owned bl1 on the 360 following on from your walkthrough i thought id wait to do the claptrap dlc at level 19 and get those luscious golds at level 20ish however the first two runs to the shop were lowlevel and no golds so i thought the trigger was you have to wait 2 levels before it kicks in turns out during the next 2 levels i mustve done the level 20 mission i definitely hadnt left fyrestone before the doing the dlc im now getting some fantastic legendaries once six in one go and also got a godlevel sniper thats more like a bl2 one it make the game a bit easy though theres no pleasing some people they came out with a revolver that holds 410 shotgun shells about eight years agotaurus i think its called the judge cause judges carry it under their robes just in case gunslinger mordecay yes please  do some vids of you owning high level enemies some crazy seat of the pants combat i have level 54 weapons but when i equip them they change to 46 still with the same stats as the higher level thanks much for the time and effort invested into solving this mystery yanks off his truxican wrestler maskit was old man witherslack additional info i did the dlcs for the first time ever last weekend after watching your vids also first as lilith however i did it at max level on pt2 and i do get many legendaries and too many eridians each gift shop run my order playthrough 1 all missions playthrough 2 again all missions moxxieprove yourself mission knoxxup to enter code access through floor zombie islandcomplete max level about half way robolutioncomplete not particularly fun that way also at 653 hours straight of bl enhanced going to try it your way after a brief respite of finishing your bl2 walkthrough at 40 and playing bl2 beyond the four assassins for the first time ever the slack always does his homework a boss thumbs up nice slippers by the way  i thought you had an air conditioner im currently working thru the dlc after i killed bonehead sol would you say its worth unlocking e ven before legenderies are you getting more purple than you would normally get if doing the original game are you considering doing the secret armory of general knoxx dlc at all slack if so you can farm the armory too and there are 126 chests inside one stand alone building total 88 red and 24 lance chests supposedly gives out mods only cant wait to try what you talked about in this video by the way i got the legendary mug shot weapon in the golden key chest in fyrestone yesterday it rocks nice detective work slack i would never have figured that out awesome video again slack and its warm in london uk as well drinking gin and tonic to cool off been getting lots of legendaries unlocked the gift shop at level 35 after completing the main story great video thanks quality is only 360p is something messed up with yt that song sounds like a dub step of cats in bootslol 33fps loooool its not star citizenits borderlands 1 cmon im sorry but i dont see a huge difference in quality therefore i will not spend an extra 30 15 with xbox live on a game that i can just download onto my xbox one with backwards compatibility they used footage from your video did you give them permission they are a magazine etc that make money httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvd35ygm8crys what the music to this original looking more realistic thank you for the movie shouldnt let your fps sink from 120 to 40s ffs this is ridiculous a remaster my ass literally paying extra for better shadows the orginal aged pretty well but idk how you could call this a remaster instead of just a port 2080 tisuper good pcand this game has an unique blurred glare especially when you move fastit will drive you crazy putting up with that constant blurred glare not sure how to fix itor if you even can as it seems it is what it is kit from what ive read its not well optimized playing it on the xbox one s even in the first town its got some real issues with screen tear considering its a remaster from the previous gen not sure if the original on bc has the same issues look the same to me  wow its the same shit my favorite thing about the remaster is the minimap rather than the compass exclusively at the end of the day both are ugly celshaded games i think its hard for the game to age graphically due to the cartoon style i think it still holds up in 2019 same with borderlands 2 i was hoping the insane frame drops in remaster would be history but no they got worse dang thats the biggest issue i have with bl1 and bl2 and it never got fixed doesnt matter what hardware you have youll always have drops down way below 60fps even with highend gpu  ima be real with you chief i cant tell the difference borderlands relied and still relies on its style rather than its graphical fidelity for its looks thats one of the reasons that borderlands 1 has aged so well compared to contemporary games of the time borderlands doesnt need fancy new tech to look appealing it looks appealing by default i appreciate the addition of an fov slider and the updated graphics but the online lag is unplayable at the momentthere is also a bug where you are in third person when you go down and cant shoot meaning you need a teammate to revive you and you cant utilize the self revive feature so the boobs shine now time to play with lilith again yes there is no gap by the lockers and the corner of the wall 236 the motion capture for her was a dude btw wow big difference looks exactly the same good job gearbox uhd titties no they look less anime nothing to see here if hes playing on pc candyland fuck off with your shitty music 133 song please ign is overrated guys candyland is best finally a good remaster so its just brighter ads ads and more ads stop telling us about your pos off brands computer junk tell us once and leave it at that nobody is gonna buy your shit when you splash it across the screen and spam your video description with information the only noteworthy things are 1 better map 2 better item management especially when you are buyingselling this is the best thing in the game the lighting and shadows are worse in the remaster none of the shadow lines are even hitting the character some are just missing in general borderlands enhanced lilith remastered version goty i am so happy they did not just upscaled textures or something they really looked at the game and improved stuff i was just about to talk about the remastered lilith lol not that big of a difference love the games tho looks at lilith doing the lords work gearbox the scopes are worse excuse me wtf as someone who has never beaten any of these titles im so fucking goddamn sick of restarting this goddamn game from the 360 version to pc now to this pc remaster now this is how a comparison video should be done not like how those ign idiots did it how are you gonna upgrade the graphics and it still look horrible ill never understand how people like this art style did you notice the was 2 lockers then 3 in the different versions check out liliths um cough tattoo detailsya the art style of borderlands is so distinct that this remaster isnt really that impactful i can tell a difference but its not drastic i dont know if thats a compliment to the art or maybe a testament to how little they actually changed regardless all i care about is how it performs if its consistently at or above 60 fps i have no complaints nothing says graphics update like an hd render on liliths tits hey im bi so im not complaining damn those titties look great in hd why you dipping so much at the end so basically lilith bas better titties wow its a much bigger upgrade than i thought i thought it was just a 4k mode which was fine by me because im playing on xbox one x so itd still be a noticeable jump but theres been upgrades to the environmental textures lighting and even some of the geometry definitely downloading this when i get home thanks candyland one new thing that ive noticed is the echo in the sledge room on the remaster telltale graphics honestly i could never really get into the first game it didnt have the charm that borderlands 2 presequel and tales did cool remastered game remaster mini map is the best feature in the game sweet i can look at liliths enhanced boobies d i actually like the older versions shadows better got a pro and 4k screen got uhd pack and update 15 main menu is 4k bl2 menu en game 1080p can some one help me on that remastered is netter ok grafic is only good but the game self is very good why my pc looks better tho xd it looks like a comparison between low vs ultra settings it looks slightly better but thats about it so wait because i already had borderlands goty edition is that why i now have a borderlands goty enhanced in my steam library waiting to be installed they fixed boobies 1010 after this video i have to play this game again nice improvements i feel bad that console folk have to shell out 30 bucks for this a game remastered 10 years later looks better i cant believe it still a super close up fov then i see remaster in 2019y and just with fxaammmmonsterkill borderlands for the swotch ploz 139 global warming hit that mountain in the background useless remasteret borderlands just looks bad anyway borderands 3 looks like the game from 2009 the transition from playing borderlands 2 to borderlands 1 is like dating gal gadot then dating brie larson actual video with effort nice job moral of the story cellshading ages very nice compare the 360 version to the goty version still looks like shit i expected nothing less from randy pitchford trash filled genius never forget the failures of aliens colonial marines and battleborn and now this epic store exclusive nonsense dont let these remasters hype you for borderlands 3 wait for reviews and never preorder it just makes borderlands look like borderlands 2 which is great for people who jumped in during borderlands 2 myself because i couldnt even finish borderlands because of how weird it felt in comparison now i finally might good job on showing the particles effect i did not realize that lilith with more breast kskaks this all leads up to borderlands 3 who else is really excited can you show the differences in the ultra hd texture packs man those sounds are a suffering i cant play co op on ps4 rip 30 fps in 10 years old game no thx so they basicly turn the graphics to medium time to play the game again  not on switch  amazing video btw whats the song in the background i love it my pc copy of bl1 on steam didnt get any update wtf  what is music those frame rate drops are gamebreakers look at that sucker fall from 120 to 30 while the original is still over 100 what the heck are they doing over there can someone help me i have it on my xbox one as the 360 version can i play the remaster version without buying it again i see no difference both looks same 510 for sure better than assisand creed remaster they gave lilith perkier boobs that is awesome lol i know a lot of people say the difference is minimal but for me its the little things that counts all the tiny insignificant improvements add up to be more than the sum of its part thank you candyland now i know its going to be a good purchase i think playing this game will be like going home lilith is sexy af now thx god so it literally looks like the newest games again fine by me nice would have liked to seen all the playable characters though cant wait to play after i beat pre sequel why on gods name would they make this remastered like man make deus ex the original remastered or maybe house of the dead 2 remastered or nf2 se remastered we dont want a game we played 23 years ago remastered weird  dont see the purpose but i guess if u aint played it yet you can increase the fps if you edit some configurations there for the game need to be started once so documentsmygamesborderlandswillowedgame folder is going to be created i cant remember the file but there is a setting in a inifile wich is called smootherframes turn it off and fps lock is gone im playing with nearly 300 fps in 2k and ultra some times dropping to 200 when there are lot of explosions but i cant see any difference and pc usage is still same just a engineproblem i guess its a fucking remake god job the game is having serious issues i have a 1080 at 4k i didnt get those frame rate drops and im way past the nine toes part now but theres tons of people getting it so not sure whats up the consoles are really showing their age with this one if anyone has ps4 please allow me to share play it with u i want to try the game out too see if i should buy people are bitching about bethesda and skyrim but still buys the 17th remaster of borderlands lmao yep anti aliasing and bigger boobs are a true reason to pay the price of a whole game for something you already played yall fucking plebs 307 boob shape changed definitely worth another playthrough whats your rig odd to see the fps drop with nine toes 1080ti 8700k 16gb 3600mhz ram here and 4k dsr didnt drop below 130 during nine toes can we just called it the hd version and not a remastered 220 they also brightened the spotlight on dr zed and oddly the ambient occlusion was removed the only difference i notice is that the redhead chick has bigger boobs i like it i mean if all they did was update the game with a minimap id still love the update i remember countless times as we drive one guy is staring at the map while the other drives im one of the lucky ones to get a physical copy depth of field on hurts my eyes for the love of god aim down sights err you forgot to point out one big thing ambient occlusion is gone in the remastered version you can clearly see it during the dr zed section of the video thats much more alarming than some dirt tbh the game crashed on me when i tried to go to the underdome with a friend best port ever yes this is what i wanted the performance on the remaster is a joke so f cking bad what about the gameplay is improved or not so much if the size in the disk is much in comparation i dont get this i think i prefer the original the only differences i notice is a slightly better texture in remaster however some shadows in remaster are quite stale in the original theyre a bit more like the shape that theyre trying to mimic also the other only difference i notice is the silicone implant surgery that lilith has gone through in the remaster if you look closely her breasts are now semi circular firm and strong but the breast size actually doesnt change if anything the originals hang a bit lower and this is due to the fact that the originals breasts are shaped like a tear drop for a more natural look honestly i dont think its worth it in my opinion its just a different shade of gray if you ask me youre basically paying for a different shade of gray i feel like they shouldve updated the hud as well to match with the newer games bl1 is a great game but the hud feels so simplistic and boring compared to 2 and presequel so basically they made the lines darker and then tried to sell it again yall made 1 hour conference to sell us old shit and then hit us with a 2 min trailer that didnt even run properly you had to run it twice foh im sorry im a fan of the series but the press reveal was bethesda esq all they did the whole time was try to sell us the old games a fuckin hour of that bs that conference wqs str8 shit they did a really good job im not sure i like the changes to the weapons though i prefer the original gunfire texture and shading great comparison video as always lilith was always my favourite character once i first got the game of the year for ps3 back in 2010 ass soon when the game appeared in store i bought itdamn my x box one is so happy having a lot of issues playing co op with friends on this remaster level 15 enemies are dropping level 4 gear also all of the quests that pertain to a certain level are dropping very low tier gear level 10 or less its becoming very frustrating as i do not remember borderlands ever being like that meanwhile same time gap https2bpblogspotcompbrs7njcysvznir7g53niaaaaaaaaaayloncrclfytqjfcbnc6eizjwfsarmrcv6ackgbs1600102bnewjpg httpsmediamoddbcomimagesgames1133d3monsterjpg the best part that its completly free if alreadh own the original they pretty much just unlocked epic settings not much of a remaster looks pre much same no where near worth 30 i never stopped playing any of the blands so i can tell the difference and its awesome i also think the 4player splitscreen is awesome got to revive my childhood x2 thx to these guys original run like shit in windows 10 wb remaster they fixed it well at least it came with the dlc and 75 golden keys with all these games i dont expect getting a remaster i hope mafia ii gets remastered this game actually works as a remaster since the graphics are already timeless what the heck is a storm trooper playing that accuracy is poopy basically it just looks like the presequel i fucking love your videos and have done for years just one question where the hell did the name candyland come from also i have always loved the pink and white aesthetic and the lovely jingle at the end of your vids please never change candyland  came for the comparison stayed for the music now thats how comparisons are done everyone else take notes not really that impressed with this or bl3 much coming from someone who enjoyed the series cause i was expecting some graphical improvements i get it but thats the art style remember that bl2 was orginally a last gen game im not saying it will be bad cause im sure it will be an awesome game but i mean major game companies are already talking about next gen its amazing how a nearly 10 year old game still visually holds up thanks to the cartoony style yo the 2000s were a great time to b alive for video games this game is literally having your cake and eating it too the game looks better and they gave it a true optimization so it runs much smoother that plus all the little qol updates and this is genuinely a musthave im playing on 1080p and even that is drastically better in all aspects this video is a great effort but you really gotta play it yourself to see youtube does not do it justice the remaster has loads of bugs and glitches on the ps4 pro the hdr is broken and looks washed out when you turn hdr off it looks better but this game needs a major patch apparently people couldnt have more than two player multiplayer and the trophies didnt unlock for the second player lazy port indeed 312 really like how they redesign liliths model still looks like a game from the 90s only with half the frame rate thats a pretty big difference between the two for the better to some developers dont do anything for remasters omg yes its a dx11 port whats the song used in the vid anyone know anyone getting it on the ps4 313 rtx off rtx on only difference i see is frame drops at the end candyland please do a short comparison video of borderlands thc uhd pack on a base ps4 and a ps4 pro my girl lilith still looking fine as hell welli dont feel like the graphics upgrades are worth the fps lost still no split screen cant wait to see your video on bl2 and tps do texture changes hurt an old game like that bad jesus the original held better frames im happy for the overhaul but ugh the frames i still have the presequel unplayed in my steam library what song is used how can i update my goty edition on steam 355 wtf 31 frames per second when is the ultra hd texture pack for borderlands 2 coming out so there are some improvements in the graphics not huge changes though for the cohsole is where i would be curious to see the difference does the game use the same engine to detect whether or not the shots hit as the first game or does it have the better hit detection of borderlands 2 this is just showing how well borderlands aged the new one is better but it isnt instantly noticeably better like some remasters are nice italian gameplay on my channel when it will come out hello i live in germany and i cant buy the remastered its not on the ps4 store not available in our local gamestop and not on any other site can someone help me i really wanna play the game again ssao is disabled or am i seeing things  looks basically the exact fucking same so little adjustment whats the fucking point they should be focused on borderlands 3 and not their older shit before giving us the third game this means bl3 is gonna fucking suck ass thats why they push older titles back on the market to try and get money cuz they know bl3 is fucking terrible we have seen this in the game industry before be wary folks save your money i am a simple man i see remastered boobies i click downloading mine now played the crap out of 2 and havnt played much of the first so this will be a great new experience for me lol insane fps drops remaster pirating it great video the difference is significant in most other videos its not easy to tell the difference cant wait to run this on my xbox one x graphics settings original very low remastered high yeah borderlands was always definitely about story and gameplay 219 remaster has an extra lockerwhat the heckwhy 355 look the fps in the remastered how you can get more than 60 fps in bl1 my bl1 i cant get more than 60 fps thx for the video i love that thumbnail i have borderlands on steam i dont see any pending update or an option to download the remaster what the hell 30 fps lowest in the video lmao not worth to buy when did this come out and why is it not in the marketplace for xbox and the ps store edit just looked it up comes out today how do i get this game now on pcsteam i have the original version of borderlands or do i need the goty before how do i notice its the new version so low fps o ohh noooo from where do you downloadbuy pc version games  its a poor remaster i think the real question should be did they fix the mouse sensitivity slider settings is there vsync toggle and uncapped frame rate option on pc borderlands is in such a weird position as its a cartoon based looking game how can it properly be remastered the only thing i see is higher res textures not graphically enhanced textures and better geometry if anyone can explain how this can be worth it please reply and answer this would really appreciate it you should next compare the original borderlands handsome collection graphics to the new updated graphics exactly the same as the original wow i was thinking this was a simple hd resolution buff or something but no they did a full remaster of every texture and added more particle effects changed the lighting etc etc day on purchase along with borderlands 3 jesus christ the amount of whining and complaining in the comments is disgusting if you truly dont see a difference i know youre bullshitting there then dont get it you think its a waste of time then dont get it you upset that its free for people who already own it but then get upset you still have to pay six fucking dollars if you dont already own itguess what not only are you the dumbest cunt of em all but the rules still applydont get it if you wouldve taken a whole 2 minutes to get off your fucking high horse and did a quick search youd know that there has been new features added as well nopeyou decided to be an idiot and open your mouth before thinking as per usual youtube pure fucking morons randy pitchford can take his ball and go home without volumetric lightfogsmokedust omg 30 dollars for this nope im going play the original my xbox1 x 65inch oled 4k hdr tv and my anus is so ready loving the pc focused content cl keep up the great work whop dee doo sharper textures and shoddy aa implementation wooo faaaaancy complete fucking useless for us pc owners it seems to run much worse too id rather use one of the numerous textures mods for the original game omg 2 hours and i can finally play not much different 60fps maybe as long as this remaster is 60fps on consoles i will buy itfor me with borderlands is not about the graphicsis about the overall gameplay and how much fun and countless of hours ive played this series heavy breathing yes please is this coming to switch whats the music its running at 124fps must be the ps4 pro version go to one of the dense areas like the mine and overlook it then you will see the frames tank i wasnt worried about the fps drop until i saw the specs of the computer you guys are using jeez how did yall get the update early nicer tits a remaster the original actually looks better to me the new textures make this game look like an n64 game a lot if people are calling this a cash grab and not a remaster let me prove you wrong the video speaks for itself but theres new content they have added head and skin customization from borderlands 2 borderlands 1 did not have this feature you were only allowed to change colours on your clothes no skins to unlock just you choosing colours the last boss battle has changed we still dont know how but they mentioned that the boss battle is more rewarding and a better experience they added shift codes free codes with free content borderlands 2 had this feature it allowed the developers to tweet free codes that gave you new skin and head customization also they added new guns probably borderlands 2 legendaries new head and skin customizations means more loot to get who can complain about more content edit hope this is enough to get you to consider this as a remaster 3 why is the frame rate always low in remastered games wow i dont remember it being that bulry original cell shading 30 remaster cell shading 10000 this isnt a console comparison remaster sure only bl2 textures omg waiting for remaster for bl2 bl3 detected framerate could be bad the work is lazy in general but hey those reworked boobs are worth every single penny is this version uncut in germany the 30 fps is a yokea yoke i remember people used to defend the bioshock remastered edition for not looking better than it actually did by saying the cartoony art style is hard to remastered compared to other games this is proof that that argument is bullshit the bioshock remaster did look better in most ways but actually looked worse in others with the shadows on some of the models this is how you do a better remastered edition sure the textures are pretty much the same just upscalled but the lighting and shadows are fantastic the only problem i have with this is the fps frames per second the original could actually run pretty consistently smooth at least on pc but the new version seems to dip way down to like 48 fps at times i hope this could be addressed without them doing what batman arkham did by actually locking the frames at a lower max rate than the original could do for the sake of stability and consistency i would prefer they just make it have higher frames in general stabili they sure did remaster them titties the best noticeable upgrade was liliths tits  is it me or does this not look different who thinks captain cloud is too op in the beginning of the second dlcmad moxxis underdome riot because i dont want to level up pass lv50 when early on the dlcs 3 this is rediculous whats the point in remaster cartoon looking game i dont see any difference wish they could have added a bit more colors and brighter ones to cuz it still looks really boring with these colors holy shit down to 30fps on a 2080ti i mean its more just a refurbishing than a remaster but still nice nonetheless borderlands 1 will always be fantastic really not that big a difference no thanks wtf that frame drop essentially the remaster looks like how people think borderlands looks like in their memories versus what the 2009 title actually looked like very nice significant improvements in textures this one is huge due to the art style crisp detailed textures only strengthen the aesthetic more moderate improvements in geometric detail the tree got more tris but characters didnt really benefit much antialiasing is pretty damn good shadows are drastically improved lighting is okay that weird area light on the doc reflective surfacaes look better now cory youre shit was blown when you got that car 237 i know the image looks more clear but ao seems gone completely one change i love with the remaster is the fact that the sun actually looks bright now like all the cutsceneslike it looks oppressively hot in the borderlands like it should 141 cool they removed that damn plant inside the ground close to tk baha nothing interesting but why rip tk my best friend  90fps to 180fps on the original lol that is insane lock it at 60fps  less fps doesnt mean its bad the original has less to render then the new one they fixed outline before it was like the higher resolution the thinner outline most overrated game of all time hd texture improved antialiasing more polygonal geometry  now thats how you compare two games graphics not just by playing two videos with one games graphics and anothers graphics side by side i genuinely appreciate your work and literally paused the video just to write this comment you read it or not candyland but you truly deserve it fps tanked terribly during that last scene ultra high definition lilith cleavage when can i install again that small fov makes me feel claustrophobic and sick i hope theres a slider for it in the pc graphics settings 315 yeah remastered tits but did they improve the walkrun speed compared to borderlands 2 you moved a lot slower in the first game man developers are just not trying anymore some improvedadded textures and lighting does not a remaster make but i guess they can get away with it bec its not a remake a total cash grab both look like absolute shit music  does the pc version have an fov slider  im waiting for april 3 so i can officially begin my entire borderlands franchise replay from bl1 to tftbl before this september graphics are ok but those fps drops are surely not the difference is so small frames down still not optimized for windows 10 i will continue whit my windowss 107 dual boot only to play borderlands 1 and 2 whitout fps drops shit looks super better you cant ask for much more from this cartoony game amazing work by candyland better than that garbage comparison video by ign this is not the second time this games are remastered stupid shooter with no logic 314 lilith is sexy in both versions slightly more so in the remaster i swear they better fix the buggy legendary weaponsi will be sad if they dont better than what ubisoft did to ac 3 i want to see the console versions nice mod its free on nexus to download yeah because that fps drop is soooo noticable this game looks so bland i never played it but it sure does look like it  i wish they would make a new brothers in arms game they said several years ago that they were working on one and nothings been said since from my understanding they get asked about it quite a bit fps tt cleavage in 4k nice not worth the money 30fps at ninetoes with a geforce rtx 2080 ti httpsyoutubeju0l40sdx5mt235 those are some major frame rate drops looks about as much of an improvement as i thought it would be less blurry textures better antialiasing and some added details here and there anyone who is disappointed in this free upgrade had unrealistic expectations more graphical effort than the handsome collection they didnt even fix the broken physx this game should be running at 200fps for its visual quality who gave borderlands a goty award  lilith looks more naturel in the orginal the remaster got maybe a bit more sharpening textures but thats really it tho i also like the colors better on the original like assassins creed 3 its a pity ubisoft should learn about this jesus look at that dogshit framerate 31fps at one point was there any point in remastering this lilith no longer flat chested so thats a remaster if ive ever seen one where to get the remaster not on steam checked 255 better pushup for lilith at least thats something this makes me excited for the 4k update with borderlands two no one plays this game because of the graphics no one asked for a remaster is there an fov slider and vsync option remaster barely any difference other than a new lighting that not necessarily makes it look better at least colors are less saturated its pretty goodno since when did they remaster borderlands 1 236 lol wtf where ao great music is the final boss better wait how do you play the remaster now shitty aa it is then 345 look at the drop in the remaster from 127 fps to 48 fps omg there is a freaking remaster frame rate drop so badly do you know what time the remaster will be released to the public  hope it comes to the switch one day even more when i saw that darksiders have a 60fps mode even in portable mode i have never played borderlands 1 or 2 or any of them except 3 which i finished yesterday and loved should i play the other ones  i played this today yo show us online gameplay could someone please tell the order the game franchise goes in completely forgot there wasnt a minimapyoung me was a lot smarter than current me 150 what the hell is that dorothy was there was a little confused about the graphics and you are good with it was a little more time lol and i dont know if thats a little too late for you to get to work so much for your help with this matter and i love  this game is so boring would you kindly give him a handoh wayt wrong game anybody else notice that he didnt grab the chest that always spawns on the building near the start just played through this game in like 5 days roland with assault rifle and shotguns fully upgraded cut through the game like butter shut the hell up mordy quote tiny tina and lilith in her head well i played 5 hrs thn realized i was playing original version lol now started the enhanced version and the difference is insane anyone got a modded gun for ps4 tryna platinum when youtube copyrights a new

got the borderlands handsome collection on steam for 5 you missed the weapon chest as soon as you get off the bus on top of the building to the left roof i wish to ask if they have raise money limit into unlimited or is it 10mil what was just killing this game before i just got the handsome edition for 15 are those 75 gold keys only on pc just bought the goty edition on ps4 and i didnt get any keys too bad i wont be usin that remastered commin back to the game within 2 days i got a lv 50 brick max without dlc on original there is the borderlands triple pack for 26 dollars on amazon that is amazing 1 borderlands game would take you a month to finish that is what you call a quality game every game now is 60 dollars and you can finish it in 2 days cant wait for borderlands 3 looking forward to the guns with legs in borderlands 3 yeah enhanced edition hurra but my pc is potato so ill probably turn down everything so i can get smoother framerates  ive been seeing in a lot of the reviews the really bad screen tearing for both one x pro any idea if this has been resolved its on sale and i wanna grab as i have original but havent seen anyone update the screen tearing issue since april whats the difference with this and regular borderlands everyone go and check steam theres a 97 sale on borderlands the handsome collection its like 450 anyone have any lag issues and frame rate issues with the enhanced edition for further reference you can actually get on top of the building on the left as soon as you meet claptrap on top is a chest that you can get a shotgun they should add a youtube mode where the copyright music is placed with not copyright music thank you for not shouting in my ear like everybody else feels compelled to do telltale brought me herw the nostalgia i bought the handsome collection borderland 2 game of the year edition is to my library but in my library borderlands 2 not game of the year edition in game is come  found your channel and love it how do you not have a lets play borderlands 2 recently got back into the game and saw this lets play when searching for bl2 and i love it but no bl2 at 000 you get got for 2 frames also 75 for the fov your kidding me right back then i have a borderlands 2 goty at my ps3 but my ps3 got strick by lighting it took a quite a whilw for me getting a ps4 and took another while to get the borderlands handsome collection you got a bad hand for the new legendaries i got the sniper it has a critical hit damage bonus of 800 dont feel bad about recording the first episode using the original borderlands instead of the enhanced i seen quite a few youtubers make that mistake frick i got the wrong one first time playing this game guys wish me luck  you kind of sound like handsome jack never played this one im glad i have the handsome collection which includes the pre sequel and second one i killed the vault boss as hunter and killed vault boss at lvl 33 before borderlands 3 came out what a time to be a gamer 1824 how in earth did you level up so fast i think the reason you like this borderlands is because in bl2 they killed roland and blood wing just looking back at how many times we look back at the games we love for instance cod 1 now were at cod bo4 now borderlands were almost at borderlands 3 and here we are looking back at the first borderlands its just amazing borderlands oh the memories excuse my french but what a great fucking game this is looking forward to the play through  you gotta problem with people who live under rocks do you get also the original that fov is so damn low got this game again 3 days ago and its just as good as the first time all those years ago i only use brick i fucking cannot wait till septemberlootlootlootand more fucking loot im sick of this copyright bs has youtube ever heard of fair use act i wish i had the bandwith to stream gameplay because each copy right claim would cost them 1 mil dollars in lawsuits mordecai was pretty cool but i loved the builds and play style of siren so much more im going to miss the og claptrap voice when bl3 comes out in case nobody played it in the vr version of 2 it was revealed that claptrap was recast the person sounds good but its very noticeable that its not the same person ok so whatever it is that you wanna do im with all of it okay we could play whatever also just so u know when u kill the boss at the vault u get a chest with 100 chance of a random gearbox weapon every time u open it idk why but i dont start with gearbox weapons but meh i just wanna enjoy the game d the series that got me into cowboy borderlands oh yeah baby i installed the enhanced version but cant find the superguns they would come in handy since i am not a good player ahem in my inventory do they appear a short bit into the game oh and cowboy you are truly the best i bought this day one i regret nothing the one thing i feel in love with of borderlands was the comic book graphics was unique an something fresh an new is there any prerequisites in order to get those gearbox guns is there any1 who knows how to avoid the securom check when installing the old borderlands game ive tried everything but it doesnt work thx mordechai and bloodwingmy favorites d meh i miss angel in the top right corner this superimposed giant image is offputting really like the uhd packs for the 2 one and pre sequel borderlands is a great game i play console only because i dont have the means to get a top end computer you should use any gun you want to oh this is going to be fun 0000 he got us i hate that i never played any of these games i remember i was pretty much unkillable in the game i played the brawler said fuck guns grabbed big shield with heavy regen of both shield and health and charged in and punched everything to death so much fun you should change your field of view takes a minute to get used to but its so worth it okay how did you get the enhanced version to work so smoothly all of the system specs in my laptop are above the recommended system requirements yet the game is constantly stuttering my games framerate constantly tanks when there is too many items or i look at a weapons details and sometimes even if there is just a lot of enemies on screen i have a 980ti i dont get it its not that much of an upgrade xd kinda sucks  did they update the ps3 version so is borderlands 1 enhanced or is the sequel i have 3 sucker punches the starter one then lvl 36 and lvl 37 the destroyer of worlds dropped the 36 and then i used a couple gold keys and got the 37 id really like the shotgun though  is this going to be remastered for ps4 not only is this one of the greatest games but that into on the bus is my favourite intro of all time in any game ever so its sad not to see the intro so much so i ended up buying the markus borderlands bobble head from the game i dont understand them how their are so many other videos with that song and intro on youtube is it because they have been their before the system came into place havent been here since i binged on the dark souls series and i made the same mistake as you so im starting again they should just delete the old version especially as it needs a little tinkering to run properly the enhanced version just works i cant watch your borderland videos every time i try to watch one i get the urge to play the game borderlands 1 is still good but man the skill trees suck compared to bl2 and pre sequel brick being the exception wasnt there an achievement for stomping in skags this is the only game that gives me massive motion sickness i cant even watch gameplay i think it has to do with the black lines has anyone been able to reach a weapon crate near shep in the arid badlands area you forgot the developer chest right after you got off the bus i didnt get any keys wth is this damn love playing borderlands amazing game 3 just a heads up the playlist is a bit out of order cant wait to watch this tbh ive never played borderlands and i really want too goty only makes me want it more how do you collect gold keys or can they be collected would you kindly cant wait for 3 to come out crank that fov up to fun cowboy its so much better the guns in bl2 sucked just my opinion mordecai is best for solo runs bloodwing can revive you on kill my first run was with mordecai and it was great but nothing was more fun than a tanky brick with explosive augmentation you do know about the loot chest on the roof at the very beginning you can get the gearbox weapons from the golden key box how do you have this game it is hard to get some youtuber had the intro song thanks for letting us know we get the enhanced version for free downloading down so glad i brought on steam  hell yes i was waiting for this ever since it got remastered greatest game ever cowboy did you know you can raise fov in this game yooo this is torture i wanna play this so bad i got a physical copy of the game but i didnt get any keys or guns any advice i played through borderlands with mordicai for the first time then second time i went with lilithalso know as easy mode this is gonna be good  i was stoked for borderlands 3 but im not buying shit off the epic store april 2020 it is good they finally added a fov slider so you dont have to mess with the config file is this better than the handsome collection with the updated mechanics oh fuck this is going to be glorious scrubs be likewhy is it trying to be fornite or overwatchlul for those of you who have never been to the wastelands of west texas the arid badlands really captures the feel down to zed and tks accents i cant help but get a little homesick every time i play borderlands weve come fill circle i started watching cowboy way back when his channel was borderlands 2 builds then dark souls 2 hit and he exploded on the scene deservedly so and now were back to fyrestone cheers cowboy it seems to me that your anisotropic filtering is set to a lower value ground gun textures should look much sharper if it was intentional pardon me that cage the elephant song at the beginning so good gotta do borderlands 2 after do you plan on playing all of them i jesus christd at the same time 1653 omg i love this game thank you meh idk man borderlands always felt slow to me as a fps if i werent fond of diablostyle games and rpgs in general i would have skipped b1 in a heartbeat the combat is so slow just started streaming this game on my channel as well absolutely love this remaster the dlcs in this game are all so good sweet lord i love these games is ther not a chest on top of the gas station in the beginning area this game looks fun controller on fps games yes cant wait for 3 crank that fov up my man the 6 new legendary weapons can world drop i have a lv55 violence and you will shit yourself when you get the new sniper also you can change your fov cowboy but you probably know that i found because of bld2 way back in the day its a nice return to form it makes me happy that you auto suck up ammo and such looking at the ground and spamming e was very annoying nobody shoots my buddy but me thats the line but you killed him midsentence bloodwing build through normal is soooo good dont be lying with that sound check you really feared for your life from those skags by far the best borderlands game so far 2 and presequal were alright but imo didnt compare to the charm this one had this game is so good shame you had to rerecord the video but im sure it was worth it  this brings back memories i really hope they didnt fix the crawmerax glitch and the glitch for general knoxx armory i was gonna get this but i think ill just watch you i remember absolutely nothing from the first game i forgot angel was even in it lol i was waiting so long for you to remember you had the free guns i was hoping you were gonna get the sniper tho its crazy only 2 per day makes me sad bl1bl2 fact who are you gonna pick as your first character for borderlands 3 i chose mordicai as well and got two completely different gearbox guns a rockets launcher and combat rifle  oof that was addictive i played this when it first came out but i dont remember a single thing from it hey cowboy are you for an easy mode in sekiro lol ign is  you ever play the surge adore the original borderlands second one got to hyped up still excited for the third one damn looks like you cant stop with good content i love your channel ive always grown up around borderlands 2 definitely will play this one how did you get those gearbox guns in the beginning was it from a shift code im playing on ps4 pro and i didnt get those let the looting begin papa cowboy back with classic content lets go i hate it i dont know way i played on xbox 360 i feel nothing special about this game first i just started playing borderlands 2 handsome edition first time playing borderlands are you going to fo a walkthrough there anytime soon i played normal goty version so i noticed some differences 1 all chests are red in old version of the game 2 chance to spawn legendaries is much less even with find rare item class mod what i see in there are weapons 10 to 20 levels below my current level of 56 i might get one that ill keep which will be the same as another but a little better nothing big or worth getting excited overnever i get all of the legendary weapons however i never get weapons leveled above my level i have been in there many many times i still dont get what makes a legendary weapon from a regular weapon is it the elemental damage or something else the hellfire and the orion are great weapons ha take that loot officer slack is there a way to give a one time donation one of the best class mods i found for my siren from the hyperion gift shop unfortunately only at level 55 im level 69 is a mercenary one with 60 smg damage and 26 ammo regen i really respect the time and effort you put into all of your walkthroughs all the thorough testing off screen runs and footage editing must take dozens of hours good info fantastic info for me at level 20 my level was greater than my mission levels as i did side missions i found that at levels 2022 no legendaries appeared until i acquired level 20 missions even though i did several story missions while leveling up since then the orange harvest has been bountiful that defiller looked good  those hornets and defilers will probably make mincemeat out of the knoxx dlcand the equalizers will keep you supplied hope we can see some test footage soon would need a few moist towelettes if i hit 7 legendary in a run i can see it now clean up in major slacks office please bring all available mops asap lol great job as always boss thumbs up  hx440c hellfireawesome i like the stats on that blast hammer legendary shottie around the 12 minute mark even my baby makes an appearance at 1424 cobalt volcano  slack statistically you will get a quad spawn if you keep farming for it not sure how long itll take but youll get it but if you hit level 20 then farm this room and everything scales up to 25 as i saw on some of the weapon cards then it would be pointless to farm the chests because now you are underleveled for the items well well thank you hyperion for providing us access to this treasure room legendaries galore me likes d it really is tragic that you dont have millions of views and major pun intended revenue from your work fuck yes they finally added the minimap got dizzy following the previous compass type navigation why would anyone play this now borderlands 3 is announced have some self control and just wait lmao i definitely like the enhancements the controller seems to work much better now too the red pill 000 the blue pill 951 either way thanks for watching 514ck  is this applicable to the base game with all dlcs or some of the new inner workings of the enhanced edition allow it getting ready for number 3 i see now i gotta turn my notifications on  hey slack are you going to do borderlands 2 the pre sequel and three when it comes out got to say that with age comes perfection and that is reflecting in the super mario skillswatching this banzai run compared to the old content namely the original and borderlands 2 its like watching night and day also with the old borderlands every single time i entered tbone junction the game would always be sluggish but seeing it now with all the bells and whistles damnand really looking forward for the run of the dlcs so you want me to share huh rofl love you vids slack i used this little circuit to blow my buddys mind also ill say this the roboluction does not start scaling till you turn in the meet shep sanders mission so you can run that dlc at a lower level beat it then scale it up to get better loot from the end reward and this is not an exploit i think a sneaky barrel got you at the start happened to me a couple of times slack be rich woohoo a walkthrough of dlc i never played and with a low level hero slack is spoiling us again d excellent vid this is the way i always start except that i take closer to an hour with side trips to the bank to upgrade my ammo capacity i knoweasymode and stash possible future weapons shields and class mods also fairly certain theres no death tax up to level 10 i believe also that fast traveling to the bank and back clears the assassins as they always disappear completely for me thats quick and smart earn really hyped for clappys dlc run thumbs upp bosss  lines up with other hardcore slackers and kicks like a rockette were in the money were in the money d slack what do you think about the borderlands 3 footage if you want to pick up one extra item im pretty sure the lockers by the first chest the one by the bounty board will always have an item in them and i always skip the chest in the boat once again excellent work slack thumbs up stick with the slack and you wont have an unfortunate fatal incident occur nope doesnt quite have the same ring  you probably mentioned this but is this like part 1 of the mordecai dlc run after i got this goty edition version of the game i also have been having problems with the game crashing probably 4 times so far i get the 2 legendary weapons when i start and have got one while playing mid way through the game in the shift box omg if i would have known going to do 3 of 4 dlcs nice back in bl1 days tbone junction was where i made bank i stopped picking up weapons less that 200k i had so much money my death taxes were in the millionswhich may be why they put that sneaky mailbox somwhere in the strider area that takes a bunch of your money will you continue with the dlc or start a new series mr slack i have borderlands goty enhanced installed and i am getting 2 gearbox legendary weapons every time i start a new game i have borderlands goty enhanced installed and i am not getting 2 gearbox legendary weapons every time i start a new game how do you get craw to move forward without him killing you so this only works as lilith because it sure as fuck doesnt work for roland im going for my 29th time now and regardless how you get to corner he will eventually see you gonna keep trying even though it ate all my money but there is no point to money in this game so i dont mind if you had a lower shield than the 3000 one youd have died as soon as you got there anyway his minions kill me before i get there or soon after whybecause my shield is less than 2400 so does it not work you still get hit by all the maggots attacks its not working for me i think because im brick or something no thanks its literally impossible now only character who can beat craw is lilith now can you still use the rocket launcher for his back by aiming at the spine im going to be trying it tonight u could get to the ledge faster with a grenade jump or two and u might even be able to get a shot or two on his back better vid than the last i saw idiot kept pulling his sights down after a successful hit and missing the next few shots going after him in playthrough 1 now holy shit it works thanks man this is the first time i killed crawmerax without cheating lol thanks a lot that helped so much how is your shield so high i havent found a 3k yet i started having this issue when i started replaying the game again at first i would just quit to desktop then go back in the game and it would be resolved but then i found out it would happen when i was farming and exiting out the game multiple times to reload my character i turned vsync on and the issue seemed to disappear for me just what happened for me and im running an rtx 2070 super that worked 1000 thanks  mine still drops to 1 fps when opening the game it says its using my gtx750ti which i use for my extra monitors but never uses or even sees my 980 even though i changed all the settings in the control panel to use that card mate youre a bloody miracle worker from a framerate below most films to stable 60fps with vsync much appreciated and keep up the good work this is a huge huge problem for me on single player this didnt fix it either what boggles my mind is that im running borderlands 2 super smoothly on my rtx 2070 this did solve the issue for me thank you so much i smiled when i saw we had the same graphics card rtx 2070 i have rx 570 and fx 6300 and played game 1 hour but my fps drop 20 fps and cpu usage 100 pls help may look different for people yeah duh for example amd settings dont work this way at all this is so lazy of devs they copy pasted everthing of boderlands 1 into the engine of borderlands 2 without testing it properly to see what happens they could at least take the time to use sound assests and graphic assets that are present in both games like explosion 4 exemplemr torgue would be so dissapointed worked for me thanks thank you so much ive been scouring the depths of the internet to no avail i had given up hope but your video was the only thing that got it right seriously ive been playing for ten years and i was crushed when this game was lagging your solution is a live saver youve made my day what about amd shouldnt be a problem in single player i just went from 130 fps to 5 fps in single player i damn near threw up from the violent shift it works thanks its work thanks for the guide 3 now if you got a jump lag fix for multiplayer i will like you even more i havent had any frame issues but whenver i alt tab i get 1 of 2 problems the game goes into windowed mode and cant even maxamize or the game just completely crashes thank you for the advice on how to fix this oh and i also used this video on a review on steam this was helpful this helped man thank you do you know why this accured is it just cuz the game is old it worked still lags a little but it was unplayable before in comparison thanks dude looks a lot like fallout new vegas 3rd person camera the game should just be like this i might actually be able to get my best friend to play it the amount of sales they lose due to not offering 3rd person mode has got to be insane and to think its all for a feature that some person can simply mod in their spare time i dont like the hip fire 247 it drives me nuts i hope three they make their animations more natural brick was a huge example scoped pistol never ads yeaaaaaaaaah i cant play bcs shes so thicc it just distracts me from the game i see why roland tapped that borderlands needs this option because the characters are so cool im not lying when i say this but i cant remember playing this game in 1st person i swear on everything that i played this in 3rd when i owned borderlands on 360 i hate fpss why are you guys messing with my head i just picked up the bl2 pack and im like huh then i see an ad for 3rd mod im like it cant benoooooooooo its like waking up in the twilight zone  the third person crosshair has the wrong aim for me iam on 219 3440x1440 anyone there with the right settings love this mod im installing the enhanced edition now do i also have to mess with nexus to get into third person i like big butts and i cannot lie you other brothers cant deny i still wonder why they never had this originally in the games bl1 i could understand as there wasnt much for character creation but when bl2 introduced skins and heads you could only see them in menus why especially fully knowing there were dlc and event costumes planned i seriously hope they add 3rd person to bl3 i would buy it for that alone playing on a wimpy area well below your challenge level weak lol dat azz boi how do you get this i have been trying for like the last 2 hours to use the file i downloaded from nexus mod i wish they would tell you what program you need to use the file how a poor fps game becomes a good tps i remember doing this years ago is it possible to switch to first person mode as well now thats an enhancement ass watching simulator ill take two please level 20 against level 10 youre real hero i would like beat this game for the 10000 time but the first time with this mod not my cup of tea these third person modes but if its optional who can object what camera settings are you using in willowgameini this camera setting youre using is perfect for me also great job on the mod i think making a borderlands game third person would be pretty cool it will give it a fresh look so aiming down sight without scope is impossible now because you just using the aim down sights when the gun has scopes eh wow thats a lot cooler than i was expecting it to be makes this play like ghost recon wildlands except you can jump lol this would be even better if you could switch shoulders and go back to 1st person if u wanted defiance vibes howd you do this lilith got that mf wagon 235 okay that doublekill and lilliths laught was awesome xd i cant wait to play in 3rd person its all iv wanted for 7 years  dat ass  looks like im finishing the game with lilith again gotta play as lilith thicc does it work in multiplayer so its borderlands but enjoying liliths hotness guess is an evolution an enhancement i dont know why this became a thing now maybe because borderlands 3 will come out but third person mod for borderland came out around 2014 liliths butt is very round help f1 does work it goes to 3rd person but my mouse and keyboard doesnt what do i do help please paladins has up on the dpad to switch between 3rd and 1st person view and honestly i would mind that function in borderlands 3 is it the same problem like on borderlands 2 with the backwards shooting causs its so annoying its like nearly perfect but than this bug and noooo one could ever fix dat shit i dont understand that xs dat ass hi emilio i run gamers on board and gamology on facebook and wanted to know if we could post this video of yours if we give full credit to you and your channel and this game is action rpg now i love this mod i never understood the preference to play shooters in thrid person to be honest this mod is amazing legxordnance works for remaster too but it is in the og borderlands category and from what the creator said all weapon og mods still work for remastered so who the fuck play fps with 3rd person xd we need this in every borderlands huh i like this much more than first person 10 minutes of liliths jiggling ass best minutes of my life what ass i cant use this mod liliths ass shaking is very distracting my eyes just keep going there would love to see this for bl2 and tps does anybody know the eden weapons i dont have the remastered i just have the goty edition i started a new playthrough recently and opened my inventory and was likewhat the hell are these kind of makes getting up to level 10 super easynot that its hard at all but you can basically just loot and sell everything for quite a while still cool that they are adding new shit why couldnt they make them have random parts too i really enjoyed this review the violence is underrated favorite of mine then ill explain my reasons ive been playing as brick going more towards the bombadierblast master setup one of the perks endowed increasing explosive damage i believe the violence with him is so very satisfying pretty much any shot to the body ends up in an explosive bloody mess with the stopping power of a single shot i love the violence with it being underrated it could be improved upon by having a 6 round mag3 standard mag having a scope could bring it up to being one of the best with at least 9597 accuracy very slight boost give the violence a shot its really satisfying seeing enemies explode into a huge bloody mess  how do i get this borderlands 1 remaster i want it because it was my favourite of the three games 2 and the presequel i got them all from the chest directly in front of you after you beat the vault i had to close the game application and go back in fast travel to tartarus then back to the vault i found that if i would get the legendary for whatever weapon i was holding if you like borderlands you should check out therion983 gaming channel how can i like your video if your asking me mere minutes in  i love the violence with brick  yep i will one the people who has a 360 copy and an remastered copy i personally love the silent night ive been wrecking enemies with it throughout my entire playthrough even arch guardians since if you get far enough away from them they stop attacking and stand still one thing i love about the gearbox legendaries is that if you get one of a higher level it is always better since fixed parts but just higher damage the violence revolver actually has a special effect as your health gets lower it does more damage also you can get a guaranteed one of the six gearbox legendaries from the middle chest that spawn after you kill the destroyer also in order for them to respawn use the fast travel point near the entrance of the vault area to a dlc are like the underdome then save and quit then load back in and fast travel back to the vault and all of the chests at the destroyers place will have respawned also the gearbox legendaries also usually scale to your level after you beat the destroyer in the vault youll get 7 loot chests one chest will have a gearbox weapon every time exit the game and go back in the chest will reload hell yeah thats awesome farm skagzilla as well has the dove hornet been confirmed in game of the year edition struggling in my game as brick wondering if i need to use these weapons he sounds like a south park character 1findviolence to be in the top three along with the sniper and sucker punch because the multiplier is x3 meaning it always pocks doing massive damige10002000 damage with one that is level 35 on mordicy i got the sucker punch from skagzilla its awesome i got the hive kind from the middle chest after the destroyer fight thanks man you got the best bl vids hands down really not sure why dps is anything that would be considered when talking about launchers that arent the hive one thing you probably didnt know about the violence revolver when making this vid is that its damage output goes up as your health decreases skagzilla also drops most of these items just a heads up so will your current character data be able to transfer to the enchanted addition dude the violent is one of the best in borderlands wiki it says that violence increase damage if your life reduced you can farm it from the destroyer chest but its using glitch destroyer chest spawns a random gearbox legendary i do play this game a ton for years now lol one thing i find weird is honestly almost all of these guns i have and have gotten them from gun machines check them out as often as possible and be sure to scroll through the guns numerous times they were the first gun on the list not the deal of the day hope this helps thanks for your videos just subscribed i got one from the destroyer today i started 2 new charakters in borderlands 1 remastered but dont get items does this only apply to console or something like this  youre almost guarenteed to get a gearbox legendary in the chests after you kill the destroyer vinylic puma is the kind of man that uses the hawkeye with the hyperion scope do u have ti buy this fame or its in handsome jack collection level 23 speaking how can you run that fast ive been playing borderlands since its conception my favorite weapon being the hellfire usually i come across one per playthrough but i cant get one to drop in the enhanced edition any suggestions specific enemies areas etc i found a bajas bigger hosted at level 19 and im level 40 and ive yet to find a higher damage shotgun to be honest i found the violence to be the best of those weapons especially on a trespass gunslinger mordecai the sweet amount of damage you can do is nice hey ah just quit and save on a dlc map example t bone junk or and other dlc level then fast travel to the vault and the middle chest will always have a gearbox legendary do that infinity my two year old looks for this video to watchlisten when going to take a nap he gets mad when i pick a different video of yours too might be late but i got the sniper in the chests given after the battle with the destroyer cant believe i got the sucker punch and hive mind as my starting weapons id play the game but it wont save the game so what is the point in playing it if you kill the destroyer in playthrough 2 open the boxes you will get at least one of these guns grab the key but do not turn in teleport to any dlc area save the game load the game back up go back to the vault and you will see the boxes still there you can just farm them like so enjoy  you forgot that the destroyer gives 1 guaranteed gearbox legendary weapon and its always at your current level is there not an smg 940 had this happened me a few times like the rocket proyectiles dealing no aoe dmg at all pretty odd i thouth i was the only one having that issue dont remember right now if thats a thing in the old version of bl since they didnt fixed anything with this new release trying rly hard to get over that 10min mark huh iv been playing it ever since it was re released like i did with the old one just saying if the hive minds this powerful they should buff the undertaker the undertakers damage is about as much as the hive minds but way rarer kind of stupid to throw in this new launcher and have it outshine a pearlesent launcher i wish it had challenges like b2 i just got the mugshot from killing the vault boss it was in one of the red chests which surprised me because i was expecting nothing as usual my first new enhanced borderlands character started with the sucker punch and the hive mind launcher to be honest i dont really like either of them especially if you end up starting out with them hive minds ammo consumption and rapid fires is not good in the start of the game subbed pumped for your bl3 content oh man sucker punch on melee zer0 would be amazing or is there something as goodbetter on bl2 i literally just started a zer0 yesterday on my steam version i had been playing xb1 handsome collection version decided to switch to pc now that halo is coming back to pc lol i always play him as a melee build and go with melee weapons where possible i wish there was actual melee weapons that you could equip though not just guns with bayonets and the melee attack but like swords and stuff haha i picked up a baja blaster from skagzilla it was just as i was going from playthrough 1 to playthrough 2 so that shotgun carried me for a while into playthrough 2 a lot of them are rather meh using a key i got the violence pistole at level 11im level 40 right now and its still the most powerful gun i got ive had the revolved the smg and the pistol in the chest want the shotgun the reaper is anything but irrelevant its superior to the sucker punch because of one reason the health regen it practically makes a truxican wrestler mordecai unkillable as long as he keeps attacking he becomes tankier than a melee brick while also possessing more damage you forgot tartarus station and the knoxx dlc loot room as well bahas bigger blaster dropped from a chest in the end of the game for me real question is why we dont get a yoteslaya legendary maybe in borderlands 3 these guns havent appeared in my inventory any ideas what i can do to fix it okay why dont i get any on my new chars best thing about this release is the ability to increased the players field of view what a difference i picked up a copy to take to work with me i work as a flight attendant flying longhaul routes with virgin atlantic the crewcabin on the boeing 7879 has an xbox and a really big tv  does this game not have hit marker sounds wait does the mini map not auto rotate havent played the remaster yet but i was hoping itd be just like bl2 new to the original borderlands question does this mean melee bonus does not effect bricks action skill like krieg like having a melee bonus on a weapon like the rapier for krieg for extra melee damage before action skills are triggered i tried with brick and didnt notice a difference they have shift keys in borderlands are there new codes and old that work it has been so long since i have played that i honestly dont know anything about it besides loot lol is he playing on console or on pc with a controller imo 6violence 5hive mind 4sucker punch 3mug shot 2bahas 1silent night you can just get them from the vault after beating the main game they drop from the destroyer too sadly the majority of the old legendaries still reign supreme i did find most of those weapons in the loot rom from claptrap dlc instead of a ranking im going to rank them i started a new playthrough and pulled mugshot out of the golden chest at lvl10 its still worthwhile and viable even at lvl22 ill probably outgrow it soon but its a great weapon to have early in the game after to kill the boss at the vault the middle chest is 100 chance of random gearbox legendary i cant wait for your channel to explode in september i found the mugshot from skagzilla in a new playthrough carried me all the way through normal what i dont understand is why gearbox didnt make an smg legendary make all other weapons except that wtf lol i got violence from the destroyer and its really good got violence from vault boss gotta disagree on the violence but each to hes own puma i would it give a first place a few things the hive mind doesnt get ammo regen from bricks bombardier com killing skagzilla has a really high chance of getting a gearbox legendary your guaranteed one from the center chest after killing the destroyer and theres a way to get that chest to respawn so its much better to farm them there go to tartarus station or the underdome and save quit then load up your game and fast travel to the vault all of the chests should have respawned the violence is the explosive defiler its insane on brick hey really nice video you seem to have deep knowledge about this game could you perhaps make a video talking about the more subtle changes of the enhanced edition theres a 7 digit number on the side of the mug shot ive found out if you do the vault boss in the vanilla game you have a few chests to open then if you jump to one of the dlc content you can save game and reload and jump back to the vault to reopen the chests up to now it seem to drop one of the six new legendary weapon every time although ive not tested it out rigorously ive never had a gaige character is she good should i try her i need to know and my most reliable source is the community itself did they add guns in borderlands 2 ive been enjoying the game but you never quite know what you took for granted in borderlands 2 and the presequel until youre back to no longer moving in fight for your life in 25 openings i got hive on 2nd key and handgun violence exotic then none sinceso they are level 8s lol joltz found that middle chest of destroyer always has a new gearbox legendary at ur lvl anyone on ps4 i cant figure out how to play with other people let me know or add me psn skillywilly187 i got both the violence and the hivemind when i started a fresh brick and my god the violence is a very satisfying gun goes to show how good the gore was in bl1 that gun carried me for more than 10 levels the shotgun and rocket launcher are the best when i started i got sucker punch and baha shotgun on brick hopefully some of these can partsshare to make unique variants on playthrough 2 the final boss has chests now that guarentee one they reset if you go to a dlc and exit game number 1 the unkempt harold lol i got the hive mind from skagzilla but crawmerax drops one of the new legendaries on each kill sometimes doubles got a the shottie from a mob type enemy keep up the good work puma some of the bosses like skagzilla drop them as well i got a violence on lvl8 and can still use it at lvl 37 lol these can also dropbe found in the final chests after beating the destroyer i got the handsome collection for the ps4 today and i can finally replay bl2 to farm the warrior just beat him collect what you want then die in the lava then once you respawn leave and save them go back and you can fight him again can i transfer my old character from ps3 to the new game on ps4 idk but i used lv17 mug shot and literally whooped everones ass with even eridian guys at lv30 rocket launchers in bl1 are trash i would do a countdown proceeds to do a countdown of the best new guns hey i saw your theory on what zer0 is and something else worth noticing is that when he runs he does not run out of breath oppose to the other characters another thing is that most of his heads are round say while his base one is thin and stretched could he or it shape shift its head also krieg was mutated with an experiment zer0 could well possibly have been experimented with slag to recreate new cells in his body changing the dna which therefore could explain why he appears to have different heads and change the fact that he does not need oxygen to run well thats what it seems like another thing is that when he crouches he has a different crouch stance than other characters this could mean he has experience in karate cobra kia or samurai training also some diolauge he says is my skills are sharp this indicates he or it has some type of traing with someone the last thing worth noticing is that in the missions assasinate the assasins assasin routh has the same crouch stance as zer0 t i thought u died i like the wave an unpopular opinion i know it from isnt very good from a practical stand point but it is pretty fun and its not that unpredictable 1 shotgun 2 rocket launcher 3 assault rifle 4 revolver 5 pistol 6 sniper the sniper is the worst sniper in the game i got the combat rifle from skagzilla the violence reveolver is basically a borderlands version of the mozambique ended up with silent night from a chest after the vault prefect for a sniper mordi i managed to get the hive mind on my first playthrough in the remaster man i remember playing this on my ps3 good times  as someone who is a big fan of the sniper play style i actually prefer medium range scopes they are much more versatile as you can use them as enemies approach you and allows for better awareness of enemies that are more spread out my aim is practiced enough that i can still hit the far off enemies with the weaker zoom ofc you can get the best of both worlds by simply carrying 2 sniper rifles optimized for different ranges and switch between them just keep in mind that sniper rifles often have lengthy swap times anyways just my two cents and nice list as always its an almost guaranteed drop from the middle chest from the vault from what i have noticed the drop from the vault scales to your level got the revolver out of a drop from skagzilla same run that my buddy got a pearlecent shotgun around level 8 ive gotten all of them so far and on brick they all perform very well because of the explosive attribute and melee attributes mug shot and bahas bigger blaster work extremely well with brick i can see how playing mordecai roland or lilith will see lackluster results but they all seem more geared towards the cackling meathead ok so from what i seen hereall the new weapons are really crappy on roland i use the bastard or the serpents on brick i use the orger on morty i use various full auto handguns and on lilith it has to be the double or steel anarchy all the way you know what i did like the content and i will like this video not too hard for me to do when you put this kind of content out new sub as well hi guys d and hi puma i just started playing blps solo what do you think about wilhelm as most people tend to say he is weak also is jack too easy ive tested both but of course i am low level still and jacks skill is basically a cheat button and i dont like that kind of gameplay thats why i suspect i wont like nisha as she doenst even have to aim thanks d how do i find players to play with on steam i struggle to just play solo and it gets boring at times but i love the game i was just womdering on how i could meet randoms and form friendships the destroyer chest also drops a guaranteed one  yall ever just go back to fight nine toes at level 69 to make you feel powerful can anyone help me lvl up on ps4 what is the best dlc in border lands 2 im level 25 ive gotten all 6 of these legendaries just by farming skagzilla ive been curious what do these weapons actually do i started a new character playing lillith and i cant see any use for the guns i got even if they were matching the playstyle does the gearbox manufacturing name have any bonuses that i might be missing i noticed that youre level 69 is that just because thats the level they unlock at or do they level with you and im just missing that going to be honest im one of those people that doesnt understand why games give you special weapons at the very start since youll really quickly replace them instead of making a countdown guys im gonna make a countdown my two freebies with my new lilith was the tk shottie and the hive mind i wasnt sure if they reworked rocket launchers in the game since it actually seemed really good i guess its just that its an exceptional rl i really want that sucker punch though i like high fr repeaters and that stupidly high melee damage modifier is super appealing i love how they dont add an smg but they throw in like 3 pistols people who import characters are pussys dont me fun fact you can animation cancel burst shots with a melee attack lol my first character i got both hive mind and sucker punch believe it or not i actually think these weapons have guaranteed sources to drop i got 6 of the sucker punches from dr need while farming him and i got the baha blaster from badass bruisers hmm they could have taken a smg in as well i keep getting the hive from the fyrestone trunk my fuckin god weapon design definitely improved 500 in borderlands 2 and seems to have imrpoved another 500 in borderlands 3 because b3 weapon design looks about 1000 better than b1 b1s weapon design is really not that goodcool make the class mods show in the skill tree part 3 its the one that he threatened to kill someone if that persons hatchet touches an innocent person part 2 i think he has split personalities and he was talking to his other half part one i just watched the how kraig could be tiny tinas father and the dialogue that you thought that he was a bounty hunter with someone else im going to be sending these in parts because it kicks me from youtube if i tried to do a long message would be nice if i actually got my loyalty weapons still havent and im still pissed about that is the 2player coop still vertical or did they switch to horizontal ive been asking this for days on every page and nobody seems to know i dont want to buy it if its still vertical you also get a guaranteed gearbox gun from the destroyer from one of the loot chests after killing him i dont know if this is standard but when i shoot people with the violence the explosive damage procs twice ive never noticed that on other guns but its pretty neat the reaper heals you on melee attacks its still arguably the best melee weapon so many cool new guns dude i remember now why i stopped watching this channel complains about literally everything no matter how big or small but they fixed the reaper how does the hive mind compare to the undertaker im at headstone mine in the first playthrough and im still using both my legendaries cause i got the hice mind and bahas bigger blaster the violence is farmable from skagzilla got one to drop in my first playthrough when i was farming xp awesome would love to see more lists an guides for bl1 puma this is the most relevent the entire series has been in years i feel like no interesting red text effects you can get all of them from the destroyers chests stop making the same video while i know and understand that this is your opinion i dont agree with your ranking hive mind is definitely 1 but the mug shot is easily the second best gearbox legendary the only other explosive ar in game that out does this outright is ajax spear which is ridiculously hard to farm cause its so rare your right about its scope being kinda shitty but overall this thing is a beast on all characters and makes the game ultra easy with brick i love the fact that ppl is playing borderlands 1 again such a great game the violence reminds me of the bryar pistol i got all of them apart from silent night just from on fresh normal mode playthrough lol im new to borderlands 1 is there a trick to hit criticals or hitting far enemy at all seems like bullet spread works much different from bl 2 and tps method 4 defeat the destroyer at the vault open the middle chest take whatever you want quit to main menu reload your save repeat as needed i have all of the gearbox weapons from this also i did this offline i dont know if it is patched can u do a video ranking every single dlc fromevery borderlands game borderlands one borderlands two and presequal just rank every doc from worst to best i think they should put body dismemberment back into borderlands and ragdoll physics are you going to do videos on borderlands 3 when it comes out i got the sucker punch from the gold key chest in fyrestone at level 20 looks like i got pretty lucky then farm the middle chest in the vault after beating the destroyer its guaranteed to drop one of the new legendaries can you do a video on how to beat crawmerax thanks vpg puma doesnt know about 550 damage combat rifles ie destroyers stompers etc again why do i even come back to this guy 6shotgun 5revolver 4 assault rifle 3sniper 2rocket 1repeater really wish they made a new smg lol craw drops them so much tbh personally i only use the sniper for craw since i dont have bessie the rest i dont really use over my anarchypistols personally i really wish they had variants i made a new character and didnt get ya weapons wtf got violence from destroyer chest on story kill  suckerpunch afects brick action skill  skagzilla is farmable for the new legendarys i extensively played bl2 before picking this up a few years ago the first time i took fall damage was the last time i played lol might try again gearbox and puma know how to piqu my interest ive farmed all 6 from the destroyer chest in the vault middle chest after you loot these chests travel to tartarus station and savequit this will reset the chests rinse and repeat great video anyone else having problems joining people in the game it never lets me join randoms like wtf getting the 2 new legendaries at the beginning you need to have a save of bl2 and pre sequel like someone at this point of life doesnt tho lol i hope they add these in borderlands 3 skagzilla is great as well i got 3 in play through 1 so in a sense these are 6 shit weapons that make no sense would be better if they change the pearl drop rates i lost all of my 75 keys after completing the story i hate zoom on all my weapons in borderlands honestly would prefer iron sights on nearly every gun oh you poor man you dont know that the chest at the vault has a guaranteed gearbox legendary and that it respawns when you defeat the destroyer you get a guaranteed gearbox legendary does this works for when i use my xbox 360 save of the original borderlands game save for xbox one i have lvl 69 roland and lilith but im not sure if the xbox one can read the game data from the 360 version hope this works for playstation 3 4 versions as well so nobody will talk about how lame those new weapons are they were sold as unique and everything its just lazy forced in the game just to push new players to spam golden keys and get them to follow gearbox social media accounts its really sad i started off with number 2 and 1 they are really good weapons tbh i miss bl1 damage scaling where everything didnt 2 shot 90 hp while being super spastic and fast uvhm really kills the fun factor you can get them from the destroyer as well ive been a fan of your videos for a while so im quite curious about yourself and your relationship with the borderlands series for me and maybe some other people itd be fun to see a video about your memories and experiences youve had with it whether its been coop or solo so more or less the impressions that the games have made on you keep up the amazing work d im confused he said if you make a new character youll get two at random but i didnt did you have to complete other borderlands games like 2 presequal and tales from the borderlands cause i know thats a thing that gearbox does reaper is bugged and doesnt provide 300 melee bonus anyway it provides 100 melee healing on melee and 25 fire rate ps there is some way to farm the destroyers chest for the legendaries if i remember they dissapear once you savequit but exiting area trought fast travel and coming back resets them so i opened a standard red chest in bl goty and i got 4 handguns but strange thing is that 2 were common and 2 were legendary what are the odds of that i have 4 so far i have these on pc rocket launcher hive mind 2 pistol sucker punch x2 sniper silent night x1 shotgun bahas bigger blaster x1 ive been getting mine with the gold keys the violence is a solid revolver whilst levelling up i have a level 46 one and im one and two shotting level 50 enemies however as end game its pretty trash the violence is best revolver for levelling 69 hahahqhq xd omg no hate on vinylic got the worst two  excited and loving the remaster but i find these to be poor excuses for legendaries while legendaries in bl1 were no were as crazy as the got in 2 or tps they still had something unique and strange about them to bring to the table even blues and purple uniques manage to posess such traits however these legendaries are either superirorweaker version of one gun or just a good shotgun etc nothing really unique about them at all well at least they kill i feel like now the we gonna have some new comers to b2 and 1 so your chanel will be usefull does the sucker punch or any melee bonus weapon for that matter apply its melee bonus to bricks action skill started with 1 and 2  i disagree with your ranking i think the sniper is 1 rockets were never very good in the first game so not widely used youre not always going to risk getting close for melee the silent night is better for early late game will outperform any other sniper because of its inherent 800 critical bonus admittedly the scope has a smaller zoom but thats also a good thing as you will have an easier time hitting enemies that get closer to you making this rifle more versatile the fire rate on my mugshot is 11 short scopes are way better than long zoom scopes crawmerex yeah man people dont appreciate my qualities as a raid boss all they do is farm me its really degrading why does the top left of my mini map always have a custom waypoint even though ive never placed one i was hoping many of the original bugs and issues would be fixed the claptrap in old haven must have glitched through the floor for me as the icon on the map was there without clappy being present why cant they fix these issues and bugs with the borderlands games i just dont get it ive gotten to level 42 on my first complete run of bl1 ever that friggin explosive revolver is good as fuck got it from the final boss at around level 32 and it still oneshots most basic enemies and takes down bosses easily the silent night seems to be a good alternative to the bessie got a hive mind launcher from the golden chest at like level 10 and was like what still using it at level 26 and with rolands perks i dont run out of ammo watch that splash damage though borderlands remastered really exceeded my expectations another great loot spot the tartarus chest room after finish the dlc still havent gotten my legendaries or keys at all even tho i did everything that epic shill said to i am upset af im pretty sure the shotguns name is a reference to the mountain dew flavor baha blast  350 can you snipe a person with an ar or smg not hyperion like that in bl2 i find it difficult to get any sort of accuracy in bl2 and mediumlong range without using a sniper i hope bl3 is more bl1 in a sense noob friendly bahas bigger blaster is amazing im level 40 and still using a level 20 and it shreds i think your problem aiming with the lower zoomed scopes is that your using a controller silly console kids this game reminds me of 2009 and cage the elephant so bascically brick can oneshot and onepunch most of the enemies now didnt even realize i had the violence and silent night in my inventory lol thanks i got bahas shotgun really early and being like lv18 its takes out any thing thats a higher level i took out sledge in just a few seconds come on really my favorite one is your least favorite again you and i have very conflicting taste puma edit ah nvm should have watched a little further sorry ok but get those lance cores v i am having so much fun going back to this remaster the new legendary starter pistol you got was pretty damn good an dope been a fan for quite awhile through the ups and downs but listening to this vid i swore i heard you smile hell yeah puma finally happy to see you back in action with your famous gun reviews keep up the good work i totally agree on the sniper rifle it could use a better scope but otherwise its a great gun specially for the beginning wanna know whats funny i started a new character and got both the hive mind and the sucker punch got the sucker punch from the giant skag in the dahl headlands if you bought borderlands 1 in steam it will transform into borderlands goty and a new added game to your library borderlands goty enhanced can you do a playthrough for borderlands 3 or a livestream i really like the scope effects they added in how does it feel to finally have new content to talk about vpg  i got the sucker punch the day the remaster released from the last chest after defeating the destroyer on pt2 i found it pretty good to use on enemies that get close and dont use firearms like psychos and zombies from jakobs cove the 500 melee damage is nice in those close quarters situations and is a good apology that makes up for the reaper thanks for the list bro im turning 14 tomorrow and for my birthday my dad is getting me this game because im a huge fan of the borderlands series has anyone else playing borderlands goty on consoles having a problem every now and again not being able to do or complete missions it first happened to me in the catch a ride mission then again when doing moe and marley mission they never spawned now it happened again on a bounty mission to find a guy i forget his name i bought the have two days ago and i didnt get any legendaries or keys my friend did though and we game share on ps4 just curious but does sucker punch or any melee weapon work with the phaseblast melee 844 he says that the game hi is playing is bl2 remastered i just had mugshot drop from skagzilla so they drop from him at least also the destroyer gives one as well i spawned with the sniper and auto pistol playing though my first time as mordecai the first like 8 levels were super easy i kinda wanna throw up at the thought of them putting a launcher in and no smg bl1 smgs are forever the goat youre not supposed to use the sights with the violence  i guess i was lucky when i made my first new character in the remaster i got the hive mind and sucker punch to start with updated versions of your bl1 countdowns using the new remaster please and thank you my loading screen for the enhanced edition has white and black lines is the reaper fixed  also the at destroyer area the red chest dirrectly in front of you when you spawn has a garrented gearbox legendary weapon and it always refreshs after save quit dont you get a garented one front the destroyer are you sure you can get one of these legendary from when starting a new charcter either ive missed something or ive never seen them can you just randomly have one of these in your inventory or something im a bit confused woah talk about luck i started my new lilith with your ranked 1 and 2 new legendaries  theres currently a glitch that lets you farm all of these gearbox weapons infinitely tutorial on my channel strange questiondo these nw guns scale or level with the player skagzilla drops silent night and violence curiosity hybrid legendaries still exists in the remaster aka ajax ogre dove hornet bone shredder savior etc and any of the new legendaries can spawn with parts from another legendary i dont need i dont need it i need it 457 the what  i wonder how many weapons that were glitched out in the original borderlands were fixed with the enhanced edition i know for a fact that the clipper works properly now wait a minute so instead of doing a top 6 list he decided to just rank them like you do in a top 6 list just saying violence is one of the highest tested burst dps in the game tips for any newbies do a reveiew on a different game please im going to get these babies i like the silent night they need a chest that upgrades your favorite weapon to your current level make it rare or hard to use perhaps once per play through a low level legendary is useless and disappointing during a run made a new brick game and started with sucker punch and hive mind yesterday pretty much perfect would love to see gear and build guides for roland and brick nice video very helpful 17th comment bring back vulgar puma do these level with you whos been here since vpg had 1000 subscribers i think you also have a high chance to get one of the new legendary guns from the middle chest in the vault 8th catch a rideeeeeeeeeee ive been asking all over but does the remastered version of this game add a third and repayable playthrough like uvhm in borderlands 2 did they by any chance make the original legendaries have actual drop locations when will you address the jewish question this is my 37th petition im watcher 0 awesome thanks for the info i personally love the violence on brick whats the point of leaving in the last 9 minutes of the video learn to trim your content instead of lying i dont understand i downloaded the enhanced version and im still in first person how do i get into third person view how to get the custom binds mod works but only two buttons works one to switch between 1st person to 3rd and the aim button any help i installed the mod from nexus and placed the files in the ini folders and it isnt working for me can you do support for some reason i get like really bad fps drops with my 1050 ti ryzen 5 1600 8gb ddr4 ram anyone know why this guy was running 128 frames i run like 4060 i have 144hz monitor and stuck with 50hz v sync off frame rate unlimited seems like gpu load is not perfect i see 67 load sometimes game has some huge franedrops on my rtx 2070 with an i7 and 16g vram does this game have physx settings like in borderlands 2 the hype for borderlands 3 is real borderlands 2 is now 10th in the steam charts its always been popular though it has has so much content and amazing dlc  fps is high on 1080p because graphic is exactly same except textures gtx 1050 ti wins guessing a 1050ti should not be a good buy in 2019 incredible movements the weapons animations incredible character as it is noted that destiny was copied 1000 of borderlans thank you for this video and timestamps this game microstutter like shit and gsync doesnt work just because im seeing many of the same question asked over and over ill consolidate any potential fixes ive left as replies to people here im calling anything that people have listed as a resolution to an issue as potential your experience may vary every method is separated by potential initialization errors fixes find your borderlandsgotyenhanced executable thatll likely be by default cprogram files x86steamsteamappscommonborderlandsgotyenhancedbinarieswin64 or if you have it saved off your main drive something like in my case ssteamlibrarysteamappscommonborderlandsgotyenhancedbinarieswin64 right click properties compatability toggle to run as admin launch game through the exe if you have a program called spacedesk may want to uninstall why it would cause an issue is beyond me though add borderlandsgotyenhancedexe to your antivirus or windows defender exceptions uni any idea how to change the language my game is stuck in japanese or something i found willowengine and changed languageger to eng instead ni change though i am looking for a solution for the game not launching any fix for this my game works perfect for an hour or so and then starts to slowly lag more and more is this also solved with this solution  for me the game doesnt render at all i dont even know if im impacted by the issues you mentioned in the video  i have a problem with my game that i cant seem to find anywhere else my game launches fine and runs perfectly fine but whenever i play it says that i am not connected to the internet and i dont have the ability to play with friends or edit online options i am connected to the internet and it works perfectly fine with bl2 and the original bl1 thanks for the fix me and my friends had horrible rubberbanding when playing in coop how did you get borderlands enhanced to broadcast to obs now i want fix for sh1tty fps on intel hd graphics but what with initialization error please ensure the game files have not been corrupted or moved pls help my game launches then dousnt respond i i cant fix it please help my game doesnt wanna start when i start the game it says initialization error please ensure the game files have not been corrupted or moved i have tried verifying steam cache but it seems it has something to do with the document my issue is that it doesnt save my configurations they get resetted every time i open the game i tried setting the file as readonly but it didnt work am getting the general protection fault error i cant even boot the game if i launch from steam it gives me a steam must be running in order to launch borderlands goty i launched from steam wtf fucking awesome dude saved my whole game experience before turning off the viop the game was unable to play in coop my game shows that the game folders may be moved or coruptted heres a helpful tip or two for anyone that needs help if youre using a laptoppc and you are unable to choose your preferred graphics via the borderlands goty enhanced launcher eg you have intel hd620 amd m430 graphics etc launching the main borderlandsgotyexe file via the installation folder you chose for it this should force the better graphics to be used for some reason the launcher can default to the hd intel graphics and thats the way ive bypassed that also the intel hd graphics being default can sometimes make the entire screen be black and no graphics will show up and youll only hear the game intro sounds and game sounds with no visuals so if you have a proper secondary graphics make sure to use the shortcut as a workaround that issue also if you are having trouble playing with your steam friends and it will not allow you to add them to your game start a game with public mode turned on then make them find you via browsing matches to then make sure  mine not launching  i have problems that steam doesnt want to open the game and if i open it from the folder the save game is not working  im getting mistyeyed watching you play this classic like the new approach to this game and the dlcs does he have his grenades bound to the w key all the times i chucked the clipper who knew nice new tactics thumbs up bottle of wine feeling fine andreas tanks good to know on the clipper nine toes was clipping his toenails and made a boo boo the electrical moemarley takes forever to kill he opens and shuts his mouth very quick and moves it fast so you cant critical hit especially from sniping distance helluva walkthrough as usual major slack kudos beat all the dlcs already but thanks for the info cant wait for general knoxx slacks the man with the plan always using that brain great job boss thumbs up  your nine toes strategerie worked great for me and i also got one of the skags for free really looking forward to seeing the alpha skag strategy in the lost cave great stuff learning a lot here shoot em up slack did you hear new borderlands 2 dlc coming out on june 9th and it will be free it will fill the gap between borderlands 2 and borderlands 3 2nd yay slack 1st for the slack keep the videos coming will u be doing bl3 build videos when it releases borderlands is my fav game good to know you fuck with it too what i do is i take out the turret from the starting point with a corrosive sniper it chews through it then just push up to get the key respect for your witch jump skills even with so much going on you still manage to land them holy crap ps how does the 20k xp challenge reset works why do you aim up with shotgun when you shoot could have got sub 25 if he didnt mess up the car junp at 5810 how does he fast travel at the start and ive played to talk give and never heard of tbone junction i noticed that this run isnt on speedruncom the record is still held by you but it is 5 years old when you saved quit at 2330 and reloaded why did it spawn you in skag gully and not back at fyrestone what were you doing with the medkits buying and selling very curious 2354 is this a tas dam lilith wants that vault how do you get the gap between title timer and splits on live split like that also what font are you using i love this game and i love this loved it are you aware that there are new missions available at the fyrestone bounty board how can you reload your weapon so fast good video the original 126 speedrun taught me some new tricks this one is just as good 925 why are you buying and selling medkit do much this is the reason i started practicing speedruns lately keep it up big like when mom says you only have 2 hours to play any reason you dont use intuition for the movespeed great just fycking great one of these showed up said not interested and of course yt go oh maybe he wants to see one of 900000000 identical videos fuck this shitty website great game great run good job u can do this sub 120 i reckon 4425 that added some time now without sell glitch what computer do you use do you like bl1 or bl2 more ive always liked the 1st so much more would be nice to fast travel within the dlc though did you used weapon merge in this speedrun i did this game on my own since no one want to play with me but im glad i complete the game with all of four characters plus achievements with extra helper from my extra controllers sigh do you think that borderlands 3 will be pay to win borderlands 1 is much better for speedruning instead of borderlands 2 where you can cheat almost everything can i ask you how many time you started new game because i think you wanted the sniper and shotgun duo p week ago i saw old speedrun but this is much better i am truly amazed thats really insane good job much love 3 even in a speedrun you always have the time to paint your car pink 5953 phsyco ahh shit here we go again hes agdqready folks do a run with commentary personally enjoy hearing about information on the run and how exploits work etc keep it up though  the healing kit strat is the best is there no longer a frame perfect jump at the beginning of the run why do you buy and sell those med kits repeatedly i miss the old angel she was way more majestic borderlands 1 have goty in original release your goty isnt it borderlands goty enchanced very very interesting stop playing games your aim is shit why lie about graphics comparison yes it has new features but literally side by side they are nearly identical extremely dishonest comparison original is running at minimum settings this is not how you do a comparison and the remaster has enough enhacements that it doesnt need gross bias to make it look good this is clickbait at best bl3 release date sep 13 2019 if you want to play a borderlands game before three skip the first one and play bl2 bl1 isnt as good and the story isnt as important as the atmosphere and the humor nikka you spent 130 mins before getting to the point of the video jesus dont call it goty edition when theyre both called that the remaster is the enhanced version cant wait to play this when i get home in july how many subs did you have when you was playing mhw the handsome jack collection is a better deal get all 3 games1 2 and the pre sequel it has a fov slider now wooo why are the settings on the original put on low for these comparisons clips 1 252 2 311 3 327 4 334 5 342 6 349 7 411 8 423 9 436 10 438 11 446 12 454 i just booted up my copy of the game for the xbox 360 and the textures there look way better than the ones you showed there the settings were intentionally put on low thats very dishonest man mind explaining a bit imo angel image looks out of place and would prefer the original ultra settings on pc version are almost the same than the remaster this video is liying dont compare low vs ultra the original looks better the only thing that sucks in this game is the map so why put a new mini map when its long since this game came out on ps4 pro the intro audio spoken words and the awesome intro song is extremely low quality it sounds like satellite radio or an mp3 from the 90s once i got further in the game the audio became less noticeable i had a complete download so it wasnt like a minimum viable game download set aside from the poor audio the visual and quality of life improvement makes this a mustown i hope anyone can answer me probably a dumb question but why cant we play borderlands games split screen on pc the original is not running at max settings its an unfair comparison it was not necessary to put the original in minimum  wow im getting this bought borderlands handsome collection two weeks ago but havent played it yet now i get to play 1 2 pre sequel 3 in that order the original still looks excellent the comparisons are unfair the original graphics settings were set to low you turned down the originals graphics i need this so badly but i have exams very soon can you do a borderlands 2 uhd vs normal the original settings are not on ultra fake news why do you have at the very least the textures set to low are you intentionally trying to make the goty edition look significantly better than it is im not saying that it doesnt look better but you are for certain not running the original on ultra disliked edit this comparison video is useless other than to show the hud changes like the minimap i wonder if they fixed the sensitivity problems on the original pc release ill try this out right away when the free update drops the new textures and qol changes are cool and all but gimme back my angel i mean youre not supposed to know shes an ai until you see the satellite at the end plus the actress did a great job and looks way better so its a shame they are replacing her with some kinda weird looking holo face also youre definitely not running the original on max settings because the game looks way better than that so the graphics comparison is kinda pointless hey what the hell hes showing the original game on very low graphics it doesnt look that bad in fact the difference is quite small im more excited for this than i was for the original handsome collection  i love the character customization could i trade in my borderlands disk and addon disk xbox 360 for the goty version on xbox one wtf what is that original graphic configuration very low xd remastering looks pretty nice might be time to jump back to the beginning looks like they got rid of the gore or decreased it significantly of course you guys like the old angel you refuse to look without nostalgia lol it used to be so cringey this looks great now if we can just get 2k to not release bl3 with a 6 month exclusivity deal with epic games what the hell versions were you using again because i do not remember these textures being that god damn blurry 334 sorry but im calling this video out if this is suppose to be the pc version and does anyone know if they added an fov slider to the games damn options now so its the 3rd and i cant find the goty edition anywhere is it for ps4 i cant find it anywhere i cant wait for tomorrow and bl3  wow it looks great cant wait for tomorrow  why the original version has the graphics at minimum curious how many actually care about graphics so cant wait to get this hopefully they have a copy at gamestop lol what did you do run the original on potato settings it never looked that bad aww it looks like how my nostalgia remembers it 3 i cant wait im going to pretty much replay all of them didnt they make the handsome jack collection though epic store time exclusive no refund no question ask so if i have this on steam i can upgrade for free i dont have a ps4 pro will it still look different from what it did 10 years ago the original lilith looks better for the rest the remastered is better borderlands 1 is still my favorite borderlands gives me a reason to replay it on pc holy shit this is an improvement i got into the series on 2 and had got 1 awhile back when it was on sale so looking forward to jumping into the first game and playing through it with the updated graphics lots of major improvements in comparison but i can also see some people not liking the new look out of nostalgia and liking the original state i love the game series but gearbox what are you doing to angel the original is better all players know the origual art has a mistery and feels better in context when you think that is a power a noisy video with static feels better could have atleast compared the same settings the original is obviously not even on med or high i just loaded it up today and it looks nowhere as bad as this but did they add a fov setting the same goes for borderlands 2 right like if you already have it you get the handsome edition for free ive started in borderlands 2 i look forward to playing this and doing a seriesathan up to borderlands 3 your graphics settings for original are at low oh nonnnnnooooooooooo angel what did they do to you so you can bring forward your old saves just like on borderlands 2 if so that is awesome news ok so i played 2 i liked it was thinking about getting 3 should i get this one or should i just wait till 3 the original clearly has all graphics settings set to low this is not a fair comparison but what about the fov slider this is a good remaster dunno why people liked the original angel but everything looks so much better its not just an upres a couple of questions from someone who has never played a bl game 1 is this game solo player friendly 2 whats the level of replayability so does this goty edition come as a free update to the handsome jack collection or whats the go im not really seeing any information anywhere about pricing im in new zealand the reason im asking is because on the psn store i dont see borderlands 1 goty edition on there i only see it for the ps now is this only borderlands 1 or does it come with 2 as well what edition should i buy if i want to play all the saga with hd and spend the less money as possible thx is it releasing at 12 am ive got and played borderlands 2 but ive never played the original borderlands a quick look online and i bought it for a fiver today ill wait for the update before getting stuck in honestly like the new angel more i know people like the og but she now looks more like the bl2 version i kinda prefer the original angel tbh wouldnt it be wild if borderlands 3 dropped tomorrow like a demo maybe either way im so excited for borderlands goty and borderlands 3 the king is back if i own regular borderlands 1 on steam without dlc do i still get the free upgrade for the remaster damn that scene with the tires is basically a summary of the massive improvements this version of the game got from extremely low res 360 textures to currently acceptable ones no ambient occlusion etc to everything and the kitchen sink hell even the gun was improved really arekkz i respect you bro but showing borderlands2009 at the left with the lowest graphic settings possible for the sake of making the remaster look like a damn miracle is misleading arrekz and i shoul point it out because its not fair to make the orginal borderlands looks like craps just to make the remaster stand out i want it and all the changes played borderlands to death and it will be good to see some changes change things up especially when you been playing for years awesome video thanks brother i hate that they removed dismemberment again at times where ultra realistic mk11 is around you can use hdr on pc games gotta get that last little bit of money before bl3 gg cell shade ages well so does this mean if people buy the original now theyll get the goty edition for 20 practically pc master race lol thats funny the manual ammo picking bothered me for years such a small change but soooo welcome so you want to hear a story ehhh cool now lets get real and show comparison with borderlands 1 set to max not this minimal setting arekkz have you got any idea on the price for the uk i cant find one anywhere will it be available for digital download 334 he has definitely lowered the graphics the old game has never looked that shit and you can look at multiple comparison videos between both versions and i played the 360 edition so it wasnt just consoles i like everything except the new angel it seemscheaper somehow like its just a quick effect used strange but i prefer the older look 300 original is way better here  there is no gore in the original enemies heads would explode with that shotgun who do we follow on twitter for keys also i preferred old angel arekkz you crazy dude thanks to you ive been inspired to create my own channel and have been enjoying it all the way im still tiny but even so i really enjoy making my videos i just wanted to say thanks for the inspiration and keep up the good work bro im too hyped to replay a game i already played to death god i fucking love this franchise is there an fov slider or do i still need to set a hotkey f epic games ruining everything sorry to break the dream of everybody in the chat borderlands 3 comes out september 13th i think and its going to be time to exclusive with epic piece of s games borderlands is a perfect game for switch has couch co op and everything jesus does the original borderlands really does looked like that i am starting to doubt thats ultra settings cus all textures looks super low wow i gotta admitthis remastered really did the game justiceall of the textures look straight out from bl2 which is super good but i do agree with people calling out angel looks much better on the orignal does goty add any sort of auto run holding down w for mins while traveling sucks carpal tunnel is a thing does anybody know if all the dlc will come with it or will it be separate those are not the original ultra graphics the fuck are you on about i just need to know if the console version specifically has an fov slider someone teach ubisoft how to remaster tell them this is how you do it ive upscaled borderlands to 4k on my laptop and use nvidia inspector for graphic tweaksthe only significance this update will have is the texture resolution will be of much larger size and the shadows in game are not the usual jaggie 1024x1024i tweak them in the ini file and input 4096x4096 but edges still are jaggie sometimesnot bad for a game that was based on dx9 and a engine from 2009 only thing i want to know is if there is a fov slider on this one on pc og didnt had one in game youre running original at lower resolution with no antialiasing or anisotropic filtering incredibly dishonest how do you have 1mil subs how are you sponsored i guessing borderlands 3 will release in september 13th maybe epic exclusive thats what ive heard i really wish they were doing the free thing on consoles i own both the original and the handsome jack collection on xbox one classic angel is better  isnt this gamestop exclusive were the console ports really that bad holy hell so correct me if i bought it on steam i can upgrade it kinda liked the old angel transmissions better they felt more personal then a robot holo if this video shows anything its that original borderlands was already really well made especially for its time wow i hate the new angel screen it looks so cheap and weird it also just doesnt for in at all with the athstetic it looks like something i could make in photoshop in minutes the original was far better you set it to low or somehtign and disabeld af lmfao i booted up the old one last few days as saves can be transferred and the 2009 edition looks infinitely better than what you show xd this will have online multiplayer so i can play with friends right just curious cause they didnt mention anything of online for the remaster i tried to pre order at gamestop and they told me they already stop taking them why make it a gamestop exclusive if they cant match demand for it i ended up ordering it off the 2k wtf why u set textures on low in 2009 version sorry i have to report your channel for misleading when will the borderlands1 remaster be available i cant find it on amazon or anywhere else is there a fov slider in the goty edition on consoles like there was in the handsome collection when i didnt bought all the dlcs back in the day and just got borderlands without any dlcs will i still get goty for free or do i need all the dlcs i think im going to have to pass on the first game it was awful to me so damn boring i never did beat it even with friends i played bl2 a lot more and beat it a few times though ive been playing the switch for so long that 60fps looks truly amazing to me lol i really hope you can keep the old angel while using the new graphics the angel from bl2 was one of the things that always bugged me because it just doesnt fit the art styleespecially the moment you actually meet her in person and she looks obviously way different to what that recording looks like aint hyped about this at all the footage of the original is it on pc if so why is everything on the lowest settings if not then the xbox360 version looks like shit its not even this bad on ps3 borderlands is cell shading you cant make bad graphics look better using cell shading imo i could never enjoy this game who else started playing bl2 again lol tk baha in 4k is 3 also are old saves loadable sheesh what is the original running on literally on x360 because im pretty sure it didnt look that bad on pc is the new texture patch only for console how about pc  ive not played this is it worth buying the new one probably one of the best games ive played forgot how bad the original looks is it 60fps for console honestly i prefer the original look of when angel talks to you but still cant wait to play it again  when will borderlands 2 get a graphics upgrade okay this actually looks totally worth it i cant wait for this because borderlands 1 is a huge nostalgia trip for me i definitely cant wait to play this coop with friends does you know if the people that got the handsome jack get i free or will we still have to pay they forgot to make this epic exclusive god damn it they have 1 job im not sure if i like the new angel it seems a bit too pixellated to me and honestly i just feel like the old one looked better fov slider though i really like that they added a lot more color to the hud plus i forgot how awful the console ports looked they basically added a filter for the first bit have it got physx too that eyecandy would be nice the one thing im not looking forward to when going back to borderlands 1 is the aiming and gunplay being a bit worse im ready to put in a heap of hours again though i can not wait for tomorrow do you get this for free if you have the handsome collection cant wait until tomorrow lol remember roland damn i forgot how the 360 version looked i want to pre download so its ready for tonight but it not in the psn store yet wtf nigga havent played this game since i was like 7 now im 15 and i repurchased it on my 1500 geforce pc stg a couple decent add ons but i will stick with willowtree does this work on cracked game i was playing this game legit but then i met crawmerax does this lock steam achivements thank you first time playing a borderlands game really struggling first play through this helped tremendously great video man glad youre uploading again  its good to have you back 3 for some reason the borderlands handsome collection doesnt have an enhanced patch even though on xboxs website it says it does im telling you now i only just realised this was in hdr with a 4k upgrade just recently now ive got a pro s and an x ive played on the s on a 4k monitor yet played the same game on an oled on my x and pro they all look gorgeous and the hdr here is what makes this game stand out like a comic book on acid unless you have the technology to pick apart each and every frame of the game you are not gonna know any difference looking forward to the latest installment i would rather locked 30fps every game with increased visuals and 4k all the time then trying to hit 60fps and sacrificing visual quality for it not worth it ur playing on a controller and on a tv the response time is shit compared to pcs anyways barley make a difference you will feel the drops more the if it was locked at 30fps its been months and they still havent fixed the screen tearing or audio bugs what the hell hat about switch bro what about switch thats only 80 the xbox one x and the ps4 pro may be the biggest scam in all of gaming im loving the remaster at the moment yeah but im still not buying borderlands 3 until it drops on steam i was expecting a xbox 360xbox one comparison to really see the diference but looking good it has a memory leak that you never mentioned freezes constantly on regular xbox 1 im on the x screen tearing is unbearable fov slider probably being the culprit shadows do not look better lol im many of the cases shown they seem to be missing entirely ex 120 original on left and remaster on right unless hes got those labels backwards omg the tearing its just distracting sigh when will any kind of developers gonna learn to properly optimize their games so they wont have any kind of screen tearing hey could you perhaps compare the handsome collection between the ps4one prox and pc before and after texture update im really curious what the differences are jaguar cores for the win xd pc mustard race was here i missed something or the base consoles was ignored the tearing on the x is much worse than this video makes out im playing side by side with my gf on a standard one and the x tears more often plus the online lag is pretty terrible too they should upgrade it to ue4 engine if they havent cuz arent both still on ue3 yes lets see handsome collection please the fact that this isnt on the switch yet is criminal but ill wait for it when it eventually comes out because ive got a backlog the size of yo momma on my switch too many games too little time this is like steam 20 call me a fire breathing fanboy but hot damn that remaster is lit af at least on the x best 30 ive ever spent i say the review does not stress test the consoles as later on the weapons get even more particles and enemies come in more quantity and with more particles as well this was the most porrly made digital foundry videoever certainly that ive ever seen such low quality and frankly incomplete comparisons that im frankly dumbfounded ps4 pro is fake im loving it on my ps4 so why it is so hard to implement hdr on pc you think pc gamers dont have hdr screens you guessed wrong i mainly play on pc on my 55 lg oled e6 and many pc games have proper hdr implementation that just works there are no excuses here not everyone just plays on a desk with a cheap ass small monitor since borderlands 2 has vita version its just matter of time i think when the switch version wil come 113 512 you made a small mistake here the samples at 113 are inverted you showed lastgen footage as this gens i added this marker 512 so you could tell is it really a surprise for anyone that a borderlands game runs like crap so freesync is going to a big benefit for the xbox one x 125 what a ripoff downgrade anyone runs like ass on pc my 1080 ti cant keep a locked 120fps will there be a hard copy to purchase cant see it anywhere on amazon uk store  does the pc version of the remaster have split screen support the original borderlands ran like shit on amd cards back in the day to the point where borderlands 2 while still not perfect ran much better so i guess any improvement to that is an improvement awesome breakdown man i was looking more for features that may have changed but this is really indepth much appreciated someone needs to tell this guy that he is putting pc tested on the title of the video with barely any pc footage at all about time they put this on currnet hardware oh well its kind of difficult to buy it now after already buying the triple pack on ps3 in 2015 not even gonna mention the new fmvs p talk about hellblade on switch in portable mode while i am enjoying the 4k hdr upgrade ive never seen so much screen tearing in a console game does pc have split screen too digitalfoundry have you guys noticed large frame drops when multiple tooltipsitem cards pop up from equipment drops how does a 10 year old game not manage 4k have a feeling next gen is going to be a disappointment at this point unless the ps5 playing all backwards titles is actually true then im sold on next gen i never liked the ps4 instead of making the pro why sony couldnt have made the ps4 more powerful in the 1st place that could avoid the stupid pro version and make things more easy for devs every ps1ps2 and ps3 had the same hardware that play the same games with the same graphicsresolution and frame rate every ps4 hadnt the same hardware this gen is pos its been fun but the connectivity to families and friends isnt happening and they still aint fixed it dont you guys hate it when you see gameplay of people aiming down the sights even though the enemy is so close theres no way theyre gonna miss the shot pff adaptive vsync is good only when the framerate never dips below the refrash rate which kinda defeats the point of using that instead of normal vsync in the first place d so i actually have another comparison that no one seems to be using if you take the original console versions everything but the characters and enemies looked horrible backgrounds were blurry and out of focus textures were bad and framerate was atrocious everyone seems to be focusing on ps4 pro vs xbox one x here where if you compare these consoles to the older consoles 360 and ps3 youll see drastic improvements all across the board the pc version looks fantastic it already did so aside from 4k theres not much difference there so imo this edition is really for console users to be able to play and see the game the way it was originally intended and not the garbles low texture mess that was the 360 and ps3 versions they should wait to release borderlands 3 for the ps5 screentearing with frame drops on the pro one x high resolutions mean nothing if graphics and performance are broken why does the xb1x have less head bob than the other versions not a complain the more head bob the more i want to puke so if the xb1x has less head bob or lets you turn it off then id be really interested in picking this one up since i never got far into it since it made me motion sick broken matchmaking on the greatest loot coop game ever getting tired of release shit for a quick buck then fix later wow you did not even talked about the 40fps drops on the pc version everytime you approach any little village due to being a single thread game 120 the original looks better with shadows the remaster is just brighter but has zero shadows wtf seriously look at the loss of shadows on the character with the brown hood and goggles forgot his name is this out already they couldve just enhanced it on xbox 1 x when was pc tested ive watched full video but i dont see it just curious how it performs just what i wanted to seeand what i thought you wouldnt do like let it die need tessellationbumpmapping terrible graphics i got the original pc game of the year version this game is brutal original looks better why is the remasted missing dynamic shadows and all characters and guns 4k60fps on xbox one x nice and i only paid 400 is the gift that keeps on giving  no shadows showing on the players gun in bl1 update it will be good that you had the resolution for each console and the min max res if they use dynamic resolution on the top right corner boycott gearbox devs dont care about x1 anymore thats bs no mention of how dark and washed out it looks on console like all backwards compatible games do odd they fixed that problem in b2 handsome collection by over contrasting everything so much so that the guardian angels face is sometimes hardly visible they left this one though and its impossible to make it pop like on last gen consoles and pc you got to love the x  ive been playing this on xbox x its got some pretty bad screen tear in certain locations hopefully it gets some patches soon really just want it on switch put the original versions on there every platform except mac got the update for bl2 cant play with my one friend anymore hes on mac because the two version are incompatible now which is a complete bummer 110 the original looks so much better unbelievable maybe this is a bug and the shadows on the characters are missing did you guys get paid to make this video lol console barely keeping 1080p on a 10 year old game if youre playing co op and youre not the host its locked at 90fps its a blind squirrel remake so its not surprising just look at the bodge job they did with the bioshock collection infinite has stutter issue and the first two look better on last gen ill stick with bl1 with backward compatibility on the x xbox one x always wins great video tom the only issue for me is that i still cant join any matches online ive been able to play with my buddy twice but even then we had to rejoin and leave over and over my wallet is not compatible with screen tearing ive tried it just doesnt work im loving this port experienced the original on ps3 now im experiencing it properly with 100fps gsync and ultra wide  is physx still avaible in this edition on pc fluids and lots of particles  not problems on one sxboth best consoles today in respective price tag thanks to freesync supportno mention df sony ashamed they called it goty i believe to get around licences they already had a goty years ago what about ps4 pro with 1080p display without ss this seems like a pretty poor port for consoles tbh it runs great on pc but its kinda sad how it has barely at all improved assets from the ps3360 versions and yet it cant maintain a 1080p60 on current gen dynamic resolutions and tons of screen tearing all over yikes 113 did they just straight up removed shadows here why it looks so much worse in remaster what about pc vs consoles with regard to physx i remember the barrels spilling out loads of stuff on pc but it not happening on consoles i noticed some occasions of the framerate tanking on pc in the starting area i was getting drops as low as 30 fps i dont know why thats happening as i have a gtx 1070 installed it is great to have games with splitscreen was at old haven and was getting drops down to like 5fps restarted and went back up to 5560 at 4k with a 6700k and 980ti ps4 pro wins again  wait the console versions still have the interior shadows on the bus looks and runs fantastic on one x in 4k hdr shows again that blind squirrel games is bad at optimizing is it just me or is there a box that cuts off the text and stuff  where the heck is four players split screen on the pc version gearbox still waiting lol console gamers are still playing at inferior frames and graphics on a game from 2009 tom is again not testing the pro in 1080p especially in this case it wouldve made sense to test this to see if it clears up the dropstearing why is this game cost 30 should have cost 5 dollar since its an old game 1800p on the pro hmmm i may buy it anyway since save for pc i have it for ps3 360 and xbox one x wish it had the textures from handsome jack collection but maybe theyll take feedback and fix this some more not sure why any of these boxes has tearing if the game is using dynamic rez the whole point of dyn rez is keep the frames consistent this game needs patches how original can someone testconfirm if its 60fps in 2 player split screen ive heard it only jumps to 30 in 34 player split screen in the handsome collection and thought it might be similar in the bl1 remaster i buy it on switch my mates and i tired to play coop on pc the other day and it was trash so much lag regardless of who hosted  err what happened to shadows im happy to have a pro for that 1440p since thats my monitors resolution so im happy lame lazy disappointing good video though df keep it up  use freesync tvs to help console players work the very few dips of fps i think its just an old engine and just going back to play this is awesome i love playing the remaster of the first borderlands theres a lot of ways the upgrade looks worse all of the shadows on the bus for character select are gone some of the guns look worse with less shadows and wierd material lighting etc too bad the pc port is rubbish and tons of people have issues with the frame rate i get times like during neds dlc where my 1060s usage is less than 10 and i drop into the low 20s then the quest markers are broken most of the time if you play coop the mini map is buggy too custom markers pop up every now and then for no reason and the ui is clunky oh and theres no option to toggle ads in the options like in bl2 you have to edit the config file what a shit fucking port lmao theyre charging 30 for this piece of shit with the videos about gen 7 remasters can you compare them to their original console versions too like compare the xbox 360ps3 to the xbox 1ps4 versions screen tearing is not acceptable please look at the handsome collection 4k update those new textures are nice and it runs beautifully on both pro and x they need to fix the massive screen tearing issue im on xbox one x and its so noticable its the only game i can tell that has screen tearing how about a performance test video of outward its the new survivalist type rpg by nine dot studios that surprisingly has 2player splitscreen support looks absolutely stunning in 4k hdr on xbox one x and we get a fov slider finally loving it so far plays great i wish there was an option to select classic ui item menu the bl2tps style menu doesnt look right in bl1 vertical splitscreen should be illegal tldw xb1x faux k dynamic 4k 60fps tearing during complex scenes ps4pro same as xb1x but with lower res and much more tearing base consoles dynamic 1080p with few drops and quite a bit of tearing pc completely dependent on your setup beast pc the best way to play obviously 4k 60fps and no tearing if you do it right funny how consoles cant even get 60fps on a remastered version of a game thats about to be 10 years old this year the game forget all my video settings after a restart can anybody help  how well does the xbox one s play i feel like theres more s models out there than the regular base model now adays and i feel like you guys should cover it more stick control feels much better on consoles to fov slider is nice too i remember playing borderlands 1 on onlive when it came out it changed my perspective of gaming questionthe resolution in the patch for the handsome collection would be the same of this goty version why do you upload these videos of 4k gameplay in 1080p youtube compression makes comparisons pointless come on uhhh finally ive been waiting for this lol so the pc manages to keep a steady 1080p 1440p or 4k it also has the keyboard and mouse so the pc is better nvidia physx was removed from the game dont let people dumb down the screen tearing the screen tearing is absolutely atrocious and unacceptable its ridiculous that a game this old cant run smoothly in 2019 if you are getting this on console strongly consider against it the screen tearing is very distracting this remaster sucks i have gtx1070 and works only on 30 fps 90 and drops to 35 in borderlands 2 all ok fps 100 switch version bro come on  i think studios should just concentrate on brand new ips even if anthem did suck and days gone doesnt look that promising especially for a ps4 title runs the game on 4k blurs it all up with fxaa the lighting system looks upgraded too am i crazy lol conslows cant even run this at native 4k without dynamic resolutions pathetic next gen needs to get here before they have to downgrade games to get them to run on these potato cups imagine a ryzen high clocked 812 core cpu for next gen cant wait  pretty bad tearing and performance issues on the xbox one x remember these are the same base consoles where doom 2016 ran at 1080p60 they could have done better borderlands 2 was on vita can we get this and 2 on switch plz this is neat and all but it would be really interesting to see testing in areas like tartarus station or the hyperion junkyard where fps seems to go down the shitter while gpu usage stays low why wasnt this produced in 4k if youre analysing a 4k remaster split screen is always okay in my book a game with tearing is a trash game in my opinion is there a benefit to uhd if you only have a 1080p monitorscreen ps4 pro sucks for not being able to hit full 4k cant wait for the ps5 i have a theory that this is actually a port to the engine used for bl2tps since as far as i know they never ported bl1 to next gen since there was issues with it biggest waste if space going if you have pc version its free why aitch prereckquizit these are the correct pronunciations are you going to do an analysis on path of exile for consoles does this worry anyone when borderlands 3 comes out do you think the x will be able to do 4k60 when i played bl1 back in the day on pc the first time i saw any drops in framerate was late game into the dlc so i wouldve been curious to see that april 2020 is gonna be lit my only gripe is the character intro run at 30fps same with the hc need fix asap switch would be more than happy with a hybrid remastered version similar to dark souls take the xbox 360 version and enhance it as much as possible along the lines of the new remaster while keeping the frame rate and resolution high the switch really had to have this one wasnt borderlands originally supposed to be a ps3 exsclusive having a blast playing the collection on my xbox one x first time ever playing borderlands and its safe to say im hooked only thing better is if i could double dip into a switch version now borderlands 3 is september not october just to let you guys know the pc version of the enhanced edition is smooth as butter 2560x1440 ryzen 2700x 43ghz 16gb 3200mhz ram gtx1080ti with the game totally maxed out it ranges from 110250fps over 300fps in parts i have also tested using dsr at 2x which gives me a resolution of 3620x2036 and the game runs maxed out with around 80150fps 200fps in some parts i am currently level 21 so i have seen some more hectic areas there is a bug where the video options menu where the resolution will say its running at 23hz and even when selecting the right refresh rate it will still say 23hz this is inside fullscreen window and borderless as well its a bug and the game will run at whatever refresh you have set it to mine is 144hz and my monitor shows its running at 144hz finished my first playthrough today and now im back in firestone and no textures are loading no matter what i do it usually takes a second or so and the textures popin now they are not loading at all even after restarting the game and console anyone else have this happen on ps4 pro not sure what to do now i really like that hey added a 4p local splitscreen coop for the full story and more devs should do that imo on base ps4 ive encountered a fair share of audio glitches mainly with character dialogue where it either wont play or it sounds like its doubled over also the player callouts option in sound options does nothing defaulting to yes other than that its a decent remaster yep game still suffers from tearing 112 what is going on here is this the sun position changed or what why the hell is anisotropic filtering so consistently low on consoles its one of the settings that usually doesnt impact fps on pc so a decade old game cant hold 60 fps on modern consoles jesus we have come so far with tech said nobody blind squirrel games isnt good at anything did he say anything about pc i didnt catch it they couldve done more like native msaa support higher sample ambient occlusion bokeh dof or same dof with increased samples does pc have split screen why do consoles always have low default anisotropic filtering ive been turning this setting from min to max on pc since like 1998 or whenever it first got popular and it has literally never made even a 1 difference in any game from minimum all the way up to 16x even on pc a lot of games have it on like 4x by default why what machines get slowed down by this in any way is it a ram thing ps4 pro vs xbox one x x pc 1080p video dislike and exiting the channel 111 is this mislabeled the original seems to look better than this shot than the remaster does the og version of borderlands include the second wind feature i dont remember it being there hey if they can put borderlands 2 on the ps vita it definitely can go on the switch your not going to talk about the online issues with this game i will keep walking til i find somebody who will console versions added a fov slider as well i wish df would start included performance hits on their console analysis for cosnole games that add that i really missed split screen  do pc version also have splitscreen why aint this on switch  starting to get used to not seeing pc performance comparisons these days oh wait no im not if you want to test performance show us what your rigs are doing too digitalfoundry could you guys do a performance test on conan exiles really really wished hellgate london had the polish and gameplay of borderlands as i felt it was the precursor to it borderlands goty for switch would work real well paraphrasing some moron from digital foundry 2019 really irritating that split screen was ripped from the pc versions for no reason ps4 pro with supersampling off results thanks is there any testing done further than an hour in the game hectic battles maybe yesss why does this video look so compressed compared to most df videos the fucking ps4 version wont connect to any mp its broken i was waiting for this ill gladly beg for a switch port one to start then two plz plz plz tearing in one x wtf damn i dont think the console versions of this remaster were optimized at all my old crappy rig from 2011 with an i52320 and a radeon hd 6670 1gb ran the original game nearly at max at 1080p 60fps with no scaling or tearing though there is no vsync option so you have to force it on with drivers the handsome collection on ps4 doesnt have these issues either and 2ps are more demanding glad i had the pc version of the original i hate tearing more than anything does youtube no longer support 4k video i cant remember the last time we got a 4k upload pc performance is garbage borderlands 2 at 4k even on my ocd 1080ti no idea why anybody else having this problem does pc version has resolution frame rate issue of 50hz its goty wtf d the screen tearing on the ps4 pro is really rough and how stable is it with 1080p on ps4 pro without supersampling additional partical effects have been added along with upgrading the ones it already had and they seem to be the cause of huge frame rate drops on the pc ive seen gameplay where firing normal guns drops the frame rate from 120 to 50 been replaying them on x looks amazing in hdr ps4 cant handle a game from 2009 maxed out the game forget all videos settings after a restart can anybody help me im just glad bl1 finally has fov slider on pc gearbox sucks  unstable framerate from the worlds most powerful console the sad part is that the game is literally like 1012 years old fagbox one x is garbage i still cant play with my friends on ps4 matchmaking is busted sucks that the mouse controls are so bad again multiplayer is unplayable on pc you cant check your ping connection is tied to the framerate enemies teleporting and popping around you cant even see what is attacking you huge hit detectionzoomjump delay lan mp removed only the host can see the objectives on the map very glad to see digital foundry doing splitscreen performance tests of the games who have them once again resubbed will there be local coop for bl3 you forgot to compare the maclinux versions if gearbox bothered their saggy holes supporting those versions of borderlandsb2gotyhandsome collection bl3 is coming put in september they need to fix screen tearing and framerate on ps4pro current gen has trouble with a sub par looking 2009 game excellent and again ps4 wins i was waiting for this d i know this is mostly supposed to be a technical analysis of the console versions but you could have at least mentioned that the pc version of borderlands goty enhanced is arguably the worst remaster in the history of pc games mouse input not fixed after 10 years of people complaining new ui on pc is considerably worse than the old one ever was multiplayer is completely unplayable unless all clients run at the same framerate as the host half the settings dont properly save in the config file and keep resetting to stupid defaults like 50hz refresh rate the game tries really hard to use cpu integrated graphics instead of the proper gfxcard for like 50 of all players performance gets worse with lower resolutions for most people that one is just lol et cetera for me this performs considerably worse on a 10606gb than it did 10 years ago on a gt240 oh and of course they havent patched it yet and all their communications regarding these pretty glaring issues is  im still waiting for someone to explain the point of having 4k with aa methods that blur the image quality here comes some triggered switch fanboys begging for the game lol why where you fighting nine toes he has three balls with the starting assault rifle 927 ive noticed that splitscreen has been making a comeback for quite some time now since ive began tracking the situation when cod black ops 3 was released i have noticed a slow but steady increase in the number of developing teams who have come foward and express their love and support for said feature  they could have done a better job on the guns unbelievable no 60 fps in split screen bugs in game why i wasted 30 bucks on this shit the hdr on the x looks fantastic the neon lights sun and flame accents on my maliwan guns are especially pretty i guess the enhanced versions run at that resolution all the time even with a 1080p screen id love to see a more solid locked 60fps especially with a higher fov bl2 had quite a lot of drops with a 90 fov in my experience instead of the resolution bump borderlands is coming out in september not october i wish the original mass effect trilogy would get a 20192020 update its insane how much better the console version looks im so happy with this one of the best 30 purchases ive ever made highly recommend play this for any borderlands fan im playing on xbox one x with hdr and the colour is just orgasmic its beautiful and arguably better looking than the pc version its sad that the enhanced consoles cant even handle a game from 2009 in 4k 544 is it just me or base xbox one has lower anisotropic filtering maybe because resolution i pass on that i stay tuned for ps4 original games remastered on ps5 tttttttttthat will blow you mind  you might want to also talk about the frame rate issues this game has on pc as well on very high end systems using a 2080ti there are times where the fps drops to around 20 its not all the time but when it does happen its definitely jarring heres hoping this will be fixed in a patch someday release date is in september not october i am also interested in how it performs with online multiplayer i have been playing it on the one x and it plays great but like mentioned in the video it does have some screen tearing although it has not happened very much there seems to be a shit load of tearing on my x would like to see a patch to try to reduce it a bit i loved this game this video has been completely butchered by youtube it is a complete compression mess no 4k upload or simply 4k upscale for more bandwidth tom is such an xbox fanboy claiming the ps4 drops to mid 50s when all the footage he shown was 58 and above then stating the x ran better when it clearly dropped to low 50s for a while hes been doing this more and more recently he cant stick to facts and brings his biased opinion into it ill wait for the switch version missed the graphical update to angel i played just before the update when thr video popping up was ful screen fmv or the like the update changes to to more of a dot matrix style 111 they botched the shadows in the remaster what a shame that the switch did not get a port was pc mentioned even once in this video lol tearing on consoles hard pass shame borderlands 1 is objectively the best in the series the best change added to this version of the game is that we now have a fov slider if this costs money then its not worth it the original holds up pretty well if you use a 1080p display if you have a 4k monitor then i can understand the purchase why we can not choose 30 fps and true 4k or 60 fps and 1440p i prefer to play in 30fps but in true 4k lmao even digitalfoundry portbegging for switch hdr on pc sucks anyway not only its buggy but it looks terrible got a 4k ips 27 monitor and hdr looks horrible and its just too bright tried it on many monitors and it always make the whole screen 400 nits bright without local dimming i could not look at a screen this bright this close for more than few minutes please do a review on the 4k pack for bl2ps even a 1070ti still has trouble to run these games in w10 with physx enabled at 1080pand even woth physx disabled you still get a few frame drops that issue needs visibility  does anyone else think having a variable resolution in some cases is a bad thing instead of a developer spending time on optimisation they can just use a variable resolution solution 1440 x 810 the future is here now update bl2 on the vita youuuuuu cunts the most important change to the pc remaster is a muffugin fov slider i remember back in my junior year of high school one of my friends put me on to this game and i fell in love with borderlands 10 years ago i want a switch version is it too much to ask umm how isnt it at a locked 1080p resulotion the video quality is pretty atrocious do the handsome jack collection upgrades why didnt you do a coop test on actual multiplayer because it has some serious issues on all platforms with really bad stuttering the screen tearing is really annoying for me hopefully they patch it good video df overall not too bad yh i am surprised the handsome jack collection isnt coming onto the switch or even this game at the very least well ill stick to the pc version unfortunately it seems to have massive connection issues at the moment wasnt the handsome collection 6o fps even in splitscreen potatostation power with screen tearing technology lol i imagine they perform far worst later in the game with the huge increase in clutter and monster density best looter shooter out there gearbox making ubisoft look like amateurs those performance issues will probably be sorted out post launch as they did with handsome collection the problem is youre playing at the lowest fov so its not really a useful comparison because it tears far more at a higher fov setting if they can put on it on the vita it can work on the switch just fine i cant think of a game analysis ive cared about less best console version on xbox one x therefore making you a better gamer it was really nice of them to give us the enhanced edition for free on steam too bad the publisher hates pc player and made borderlands 3 an epic exclusive meaning most people wont play that for a year borderlands is such an amazing game to just kill something when i am super pissed  this is the least impressive remaster since dark souls remastered would be nice to join friends in this game fail gearbox another x win so powerful its just unstoppable wow thats amazing in liliths voice do you guys know anything about ps4 multiplayer issues finally ps4 poo the definitive certified poo version did you test the pc i didnt see it in the video but its in the title tearing broken wont touch would rather locked 30fps anyone else having issuses playing online like i cant connect to anyone handsome collection analysis we need a switch port please gearbox give it to us 124 517 it looks like the remaster and original are the wrong way round for some of the pc shots again at 140 textures and lighting look much better on the original side gearbox y u no splitscreen on pc gee more old games that weve already played to death we should be at bl4 or 5 by this time last gen now companies dont need to make as many big new aaa blockbuster titles with price gouged microtransactions and the mobile model conditioned igenners who have fallen for them since childhood so old af big games look incredible to them because its not fortnite or cod br the chase for the best microtransactions scam has really damaged the industry i thought borderlands 3 was out in september 13th not october curious that borderlands goty is performing worse than bl2 bl presequel in the handsome collection both achieved 1080p60 with minimal hitches postpatches on base consoles yes even xo the screen tearing is really awful i have an xbox one x and it is super distracting looking forward to april 2020  best console version xbox one x 2160p to 1440p 60fps with less screen tearing compared to the ps4 pro version okay ill take it after playing borderlands 1 i have come to appreciate borderlands 2 and the games after it so much more borderlands 1 level system is so bad almost every enemy are some serious bullet sponges cant wait to do another no kill run in this was waiting for this im noticing a decent amount of screen tearing on x1x with an ssd could we get an all xbox comparison 360 vs backwards compatible vs remaster etc the sad part about borderlands 3 pc version as i hear it wont have physx its supposed to be an amd sponsored game which really sucks because physx on borderlands 2 really made the game for me if this is true ill probably just buy bl3 on the playstation pro test out the handsome collection 4k texture pack on consoles too please  its nice that the textures shadows are improved its nice that you can unlock the frame rate without an ini tweak i like the minimap too but for a ten yo game it has some strange issues still not fixed like originally it had no vsync option the remaster has a vsync option but its broken it destroys the frame pacing so i still have to use nvidias control panel to force vsync its nice that they at least gave it out for free to people who owned the original here are the bastards on the nintendo switch i thought they would release the game but no need to release bulletstorm why didnt they compare the ps3 and xbox 360 to new gen i remember picking up borderlands 1 from my local blockbusters to rent for two days thats a throwback in itself me and my friend played nonstop split screen coop for those two days barely got any sleep and bought the game as soon as we returned it the way they nailed the fps rpg combo at the time was pure crack cocaine its only releaseed in playstation store and others cant find a physical copy anyone who is interested in the pc version amazon has been selling the original versions steam code for 750 it can be used to download the newer version doing bl2 hd or is there no point looks really good on pc rn i was never a big fan of borderlands 1 but borderlands 2 thats another story so basically the current consoles struggle to run a game from 2009 at 1080p the only difference between the old and new versions are higher resolution textures and better shadows at least it can run at 60fps looks and plays great on x but has some nasty tearing at times borderlands 3 is going to be a failure rtx 2070 and i was getting 10 fps day one on any settings i was so pissed off the screen tearing needs to get addressed asap on consoles it makes the game nearly unplayable they renamed borderlands in borderlands goty and fucked up my games list order on steam 010 uninstalled physx is relevant again boredomlands 3 is looking pretty epic oh boy a minute in and the fov is already killing me second the video i was waiting for never clicked on a video so fast lol soonest ive ever been to a digital foundry video release boss list has been added to the description enjoy click description for boss list dont forget

video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnrhpyjounia do a borderlands 3 all bosses 2838 i remember the first time watching this cutscene and i died of laughter when steele died glad they kept the crawmerax cheese strat in talk about being faithful to the original im guessing claptraps were made hatedmistreated and killed started a revolution and took control over everything by literally putting mind control devices on their heads im not sure but that might be what the claptraps story is question for everyone of all the enemies in the borderlands which one do you hate the most the bosses to this moment all feel glitched i went to beat bone head and when you strike from a distance he just stands still and does nothing same goes for the midget in t bone junction coming out of the locker it takes about 30 minutes or so but you can totally shoot and kill him from a distance with a sniper d everyone clicked on it cause of lilith lol great job and all but i dunno for some reason ive never enjoyed the original bl it just seems odd it has atmosphere it has some special things about it but its grim rough around the edges i did finish the second one and halfway through the presequel though i had forgotten how badass the pyro maniacs looked 3 balled larry question can all of them be considered bosses im just asking by the way in your fight with flynt is that a hellfire youre using september may be a ways away but considering whats coming i think the wait is gonna make all it all the more enjoyable that said september cant get here soon enough here it is borderlands remastered all bosses after trying out the newly enhanced edition of the original game i just had to play it through again getting hyped for borderlands 3 yet slack so many fly amonita there lol im so stack with your skyrim necromage build slackula nad now im here what an influence uv got a fan here in philippines majorslacker the damn golden key box gives me like 3 sets of shotguns in a row and then 2 sets of snipers then it rotates back to the shotguns what a waste whats your version of power shopping bonehead spanked good feels great everytime payback for the early bl1 playtime when bonehead spanked me so many times d go sonya blade  hey slack i was wondering if you are planing to continue dos2 walkthrough because that series was amazing any plans on doing a walkthrough on bl2s new dlc i just started the bl2 dlc all im gonna say is have a fire weapon with you before you start it and thanks slack im enjoying this walkthrough too good stuff as usual slack until you started the bl series again i never knew you could use the bank at the under dome i was always under the impression you could not use the bank until you completed the under dome dlc hey slack this one seems to be missing from the playlist would you kindly add it when you got time  your voice makes me happy for some reason i love how youre applying all these stategies and challenges into this pistolero build great idea you had to do this its really hard not to pick up some purple weapons have to be reminded i making a pisterlero build never tried this thanks slack  slack you do know theres a buy all ammo button now right it wouldve been cool if mordecai had the option to duel wield handguns maybe we will get that ability in bl3 wow wow wow you are going take on the lost cave and the alpha skags at tough difficulty really looking forward to mondays episode loving this walkthrough thanks slack im currently following your gameplay and creating my own pistolero build happy friday great series so far keep up the good work slack be vewy vewy quiet im hunting skags hahahaha be sure to use some club soda to get the skag offal out of your clothes great video as always slack is the golden key thing in main menu extras same in borderlands 2 or no yeah i get a kick out of her audiotapes to they are kind of funny have a great weekend everybody dude color me late to the party and commenting off topic i dont care x0d laughs i just saw your other page for the first time and i couldnt not have been more off base when i envisioned you in my mind now im going to need therapy that i totally cant afford thanks for that and the many many laughs hey to mrs slack too loving these borderlands walkthroughs so much out of curiosity slack how do you find a finished mordecai pistolero in comparison to a sniper build i have to admit i found pistols to just be way more entertaining  thank you i think the reason why you arent getting a scoped revolver is because the game is pissed off getting its ass handed to it any plans for the new borderlands 2 dlc slack meet the channel with the gameplay of far cry 2 and loved it now i follow the 2 channels and love the content awesome work man raising my skag proficiency hey slack they are coming out with a free bl2 dlc in a couple days will you be covering that theres a new slacksheriff in town pure pistolero ah gee thanks sir slack making skag toast that was fun almost midnight here and im watching slack ah man i was hoping for a little field testing with those new bad boys oh well guess i better start studying for that pop quiz thumbs up  if theres one weapon type one can always rely on in every installment of the borderlands series its pistols great run slack nice cover strats really stymies the skags is there a reason for not using bloodwing just curious loving this walkthrough seeing some totally different strategies for stuff ive done many times im excited to see the optimized path through the main story and the dlcs i took slacks advice and went into walmart looking for a revolver with a scope no luck at all so i saved a lot then exited the store i had to do this eight times more before it worked sadly though my transmission locked and i couldnt get anywhere i had to go to the shoe department to reboot gaming is hard hey slack welcome back keep em coming wanna try this every time i do the by the seeds of your pants mission i always get badass skags are you going to play another game unce you bet the borderlands series are you going to play another game unce you bet the borderlands series hi does the profilebn given in the description works for bordeland 2 in the handsome collection aswell omg thankkyouu for this i need a pickmeup after corrupting my saves on a level 35 siren all that farming and leveling hours gone to waste youre the best man will you get a vac ban for this on steam but how does this work you can do this more effectively by simply right clicking on the profilebin and setting it to read only works for bl2 as well what about borderlands 2 and presequel remastered does this methord work on that anyone else realize that borderlands goty enhanced is 10 times harder than the first game did i get a ultra hard copy of what i had 75 keys and spent a couple and made a new game and i came back to my first play through and didnt have keys i have no idea why this video has 66 dislikes it fucken works perfectly ultimate keys for days probably gonna be patched soon so stop fucken leaving dislikes and have fun kids this channel doesnt deserve dislikes it deserves likes and subs btw dda50 great video you forgot to mention you need the keys from twitter or gearbox first then this will work this has been around since well borderlands keys hitand dup weapons was a thing appreciate the reminder tho another option is to have a friend with an empty inventory join your game you open the chests they pick everything up until they are full they quit then after they are gone you alt f4 out start yours back up and then have them join and share the loot no keys lost can you tell me how to increase my backpack size thanks if you right click the profilebin and set it to read only you dont need to copy the profilebin back into the folder my savedata folder doesnt show up even when showing hidden folders and drives what do this video needs to be liked about 10000 more times who ever disliked this video apparently didnt understand it you can just make the profile be read only for everyone who says they didnt get the keys or guns they were promised you have to have had a save for borderlands the handsome collection and then you have to start a brand new character with you being the host not a friend  to those who dont have golden keys heres a shift code srcbj5kxff5t6k333bbbwbf6h today is 100419 and i dont know when its going to invalidate it works perfectly thanks does not seem to work anymore sup with the thumb downs how to get the gold keys i do not have a single golden key this works woo it just sucks i never got that 75 keys they promised maybe its because i linked my shift account too late i dunno either way i was able to get 10 keys you should put the profilebin in the description so people can download it since some people dont have any keys i love you attitude towards this lol shift keys should be awarded in game not via twitter maybe through challenges or some repeatable thing i love the outro how did you get the keys oof used my keys im at 50 edit think this was patched since i do the same thing you do and keys are gone dda50 all i do is set the profilebin file to read only mode i can then log in and out of game to reset my keys no need to make a copy so i dont have the save data folder what should i do this whole key thing is weird my friend got the keys even though he never signed into his shift account yet im sitting here with nothing i am absolutely loving the enhanced goty edition of borderlands playing it for the first time in years and although i remember exactly what to do at what point ive forgotten just how great it is and why im such a fan boy  put pc in the title how do i get it it say i have borderlands goty but i mine dint update its still the same wouldnt setting it to read only achieve the same goal and would save you overwriting the file every time you exit the game welp i deleted my profilebin that had the 75 keys on accident question does the golden chest work the same way it does in borderlands 2 presequal or can you now get legendaries out of it in bl goty enhanced i figured out my issue you have to log into bl2 or presequal with your shift account before logging into blgoty i never made a shift account before this lol got my keys the moment i made a new account and did that how u get keys for goty on ps4 though hey i would be happy with 75 keyshowever i have zero keysno keys for me i suppose i will delete the game reload and start a new character and see if that works yep you have to have some keys first eh i have every borderlands game ever developed in my steam librarystill no keys cheers kit this works 100 though i prefer not to do it because it kind of ruins one of the major aspects of the game thanks it worked for me i have both the original game and the goty edition but i didnt receive any keys or loot is there a shift code or setting that im missing or what help i have the other borderlands but not the keys do i need to create a new character because i imported a level 12 nice for refreshing this metod i completely forgot about it it was there since borderlands 2 and golden keys has been released on pc anyway thanks again this is also an amazing way to get a ton of money to you have my subscription good sir thank you very much for this the golden keys are great and me being an idiot used 10 of them at level 5 to get a boosted gun totally panicked when i knew i couldnt get them back and this helped if you guys cant follow it properly simple as these little steps make sure youve launched the game and made a new character up to the point after you fix the med machine near dr zed after that you can go around the arid badlands and explore a little go to the golden chest it should be easy to find by now check your keys if you have 75 youre golden if you have less dont worry too much exit to the title screen so it saves your game then exit the game completely and go to my documentsmy gamesborderlands game of the yearbinariessave data and make a new folder call it whatever you like and copypaste your profilebin into it thats the file youll be using to restock your golden keys with so do not delete it once youve done that you go back ingame spen i lost my 70 gkwhy the 75 keys are a reward for having logged into shift on another borderlands game prior to goty enhanced if you still do not have any keys check with support just look on gearboxs twitter or randy pitchfords twitter once you have atleast one key you can do the trick the people who disliked this video either dont like free stuff or has not enough brain to follow a simple instruction i just tested it it works either i am doing this horribly wrong somehow or this no longer works after just a few hours edit well figured it out had to delete the original profilebin completely and exit from the game every time i wanted to reset my keys i just want my 75 keys for owning the others isnt it easier to just change the file to read only is this borderlands 3 no thanks i remember this game since they had it on ps3 theres another spot in the middle of the ledge instead of the old one in the corner but you have to watch for the craw maggots since sometimes they body charge you and you fall off the ledge and die also theres a guide on how to use the old oasis mod to fast travel the dlc httpsforumsgearboxsoftwarecomttutorialplayingmodswiththeenhancedversion2245990 when you go for the back phase blast to behind the pillar and are hidden let it regen before you try to shoot the back and with a siren farm for the mod that gives you extra smg damage and smg ammo regen equip the best fire shock and caustic smgs you can farm 12 fire rates seem to be the best for elemental for your 4th slot have a good sniper caustic on purple ones fire on green and shock on craw worms you can melt them pretty easily hardest part is phase blasting and getting an angle on the back but if you peek slowly you can usually get a shot or two before he turns then let him come close to you and phase blast and hide behind the other pillar the ledge does semi work but you need a weapon like a shotgun that will at least have a few bullets get past the ledge snipers hit it every time i tried the old spot 40 times or betterit dont workyoure right deadass my nigga do asmr this shit perfect for  i play 2 more on ps4 i remember the old run through as well keep it up guys love watching ur vids catch that train yaw its gonna be huge big yaw fan big

menu is 4k bl2 menu en game 1080p can some one help me on that gorgeous hey guys just want to let everyone know that the ledge glitch and armory glitch still work btw the vault insider program is open to public on the borderlands website use this link to earn easy points and redeem them for rewards for things like golden keys httpsborderlandscomenusvipctsyg66c2hn 545 u already phucked up ive never played a borderlands game but i want borderlands 3 too bad they only shipped 5 freaking copies to every gamestop 2k is trash and that proves it to me and i run consoles only will wait for a deep sale since its not available anywhere on disksold out is there fall damage in the remaster just show us tk baha already i remember hearing that song when the first trailer came out years ago character creation would be awesome i hope borderlands 4 will introduce itlike have set classes but you can customize a character for whichever one youd pick aint rest for the wicked boi the original looter shooter ppl this game already came out as game of the year i dont like what they did to angel 324 gotcha oh snap they finally had a mini map in this version thats cool that background music brings a tear to my eye the music of fyrestone takes me back  bruh that intro to firestone section has about 20 loots cash weapons you missed i would really like to see witcher 12 remastered made a 4k 60fps but upload in 1080p i feel like the only person alive that liked this game more than 2 i have no idea why this game was so much fun for me so many memories of split screen coop time to enjoy this game inb4 modders ruin it i think this is my favorite opening sequance of all time get out of my bus lilith has great moans and screams yup thats my takeaway from this video great will it include a better story like borderlands 2 2999 tho and they missed the chest at the beginning no wonder they wanted battle royal on bl3 damn i wish they fixupdate the animations they look so stiff and clunky 148 so apparently theyve watched stranger things behold the anthem killer looks trash mr zed that was quite unnecessary oh dr zed my apologies this is going to be so much fun i need a group to play with though while borderlands 2 was better in almost every way borderlands 1 has some beefier sounding and feeling weapons that i wont deny oddball thing is i dont even remember that intro from before maybe my memory is crap but having a mini map is a huge help finally no more guessing where enemies are everythings all colorful and cell shaded up to borderlands par now one more thing you forgot the loot chest on top the building at the beginning we want border royale in bl3 ign 2019 playing it right now and im loving every second of it the nostalgia is hitting me so hard  if they really wanted to make it awesome they should have taken the resident evil route added more dialogues more maps etc i see the texture popping is still here in full force finally i can continue my lilith gameplay without getting nausea every 10 minutes because of the fov im surprised one of yours hasnt asked for an easier difficulty face animation for the vault hunters i dont have the new mini map and my new install says borderlands goty on steam these are the twats that want another battle royale first 17 minutes and you forget to check the new features in the newu station nobody ign we want battle royale and microtractions isint holding up that much how do you play so boringly so you want to hear a story huh heres the legend of the remakes an era of gaming where gamers buy the same game about 3x because of minor changes and labeled hd and then complain when called out on it aint no rest for the wicked whats the bets we are gonna have to fix claptrap in the opening lvl of borderlands 3  blah im too lazy to make a graphics side by side video can someone do it it will get you alot of views btw like this game was released yesterday  mine updated but i dont have any of those changes handsome collection got a 4k texture pack on ps4 today i see the textures still pop in fix the game multiplayer is broken cant find anything on it but it wont let me join my wife but it will let me join my brother with ease all it says is could not connect to host been trying all day anyone have the same issue minimap and auto pick up make me very happy do i need to completely start over in order to play the remastered version yeah another rerelease of a game we all can play because its already out a long time but hey lets buy it again and play the same game again instead of letting them make a new game its a game not a painting it doesnt have to look great its about gameplay and fun and thats still the same why are there so many people that want the same game again and again those people ruin gaming for others they dont make new games they just remake old games and ask again for the 60 euros and people will still fall for that is this that goty edition which is currently available on steam  anyone who thinks borderlands needs a battle royal mode is not a boderlands fan ive noticed they make the game looks less brown and added more color to it and the background music added some beats to it an i just bought this game with dlc 4 days ago ok im happy lmao battle royale is the decline i owned borderlands 1 on pc it changed the name of it to borderlands goty but the game is the same as before why your using controller why would you use a controller is this on switch marcus looks a lot more older is it vertical or horizontal split screen if its vertical still then ill pass on this that song will always and forever remind me of the crisp autumn day on oct 20th 2009 when i first fired up borderlands 1 it was the kind of game i always wanted how do you buy this i cant find this on steam i also dont see my normal game updated help borderlands goty remaster when this game will be ready for download i hope that the sniper scopes would be different wow 2k has become 4k so you want to hear a story borderlands 3 is an epic games store exclusive wellthey changed angel how do i get the version a remastered version of an older game at half the original price meanwhile at activision a remastered version of an older game at half the original price meanwhile at activision such nostalgia within seconds  damn i wanna it but money dont grow on trees huh never realized marcus hinted at borderlands 2 or new game plus when you get off the bus also this game is probably the best in the series didnt need this work on borderlands 3 please i dont know why i should buy this when the new game is coming soon also with the much better sequels this game feels ancient this game still looks incredible and i remember my friend arguing me over the merits of borderlands artistic style look who won i started back playing bl1 its so amazing glorious again this and borderlands 2 should have got switch ports heck borderlands 3 in my eyes should get a switch port too i just remembered something will split screen still have a horizontal and a vertical cant wait to abuse new haven for gold weapons again oooh i love the shallow depth of field when you aim down the sights i dont think that was in the original anyone know what time this hits the xbox store uk its fake holy dang they really made it look way more appealing than on 360 and ps3 its soooooo crisp lol to people who bought the division 2 ubisoft take notice this is a remaster 4k60 on console yay now i can play the thunderdome in 4k 60fps xd only at gamestop which is complete bull i purchased borderlands 1 on steam for pc last week how do i upgrade to remastered  just shut up and take my money i would love to play this game but i cant cause i dont have a ps4 pro lovely how do you get it i was so hyped to this day but i cant find this version on steam i have every borderlands but not the handsome collection really want the steam version for borderlands goty edition but i still have the original disc of borderlands i rented this from blockbuster  would you kindly oh waitwrong game this game is better than i remember i dont like the way they changed cortana or whatever her name is she looked more realistic in the original so as a pc player what am i actually getting when will it be available on ps store in europe i really hope your marker on the minimal doesnt blink the whole game this isnt the borderlands goty that i know the real one just end off at so you want to hear a story the intro scene after you choose your character has been re done and a lot of other things hopefully we get to use circle or whatever correlates to your crouch button you missed a chest and other loot too ive literally spent months of my life in this game  i cant stand lilith after the pre sequelone bit i cant wait to buy borderlands 3 from epic store exclusively from other online stores when does it fully come out is 2player splitscreen on ps4 pro 60fps cant see the game in the xbox one store any ideas when i searched it up on ps store today it only came up with the ps now to get the ps3 versionsomeone please help me anybody know the song from the intro are they any kids out there that havent played this so thanks to nostalgia these upgraded visuals are what i remember from the original weird next aliens colonial marines that fyrestone music the bandits sound like gruncle stan from gravity falls one of my most fondly remembered games as a young boy and im so glad to see it can be experienced again in the best and cleanest way possible the auto loot didnt seem that auto for money and ammo why did ign decide to do this like its the same as the original game woohoo we really needed to watch claptrap in 4k 60fps im about board this land is this out yet what legless spider did you hire to demo this gameplay is this a whole new game  is it just me or do the guns in borderlands 1 sound more beefy  very terrible gameplay omg it will be available 3pm uk time guys someone knows where can i purchase this edition i do not see it anywhere even on steam  i love the siren when does this come out on ps4 the only feature missing to really make me play it again vr support i missed hearing liliths evil headshot laugh wowlisten to that music the voice acting the dry arizona desert atmospherewowi used to have this mw2 beyonetta and wet on repeat whoever is playing this doesnt know where the melee attack is game is remastered to 60fps and 4k2160p but uploads the video to 60fps 1080p  im always happy when i hear my favorite band at the beginning of this game i wonder if they added talking animations for the npcs outside of cutscenes does ign have an ai playing games for them  will it be on the ps store tomorrow will this be on the ps4 it still looks the same i need a side by side comparison so you want to hear a story read more does this comes with borderlands handsome collection someone help i csnt see borderlands available for download on the playstation network someone explain so when is the game available digitally i have all 3 games so i will get remaster of the first game or not dont have dlc for first whats the bet 90 of people will pick lilith its skag season boys why are the ads before ign videos so damn long they finally put a map yay i was hoping it would show up in the store today so i can preorder and download it on ps4 anybody else not run though it like a bot at e3  besides the graphical and game enhancements that will be available for free the other 4 dlc will be also available for free for the people who already have the original borderlands on steam and they will do the same with the dlc on bl2 on steam too 1240 she said would you kindly she cant be trusted so youre showcasing the new stuff andyou still leave the fov what seems to be default setting even though one of the added things is the slider from bl2 couldnt put it at minimum 90 no yikes ign is it 60 game now  if remaster goes to epic games store borderlands gotym how do i buy this game im finding no evidence there will be a digital edition for consoles plus all the gamestops in my area dont have it im ashamed you didnt go for the chest at the start whats the song in the intro cutscene sweet amazing but what happens to the old version such a beautiful game much nostalgia im gonna be so happy to my play this wonderful game once again lol who else is rebooting their old gen to upload characters coming from xbox 360 to this all i see is pc max settings can this console pleb stop staring at the ground the whole time nearly 10 yrs old  how are peeps playing it early its digital only right i had so much time playing this game bruh what if they added physx in like borderlands 2 the bandits sounds like the fish in spongebob who always screams my leg i better still be able to acquire my stock repeater pistol hehe this was making me angry the look sensitivity is like bottomed out this isnt a remaster it looks exactly the same as the original version its just the game of the year addition from 10 years ago this is nostalgic and sad as well this isnt choice based like the telltale series was damn it should of been new angel comms huh i loved the more serious and dark humor vibe of this borderlands should we expect it to be available at 12 am or just sometime tomorrow looks just as boring as the priginal no thanx 1213 whos playing so bad he sees a guy jumping right in front him and what does he decide to do put his back on the guy so the guys can freely shoot him while he focuses on the enemy on the distance will this be cross platform for xbox and pc im even more hyped now this game looks gorgeous this lokls great cant wait to ply it tmrw thank you ign thanks for showing us that the person that made this video had no clue about the actual game they were supposed to showcase missing the chest at the beginning not showing changes to customization or the inventory playing with a controller on pc curses and no idea about the first missions at all was there really no one who played this game at least once back when it came out originally hell you didnt even take the time to maybe rehearse the gameplay footage you put out oh but of course you have no idea about what players want from borderlands right i mean there is no battle royale mode so why would anyone play it s how can i get this game for pc i cant find it in steam or anywhere else not one single severed arms or popped head they nerfed the violence hard frikn why wait what i thought this was borderlands 3 lol whats battle royal so what is remaster i honestly dont see how the graphics changed love it when am i the only one whos thinking this guy hasnt played the original missed so much loot didnt know where the button was for zeds room but did they take out fall damage u can tell they know nothing about borderlands when they want b3 to be battle royale and they dont even know the first chest in borderlands 1  this is a bigger treat for me than most i have my lilith that i brought from the 360 days in 2009 when i first played it over to the pc with over 32 days played i cant wait to have an excuse to get really hard into it again its my favorite borderlands game because i love the setting and vibe so much better this is problably gonna consume my time more than anything the rest of the year personally hit up me on steam if you see me on ive been modding it since 2010 and know everything there is to know so i can customize your weapons and everything im guessing ur sad the remaster didnt have br  how do i buy this game because its not on the ps4 store the zombie dlc gives so much memories i miss the irritation of not finding weapon parts will the knox dlc have new fast travel locations it looks the same smh i always thought the first game had the best graphics and i like both 1and 2 but 1 was my personal favorite original angel looked way cooler other than that looks like og borderlands which was never as fast paced as the sequel i dont understand the desire to go back honestly everything looks the same to me miss this game so much i feel like they could have done a lot more this game should have been in the handsome collection honestly at launch have they fixed the gun parts missions that song though ugh lol i played b2 split screen with my friend in 2015 later 2016 and 2017 still not finished it after 20hours of gamingdont want to play alone on xbox360 is this on xbox one and ps4 i hope everyone complains about how you didnt get the chest in the beginning because you arent actual borderlands fans looks even more polished than borderlands 2 looks bo1 music atmosphere bo2 one i never played borderlandsshould i invest time and is it worth it borderlands 3 epic store exclusive confirmed damn it accuracy and sprint speed hasnt been fixed its free on pc if u got borderlands goty steam angels the one thing thats more pixelated  its so close yet so far i need this right nowwwww well i know that playing on pc in shooter is superior but why controller dumb i love that robot  so you want to hear a story bl3 epic games exclusive i want to die your aim is off my friend not sure if im right but it seems like the guardian angel may be the inside voice of the vault hunter borderlands 1 was the best imo why is this not on the xbox store i remember back in 2009 i finally had enough money to purchase an xbox as i hated to spend money from time to time on new pc hardware so on the fly i bought batman arkham asylum as batman is always wicked and because of the cool 3d kind of cover i bought borderlands never heard anything of it never saw any trailers or gameplay best buy ever as i totally fell in love with the graphic style the unique gameplay elements and the random humor at moments 500 hours later 4 classes played through several times borderlands 2 arrived but still this was my first xbox 360 love can yall confirm about digital download or just only for physical disc for xbox still weird that there is no info in the ps4 store i wish you could views your avatar in 3d like in the handsome collection i think the person playing has raeks aka reload after every kill syndrome i also have that might pick this up i only ever played through this game with modded weapons around the time it came out and i remember it was super boring well duh 11 year old me really looking forward to this thumbs down too many adds nostalgic all over again i miss this game so much and honestly cannot wait to play this wonderful masterpiece in xbox one i can pass my data from the borderlands 1 retrocompatible to remastered i thought it wasnt available till tomorrow  is it going to get a physical edition on ps4 is this on ps4 did anybody else notice theres a compass on top of their level i dont remember if its always been there though lol just one question how do the console players get this game pls someone answear  i see they still couldnt hide the textures from popping in anybody noticing that the animation for angel looks different from the original it is closer to the look in borderlands 2 please dont skip the intro when playing multiplayer like in the original as anyone been able to preorder this game on either the xbox store or psn store its still not on the xbox store what missed opportunity on switch even doom and skyrim are on switch can we bring over our saves from last gen like we could in the handsome collection asking for my mom where is new inventory showcase wish it was on the switch tho tsunami smg and the serpens rifle pearlescents were the top dogs in the original i wonder if itll be the same on this one i hope the ui is as clean as this in b2 its a little blurry in the original release wow remastered angle know what time this will be available in the uk tomorrow why isnt it on playstation store whats about orig save transfers and whats the download size im annoyed because this wont be coming out on disc in australia nostalgia so many memories with this game  aright everyone which vault hunter did you pick when you first played this game i chose brick honestly this looks great my only complaint is the mini map i am speaking for myself but i do feel that plenty of other people will also think the mini map is kind of unnecessary if anyone has been playing borderlands 1 since it came out 10 years ago memorizing maps was what you had to do and i still know all of them by heart even after taking year long breaks from playing bl1 i dont think a mini map is the equivalent to holding a gamers hand but honestly the original worked well without a mini map until you get to sanders gorge in the claptrap dlc no one knows where they are going and even if they check the map it doesnt give direct paths because of the numerous weaving tunnels and tiers the map trolls you with a literal question mark over the center of the map sanders gorge is not usually fun but damn is it rewarding to get through the entire location without referring to the map as of tomorrow i have 3 days off work just when borderlands goty remastered drops perfect 3 br3 is an epic exclusive captured on pc at 4k 60fps uses a xbox controller how will it cost  it is funny to see dat now the original borderlands is more expensive than the goty editions lol ty gear box this isnt on psn store im assuming they have it early and cant download till tomorrow in uk one thing i dont like is that they didnt replace the reload animations imo they look stiff this is my first time playing borderlands i saw a bit of gameplay and decided to give it a shot i would buy this game just to see and hear claptrap again didnt even look at the heads ugh i was reflexively shocked to hear would you kindly give him a hand xd i want this now triggered captured on the pc but using a controller do you even mouse and keyboard bro d i dont need the minimap but its a nice feature know this game like the back of my hand cant wait to revisit it is this available for preorder on xbox yet been checking but cant find it ive never played borderlands before do i have to buy the handsome collection or just borderlands 1 from steam to get the update why is this thegamer ripoff in my recommended what about legendary weapons with slots to put things like gems to increase the damage for b3  they didnt fix the compass cant even do it bro lmao i got used to borderlands 2 compass as someone whos never played borderlands should i pick this up or should i wait for borderlands 3 is there an opacity slider for the hud if this game has character creation im not gonna play it so if i have it in steam the update will be free sometime on april 3 is there gonna be a uvhmtype thing in this is gore the same as in the original i cant tell because back then i only played the censored version but i heard in the uncensored version you could shoot off limbs and the elemental animations were cool but i couldnt see anything in this video so you want to hear a story huh about battle royale haha not here its not what we are doing hahaha so you want to know why you cant buy this game yet me too me too i love the ambiance and music of the first area might buy again depending on the price only 2999  now i can play with lilith again in hd it bothers me so bad that they didnt get the chest on top of the building on the left at the beginning of the game borderlands is back baby its up on amazon digital for 8 bucks as i type this cheapest anywhere on the internet cant wait to play it tomorrow lmao this is a port still gonna buy it tho forgot how much i loved the intro song so im watching fake gameplay  great feeling to come back after 10 years to this game i had bl1 on ps3 have it on 360 now i need it for ps4 ohhh yeaahhhh aint no rest for the wicket yay remaster never played borderland but i brought the handsome version and im playing boderland pre sequel my first borderland when i beat the first one ill go to the 2 i cant believe they didnt open the inventory aint no rest for the wicked  person playing the game has obviously never player borderlands before my brain hurts with that fov so close i remember when ign wasnt a bunch of whiny sissies and a bunch of dedicated gamers they all left a while ago sheeeeeet this is perfect holy crap i cannot wait to jump back in this game especially with all the dlc i missed i know it may be game breaking but can you crawl while downed now or is that the same yes im commenting without watching the whole video so shoot me lmfao is the frame rate uncapped on pc i cant wait to play this my favorite borderlands game that seemed to always be overshadowed by the games released after it finally its getting the recognition it deserves kinda makes sense though cause the controls for the original game were clunky af years after it released so going back to play it was annoying to say the least but hopefully with this remaster the controls feel more like they did in the presequel the person playing is painful is it up already thought it was on the 3rd every thing looks great but marcus looks like he has too much detail and seems to be a bit stiff beautiful absolutely gorgeous i cant wait to beat this game for the third time they added a mini map the one thing i wanted added to the first game its a buy for me boys borderlands 1 lags like crazy on pc did this remaster fix any of the lag theres a treasure chest on top of the bus my childhood in a nutshell man i missed this game my favorite one so many memories when life was much easier the intro always gave me goosebumps the heads dont seem to be exploding after a critical headshot kill i tried getting into the series back in the day i just couldnt 60 fps enhanced visuals mini map auto pick up fov slider new heads new skins new weapons uhhh yes please i hope they balanced characters lilith is just op while brick is the worst but most importantly does the sniper thing get fixed how do i pre order this on digital i dont see it on xbox store and i really dont wanna go somewhere to go get it will this be digital or physical only its not showing on xbox store to pre order or anything  is this going to be available for digital download on ps4 or only at gaystop i dont see the difference finally no need to manually pick up everything cant wait for b3s theme song aint no rest for the wicked and short change hero are awesome lilith lookin even more fine how can you forget the chest above the bus depot sorry but this doesnt look that much better from the original cant wait for zombie island much nostalgia so you want to hear a sto how tf do you buy this game ive been looking everywhere do you have to wait till it releases okthe minimap is a big oneonly this thing is a reason to replay for metextures looks sharperwhich is very pleasantand btwis it meor fov looks a bit betterthat was a huge issue for meall in alli am looking forward to replay this game again  so hyped for tomorrow so you want to hear a story crashes how about these stats on steam last night this game had over 28k players online thats more then eso and about 2 other mmorpgs had combined its amazing seeing so many people loading up b2 to get ready for b3 i highly recommend picking this game up on steam if you havent and to actually play with a big player base usually you can get the collectors edition for crazy cheap like 800 im so triggered that they didnt get the chest at the beginning everyone who knows even a little bit about borderlands gets the chest wow 1k likes thanks all i try b1 on xbox360 a couple weeks ago and shooting was terrible and annoying hope they fix that think im gonna have to rebuy this for next gen as i had a lot of fun with this game back in the day what that song called you could drown a toddler in panties right now also angel looks amazing looks no different to the original open the door we need your mom to come out and give us a hand everything got an upgrade other than angel she looks weird compared to the original bl1 xd is there an fov slider and did they fix the wackass pc mouse sensitivity only thing i hated with borderlands 1 and 2 was that ridiculous claptrap so badly written comedy if they could only get that right these games were excellent i played them to death wut this looks exactly like the original game im so confused how much will it be yes i know its a free update on steam looks the same game 4k which i bet you could achive trough nvidia dsrlmfao what a money grab whoever is getting this on xbox one drop gammertags luckyyyy i cant wait for this  so is this releasing tmr and if so how do i get it funny how the vid through utube is playing at 360 with the ultimate resolution set at 720 not 1080 suppose to be remastered for 4k yet utube strangles it with a lower resolution ceiling the game seems much more colorful i love this game anyone know how much it is was a remaster of this game really necessary lol is this epic exclusive  remasters people will always bash them and never understand how they work id start embracing them because theyre becoming more regular now developers and publishers are noticing theyve got a market remastering and remaking their old games if you like it or not hey they updated angels video too its vault hunter season again  how much will it costdoes someone know sooooooooooo great cant wait to play it again they could have skipped the 440 intro i hope the pc version has the same level of phsyx like 2 does because this looks exactly the same only minutely sharper is our cursor going to be constantly flashing on the mini map once again its on so much nostalgia especially her moaning does this remaster consists both 12  the map change is the best i forgot what happened in the game except for that vault in the end time to play this one again wow cool i want to try this game on my old college laptop to see if it still run yes claptraps there d awesome already i cant believe someone on your team wants b3 to be battle royale and to have character creation shame on them so many memoriesthat ending had me flipping tables which is better 1 or 2 there aint no rest for the wicked after the first 17minutes on this video dedicate your day to my channel looks the same imagine promoting you support a creator code while your not playing fortnite oh wait still the worst and most flawed shooter game ever dont try this turd and get borderlands 2 429 damn boi she thicc 429 thank me later so i just got a new xbox but ive been playing bls forever should i install the handsome collection before bls1 to get the 75 golden keys any 1 on borderlands goty ps4 wanna help me with the underdome moxxi madness level 5 100 rounds last 1 for me if you have the time join me psn darkd4444 this game worth a re buy so your job during this video was to mostly read out patch notes and have flashy gameplay in the background great content 1010 time to play borderlands again cant wait till 3 what makes pc players so special so i already own bl 1 tps and now i can get the remaster for free just like how i got skyrim legendary edition for free by owning the original they took lan out 010 the amazing ui improvements not worth i cant play online why its different from the original but a good kind of different and personally i fukin love it the only company not out for your wallet thank god gearbox is still around i know alot of there games arent a hit but they are good people if alittle cringy but good people i know im getting borderlands 3 you know the games gonna be good if a laptop struggles to run there video alone in 4k 60fps kidding but im excited  4 player split screen only for consoles what the heck why do devs always treat pc gamers as if they never have friends come over to their house im a big borderlands fan am looking forward to this but im also sick of no local multiplayer on pc how do i update it has anyone used the cross save feature worth noting that the first borderlands has been backwards compatible on xbox one for a while now seems odd that they keep saying it hasnt been available on there until now as long as they didnt patch the secret armory glitch and the legendary drop rate is the same this is a flawless remaster i had borderlands 1 on pc and played it 2 years ago never got the dlc was so happy to hear the remasterd goty will be free for us who own the vanilla version too i can read too you can sum it up lmao no need to read it word for word but did they nerf the crawmerax cheese also dat lilith ass nice never played it dude i can read myself am i able to restart the campaign in the second playthrough after i completed it once i dont know about you guys but all i ever fucking find are sniper rifles its gotten really old just gonna play the original no need to pay 30 bucks for slight visuals and auto loot i started playing borderlands about a week ago and am now level 23 and only now they release a remaster im so hyped but pissed at the same time it runs and plays like ass on xbox one and network connection problems and its being scalped by scalpers already 60 on ebay for a 30 game i finally finished my first run on b1 a few months ago gonna go for another run with the new update what is the best vault hunter for first time players does the dlc have multiple fast travel points thats the one thing lacking that makes the experience super tiring everytime jumping back into the dlc map only to spawn at where i started just to get to the point i left off sound congested af nice video though is it going to be possible to transfer an existing borderlands account to the remaster what if i buy the old game and then upgrade would that be possible considering the old game u can get ir for peanuts i got it for free thats how communism works just a few random quality of life fixes too which are amazing include the ability to skip the opening logos when you first open the game as well as increased run speed similar to bl2 both of those things were pretty annoying in the first game i wish the remaster was free on console too cause i have a digital copy of borderlands 1 but i play on xbox one and its backwards compatible so i guess i can still play borderlands 1 on a current gen system before i get the goty edition no mention of bug fixes for non functioning weapon features yeah man we can read too so you showed nothing empty video still not a fan of fall damage downloading the remaster now for a replaymight buy the split screen 4 player option for my ps4 hell ya finally the whole collection now the q are they going to include it with borderlands 3 as freebie when preordering deluxe or super deluxe if so then i jst blew my nut gave my walls a new paint borderlands style a couple things i noticed about the remastered version 1 the game gives a warning about my system being below minimum specifications even though it runs with no problem afterwords on a system that runs dark souls 3 at both 1080p and 2k 2 it shows the graphics card as an integrated intel windows live graphics rather than the installed card radeon rx 550 4 gb ddr5 anyone else notice this or a similar problem i just wish the fight for your life gave you a little mobility for you to kill the enemies behind cover wonder if the game still has willowtree support coz fuck the standard inventory limit 500 slot is more acceptable for this type of game it better have all the same glitches its not showing up as free for me why wow it actually looks better than bl3 minimum effort to squeeze another 59 bucks out of retarded fanboys i guess but will npcs have moving mouths dr neds is still my favorite zombie game hyperion is pleased good thing i already have the goty version wow free for pc users what about console players who already have all the dlc and the base game to begin with kinda seems a little unfair in my opinion too bad epic is a blight on gaming as a whole so can we still glitch crawmerax with lilith gimme doz pearls i have borderlands 2 on steam but i didnt get the golden keys or the weapons when i started the bl1 remaster anyone know why why is he reading everything as a question learn how to intonate dude moving on to another video the fact youre able to play for free of you own the original game is simply amazing i love gear box is there still modded weapons please someone let me know where to purchase borderlands 1 remastered  dont forget that they added fov slider too is the two player split screen now cut horizontally instead of vertically that was a big reason i havent played in a while all really cool and all especially the part about it being free for pc for those who already own the game but i doubt i will play it much i didnt much care for the original games special abilities for the characters especially lilliths kinda dull knox floor farming will be fixed so end game wont keep many players playing can golden keys be used across all borderlands games also love your videos c this is wack ok so i own bl1 and hjc and i dont get bl1 for free in console really fucking microsoft and sony they did it so they can make some momey from there stupid store thats one of the reasons i use team most of the time calling it now the locked the good weapon drops behind the shift loot boxes all i wanted from a rerelease was support for more resolutions and fov slider why do they have to ruin the only good game in the series does anyone know if the dlcs scale to your level because before it was horrible you literally crushed all the dlc after beating the main game it was stupid for instance the zombie dlc it would only be like level 20 your first time around so if you beat the main game and you was level 35 the dlc would be dead content which i thought was dumb and if it does scale is it for both play throughs i know they fixed it for the last dlc in the original but they never did for the others which was wierd if anyone knows for sure you would be a god send no free upgrade for consoles kinda dumb as for it being available for the first time it was already on xbox one through bc does anybody know how is the vram usage in this remastered for 1080p i have a gtx 1050 it seems like yesterday borderlands 1 came out now here we are talking about borderlands 3where did the days go yes its a free upgrade if you already have the digital version oh and you cant convert you original physical copy as of march 28th this means the original physical copy is useless now thanks 2k thanks for the notices wait they are making the destroyer a better fight improving a boss fight in a remaster is a thing goddamnit fromsoftware you could have fixed the bed of chaos can we move our character from the original to the remaster  360 character imports okay who would play this 4 player splitscreen borderlands 2 handsome collection is 94 off on steam unfortunately borderlands is not onsale well i got a 9 gb update but nothing changed and i dont have my missing dlc i dont get it whennthis comes out in the ps4 store what if i have the handsome jack collection on onex free upgrade or do i need to buy it again wish they added borderlands 2 characters like krieg why you showing me 4k pictures on 1080p video thinking 60fps on consoles ive played the first on xbox one backwards compatibility but keen on this if 60fps as of midnight and this morning its not anywhere to be found on steam whats up with your pronunciation borderleeds whats that wow lilith ass lookin tight why pc owners get it for free hows that fair id read the comment section but you pc faggots ruin it with your im going to get it free well no shit tell yo momma she wont have to waste anymore of her money on ya i just would like to read about gameplay and new items so instead of commenting on shit that everyone already knows about shut the fuck up and let the real gamers comment  i dont think i will get it unless one of the guns can out do the orger bastard man i miss that gun and or the serpens is this even out i dont see it on xbox stores yet hope they added that you can transfer saves no skill tree over hall bummer lilith is like like the only usable character will it be sold as a disk so this game can be played coop through the whole campaign anyone have a price these fcking golden keys i hate the golden keys  honestly they never patched many glitches that where problematic for bl1 and as well some glitches with bl2 like hyperius lockout voracidous impossible to solo and ancient dragons impossible to solo as well but thankfully i soloed the dragons with a lyuda method and no grog nozzle other glitches like jakobs cannons or dahl grenadier or etech being glitched and hope the bitch from bl1 gets its critical fixed or else its just a waste of a remake im assuming itll be 60 fps or higher on consoles i can read why the heck are you reading the release notes verbatim  im absolutely blown away at the fact that you get this for free if you have the old borderlands by the looks of things it fixes a good couple of the problems i had with bl1 such as meh visuals at least for me and the lack of a minimap and i get these fixes for free thats crazy thats amazing can we transfer our save character from the old gen i always wanted to play borderlands but felt it was too late this might be my chance will it be an update if you already have borderlands installed to get the stuff or do you have to rebuy it you think it will be ready tonight at midnight note to pc users backup your old version of borderlands they are making the original more like bl2 it will be less singleplayer friendly by making it more difficult it will more than likely get nerfed and no longer rain legendary are purple rarity weapons and items as it now does and you can kiss that general knox armory glitch goodbye warned game of the year 10 years later will borderlands remastered be in handsome collection i hope they fixed some abilities like bloodwing rolands turret or bricks ability damage and u mean april 4th for the aussies lol doing a playthrough of borderlands but im gonna get this free upgrade tomorrow hoping i will still have my character ive never been as hyped for a game in a while thank you so much borderlands i dont even see it on the marketplace is it out or not only real reason released is so we can play 1 2 and the presequal before the 3rd comes out to refresh yourself on the lore always remember yoteslaya rip a rebalance would bem nice really hope rocket launchers have been fixed wish i can get the update on my xbox 360  can i get this on digital ps4 ubisoft and from software should learn from gearbox not to charge their games twice to those who already bought it on steam i was wondering why there was an export character option does this mean if you just buy borderlands now you will get the upgrade and all the dlc for free  so pc gets a free update if they already own it but wht if i already own it on console do i still have to pay for the game again because that doesnt sound fun also if it was already mentioned in the video i obviously missed it i have the handsome collocation what do i get can i use my ps3 save and upload it to the ps4 version does it patch any glitches i quite like the general knoxx glitch for the shift rewards it mentions returning users from xbox one and ps4 get 75 golden keys does that mean i would have to play the handsome collection and playing borderlands 2 on xbox one using backwards compatibility doesnt count bungie take notes this is how you make a good fps game all this is useless if there is no fov slider or lower sensitivity i was hoping they would include badass rank in bl1 but otherwise these are some pretty satisfying changes its getting a re master why does pc get it free though hopefully they didnt remove the arenas of borderlands 1 2 and presequel 1 has always been my favorite ive just felt that it always had the best variety of loot would be nice to have a toggle for the autopickup but its not a big deal either way im sure theres an ini setting or something i assume this will be a separate game entry on steam which is fine but the big question remains did they fix the armory glitch in knoxx 430 thats a really thicc chest damn lilith what if ive played the handsome collection on ps4 and not the original bl2 or presequel will i still get the bonus weapons and stuff well worth my money hahaha its free what about us console players i own bl1 the 360 edition why not give us the update or game for free like pc damn will i be able too transfer my character pls let you pick up stuff by walking over it all they needed to do was add a play through reset it sucks that after you play through twice you are done im so happy ive been waiting so long for this borderlands hype is absolutely real booted bl2 on the handsome collection back up for the first time in ever gonna play through all that again still better than any other loot shooter out there ima be buying it on console to play it with some of my friends as well as getting my free upgrade on my pv its only going digital only on pc thats a big hell yes its also 60fps now i believe  so wait its not going to an update to the handsome collection on console whens the update supposed to release for the handsome collection the visual and quality update wait i get this for free bl1 is one of the games that got my wife into video games we still play it to this day on the regular one of the best games ive played and my one of my favorites this might sound weird but i hope they didnt fox any drop rates is the shitty mouse sens in settings menus gonna be fixed though please do not fix the knoxx exploit d im glad they made qol changes its rough going back and playing the first one but these all sound like good changes 4 26 is that a nilla wafer top hat from gmm so is it only physical copys or can u get the digital version on ps4 if digital do u have to wait till its released to get it cuz theres no preorder i really like how console players dont get it for free if they have the original thats kind of unfair since it is buyable on xbox not sure about playstation sweet i am glad i own it on steam its only 30 bucks as well so what if i only have the base game not game of the year edition i do get free remaster 3 because i see the goty edition on steam right now and its like 40 something wrong or i hope they decided to build it on the new engine instead of redoing it in the old engine it had its charmes but for me borderlands 1 feels too slow paced compared to borderlands 2 and the pre sequel well thanks for reading the developers information sheet to us i guess and thats only 75 sarcastic not free on consoles guess i aint picking it up is pre sequel before borderlands 1 or after how to play all in series before borderlands 3  i knew buying borderlands on steam was worth it will the free upgarde work if i buy borderlands on steam now its available for a good price of inr 999 i own all the borderlands on xbox 360 except for pre sequal and all the games including one backwards compatible on xbox one it would have been nice to just get it added for free to handsome collection or to get a code for long time players but i wont complain i just probably wont buy it for a while i never played borderlands is this worth a purchase do we have a release time for the update on steam would this be 40 or 60 its a resale of the game so 40 would make sense hmm i wonder if i swoop the original borderlands for 20 bucks on steam right now ill be able to upgrade to the game of the year edition so does the handsome collection get a free upgrade i jusg got the handsome collection and im just waiting to get the game of the year edition of bl1 so i can play through them all before 3 comes out very hyped to start this series  i have the game of the year edition on my xboxone will i have to pay for the update so if i buy and download this onto my xbox one at my buddies who has internet will i be able to take this back to my house and play it without a internet connection i just dont wanna buy borderlands one again and not even be able to play this version please make inventory slot expansions not missable do you know if the upgraded version will be more stressful on older computers cause mine can run borderlandspresequal just fine right now but its getting pretty old suppose ill find out the hard way but do they have dynamic scaling borderlands installed and prepped shame my friend went to another work schedule now well have to wait till saturday to play together never had the oppurnity to play the original on ps3 so im so happy about i loved the handsome collection so i cant wait to put my hands on this one btw i did not know it was out tomorrow o i learnt it from a friend  shows 4k images video tops at 1080p where the fuck is the fov slider i started playing the original again and although i have all dlc im tempted to buy this again for xbox one in prep for the 3rd game hopefully they update fight for your life too i loved bl1 but sometimes you got downed behind a rock or wall that you literally couldnt save yourself from the screen would sometimes go black to where it was too difficult to see anything hopefully they add crawling to fight for your life wait what it comes out on the third holy fuck hahaha niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice anthem has nothing on even this a remastered game from 10 years ago so can i preorder borderlands one on the xbox store  can i play with somebody on the xbox360 backwards compatible version while im playing the new goty edition yo not free on xbox man thats mad its kind of weird that it isnt free on console especially since my backwards compatibilized version got a 700ish mb update the other day theyve had like 3 game of the year editions already why do you say borderlainds ummm you can already play the first borderlands on xbox one its backwards compatible when youre most excited for auto ammo and money pickups gearbox knows what there doing with there games sooo is there a way for people on console to get this for free cause thats fucking bullshit how are you gonna pass this shit out for free to so many people then tell others to fuck off like that that honestly makes me want to keep my money thats just unfair garbage you still cant play it on xbox 360 if its a digital download jokes aside is it gonna be on 360 and ps3 i get paid on april 3rd bitching i really hope they added a fov slider glad i have bl1 on pc d thank you for the information glad i have the game on steam still borderlands 1 already is playable on xbone through backwards compatibility wht the fuck do we have to buy the game again free for pc owners of the original stop i can only get so erect can u move while in fight for your life i could swear i was playing borderlands on my xbox 1 a few months ago all available and reaylike why does gamestop have exclusive pre order i was hoping to pre load this and play at midnight  remember to subscribelike and share the video at least say please first wait they are fixing the ending boss from the base game finaaaalllllyyyyyy although the 4k looks fantastic considering the original was released on xbox 360 the 1080p on xbox will still be a vast improvement definitely one ill be getting cant wait to this coming out will anyone help me run thru tps on xb1 quickly so i can get the 75 keys and stuff on the borderlands remaster i played tps on 360 but didnt care for it so didnt bother playing it when i got the handsome collection pls modestokidd is my gt the real question is this 2 player split screen will it be a top bottom split because ps3 is left right only for borderlands 1 and that kills it for my wife we love bl2 and the top bottom split if i buy it for ps4 i get all dlc never played borderlands today i bought handosme colection 999eurobut have to wait to get borderlands 1 for start playing in order does anyone really want to do moxxys dlc again lol i got all the achievements for that game on the 360 and that dlc sticks in my mind as being one of the most mind numbing that and collecting stuff for claptrap great game though would buy hopefully the mini map helps with those quests where you had to run around like an idiot trying to find all the parts so i have the original game of the year addition on ps3 why is it steam players get it free and not anyone who has the previous gen copies they shoyld have to pay for the remaster as well not like they dont have mods to make it seem better than vanilla release joseph joestar yess yesssss but for those who have borderlands plus handsome jack digital on xbox are just out of luck so what about those that own the hansome collection let me get this straight if i have the handsome collection on ps4 its not free but on pc it is  did you seriously just read that post and call it a video purchase pc gets this as free update if already own game man i wish crossplay was a lot more prevalent in video games nowadays borderlands game of the year edition is on ps4 through psnow ps3 version so its not the 1st time on ps4 just to be picky im completely losing my damn mind rip anthem can you buy it digitally for ps4 why do you say it like borderleynds can someone tell me some good mods for bl1 2 and the sequel or mainly bl2 why is it only free for pc pc players arent the only people who are original borderlands players  if i have borderlands the handsome collection do i get it for free for pc do i need the base game or the goty for this upgrade would you say they patched the armoury glitch i still own this for my ps2 wheres my free copy pc gets it why cant i i hop they did not update the armory glitch xd no coop ill just wait for 3 soo hey i dont have to waste my money on a game i allready have nice can we please get borderlands 1 and 2 on the nintendo switch please thats bs i have the 360 version of borderlands on my xbox one x so that should give it free aswell although everything else is cool im guessing its not cross platform  this comes out on my birthday does anyone know if fall damage was taken out what if i have the hard copy of borderlands do i still get the remastered for free or not cause it will suck if we cant due to having it on cd all those years ago what about fall dmg  borderlands was the first game i ever got when i got my xbox 360 cant wait for the third one but the remastered is my number one priority i wonder if they fixed the drop ratethem registering for those collectible in the claptrap dlc yas getting it free i kinda regretted buying the game knowing remaster was coming out but getting upgrade free is fantastic 3 auto pickup ammo now thats a sell for me whats the price should be game of the decade this does have adjustable fov on console right where is this on the store for xbox cause i dont see it  autohealth pickup is a bad one the great thing about bl1 is when one person is at 95 hp and another at 10 you could just delegate the health drops to that person now youve gotta watch your step or the wrong person will be healed also yes health pickups are important roland is boring  you remastered the wrong dog yeah moves like this make me want to support a company will definitely be buying bl3 to support them it would be so good if we could transfer items between characters wtf to pc players get the handouts i have the game on both but prefer console the choice would be nice auto pick up was all you had to say to make this an instant buy am i the only one who hopes that tks wave is buffed oh so pc your good but console you get screwed 4k lilith ass and cleavage thats easily 60 i hope they improved some farming aspects ps4 too borderlands 1 the last borderlands game where legendaries were actually worth something dude i fucking thought the green line that appears when you transits between screens hot of the changelog was my phones screen getting defective great video thank you man  does anyone know the price i own bl2 and all the dlc does that get me bl1 for free i read somewhere that if you owned any of the games youd get it every borderlands player i know liked number 2 better except methe first one i felt more like i was teaveling through a true desolate planet in search of unknown wonders other game devs in 2019 charges users for something as small as a red dot sight gearbox offers an entire remastered version of the game for free to current owners god bless you gearbox and the game is 30 for the people who havent found out already how much is it gonna be whats the price i been playing this game since 2009 on my pc lol so if you own the original digitally on steam you get the remastered for free thats kinda bs cause i have it digitally on xbox one but i have to pay for this i already have it pre ordered borderlands 1 has been readily available on xbox one for quite a while now via backwards compatibility wait if i have a regular xbox one it wont have all the graphic upgrades free for pc i hope that one of the quality of life updates was to add fast travel stations to the knoxx dlc all i need is a fov slider cuz the original had me weak af will they leave the gory stuff in like headshots and gibbing or has it been watered down like bl2 im surprised nobody is asking if the bosses are going to be farmable in this version unlike the original really looking forward to the bl1 remaster as we wait for bl3 release just hope they dont fuck with the business model 4 screen co op thats plenty reason for the purchase get over here wallet second game i would be getting for free cause i have the previous version first one was skyrim a ten year old game better than any modern looter shooter all hail the king baby this is all fantastic but i am still hoping for 2 things not mentioned 1 fast travel in dlc locations 2 draco executioner and penetrator fixes will it run 4k and 60fps on a ps4 pro cant wait to get this from the upgrade is the option 2 transfer bd1 ps3 save to ps4 i have some friends that have played part 2 but never the first perfect chance to run it with them so excited  in the bl3 trailer i think that 1 big wheeled vehicle is a the gadget dudes special ability granted its not that big of an update on the pc its pretty much just a hi res texture pack and some ui changes i have bl1 on last gen will i still get it for free on next gen when it comes out or will i need to re buy the game yoteslaya would be proud i own borderlands so i guess i get it for free im excited for the endgame its gonna bring a big smile on my face seeing the loot i shoulda got 9 years ago  ill play borderlands 3 but wont be going back in time to replay borderlands 1 because ill be playing borderlands 3 is it still remastered without a xbox one x and ps4 pro funny as hell this game thats hella old gets more new content and updates than black ops 4  the same day this comes out is the same day i start baseball practice wish me luck does anyone have a link for those 4k images im so hyped eh eh ok ill leave  question is will we be able to farm bosses via savequit hoping someone can fill in the gaps for me so for xbox one bl goty edition will be sold as a standalone game correct will i also be able to buy bl2 remastered as a standalone game my other questions are if i bought bl1 right now for xbox 360 xbox one backwards compatible come april 3rd will i get the update for free same question applies for bl2 were excluding the presequel out of all of this rest in peace yoteslaya honestly this game does not age well in terms of gameplay went back to play it the other day the gunplay just felt horrible after ive been playing destiny for so long i have never played borderlands before but i love looter shooters and i want to try borderlands should i buy the handsome collection or buy the remastered im confused will we still fight the boss beast i hope they dont change the final fight too much yeah but did they tweak the red chest farm in new haven heard they lowered the chests there to the white sucky chests that was my favorite legendary weapons farm before the dlc gearbox does know that borderlands 1 is already backwards compatible man this is such a big overhaul imagine being the one person who never stopped playing borderlands 1 for the last 10 years this is probably a life changing moment but what about a field of view slider for pc love being on pc all the remasters are free for us how much is the game going to be will there be an fov slider in game like with borderlands 2 and pre sequel always hated how close everything was on borderlands 1 alright youtube ill watch it for fucks sake i was so ready to give gearbox all my money again and they are giving it to me for free gotta love this guys not free for console users who have the backward compatibility versions  why do you not have the change notes linked in the video description wait so if i have the original 360 version i basically have to rebuy it enough changes to justify purchase i mean it being available is enough for me idc if they changed nothing so many unanswered questions 1has the fat travel system been reworked especially for the dlcs 2have the talents and coms been reworked especially broken ones 3 what about all the display bugs that hid gear abilities and stats 4 how many customizable head options are there just the 5 just saying there is more to find out beyond the press release i cringed everytime you said borderleendslmao like whyyyy they bought me at picking up ammo and cash by walking over them i just bought the game of the year edition of the game just for the remaster i figured the price might go up a little once it is out i always noticed that the weapons would change levels between equipping dropping or putting them into your backpack that always bothered me and seemed buggy will this be fixed never played og im hyped as fuck for this i really hope they add a fov slider for the pc version thats honestly my 1 issue with bl1 so basically its not worth buying againok im not annoyed anymore that its free for pc owners that already have it but not console owners what about the fov slider 75 degree angle is ridiculous its only 30 for ps4 n xbox one so yeah its worth it to use the capture feats and play with better graphics why do pc players get it for free if they already own the original but console people dont this video was exactly 5 minutes long didnt know id be getting this for free awesome thank you past me for your poor purchases d so it gets to be free on pc but not console for why thats very bullshit and you cant even pull it cant detect the old game cuz it can so this better also work on console come launch free to existing owners on pc i nutted i hope that they tweak the projectile speed of the rockets they were so slow that i only saw them viable with liliths high velocity maxed out oh my lord thank god i can toggle the borderlands 2 style mini map off but to be honest im a little upset they arent giving everyone the preorder weapons i was playing on my xbox one a few months ago and i received them for some reason those weapons are amazing after being able to try them i am truly upset we arent getting them via steam with the upgrade or at all on the consoles what about the controls the gunay is kinda dated even though i played it on ps3 and xbone 360 im still going to buy it can u split the screen in orizontal now if we own this on xbox will it become free when it comes out bc i have the 360 version will you be able to buy it digitally weird thing the day of the announcement my 360 copy of bl1 downloaded an updatei wonder the real question is will the general knox armory glitch still work so if you have the handsome collection do you still have to buy it on ps4 sucks because i owned bl1 on ps3 but oh well i want bl1 so i dont have to deal with ps now stream bullshit the delay is just weird and makes me not want to play it i was getting the game either way but it bums me out how pc gets it for free i have the original downloaded from the microsoft store wish it worked the same i guess having given bl1 a try again today there are a few things immediately jumping out at me no in game aa option narrow fov with keybinds needed to change it highly irritating zoom out fov on sprint 1 is and always has been my favorite i love the tone and setting so much more is borderlands remastered separate from the handsome collection so happy i love the original i think 2k are giving the free versions for multiple reasons some games they have been a part ofbattle born and evolve were never successful and evolve ar least died due to greed there are a lot of gaming companies going wrong weight now and getting more dislikes than likes most importantly though i think 2k and gearbox actually care about the borderlands series and its a way for us to enjoy borderlands now as we wait for borderlands 3 borderlands has been the least greedy series of all time with the handsome collection for new consoles at the time or the sales on steam all the time that make the game and dlcs cheap for this reason i doubt they will do full on microtransactions that are in any way worse than borderlands 2 does anyone know if it will have a fov toggle are the remasters going to be price at 60 i already have all others will there be crossplay with pc and console do we know if they got rid of fall damage and can you move around in ffyl like in later games i hope we can import ps3 saves to ps4 can someone tell me what this released on like steam or epic games store i dont see any information about where to purchase it anywhere 310 borderlands 1 was free one month on xbox one a while back though what about fov slider anyone know i think its bullshit pc players who own the game get the remastered version for free if they already own it i own the backwards compatible pack and i have to buy the remastered version such cunt bullshit thats how you hype people for a game rerelease the original in hdfor free i would love to see them add a couple slot machines and maybe the grinder i was 10 year when borderlands 1 came out its 30 for ps4 gearbox is one of the few developers who actually give a shit about their player base who is gonna be playing this online on pc free i cant wait im glad they added auto loot feature for ammo money and health pick ups and also implementing the mini map but talking about the final boss is he gonna be refarmable cause you would only face him once through each playthrough but you couldnt have the chance to fight him again to be honest i dont think he dropped loot at all i dont remember if dr ned was refarmable either i hope they add more fast travel locations in 3 of the dlcs cause the only fast travel locations where at the start of each dlc like tbone junction jakobs cove and the other one i actually am playing through the game right now and im not too far in on my way to kill sledge will i be able to use my current save when i upgrade or will i have to start over cross play all this doesnt sound like an april fools gag when you search it only the pc version comes up guess well see its also about old players experiencing a repopulated online especially without mods being available every single server unlike the 360 version idk about you guys but thats just the way i feel as long as the reaper is patched i can not wait how much is it gonna cost for xbox one thank got its getting auto pick up now so is this an update or new game  what if you only have the base game and not goty edition so no dlc can you still get the free upgrade wait is there no digital for xbox i think a fun skin for roland would be one with a hole in his chest happy i got on pc how much is it on console gearbox is really setting this right for the players hopefully bl3 is better the the presequel so fans can finally get what they deserve they seem to be on the right track that is how you make customers buy the the same game over and over again marketing at its peak performance tip the hat dont get me wrong i got myself several examples of borderlands 2 just wanna point out that genius move itd be nice if we could transferupload game saves from the original borderlands saved on the older consoles like ps3 to the newly remastered version on the ps4 youll be able to upgradeabsolutely free we here at the torgue corporation sincerely think that this is fcking awesome enough changes to justify a purchase was that a joke the updated graphics and minimap are worth it alone not to mention skins new guns updated boss mechanics gold chest to clarify for me and a couple friends is it a stand alone thing or do you automatically get it if you own the handsome jack collection on xbox or ps4 bro i played this when it came out really hoping they fixed the fov and shittier mouse sensitivity is it free on ps4 you forgot to add your opinionverdict noextra fast travel in the dlcs gear boxgood news were remastering bl1 medang i dont have any money gear boxpfff why do we need money mehuh gear boxyou have a pc meyes gear boxits free for pc users me d i just hope that developer chest i grinded for days is still gonna be there when the remaster gets released oh what shiny new loot will i get next d i really hope they fixed the bugs and hitbox issues the amount of times in bl1 you would aim a sniper perfectly at a guys head and it somehow body shots him or just misses all together is so stupid i cant find confirm about update graphic enhance for xbox or ps4 for me it is xbox so i already own borderlands for xbox 360 and already backward for it so update for that or have to buy new one for xbox one only its wierding me out i cant pre order a digital copy on xbox store but i can pre order it on other wb sites like gearbox and gamestop bs i am panicking there gonna be no digital on xbox anyone know if i buy the game right now on pc will i get the remastered version for free omg fucking god i didnt even know this also my bday is on the 8th so im getting this game but im mad because my borderlands handsome collection dont work like its clean in referring to my disc but its not working i got a new ps4 and its still not working omg yasss i literally got done with maxing out roland and lilith again on pc now imma do it all over again with a big grin on my face biggest quality of life change possible in bl1 the ability to reset playthroughs i wonder if the loot system is like bl2 have to farm certain enemies for weapons might as well add uvhm to it too i pre ordered it for xbox one x via 2k store i like physical cop plus the psycho looks badass will we get an ammo auto pick up i thought that the remaster would be more advanced than that way borderlands 2 the playability will remain the same as in 2009 a little outdated for a game 2019 when we kill the 2 presequel and we just see the trailer of 3 lol why would we replay at 1 just because the graphics are more correct  i am so happy for having this on my steam anyone notice how they havent really shown any of the head customizations for rolandkinda weird when it ses xbox one dose it mean ones onex lets say i buy borderlands after the release of the update is the update still free or do i have to pay on top of borderlands looks like i will make my friend play this with me  so you can now get legendary weapons from golden keys but can i bring my old characters over from ps3 like 2 or tps if i can get my ps3 save on ps4 then i will definitely get this so they probably arent patching the armory glitch but are they gonna patch the reaper vengeance draco and all the other weapons that were screwed over by bugged effects i tried borderlands 1 on psnow but felt clunky and blurry is that how it ran back then i did enjoy borderlands 2 and will probably buy this game few days after launch or so if i can see a big difference 75 omfg thats so many so aas its all one big game does that mean that the dlc loot is now part of the entire loot pool can i get pearls in the base game for example i hope we can farm the ajax ogre easily now not having to drive all the way over there so i have borderlands 2 what should i buy borderlands the handsome collection or borderlands on steam because the handsome collection is cheape than borderlands to get an upgrade and play borderlands remastered i a little confused  im going for 100 completion when it comes out you guys thinks its worth getting if i already have the goty edition on xbox one thru backwards compatibility its a shame the heads are unlocked from the start unless it means you get 5 but theres more to unlock also wish the ui was changed to the bl2 style 60fps so now i can but it again on playstation does it cross save  i just hope they fixed the skill mods to work like bl2never had much trouble extrapolating the numbers but bl2 made it visually better bit of a money grab im on xbox and have them all already is it worth paying again for the same game nah especially as its free to pc players remember the ledge when battling crawmerax they cant take that out because they featured a little throwback message from lilith in borderlands 2 son of crawmerax this is a good day for pc users  what about splitscreen on pc the original had a darker vibe a creepy feeling to the world and i still love this game i cant wait to play it again and i really hope they added in that fov slider this time and fixed jumping lol console players if you at all want to play this i guarantee the 60fps with better graphics on a modern console is worth the 30 alone can we move in fight for life or let rolands turret stay up in fight for life i cannot wait there aint no rest for the wicked wait do i get upgraded if i own only the base game pc this is borderlands 2 with a borderlands 1 storymap what more could we wish for given how much of an improvement was 2 over 1 well i never really got into the first one for some reason played it and finished it but dont remember much and didnt get the dlcs so ill be definitely getting this and 75 keys damn straight when remaster relasehow i can update itthrough steam library given from the patch notes im guessing movement during ffyl is still a no go doesnt bother me either way but im kinda glad it stuck in so now if you have borderlands goty can we actually download the dlcs and there would be an update or am i just retarded and misunderstood everything im just happy that they really listened to the players cant wait for this but i really think its bullshit how only pc is getting it for free yeah pc has been playing it with nice graphics and frames for years but console players bought borderlands back in the day too we spent the same amount of cash what a treat im just wondering why borderlands 1 on my xbox 1 got an update ive tried to look to see if there were changes sad that there is still no mac release bought a key for the goty for 12  they need to be reinstalled or will be applied a patch a pc version in on the line i dont understand yeeees i have just buyed recently borderlands for mere 7 and now i get the upadated goty edition for free 3 i think the experience of playing it with friends doing all the co op stuff i missed when i played through it alone will definitely be worth the 25 i think its a well priced game online coop price tag for ps4 would be cool if they added more vault hunters from 2 and the presequel to the game even if its not cannon wait every uhd remasters including the one of the oldest game are gonna be free for people that already own the original games gearbox thats so sweet  does the pc upgrade apply to mac cool i already have it all on steam cant wait im here for it how andor when will i receive my free update i bought borderlands goty on steam and im not seeing anything on steam about a free upgrade to the goty remastered version i played all the borderlands games not including tales for 8 years on my ps3 and i finally got an xbox one and now a remaster of borderlands 1 on the xbox one where i have no pre existing data edit im making one of each character to get to level 72 im making better characters than before excuse me wheres the fov slider his is so far the best break down on the new borderlands 1 remaster keep up the good work this makes so happy that ever since day one gearbox and its content creators have honesty on the will to make great items for consumers i hope they add tvh uvhm and op8 including a raise to the level cap would be soooo sweeeeet im super excited for this remastered game i didnt even find out until now that there remastering the first borderlands game thats fucking insane and awesome i get it for free because i already own it on steam sweet i wouldve loved a performance mode on the enhanced consoles id prefer 60 fps over the 4k graphics personally still super excited no fucking way i think gearbox is my favorite gaming company right now i really get the remaster for freeeeeee will they ever fix the fact that the crimson lance npcs dont fight the bandit npcs even though they are clear enemies this is going to be the best remaster ever can i get a fucking fov slider jesus christ so i had a few questions or comments did they leave fall damage in the game or was it removed like in bl2 on the info about the new legendary weapons they said something about using gooden keys to collect them all does this mean you can get a legendary from the golden chest in this game my final thought was just that i hope they left things like the armory glitch sledges shotgun jumping with allies and hybrid legendaries untouched as theyve become as much a part of the game as anything else in it finally just love your videos mate keep up the great work huge fan any mention of fov slider i hope its not 60 but it most likely will wonder if the remaster will recognize any save data from last gen consoles meaning if you played bl1 on your xbox one will the remaster recognize those saves i lost my fucking shit at 318 i cant wait to hop back in woooooooooooooooooooooo do you still take fall damage is there a mod that patches that out what about voice overs for side quests refinements to the ai the ability to walk down the street without the same enemy you killed 3 minutes ago popping out again do borderlands 3 supposed to be released april 3rd too my inner completionist hopes they fixed the challenges that would not accumulate like the hang time counter that stopped at 2232ms or whatever most annoying this is going to be realllly expensive for me though i will need an xbox one x and a 4k tv so that is 200000 cdn right there worth it to be ready for bl3 hopefully you can have horizontal split screen on console now almost worth playing again for that feature alone so nothing about the fight your life from bl 2  what about the most important console framerates will wait for reviews then but looks good i just hope the dlcs are less boring i have bad memories of me just driving around in knoxxs dlc great news cant wait till it comes out free btw on my pc mini map auto pick up and fov slider sold me i need it now i love this cant wait to play my favorite games again  but did they fix the sprint are they gonna fix multiplayer when it comes to people using modded guns and shields thats what killed it for me last couple of gens they just didnt give enough details on this i need moar like is there going to be true and ultimate vault hunter modes how about level scaling pearlescent weapons and vehicles from knoxx elsewhere on the game i love how you made a short video when most people would make long unnecessary videos i really hope its not a full 60 dollars i hope they fix the balancing in the early areas and have endgame weapons hit harder i always felt underpowered while playing bl1 even after doing all the sidequests in each area i already have the handsome jack collection is that different from this i cant wait for two borderland games in one year basically i didnt care until it was free cheers lads please put fast travels in dlcs or just knoxx at least do we by chance have a price yet for the game that is my biggest question ive been looking and cant find anything i dont get it you just spoke out loud everything players couldve just looked up come here little one time to die are they gonna give this game feedback like in bdl2 if not im hoping for a community patch whats your source website i wanna look at the stuff in detail i hope they finally fixed the bugs spawn and class of weapons i am talking about the reapers weapon effect maliwan and ss crux penetrator and draco can you play this game co op online im overwhelmed by the amount of new features i didnt expect this much so mad moxxis underdome riot is going to be a difficulty spike or did they fix the problem with one of the bosses it would be nice for random level instead of the same level as your character unless the devs fix that in general does this mean all or atleast most bosses will have a designated loot pool going to buy everything when i have the chance on my xbone x p b1 b2 pre sequel and of course when its released b3 oh i can so not wait for it  i dont understand why consoles that own the game already on the account dont get it free as well i own borderlands 1 all dlc borderlands 2 360 all dlc borderlands pre 360 all dlc borderlands handsome collection gimme the free original if they patch the armory bug imma be pissed will farm knoxx again and again still the absolute best farmingroute this will hold me over till bl3 release definitely gonna beat both play throughs while going down memory lane i expect the release of bl3 will be in may or june all these changes are cool but did they fix fast travel in the dlcs did they fix the weapons that needed to be fixed like the penetrator and the draco and what about the missions will they scale when you beat the game and what about knox did they fix the glitch where we can get into the armory there a lot more stuff they needed to fix in the old version of the game and not just a mini map this is the reason why borderlands is the best looter shooter 1 how much will it cost 2 take my money 3 seriously just take my wallet damn the 3rd needs to hurry up and come already 1 will the oh it does address bl1 is for free retracted statement bl2 remasters cost money or will it do what some remasters have done in the past and give to existing pc players for free 2 did pax east address the hidden steam database files on possible new content coming to bl2 or tps to address the gap between bl2 and bl3 either it was all fake updates or they are adding something but not until bl3 has a launch month is ther a ng mode because it doesnt existed in the original did somebody know it  can you play online with your friends report is if you own borderlands on steam pc and dont have the dlc you get those for free free visual upgrade a few question remain that well have to find only after the release 1 do dlc maps get fast travel on pc we have oasis mod console players cant 2 will backpack sdu be a guaranteed reward on all modes currently on tvhm sdu may be awarded from claptrap rescue 3 is it fully compatible with windows 10 hope so bl2 causes some problem in windows 10 setting compatibility to win7 doesnt help please tell me roland and brick got buffed lilith and mordecai both were weak in playthrough 1 but overpowered in playthrough 2 brick and roland were underpowered as hell in playthrough 2 the hpye is real roll on wed bl12 update auto pick up on ammo cash is gonna make the game feel much more smooth cant wait to jump into bl1 on the 3rd im on ps4 psn is redrick9148 if anyone want to join me very chill dude with mic if i buy borderlands base game only on steam right now will i get all the dlcs free on april 3rd with the remaster justify a purchase they said its a free upgrade for those that all ready have it or is it only for pc users what about claptrap announcing missions at the bounty board every 10 seconds that was very annoying can you finally move around when you get knocked down im an og borderlands player im buy borderlands 1 game of the year ps4 remake that is nice and stuff but does it have a fov slider thanks god i already had the original borderlands on my library i had a feeling that told me to pick it up for some reason and here is the reason hmm is nice waitwill we have stash yesss hd lilith bum ya got me at free for previous owners on pc im waiting to hear about the fov and since i have pre sequel on steam i will recive 75 gooden keys for free right i never had the chance to play the dlc on the first game i will now could i play remaster with 4 gigs and 266ghzi already have goty versionmy fav was first blnow its remastered man thank god its free cause i paid like 30

carry over to this one i can use shift keys now hell ya no brainer honestly i hope the sounds were updated please tell me they added option to change fov so i dont puke while playing this amazing game honestly i just need it to have a fucking fov slider do i get this game for free if i own the handsome collection on ps4 as long as they still have ss munitions and tourge x4 anarchy smgs then i will be happy hey guys its available for pre order physical copy at gamestop and the 2k online store only 30 for everything  in ps4 borderlands a handsome collection cost 999 should i buy it or the new borderlands goty will rockets actually dodamage will mods still work will there be any new community patches just curious did they fix the knoxx armory pls not bl1r free on steam if you own the base game without any dlc also if you own bl2 and blps on steam you can upgrade to handsome collection for less it cost me 4 usd my friend 6 usd new gold skin wepons75 free keys did they patch general knox floor i just hope the fov can be adjusted if i have borderlands a handsome collection should i buy this honestly this is perfect for anyone new i still have a couple friends who have never played the original inb4 plague reaper vengeance draco and penetrator remain bugged  i love borderlands but i dont think this should be a full priced game tho i already have the bl1 goty edition on my ps3 can i download it for free on ps4 now and if not how much will it cost me does anyone know when it will be available in the xbox store for digital pre order changes or no changes true bl fans will buy it no matter what is the crawmerax going to be added or general knox armory if soooo its buy actually its borderlands its a buy anyways gearbox take my money lol great video bro thx tho i just wanna say it was already going to be justified for me just for the fact that i get to acquire all the trophies again plus playing through with a different character this time but its going to be so much more awesome with all these new additions  love being a pc gamer borderlands 1 goty is 6 on gmg with vip and borderlands 2 handsome jack is 14 on steam even though i already own the complete series i would actually pay for the remaster looks awesome 3 still happy i dont have to d this video literally just made my day thanks so much for making it i was honestly not that hyped about the remastered release but these changes look like they will make a second playthrough of the game not that stale 3999 and general knoxxs armory better be just like the first one to be able to farm it any word on whether the actual ballistics in the game are updated theyre so outdated by now i wanted the remaster for that one reason remove fall damage hows that for a nice qol addition i own all borderlands games as digital on ps and xbox consoles and to be told i should pay but pc shouldnt is a fucking insult the fact that the remaster is a free upgrade for pc users is amazing thats crazy wheres the list i want to read it and send it to other people ive preordered it its 30 didnt hear anything about fov sliders and more fast travel areas especially in dlc areas oh boy free for pc that made it for me cmon didnt they already release a goty edition i wont know wich one of them it is nothing at all about an fov slider damn i hope it has it the price will also be around 35 to 30 dollars why cant i digitally preorder it on xbox does anyone know how to preorder i know you can preorder from gamestop in america but in the uk how do you order whoever complained about this fight being too easy can choke on a dick why i got the normal boss not the remastered tt love the borderlands series excited for 3 good to see you doing a borderlands vid you should really cover borderlands 3 when it drops you make good content and i think your subs would skyrocket with it anyway great vid done and dusted still yet to give the enhanced game a try none of my friends seem interested anymore after hearing b3 is going to be on epic games exclusively whats the big deal you should have nuke monked the boss p had forgotten whole destroyer thing am i wrong thinking that in later games you die and boss is in full health as i remember quite a few frustrations  personally i feel roland is the best with shotguns not only does he have skill specifically for shotguns tighter spread and faster reload but with his mag upgrades you can have like 10 shots in 6 round shotties this combined with his kill skills for faster reload and fire rate along with rolands insane ammo regen with class mods result in basically machine gun shotties that never run out of ammo as you regen it faster than you can use it granted this isnt the most optimal way to play but i find it quite fun to turn everything into miniguns via insane ammo capacity and fire rate lol this legendary is nothing special trust me i have a roland playthrough level 69 maxed out weapon proficiency using a shotgun build with a really good commando class mod bahas blaster does not hit that hard in pt 25 especially compared with the likes of ssmaliwan crux hammer friendly fire or a decent matador it is kinda on the same power as a striker it is ok but not good enough to melt bosses or badasses any decent legendary is op in pl1 and um for one all guns gain tighter spread while sprinting and jumping two youre not at level 69 where this gun becomes equivalent to level roll trash it never spawns at 68 or 67 usually just 57 so its useless against most enemies higher than lv 60 when it does even spawn high level it does nothing without shotgun crit or accuracy perks like mordy and roland has i want you to know the first person to show this off with testing at lv69 on the forums was using it on a lillith just like yours and even had corrosive elemental damage it was doing nothing it was at lv 58 and it wouldnt spawn higher you shouldnt judge a legendary even if its low level and still works levels later in this form the hellfire is just outright broken cause of the mechanics involved with fire dot stacking doesnt mean this gun is broken for the same reason cause hell nah its not that gun has zero fixed parts but the barrel this one is 95 fix i was using this then got a double anarchy im owning level 29 enemies with this lv 14 shotty more than half the game best with this gun roland has a skill that reduces spread even more so its a hunters shotty not a big deal the accuracy sprint aim thing was a bug since the launch of the original bl1 it does happen with every weapon i think its a play on words from the red text you have a leg up on people i feel like its intentional idk the crosshairs getting smaller while sprint jumping is only due to the fov change that occurs and because jumping while sprinting retains your spirit speed it looks tighter this happens on all guns change your fov to default while standing still see how large the crosshairs are increase the fov and they should look tighter i think they shouldnt change or patch this gun i love it when sprint jumping every single gun bullet spread gets tighter than sta ding still ive noticed it as well im sure it intentional and i honestly found better shotguns with similar spreads at near same level haha so to farm the shotgun you need to farm skagzilla the flavor text says a leg up on the competition meaning it will be powerful bl2 most legendary weapons are powerful enough for 10 levels theres nothing wrong here it is just a powerful legendary i tell you whats broken but im not complaining is mordecai using mashers and crit skills one shot anything except bosses 3 shot badmutha brutes using the silent night or other high damage snipers 1 2 shots welp the gun looks weird but its damage is spectacular i guess dont judge a book by its cover and its like ridiculous with the damage but any way looks like you came back to youtube i hope you grow up and yeah  i should play this game but if only it was free hey i use to watch your streams my name use to be vannosthetitan nice video youre cranking out these vids proud of you big man it looks like youre enjoying yourself too nice vid dude the game looks kind of like it flows like some of the halo games was just wondering if thats a fair comparison or not hey backlynx is f13 done on this channel since im too broke to get the remastered ill just get the original backwards compatibility if it took more than one bullet you werent using a jakobs is a revolver one of the 6 i really want to play borderlands remastered but it hasnt come out in my country  can i download the custom maps plz wow how do i get that minimap its the worse about bl1 not having it like bl2 implemented later on please where can i get it quality guide really helped cheers great guide very helpfull mad thanks bro now i can finally farm ajax for the ogre without driving throught the crimson tollway and deep fathoms also being able to fast travel anywhere in that dlc is quite welcome cheers where did you get the mapslots that will replace i dont have it somewhy upd sorry im dumb thanks having oasis is great but it bugs out multiplayer  have they found a way to use udk editor just use the fyrestone coliseum as mapslot2 it works just testet it d could you please make a tutorial on how to use the legxordnance mod too most excellent thanks can you provide info on how to fix the grass blocks its very ugly thanks again sadly oasis will probably not be added back it wasnt even intentional in the original it was just a left over fast travel location in bl1 you could even unlock it on the console version using williow tree but it would fail sense there were no game files linked to it but people found out how to use and make for a custom map hub great video though so much better having these maps back and if you find a way for unlocking the console so commands actually work a tut for that would be fantastic umm what nice vid dude is it ok if i put a link to this vid on my mod on nexus for people who prefer vid instructions its called legx ordnance on bl1 nexus couldnt do it because i had to pay to register for nexus i needthe fast travel dlc please id would wanna see the link on reddit thanks  fantastic super clear and concise and explained well cheers buddy you are a saviour thanks does the resolution stay at 100hz for me its always getting back to 49hz dont know why  is it native or zoomed in very annoying that they zoom in for 219 resolutions i couldnt bring back my characters from 360 said i dont have any save data can anyone help plz btw this boss it the easiest one you find out that most of it attacks cant go thought a fucking rock he can only hurt you when he slams the ground anyone here after beating the campaign for borderlands 3 thats doesnt explain how jack got its eye i love how this is a stationary boss fight  theres angel the hyperion satellite in orbit on planet pandora why does it look like the old one is easier than the new one sothey added rakk and thats it you were tool handsome jack using them infinite ammo i need that man 135 what gun is that or is that your skill tree that make you have such a fast fire rate so will the warrior have better loot or would borderlands 2 be overwhelmed by bloom effect how do i get this i cant find the ps4 version bl2 was the superior borderlands but bl1 had some things that i miss in bl2 the weapons seemed more varied and the fact you can get legendaries anywhere was better than tirelessly farming bosses bl1 was lacking in the boss department including this fight so glad they improved the boss fight and rewards was a huge troll in the original that you spent 10 minutes emptying all your ammo into a sponge and waiting for tentacle respawns to give more ammo then a boring ending and 0 loot this actually killed my groups interest in playing any of the dlc 10 years ago which is a shame because the dlc is awesome doesnt really matter if bosses are hard you kill for the loot not for long ass battles i remember first seeing the ending and then seeing the angel reveal in borderlands 2 i was confused because i thought angel was an ai after seeing the first games ending all i see is that the old seems more tankywether it be the guns used have higher dmg or his hp is higher and the new attack patterns either way they both seems simple fights not much to compare its funny how this final boss took me around 4 minutes to kill while isshin took 7 hours  quite a boring fight for an elder gigantic alien that could destroy the world with its power althought the new remastering is great after 12 yrs but i think i loved angels look from the first then the new from bl2s look that they replace it with i still dont understand why they changed angels videos to a blue monotone ahh back when the highest health shield and damage you can get is only like 13k now the scaling in bl2 and bltps is crazy and the amount is half of millionmillion you should of just used the ledge for the most badass fight that little dance you did when you got those artifacts killed me my only question is why are you only level 69 really sad how long it took him to realise their was a legendary can you refarm this new destroyer it looks so much better in the remaster in the remastered version i 3 clipped the destroyer with a double anarchy on lilith wait doesnt showing the destroyer slinking back into the vault kind of conflict with the events of the presequel in fact the claptrap dlc completely opposes that the ony one thing i cant accept in the enchanted version is the angel transmitions change i really love the old art now is a bit ugly its nice having the flying parasites to trigger your kill skills more often i wish they changed the walkingrunning animations how are you fighting the destroyer at lvl 69 is there a way to reset youre playthrough feels almost on far to the warrior in bl2 aside from the fact theres more mobs because the destroyer cant move around if this was during the initial release it would of probably been an amazing boss fight until the later borderlands came i mean now if you ever die during the boss fight you can just shoot one of the ghost rakk for instant second wind i killed the new destroyer very fast with mordecai cant wait to not play borderlands 3 and replay borderlands 1 they made the right easier thats even possible jeez the old one was so boring 1033 that dancing move tho we updated the destroyer to be more challenging and rewarding umyou sure about that on the new fight my friend and i just double anarchied it in the eye the destroyer was such an underwhelming fight tbh the only thing i disliked in borderlands 1 the warrior was actually pretty hard the first time you fight it compared to the destroyer at least yup looks like his health is down to a more acceptable level i dont see how this is any harder though looks easier to me i cant be the only one who remembers the destroyer launching those spikes at you in the original fight can i i played the whole of bl1 last year and i remember that spike attack in the original that was fast best part is the little loot dance the player does when looking at the loot changes are much needed before it was just time and 0 effort just take make it long boy i remember the original boss battle i didnt realise i was entering the final stage so i was already running low on ammo i pretty much spent most of the battle hiding behind the giant rock on the right using a lower level gun that regenerated ammo and taking the occasional pop shots at it took me bloody ages to kill that thing i like how in the game of the year edition ur more likely to get legendarys for killing destroyer but now im wondering what are all the enemies like comparing the og to the new edit btw i mean enemies like bandits psychos skags and sythids the final boss will be the destroyer and the twins i liked the very first angel look c she was so beautiful  i just like how the whole world revolves around claptrap one way or another i remeber this back in the summer of 2015 that this boss is where i ran out of ammo gearbox went all out with this one prolly the best example of a remaster which makes sense since bl2 is the best example of a sequel is that a hellfire because if it is thats why you melted him so quick omg anyways though i like the newer one better its much more interesting damn i wish i could play the remaster never played much of bl1 so when hearing someone fighting the revamped boss going this is a huge improvement i was like it looks like a pretty basic boss battle to me but watching this now holy shit no wonder the old one does nothing except hit every now and then new 713  im glad they updated his moveset and damage so he is much tougher the only nerf he got was the health which is a good thing as far as im concerned man its like shaving my balls but the hair is still there after i shave it wtf gearbox anyone noticed how better the splatter and gore is in the first borderlands compared to borderlands 2 i mean i hope they bring that feeling back to the third one  god angel looks bad now especially with that creepy ass smile plus she looks like a bunch of dots the loot from the destroyer was not that good its nice to see the chests respawn after you kill him as a better reward did the original destroyer fight have the same movesets as the newer destroyer maybe that change is why the boss is quicker to kill than before since i noticed a lot more going on in that fight on one hand it looks easier on the other hand your gun was a million times sicker than the first goround its a little hard to tell but im suspecting it is in fact a bit easier thats disappointing i thought they were going to make steele the new final boss or something i liked every comment that i saw at 1201 am cant wait play more this game lots of fun come on lynx stream literally my childhood lmao can you battle him more than once in the remaster interesting he does seem a lot easier wouldve loved a lootsplosion but at least you get good stuff and it doesnt fly into rocks hey lynx been a while howre things goin also i love this video that game is really old but i see youre channel and twitch are building up keep it up  wow been awhile since i got a notification from you glad to see youre back wow so in the remaster they made it much easier to kill him instead of making him a giant bullet sponge how are you already level 69 in the remaster does the destroyer respawn so that the loot chest can be farmed this ending isnt right if the destroyer goes back into the vault then how the heck did they get the eye in the pre sequel dont see why they changed it hey its mohammed fellah ive asked you to play this game for ages hey lynx its been a while  can you do one for bl2 and bltps please thanks thanks its really works dude your profile file made my character sprint way faster thanks i cant open the file thats in the description any idea whats up thanks for the profile man appreciate it or you could use the profile editor of nexus also i have another question is there a way to transfer a pc save to a ps4 save hey so can this also work on ps4 i keep the keys but when i replace the profile file the items go away hey you can farm any named boss for legndaries pearls and red text weapons meatyshotguns are awesome in this game sells the only two shotguns he had last episode mehuh i always loved ur borderlands video cant wait to watch u guys play borderlands 3 the sad thing is they are so good they are flying through the game the fun wont last long but i will enjoy the ride meaty you got rid of the unique gun lady finger that has mass critical damage yes the borderlands game is back the multiplier is the

again josh sounded masculine when i first started watching but the more i watch the more i hear them as feminine im always up for some good old borderlands so yeah keep em videos coming yes more please yes the blind tk baha saw josh suddenly appearing in front of him if you do this again i dont think you should uses those new weapons ie the rocket launcher and sniper josh tk baha is blind he cant see you in ghost mode or any mode for that matter josh killing the counselor makes sense we know who the new pro is compared to the noob his nipple spikes arent attached to his nipples if you watch the cutscene not just the introduction screen yes i love it i need more you guys always make my day better i am lvl 19 about be lvl 20 for anyone reading this do not buy borderlands 3 on epic store we need to stop them from doing the bullshit exclusivity deals apart from that great video josh you guys should try a pvn for warframe please play more also you can pump out plenty of proob videos now and not have to rely on challenge runs and disparate quests from the 2 mh games as the 100th like i get one request and that is you do more of these videos like a series also does dyno have a channel its been bothering me for a while now please play more rage i love your amazing videos i mean no offence and this is a great video but i prefer mhw videos wow iceborn really changed the graphics i look forward to later levels i love this video xd but where is my smash bros video d is this joshs first time playing borderlands more please 1418 he knows tk is blind right ok before someone told me he actually played the game but from seeing him play the game for the first few seconds thats complete bs their rules have totally switched where the noob is now the pro and the pro is now the noob payback for denying him the dragonator thats menacing id love to see more of this please yes you need to continue butt you cant call it pro and noob just noob and a very strange buff pink man well done josh went right to the most broken character in the game from the start you make me vomit the pain goes here theres no fence on this fence i am the conductor of the poop train i love your monster hunter videos but please do more of this cotton chose the best character to play as brick has masassive health regen and pumps out major damage when going berserk lets see them go against skagzilla so josh is the noob in this then if your gonna have so many sexual undertones cotton shoulda played rolland for some reason whenever i play these types of games i see fire and stop what im doing to check out this fire and kill my self in the process god i hope this isnt a one off also yet another portal has opened up they have gained many abilities including guns however it seems cotton has lost 40 of intelligence through the portal thank god the commander isnt hear to see them one last thing of course josh picked moxi please do a series on this i see rage using the overpowered character so you dont have to work at all lol dear god of guns it has begun let the carnage start and the loot comes a lot i wonder if borderlands 3 will include different type of loot cool outfits houses cars house decor robot servant etc as soon as i started up the game i got the notification for this video and i havent even watched it yet but im glad its a thing oh yes one for the borderlands

the last hybrid i need on xbox one i farmed every other hybrid except for this one since i accidentally killed typhon and i dont want to play through the campaign twice if anyone has it my xbox gamertag is ws cheekspreadr and i would trade my soul if i could  wish i had one of those i went through and farmed every hybrid and pearl but accidentally killed typhon so now the kyros mission is haunting me because i only get one shot at the hybrid if i kill typhon and trade in mission will kyros still spawn or they didnt change that in remaster 1000th view well done man i would lose my mind trying to farm hybrids congrats dude did you had the mission to kill kyros when you got this weapon or did he respawn after you kill him has any one ever got a kyros power without a elemental multiplyer you claim he will not spawn after he is checkmarked up and saved and quit yet he is for me and i have farmed him some 30 times now without needing to essentially alt f4 or the likes heyyyyy thats pretty neat insane drop very cool thanks ganza oh shit thats cool lol if you dont kill typhon but kill kyros he still respawns whats the effect doesnt kyros supossed to respawn now can anyone drop me mods on ps3 plz how do i fix on willowtree has stopped working every solution i found on googlewas not helping my game crashes evrery time i click single lyer or selct character when i save and go into the game on pc the weapon is not in my inv i was wondering is there a way i can change the lvl of the weapon and have it adjust the specs with each level change i changed the level of a weapon since my favourite weapon is lower level then my character anyway when i changed it it just changed the lvl and not the damage higher lvl gun higher damagespecs each lvl the numbers go up a bit if u cant find it in mygames its probably in the steamapps folder if u save the game to a drive other than c i go to binaries and there is only win32 no save data if i use the save data in willow tree it gives an error this stupid programm destroyed my important save file just because i wanted to get more money mk99 what recorder do you use for your computer xbox 360 freeze when i go to save my gamertag for xbox 360one is xenogenesisking if any of you dont want to go through all this message me and ill drop my inventory for you i have over 30 saves for this purpose and i need to put them to good use my inventories include skill points and ammo upgrades as well even unlimited money omega artifacts not trying to promote myself id just like to help people out everyone have an amazing day note i cannot guarantee this will work for goty enhanced edition as i am on xbox 360 and play vanilla to anyone that gets confused or sketched out about putting in the codes from willowtree due to a fear of corrupt saves 1 backup the save willowtree is an amazing modding tool but it isnt flawless sometimes your filesave can become corrupt if you add something that wont work for the patches 2 search gear calculator borderlands in explorer and click the first link then on the left side youll see a part of the webpage that says weapons hall of fame this has codes for all weapon classes meaning shotguns repeatersunder the pistols tab revolvers combat rifles eridian weapons snipers launchers it also had grenade mods as well as shields 98 of these to an estimate will work do not use the very first page of the codes use the other two below it they are the most recent under the second to last page under the miscellaneous tab there are stock items these are we anyone can say me where i can founds codes for mods class and granades pls nothing changes when i go into bl1 remastered but when i exit and go into willowtree it says everything has been changed when it clearly hasnt searching for answers didnt know willow tree got an update youre fucking awesome bro thx mk99 so do i need a ps3 to get my character to my ps4 once its been modded nice tut how do you add code to willow tree is this safe to download very cautious when it comes to download things from youtube descriptions but im not sure if i trust sourceforge or whatever i tried to use this to reset a quest and it didnt work for me when i went back into the game  do i need a usb to do this or can i just upload my saves to online storage im on ps4 after i exported the saves to my goty save file i go to borderlands and nothings changed lol what do i do hey dude whenever i dowload willowtree it says that my free trial is over and that i have to pay for it is there a free version when i try to load the svae into willowtree it shows that there is no save files do i even need my 360 to mod then or when i try to import weapons it says invalid clipboard data wtf else can i do to copy and paste a weapon love the video short and to the point question in willowtree when i download it says 22 version is that right or do i need to download another version volume is alittle low fyi but good job 1052 the crystal quest is the best i love looting weapons in that cave its a good place for leveling up too you just need many granades a good granate mod and good weapons hey cowboy i would love to play with

in my head telling me dump the sniperonly rule use those awesome pistols but i am strong and loot officers are just a bunch of aholes d badass skags my ass pistolero mordecai is the real badass over here d in every game in the beginning its easy to level up fast but the longer you play the higher you get it takes more and more and more xp to level up why it sucksimo got my first pearl at level 20

need no stinking mugshot hey slack im enjoying the walkthroughs great info slack im amazed boss been waiting for this wohoo works well another option is to join with a friend have the person who started the game use their keys and the joiner pick up the weapons from the chest have them quit out and you hit alt f4 to force close the game you should be able to start another game back up with all of your keys and your friend can rejoin and drop everything they got from it against terms of service reported should you get the golden keys at the beginning of the game thanks worked for me you know cristin that the fallout of the new game if it is going to be done will come out between 2020 and 2021 in both years it is possible that it will be taken out on the same date that the first fallout came out the fact that they are shouting anoyingly loud convinced me to not buy the game lmao i just finished the game done all missions and i dont have any of the dlc areas in my fast travel list typical nerd even has to eat while playing lol fail obligatory comment regarding infamous adhesive plastic im sitting here playing game of the year with my keyboard on my lap using a trainer

be so so interesting bro honesty it will be dope how do you make your videos so cool i mean your videos are so freaking entertaining to watch bro  yup its better than my laptop  god i love this game so many hours put into this takes me back trust me when i say it can run much better than this with higher graphics settings at 10watt and some tweeks to windows 10 there is litterally no reason not to tweek windows 10 id wonder what it would look with shadows thank you for the vid i dont think this game is enhanced enough so to speak unless youre watching a closeup comparison video youll never notice the differences loved it wanna see more play more borderlands i definitely want to see you keep this series going dude if you read the objective items youve been picking up they have really funny descriptions most of the time btw bro borderlands is sick can you still play multiplayer nicely done and legit  could you get to the sledge bossfight by chance in that area i got really bad fps drops seems to be running well for some reasons the frame rate is jumping up and down on my 9900k and 2080ti sniper rifle hah majorslack farts in its general direction 002 heh jack off almost felt sorry for reaver the poor guy never stood a chance nice strategy there ah crap i already turned in the next piece oh well most excellent slack pistolero build vs the zombie mobs is coming up soon i am really happy that we will see the other dlcs played slack style as slack style means with high style and the waltz in this episode was absolutely elegant eat this a hole hilarious  the golden chest has some magic powers d ready to see some bandits get toasted with the fire hawk this aint no flim flam bamalam click flinger trigger finger panty waste safe space this is a walkthrough and the slack aint taking no prisoners howdy slack i remember you saying that you didnt want to make this a strictly bl channel because of interest in upcoming projects can you confirm or deny a doom eternal run at this junction just when i was hungry for some more borderlands thumbs up major what no comments had to step up and say thanks i need to watch the stream more if youre gonna keep getting these hybrids the best part was the showcase of damage at the end lul its the right blue holy shit man how did you get those weapons worth 1800 at that point of the game best i am getting right now is like 900 playing solo annoys me that every weapon drop is noticeably under my level best ive gotten has been at my level never above it its weird to see you planning about keeping as a youtube series or transition into stream i think i speak for most of us subscribers when i say that as long as you upload well be watching that claptrap would have led you to some looooot looking forward to autumn when halo makes its comeback to the pc i wish bl was cross compatible those windows notfication sound tripped me out streaming would be fun if you could keep up with daily content otherwise solo would be preferable to weekly are in this game multiplayer mode you can change your fov whats the main objective of this game seems like a game of endless side quests i know its super popular so obviously there must be some type of appeal but ive watched the first 4 videos and im not seeing it at all anyone care to elaborate so i started playing but i didnt get the goodies at the start any idea why  come on cooooooowboy we need a new episode playing with someone else on stream would probably be even more fun as long as you post the streams here but i know you usually do either way ill be watching  dont stop uploading this cowboy loving it youtube series i mean i would prefer more daily episodes then weekly but in the end i say do what you want you should let your wife play this game with you cowboy what is the sniper rifle im also doing solo run and i got a level 16 badass bruiser with a rocket launcher instead of the raider the guy ripped me a new one i cheesed it by snipping him through a fence while trying to avoid the splash damage of his launcher im also doing solo run and i got a level 16 badass bruiser with a rocket launcher instead of the raider the guy ripped me a new one i cheesed it by snipping him through a fence while trying to avoid the splash damage of his launcher honestly do what you want its more enjoyable to watch when your having fun as long as its put on youtube to watch ill be watching coybow i dont know if u know this but there is a f o v slider u can use it just seems really zoomed in cause u on the default settings idk if you forgot but when you help a claptrap they lead you to some secret loot sledge always seemed easier than bone head to me you can kite sledge around his room and you likely have an elemental or 2 by then but bone heads arena has cover on the edges and is open in the middle plus unless youre on level and have on level gear he is a really tanky badass my last name is skaggs my friend gave me so much shit when we couch cooped this game either way of playing it is fine either way its you playing it which is why were here just as long as the stream gets uploaded here i played bl by myself so its nice to see how you tackle things solo love the vids heres a helpful hit if you ever get stuck on a scavenger mission on the compass bar bottom middle if you see a little bag on top of it it mostly tells you that there is a item close by just a little helpful tip incase you didnt know about that fun fact i didnt know about till five years after the game came out lol one of the things i missed about bl1 while playing 2 was when you saw an enemy using an elemental weapon that weapon actually dropped when you killed them in bl2 if you saw an enemy using an etech weapon all that meant was they had a slightly higher chance of dropping an etech weapon but not necessarily the one they were using im referring to nonbossfixed weapon drops also a lot of the rescued claptraps will lead you to a cache of chests when they get up if youre taking votes i say keep this as a proper lp dont take this as a criticism but stream vods arent as entertaining youre more focused on shooting the shit with people youre playing with or with people in the chat and less focused on the game then throw in a 5 hour unedited upload im personally not interested in watching that so many memories watching this man maybe you could stream with viewers this game was really fun solo but soooo much fun with friends not sure what it was about borderlands 2 all i wanted from it was more borderlands and it delivered on paper it was better in every way but it didnt do it for me like the original cant put my finger on why though stream hype the solo run is pretty sweet bro also on the streaming of the game why not do the lets play then stream the game on another build spec into critical damage before any other skills for blood wing so you wont have to worry about under leveling when you get an sdu from claptrap most of the time they open a chest room if there is something your not sure of ill try to answer it but it is your channel and lets play after all your choice the only reason i was keep playing in my ps3 is for this game now i got the remastered on my ps4 together with the handsome collection so happy i can jump from 1 to 2 and pre sequel keep up the great job it feels weird to play borderlands 1 because im so use to hitscan for first person shooters also i would prefer a stream series haha 30min aint nothing for this game you missed the big white chest in the sledge area for the mine gate key it is on top of the area you jumped on before falling down to get out of that area moar also lookin forward to when u get ur hands on the elephant hunter sniper rifle that thing rocks took it all the way to lvl 40 and it still one shot everything with crits stream or episodic ill be watching i feel shotguns in general really suck in this game or i just had bad luck with them honestly i saw the other peoples lets plays of this they all suck i prefer these good gameplay stream it please looks to easy ooh another episode whats up cowboy can i get a like first if you want the original version of this video you can find it here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvggpwpbq8dxg still as confusing as the first video good video i tried thanks to you i dont understand why gearbox2k did it that way but your vid was very helpful thanks mate am i the only one who cant believe how much of a cluster fuck this is to just transfer a character thank god for your video mate id be fucked without it i have the disc version and yes you dont get the export option on the disc does badass rank transfer aswell  how do you get the bank space upgrade i just got a legendary sniper rifle from the red chest surrounded by the money boxes in the first section of the chest route slack yeeeahh too bad i cant use it immediately a fearsome volcano dvl20 pele demands a sacrifice with a squishsmack daddyslack give a skag a bone this psycho rode a meatbike home im a normal person i promise my brain just does this okay how are you feeling about the borderlands 3 material so far slackster cant wait for revolution dlc looking forward for the claptrap dlc i have never played it i will probably play along but with pt2 character could be interesting to compare also i bought myself rage 2 so you are free to do a walkthrough major slack d this power shopping in the underdome has gotten me many legendaries for my gunslinger build thanks slack there is a list i saw on reddit of a lot of issues with borderlands enhanced and one is a memory leak the longer you have the game running that leads to lag i get that plus the one with mouse not tracking correctly when running in 4k resolution hey slack what i love about your videos are how you make strategies for games like this where i normally just kite n die until i persevere slack i feel like you could do a borderlands dedicated channel similar to you skyrim channel i dont mean to make more work for you but id watch the hell out of you running through every permutation of every class hello fellow humans 1 im addicted to major slack videos 2 would i be called a slacker or a slackaholic i noticed i get major lag build up if i exit travel or power shop too much without quitting to my desktop every once in awhile 2112 been wondering why i always seem to find a bandit under the bridge in the remaster now i see why they just walk off the edge lmao borderlands with mordecai this was my first slack video and i am loving the nostalgia my level 45 mordecai pistol only is kickin butt love the borderlands walkthroughs definitely one of my favorite game series to date hey slack'"

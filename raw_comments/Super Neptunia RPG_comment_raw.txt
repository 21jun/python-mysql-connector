ok looks like this is one of the worst games in the franchise thanks will pass meh guess im not buying it then insert nepforsmash meme here super neptunia rpg is now on sale for 49 off 2499 sale ends december 22nd eh its 2499 on eshop right now trash controls if i could blow up a studio i will kill the programmers director who made this shtty game neptunia fucking hypocritical company irony that they cant make a fucking decent game sorry im not buying this game because i dont get to play as rom and ram i hope the game fails that way three months later the game still runs terribly i dont recommend it get the pc version worst neptunia game thus far id love ports of the classics my gosh this game is worse than the older versions i hope you are joking about the 14 hrs cause its longer if you wanna completely beat it i love neptunia games this one is not worth 50 the jumping lag is repulsive its just made bad i dont even think its worth 10 bucks ugh that movement speed glad i skipped this one thanks for the review mate thank you for making this video i think ill be skipping this one unless there is a crazy sale combat is pretty garbage lets be real the 1 skill limit per button is stupid its embarrassing that ppl even compared it to valkyrie profiles its nowhere near as fun as vps combat system the best neptunia game will forever be megadimension neptunia vii in my opinion basically a boring slow paced valkyrie profile nope pass completed super nep rpg game softlocked 7 times in the 3rd to last battle and this is why i wait for nis games to be on sale now for quite a few years i was buying all the collectors editions theyre getting so lazy to me i dont really care if it looks like a mobile game i just wanted the story and i was not disappointed it has a damn good story and has one of the best ost in the series imo i like this review i think im going to wait for a sale on this one thanks it wasnt really that laggy only after you fast travel and in the fast travel menu there were a few glitches though but nothing that prevents you from doing it so its 50 for a short laggy game ill wait for a sale i disagree on the platforming being fun controlling the characters is stiff and often times youre overstepping moving too fast to have precise movement a game like shantae half genie hero easily sets the standard as to what should be expected of a polished platformer today just as shovel knight does for modern retro performers that and the writing for the characters just doesnt really make them feel like the neptunia characters theyve been in every other game just to be honest the animations and all look like crap and combat looks pretty bad too this is what happens when you let another group of people make a game for you compile heart japan didnt make this in case you didnt know a western group did as far as i know im sadly gonna have to wait for a price drop and hopefully a couple of patches to help with the performance issues thanks for the quick review thanks for your review im glad i didnt bought this game day 1 and skipped it never let a canadian company develope an jrpg lazy animations lazy battlesytem no love in it gonna wait till its 1999 someday aside from proper optimization to fix the lag there are two things that i think should be patched in this game 1 adjust how frequently neptunia gives off voice clips as a 2d platformer you are required to jump around a lot to traverse it grates on the ears a bit when neps spouts out like a kangaroo like a kangaroo like a kangaroo in rapid succession 2 in battle display under the health bars what skills the character currently has assigned it saves the player the trouble of memorizing what skills they set up for each formation which leads to reluctance to experiment or having to pause the game with each formation change to see them on the stat menu princess crown characters look great standing still but the platforming and actual animation looks janky as hell shame looks like a cheap smartphone game awful its worth sale 25 but its 50 is this a flash game ahhh man i was looking forward to this one but 40 bucks for it seem a bit too much perhaps ill wait for when it goes on sale for around 25 or 30 what the fuck is this garbage game this neptunia game is nothing like the ones on the sony ps vita you know 3d turn base jrpg customise characters so on neptunia rpg looks like a shitty mobile game that ran out of budget money to make the game lmao trash 49 bucks for snrpg steam with dlc only 28 tho thanks for this review i appreciated your thoughtful analysis and fair treatment of a fun game with some flaws really thanks for the review and showing off the game theres this game called indivisible thats like probably better and matches this style but has been worked on since 2015 gonna release date this year ive download the patch and it doesnt seem to fix skip frames random slow down and lag this looks like a miss for me i love the neptune universe but for the price its kind of wack idk why a 2d rpg thats short would ever cost 45 maybe on a big sale i would get this but i still have to beat hyperdevotion noire thanks for review im gonna wait for a sale im glad i skipped this one id love this game if the load times werent forever i found the game to be rather okay its not bad by any means but it could be better the story was interesting ill admit but the character interactions was somewhat lacking if anything it was quite basic and underdeveloped it also took me a while to realize that this takes place in whats basically a new dimension since if and compa were only children in the past when the cpus were friends as well as new characters chrome and filyn who existed before the cpus that and no cpu candidates and the gameplay i found rather basic and somewhat easy to abuse if you know what youre doing especially since theres no mp in the game and items can be used at pretty much any time the only difficulty i found was when i didnt have an element an enemy was weak to or was at the mercy of the stop effect combat was okay but became uninteresting towards the end heck i found myself avoiding most nonmandatory fights because i saw little value in fighting only doing so for cre nepnepforsmash super neptunia rpg was a really good spinoff but there are a few cons about it that really dipped my experience 1 despite the whole ap limiting your actions hitting your opponents weaknesses was too rewarding considering that you can button mash with the right combination of spells 2 final boss was abit underwhelming in my opinion when i saw the three heads with colored gems on them i was almost impressed and was prepared for the game to test my formation skills only to find out that it didnt really matter cuz spamming lightning protagonist slash finished the fight in 45 minutes also vert with fire absorb made this boss look like a joke 3 i understand giving us the weaknesses of regular enemies but bosses too i feel like they held our hands waaay too much with that status thing xd anyways im glad that the goddess forms were just a nice bonus and not something you desperately needed i say that as im about to take on every hunt quest now can i change their voice language to japanese what neptunia game should i start with this one that was a cool review i think im sold id like to see a future neptunia game with realtime combat like kingdom hearts a hack and slash nep game like devil may cry but more realistically like senran kagura no sisters apparently thank you for the detailed review this game looks amazing i dont understand why it was bashed so much this is one of those games where i want to like it but i cant maybe its just that i bought it on the switch but the game runs like garbage the character art while it would look nice as a still looks weird when it moves the animations arent awful and the voice acting is just as lovable to me as every other game in the series but just the way it runs on the switch prevents me from even wanting to try to keep playing ive only invested maybe 10 hours into it but i dont know if ill keep going which is sad because i love hdns sense of outlandish comedy and constant 4th wall breaking im hoping some updates will fix the issues but the gaming gods are not always that kind nice a really well explained review may pick this up later myself wont get the ps4 version since i dont have a ps4 and well amongst their recent decisions as stated in the video other than that definitely a pick up for me once i finish the vita games best nep game in years pft its trash honestly its boring as shit and i had so much bugs that made it unplayable it isnt even funny crome is arfore just obvious similarities not to mention well she looks literally like the purified version of arfore in rebirth 1 yo wheres the pc rep those guards look like a secret meme secret meme secret meme the hyperdimention neptunia is a great albeit a bit cringey rpgs series play the games when you have the chance is it possible to have noire blanc or vert as the controllable character when exploring the dungeons i mostly play for the characters i finally buy it ok steam full price well this certainly is a interesting review your intro does make it seem like its a good game just because its something different from the usual neptunia from what ive seen about this game it seems to come with its own shantaemetroidvania like overworld a huge open world styled gamindustri would be nice but with how chif has been reusing assets its no surprise that there isnt not sure if that would be troublesome without any form of warp points though maybe simply include warps but still allow players to run through areas other than the 4 goddesses if compa and whoever else returns from the cast plus dogoos nothing really looks neptunia like looks more like generic steampunk like stuff which in my view doesnt really fit the colorful vibrant look of the characters despite this being supposed to be gamindustri i guess many of the other npcs seen in the neptunia series dont really show up here the plots similar to what we had in the ori im so getting this game for my switch i want all the sass and the fan service to the max super neptunia rpg took a while for it to click with me i kinda dropped the game after hitting lowee because i didnt feel like i was having fun a few days of trashing the game as a joke then feeling bad later i came back and got sucked in hard i do think at least in terms of a neptunia game that it is pretty good the lack of playable characters does kill some replayability for me as im soneone who likes to challenge themselves and do x only runs in rebirth 1 but the roster itself is fine and decently balanced heres the thing though i never bought an item in this game equipment sure but itemwise i didnt buy anything mostly because the fast travel system allows you to heal up rather quickly along with there being no sp system so you can just spam omni heal against a weak enemy while you build up hp again and the only items i did use were life fragments and some potions towards the endgame as i couldnt be bothered walking back it says a lot about the i know everyone loves nep she is hysterical but i prefer noiregot a thing for female tsundere characters and silent broodingshy male characters interesting review im still not sure if i would want the game or not the changes to gameplay and world design are pretty interesting i really like the plush in the limited edition too there is one fact that really mispleases me though my favourite couple is not part of it neither nepgear nor uzume is present if they add them as dlc i would definitely buy it btw have you already finished the game how much playtime does it offer sucks to hear it bombed in japan i cant say i agree with anything here i find the music extreamly annoying and repetetiv und the combat is clunky and unintuitiv i am 5 hours in and stoped playing i also hate the menu navigation its super slow and poorly thought through things arent located where they are supposted to be the main story progression is really annoying too to much going back and forth abd the short senteces where u need to go are to vague and had me running around even more in short it was my most anticipated neptunia game but also my most hated i was really looking forward to a new take but i get why it bomed in japan its simply a bad game thanks for this review i like your objectivity being a neps fan sometimes disapointed with some titles i think i can sink into this one in the same way you did i was really curious about super neptunia rpg and this vido sold it in my heart thanks again honestly to me the game was a sort of mixed bag i didnt have a lot of problems with what most people did got it on steam just as a foreword i started playing the games with the rebirth series the games glitches werent a big problem to me i never ran into any hard crashes and it was pretty stable i was rather mixed on the change in themes much of the game changed themes from traditional neptunia to a more standard high fantasy feel and im not fully sure what to think about that after all the presence of meaningless technology has typically been a hallmark of the series to me theres always a ridiculous surreal feel to things in that regard the art and soundtracks cotnributed to this you speak of the soundtrack to this being subtly epic but at times it just feels generic and is neptunia ever supposed to be subtle the quality of the art and soundtrack dont get me wrong are extremely well done and there are some truly breathtaking moments like the und to be entirely honest while im glad that there are people who have managed to find enjoyment with this game im still kind of baffled that people are actually liking it as much as i wanted to like this game myself i couldnt get past all the many many glaring faults i found with it while this is probably the best looking entry in the entire series even that aspect comes with a lot of buts the environments look amazingbut they werent implemented well depthoffield issues constant clipping issues enemies can get concealed by foreground elements etc like they were made first and then retrofitted into being explorable fields not to mention while this is subjective they lack any of the series charm and aesthetic the character sprites are beautiful and emote pretty nicelybut as soon as they animate even a little more than an idle animation like walking they look so awkward animations in general especially in battles look oddly sped up for whatever reason the game is amazing im super glad i got the limited edition for this one in regards to newbies ive actually had a debate about the niche gaming market in general on twitter and regardless of how different this is still more on the niche market side of things as a series one thing to note what you may like about this is likely again more niche than we would like to believe especially given the poor reception in japan and how so far youre the only whos given it this much praise in a review super neptunia is a game youll either like or just straight up hate for some reason so far at least there hasnt been much between so its kind of important to note why there would be reasons people wouldnt like this one as much as others as well as noting your own reasons for liking it ill probably look into what is about this neptune game japanese fans seem to dislike about it later cause despite that the fanbase still love the series and that may have to do with why the series is got another ova release this week on japanese psn to try an appease tho hey great job on this video this game really reminds me of valkyrie profile i thought chrome was arfroire also megadimension was my fav i would try this one outbut 50 dollars for this one seem steep plus already 3 dlc characters this nep game is refreshing for me its also well made and chill for the most part however maybe it is only me but chrome looks somewhat similar to arfoire the one in rebirth 1 in true ending route for me megadimension neptunia vii is the best neptunia game ever mmmmill be skipping this neptunia fan since the very first one on the ps3 the animations look bad its an animation technique that looks good on visual novel style cut scenes but it just looks lazy and creepy in this game ill try it out on the pc when its discounted because it still looks interesting otherwise the switch port is probably the worse out of all of them especially with the new dlc char compa animation causes so much studdering on screen as much as i like neptunes japanese voice i feel like purple hearts japanese voice is a mismatch because its too deep when compared to neptunes high pitched voice i wonder why this bombed in japan too bad i still cant get into the pointlessly yuririffic neptunia games play it on switch ps4 version is the absolute worse option there is obviously all opinion but theres no way the story here than mk2 or victory 2 haha dang so the switch version runs poorly and the ps4 version is censored im kinda out of luck lol a great game i love it you are only praising it cos its on switch if it was on ps4 you would say its terrible its not like the japanese hate the idea of a 2d nep game in this format but the quality here is pretty subpar compared to most 2d and spritebased games they have over there theyre probably wondering why if didnt hire someone like vanillaware to do it with the battle system of grand knight history and exploration of odin sphereoboro muramasa and the visuals theyre known for it wouldve been perfect the real question is do you have to grind in some no name dungeon for hours to level up and have a chance to fight the story related fights feel annoyingly mobile you used lore with disdain for some reason neptunia is about games games have lore games as a history is lore this is why yall dont dub this is why you sub dat moment when neptunia is better at platforming than devil may cry if youre smart with it you can mix a bunch of attacks with attack items the amount of damage you can eventually spam is ludicrous i did so when i platinumed the japanese version of this game cant wait to try out the story though were in a day where im in agreement with yellowsupernintendo well looking at the 2d graphical style i get a strong vanillaware vibe from this but considering the developer is from the west i think they took inspiration from vanillawares dragons crown and added in a strong turn based jrpg similar to the neptunia series i really need valkyrie profile remake now the gameplay is clearly valkyrie profile the ps1 aka lenneth of psp 523 overworld what i had no idea they were based on game systems i just play for the tits senran kagura needs this they got better tits they literally just swiped this style from valkyrie profilenobody has new ideas anymore seems like switch version player here animations are smooth as butter but load times are ugh well we could just jerk off to the pics online but its best to buy on pc or switch and not give playstation that money neptuna has never been hard the early chapter are often the hardest of the games because your weaker and underpower got my entire party immune to physical damage with blanc in the lead i have constant hp reg and i spam her neutral damage hp absorbing attack fights have become too easy now occasionally the one or other magic spell hits but the life reg takes care of that i would go as far as to call this a balancing issue not that it harms my enjoyment anyway i guess japan didnt like it because its a change of what its usually us which in my option is actually a good change although wonky graphics look good and everything but they seem like they are hitting with rubber weapons on rubber enemiesugh this game reminds me a lot of valkyrie profile worth mentioning that this game is already on the steam sales at least on my region im still gonna wait for that comparison thanks for the video sounds good to me one thing im sure ill be missing in some way is that from what ive seen in your video they dont have the usual skills people might complain about recycling but i also like the worldconsistency it brings to the table also i suppose they went back to silence again ive just finished vs zombies and while they have almost everything voiced in english they didnt do it for the special unlocks backstage talk in particular however instead of just being silent they used the japanese voices something that id love to see in all neptunia games at least as a setting even if the voices arent identical having scenes voiced is still better imho im playing on switch it chugs sometimes during battle and slows down when going through menus but asides from those performance hiccups i love the game so far the platforming may be kind of clunky and its especially noticeable at a certain part of the game when falling into a pit starts you at the start of the map instead of the room like usual i struggled with the combat because of a small moveset and characters at the start but this was remedied later by pressing the minus button to reveal enemy weaknesses makes the game too easy i think the big fun comes from the customization you can do when anyone can learn anything given the right equipment and making the optimal formations to stampede through enemies for me 1neptunia vii no r 24goddesses online 3hyperdevotion noire my question is is chrome actually uhh who everyone thinks she is ps look closely at her design and then look at who else in the series she shares both jp and en vas with the ps3 the golden era of gaming before sony went full retard lol did you just praise the first game that game is pure hot trash i thought it was pretty good other than the glitches i never really had any bad glitches in the previous games never in the main games but using fire element spells with noire sometimes can glitch the game it isnt really that laggy like i keep hearing not on ps4 at least i platinumed it in 3 days without trying so it didnt really lag just the fast travel causes a few seconds of lag my favorite spinoff was probably 4go but i still like this one since it kinda reminds me of old rpgs wow the same day i plan to post my review you post yours what the heck man lol great video tho i agree this game was great definitely the best one in a while man i miss the original neptunias story not great but not sub par eithet i wish they didnt squander the ip so much maybe ill try this game after all though you might have convinced me to buy this game was sceptical to the 2d gameplay hur after this i might just give it a try we need a nep fighting game i need a nep fighting game i need a nep fighting game seriously this game shows how well a nep fighting game could look like between this and indivisible its gonna be a good year for valkyrie profile spiritual successors the original system in neptunia was easy to understand if you bother to read it really i have been thinking windows not xbox though now they are kinda the same thing since xbox 360 so whatever i guess chrome is based on stadia the cloud game streaming service its 2d so not interested unless its super cheap switch version is good but it will lose frames and lag in big battles meh this like other neptunia have potential but never reach or attempt to reach futher and just feels bland aling with technical issues and a boring combat system its just another neptunia game 610 i will buy this game later when its on sale i have a rule to never pay retail prices for a digital only copy and i still have 3 or 4 other neptunia games to finish so it doesnt make much sense for me to buy it now since snrpg is on the switch which is the first time for it do you think idea factory and compile heart will port the rebirth games and megadimension neptunia vii to the switch in the future if snrpg does well and do you think the other spin offs can be ported all i can say is nap nap nap thanks for the review gonna buy pc version wait what youre pretty late nep nep seal of approval the switch version does not run well constant fps drops long loading times and stuttering it sometimes takes me almost a minute just to open the menu and even then it still has to load the character models i was amazed in your video how well the game runs still i like the game nice visuals good music and story i find the battles to be pretty boring though if i know enemys are weak to something i just keep spamming the y button or whatever and end the battle that way the idea is nice in theory still i enjoy it for what it is 2 hours in i like it but too many games i have started already to continue i bought it on the switch and well lets say the movement is annoying with the shitty joycons and lags hard during battle scenes but thats the switches fault for being a shit system for anything cant even run a 2d game it runs 3d games better than this this isnt looking like a favorite for me and i was only a few hours in have the switch version any real word when if compa coming out and noone say on the 9th because that rumor is fake ugh for me it is probably the worst nep game in years it is extremally boring with gameplay so pointless pressing one button and repetetive than even games like neptunia u feels like a 4x strategy artstyle is superb plot is really interesting but gameplay itself well thing that is most important in games it sucks really really badly im surprised cause everyone over in japan and taiwan is saying this is a bad game even looking at this game i think its shit ahhhhhh also fuck sony ive got the first rebirth game and while i havent finished it yet have really been enjoying it and this game looks like a lot of fun too might just have to pick it up at some point thanks for the detailed review swich version soft locks a lot in most of all in boss fights also it studers a lot ill still probably wont get this game i have most of the games main line and spin offs but this one just does not interest me either that or i am too busy with atelier games but how lewd is it the switch version is deffenitly suffers from some slow down during some battles nothing that ruins the game but its deffenitly noticeable and drags the experience down i only own a ps4 and a vita and since the ps4 version is censored i wont get it i currently have no way of playing this game lol sadly the switch version is really stuttery in the first third of the game and it has some loadingissues even the title screen logo just popped up the first time instead of zooming into place like it should and these might be an issue in the pc and ps4 version as well but the optional cgscene with noire doesnt load properly and i got stuck in the 3rd guildquest fight against the satanic book in the library because the game suddenly stopped accepting my inputs and i had to switch around with the characters until it was properly running again was pretty funny to speed up the fight and see the book bouncing around without doing anything though glad you mentioned the hilarious cgscene with blanc holding an innermonologue conference and the bookconvention sideplot not being voiced at all i was so disappointed in that i watched the scenes twice in japanese just so i could experience the empathy within them i still dont understand their choices when it comes to w first off sorry if my english is a little bad to be honset i hope that this game isnt the standart for the next neptunia games i couldnt even finish the game i got to bored and i had to force myself to start and play the game because i wanted to finish it in the end i couldnt do it ive also really like the game i ave buy day one on switch but honestly its far from my fav neptunia the rebirth trilogy and neptunia action u are still my favorite neptunia im sad than in super neptunia you cant change your overworld character with nep summoning puding i tough every character woud ave a special ability also chrome is obviously cured magiquone arfoire from rebirth 1 true ending i ave already recognise her 1 year ago wen i saw the oppening cough trealer good neptunia 100 new witheout any re used asset but far from my favorite also stop playing with the awfull english voice acting i cringe everytime i hear a japenese game in english i even play zelda breath of the wild with japenese voice in french voice zelda ave 12 year old glory to lady white heart glory to lowee my land of white serinity blanc white heart next white best waifu wen idea factory will be tired of safestation censorship i still wa this game looks great on pc i think ill wait for a sale the game just doesnt seem like something i should pay full price for plus i dont have a switch or pc yet so i refuse to get the ps4 version lol definitely a great nepnep game i loved it and it gets even better once you figure out the enemy weakness trick meh im fed up with side games i did them all except this one yeah even pp its just one more dimensionuniverse as if it wasnt confusing enough and also using the amnesia card is too easy ill pass waiting for the next canon game stopped watching a few minutes in just wanted to know if it was good glad to hear it is and will be bumped up to next play though on my list but the skyrim intro is amazing this is my first neptunia game and im really enjoying it the graphics are definitely a highlight for me the lack of memey dialogue is probably because nisa didnt touch it this is definitely the freshest neptunia game i have played since the first game what i like most about this game is the animation of the characters during cutscenes previous neptunia games only have those visual novel style drawings of characters talking to the screen being able to see nep claps her hands while talking with other characters is really a step forward from the idle talking we had in previous games hope they will keep doing moving story scenes like this in the future game ps if someone has the scene where vert is on game addiction withdrawal send me a link pls thanks edit i found a vid that has that verts animation in it the internet is great link httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7aydyhdmhhk the walking and the dash parti feel like we playing mega man the switch version has bugs and stuttering but those aside i still enjoyed it sham cold girls echoes in the background i love how underwater noirs twin tails just hang out if the bubble but youd think neptune and blancs coats would be uncomfortable to move on underwater especially plus no swimming animation thats how many an rpg does it but still this is why ill stick with the japanese audio either you go all in with the english audio or not at all instead of only dubbing about half of the game censored so for my first neptunia game it was pretty good i liked the gameplay and the music was great i played the switch version and i had some performance issues like fps drops and input lags in the menu i hope they bring out a patch or something but overall it was fun and i would play it again are there more than four basic goddesses this reminds me of the old school valkyrie profile games on ps 1 and ps2 people bitching about the battle system take some time and learn it crybabies i find the battle system refreshing nice and complex i like it great review i feel stupid playing this because i really dont understand the battle system it just doesnt make sense to me idk i agree i am really enjoying this one the best among ifs later games for sure if we exclude mary skelter switch version runs very poorly im glad that i wasnt the only one who thought about muramasa the demon blade when thinking about the movement in the game when outside of the battle i mean after realizing that i cant unsee how great would a game like muramasa but with neptunia characters would be excellent video i wish it was on the vita i really like turn based rpg games on handheld consoles they play well in that format because its okay if you get distracted by something and lose focus for a little while donno if it was a good idea releasing this so close to judge eyes or yakuza judgement i mean sure both series have their fans but to the casual who doesnt want to spend money on both which would be a better buy on someone who isnt familiar with both series a fun but generic looking 2d adventure game or a game where can punch can throw someone s poor head into a microwave and cook them to death xd i hope the switch version is good since you asked viewers about our experience with the switch version compared to what we see in this pc version video i can be of some help i got the switch le it runs like garbage its almost unplayable i did beat it but it was a nightmare the platforming is next to impossible becasue of how bad it runs and there are a lot of mechanic freezes such as during a battle at random itll just stop doing things the first day i had it in the volcano in lastation i was going up against one of those large fire monsters and it actions altogether just stopped iwas no longer able to press y to attack not to mention the enemy also was no longer attacking since zl is fast forward i did that and heldit for about 20 seconds literally nothing happened the only option i had was to try to flee because pause and a and b worked in fact every button except y worked but no matter how many times i pressed flee and the timer went down i never successfully fled the battle i tried over even though i have a lot problems with this game im glad you enjoyed it ive played it for 8 hours so far and im not really liking it that much mostly because of some weird design choices some platforms dont even look like platforms badreused animations etc and gameplay mechanics basically a waiting game on the other hand i really didnt expect to like so much this new kinda take on the characters also the music and art pretty good hello im from russia and also rewieved this game i liked it a lot i think i like it more than other neptunia games visuals are kinda wonky at first but it gradually grows on you and some locations are gorgeous ecspecially with soundtrack like sunken city and planeptune forests gameplay is a mix between classic jrpgs main battle system taken from valkyrie profile learning skills through equipment from final fantasy tactics and elemental system taken from shin megami tensei in which if you strike your enemy with elemental attack that they weak to you gain addiotional aps so the whole game is like a homage to classic 2d games and the game is very easy i never died even after beating story and going for optional side quests i beat a 100 lvl dragon being lvl 72 myself but the game has missable sidequests i think this game is eprfect for newbies to the series it doesnt rely very much on mythology of neptunia series and gradually introduces all the characters on the lmao so im not the only one to notice that bit at the start of the video huh i went in high hopes for this game but couldent even progress past leanbox because i just got fed up with the battle system btw the battle system is possibly the worst thing i have ever played in a jrpg ever its so braindead confusing and boring the game looks alright but thats really about it the music wasnt anything impressive either artisian studio claimed they were actually good at making rpgs somewhere if i recall but clearly they cant if i didnt buy the virtual copy on switch i would of returned this in my eyes this is almost as bad as the idol game dunno maybe ill give it another go later on buti just really hate the battles in this game which makes enjoying the story and jokes hard for me 10 seconds in and theres a riff on the video game industry and its constant pumping of samey iterations im getting this game really great and detailed review i can see how much work youve put into making this video really appreciate your effort just like always i still need to finish super neptunia rpg but ive really enjoyed it so far its truly something different than the main games its refreshing also 305 i got a little heart attack since i thought i heard my name lol i really like the game im about five hours in and im enjoying it why is the title in english i feel scammed did the run covered all the game trophies and secrets i mean 100 content finally started the game i actually really like it since it is similar valkyrie profile i dont care if its 2d3d the only spinoffs that just seem kinda weird to me were neptunia shooterpp but i did at least try playing them for a little bit not really my taste valkyrie profile but with neptunia character with the number of combat changes for these lastest few games i wonder if we gonna end up getting one with the combat system of ffxv at this rate you should do a video of what games you have on the ps4 im curious i like neptunia games thats why i feel bad when i must say that this looks just bad its been awhile since i played any other neptunia games im waiting for atelier rayza but i do love the style of this my only concern has always been the build up of the dialogue hopefully it holds up but im willing to try this i cannot help but think that the sound design is super annoying and im not just talking about neptunias highpitched anime girl voice screaming jumpuh there is also the fact that when you use the fastforward option in battle it speeds up the audio to make it sound like nails on a chalkboard i hated maple story for the jumping mechanics of having traverse the word by platforms i absolutly loved the neptunia games but this one looks like trash x damn i was so happy when i heard about this and now its a 2d platformer with a crappy animation and a crap animated battle system if you enjoyed 818 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtvrfie0hiom how did you get that beautiful ps4 theme lmao this looks like a trash flash game preorder cancelled neptunia gives me a break from the new games that come out so i try it out this looks more fun than the usual neptune games and the background art is quite striking people say that they dont like this change in the neptunia series but i think that theyre experimenting on it to see what people think about it and i think it looks beutiful but it lacks the battle system and not using special affects when the texts and menu appears and also lack using more lines for the npcs they should also use some anime cutscenes for the cutscenes but i think thats a little too much and it would cost alot overall i think it would be a great game if they fixed the issue that i see which i dobt it because its already released in japan im still excited when it comes in america aaaaagh i need this in english now so this game is set for a western release in the spring also anyone that criticizes canadian video game developers about not knowing anything in the video game industry need to have their brains check canadians are smart people why i cant find this game in the ps store ill get it and ill beat it as i have all the past nep games looks interesting certainly different but will most likely check it out 4518 it sucks that neptune doesnt constantly say jump every time she jumps anymore this is why western devs shouldnt touch japanese ips will likely buy this thanks for uploading overall gameplay looks a bit simplistic but the characters are so darn likeable i really wish they go back to the usual visual novel and turnbased style i love neptunia but i didnt enjoy the recent musou style and this new style theyre trying out really wish rebirth plus come out already it to goodbut i miss neptunia 3d old school tt happy new year red where is leanbox lowee lastation and plantnatune i usually get super excited for a new neptunia game but for once i dont really care about this one art looks nice while animation looksodd this strangely has the workings of a mobile game i so hope they dont go the gacha game route later down the line r3d keep your fingers crossed for an english release soon with death end request and team sonic racing i thought this was coming to the nintendo switch but which version is censored that comment concerns me cuz idk the first game was heavily criticized for being slowpaced plain boring but the combat system here is the same it just changed to sideview so its basically dragons crown combined with neptune im guessing you are going to be doing a review on this soon from the look of things i cant understand a word so i have no idea what is going on like how in the world did they get stuck in a book to begin with so when is this gonna come out internationally made by a western studio still gotta wait 6 months for the english version cool but why do we have wait is this a new bro game ripping off final fantasy end battle song is this a loligame did i just heard her sing the final fantasy fanfare lol that intro music was so good this looks better than i thought it would be ill have to check it out this looks like a cheap cash grab mobile game did this walkthrough cover all the games secrets and trophies i wonder how much sony screwed this game up ps4 the censor platform f them glowing book nep awesome i love it cant wait to watch more is this a remake or a new one this looks cool yes thank you tikal i am sured that you will play it it will be a excelent walktrough if you want to support me and the channel please leave a like subscribe and comment thank you this game has so many problems the lag it was a waste of 50 i love this anime and this game finally on the switch thank you for playing it great gameplay keep going yeah i was always a nerd of this anime its a great game and interesting story super neptunia rpg is currently on sale on nintendo switch and ps4 if anyone was waiting for a sale 60 off on ps4 50 off on switch sale ends december 22nd maybe they will listen and redue it better like they did with all the rebirth games mobile games cancer bleeding into console gaming count on stupid quebecquers to fuck up everything the game is fun different but fun as for the ps4 being lagy or bugy is a lie as i got it a week before release geting the dlc is pointless but neat to have new party members lege jumping is allmost in possible this game is at 82 on steam while the game is really simple and the combat is boring i would say it is in top 3 story wise its kinky beautifull and i cant afford it just like my ex the combat is almost like regular neptune combat but in 2d so what youre saying is that if regular neptune games were 2d without dodging and aiming it would be mobile garbage thank you for this review looks like you put more effort in this review than developers in their game welp and people thought this would be a spiritual successor to valkyrie profile such a waste of those beautiful environments the battle layout remind me of valkyrie profile from psx this game is epic to me i love the simplicity protip dont start with this game is goodbad many people will skip the rest of review after hearing that what the fuck is this garbage game this neptunia game is nothing like the ones on the sony ps vita you know 3d turn base jrpg customise characters so on neptunia rpg looks like a shitty mobile game that ran out of budget money to make the game lmao trash usually love the nep games but the gameplay of this one is a no no its really as you say mobile garbage cheap is definitely the biggest word to describe this game the npcs movement menu organization audio clipseverything was done in the cheapest way possible and playing through it is just so cringe the only thing this game has going for it is visuals and the cast i invested in the limited edition and i gotta say i couldnt be more dissatisfied withe the game i got it over thank you for making this review was about to get the game but i will wait for a sale now i have to say though the quest design in the neptunia games was always extremly lazy the quests you describe are pretty much the same as in all other games of the core series maybe aside from some quests required for the story i dont think that is a big con for neptunia fans wasnt the combat supposed to feel like valkyrie profile how could they mess it up so much i wish if games had actual story cuteness does not sell to me they might as well just do hentai at this rate that usually gets a pass for crap story really disappointed on this one still gonna buy the next neptunia game though they tried to go the same rout as indivisible but without the insight mikez has for dynamic game mechanics but the art could make some cute keychains shame considering this is one of the best this franchises ever looked what is the best game in this franchise is it available on pc you peeked my interest and id like to play a game like this that is actually good thanks honestly i always found neptunia games to be really lazy with their assets levels often feel recycled between games the only thing that carried it was the funny banter between the characters i feel like in recent years the writing got worse and worse and only a small handful of the dialogue was ever voice acted this is a shame because i really enjoyed the english voice acting i feel like the creators behind this games has enough of a budget and audience to release something of higher quality one thing annoyed me since the first time i saw the game man it seems they are fighting with rubber weapons against rubber enemiesthose animationsargh how is the length of the game the battle system was taken from valkyrie profile it isnt based off a mobile game it looks worse than the system from valkyrie profile 2 which was a ps2 game that speaks volumes when you couldnt improve a system that is close to 20 years old ill wait for a sale but thats how i feel about all neptune games i was really hoping itd at least be turnbased combat as many 2d rpgs are sad to see it be disappointing overall the jump running animations looks really lazy just a blur really feel like this game is intended to be made as a mobile game as far as i like the neptunia franchise i too am disappointed with this release i cant even believe folks have to say they wanted the game to be good that should just be one of those rules that remain unspoken like please dont kill me everyone wants a game from a franchise they like to be good and its kinda sad when folks have to say they wanted it to be good devs should know they fked up when they hear those words this is sad to hear i generally love the neptunia series but have no need to rush out and pay full price for this ill wait for a sale lol now youre going to piss off a lot of neptunia fans thanks for being honest i c your point i have heard nothing but primarily negative takes from the fanbase about this and now seeing more gameplay and another take this is just sad will you buy this side scrolling nep adventure which version will you be getting switch ps4 or pc for those that dont know super neptunia rpg is currently on sale until december 22nd 60 off on ps4 50 off on switch the switch game is bad dont get it not gonna support censors in my game sowy bye i only have 2 issues with the game so far firstly battles are rather tedious secondly the game is a little to 4th wall breaking i like it when nep breaks the 4th wall occasionally but it feels like every other joke is a 4th wall one also im playing on switch and theres occasional slow downs and frame rate drops when a battle starts with multiple large creatures and theres occasionally a glitch where nep will get stuck in a falling animation when going into a house kinda funny since you can still move around and it goes away after switching screens im about 2 hours in and loving it i some how managed to not get the story spoiled and i love how theyre dropping so many dang hints this is a prequel in a way which also means this would be the only neptunia game to take place in the main timeline god i hope my suspiciousions on chromes identity are true theres a way to attack infinitely by the tutorial its when you use the right elemental attack that the enemy is weak exampledogoo weak to fireuse fire attacks and youll recover the gauge instead of just depleting it p i think its that way this game is a 510 easy pass dont waste your money the reminds me why i watch subbed anime xp nope bad move changing the game to this i would of bought this game but since i just bought persona q2 collectors edition then im planning on getting crash team racing on friday plus judgement on the 25th this game just came out at a wrong time for me im so looking forward to the ps4 ver how is the length i have some questions 1 is there any endgame content if so what is it 2 are there any changes to the battle system or challenges in lategame does it get harder or easier or anything new you learn for the battle system i dont mind being spoiled lol no acknowledgement of the game being censored ok 0oooh it dont look very good i give it a miss untill i can buy it very cheap second hand side it not free roaming looks like a step backwards switch obviously ps4 version is censored i have the whole neptunia series and havent played maybe ill play it when ive played more of the others i planned that ill just watch 15 minutes of the gameplay cuz it would be little spoilers but ended up watching the whole video man thanks for the review as always no cpu candidates i guess i will pass on this one super conflicted with this my fav franchise has really taken a nosedive with this game i hope it picks up with the next game even if it is another spin off oh well im still guna nep this up at some point im sure if there was a vita release i would consider buying despite owning switch i am not a switch fan doesnt feel like ps4 game so i will pass death end request mary skelter fairy fencer f neptunia games excluding this and trillion god of destruction are my favorite compile heart games any news on mary skelter 2 western releasehyped for date a live rio reincarnation this game is kinda interesting to me and ive read the official information about it but i dont completely understand why many people call it out as a cheap mobile game ive tried out a game development software and even attempted on making a good quality mario fangame back in 2012 and i also remember watching my older brother play phoenix wright ace attorney on wii back in its era cough nintendo 64 cough blanc is my favorite copping that nep also i cant believe noble senpai hasnt done a vid about this yet nepodin supersphere fanservice edition i never played any of the hyperdimension neptunia games but i know neptune herself a little from fan videos and she would be a cool dlc character for super smash bros ultimate the thing is that theres already a sega rep for dlc and thats joker from persona 5 which is owned by atlus a subsidiary of sega if rom and ram are not playable here then i will not buy this game will this be consored i hear on the ps4 and elsewhere it is but so far nintendo hasnt been an ass about that kind of stuff so just want to make sure i cannot stand shit trailers like these with no gameplay at all we dont give a fuck we wanna see what the actual game look like i doubt this is real soa neptunia game that take himself serious i dont know that to think no actual gameplay no hype now dont go nepping up the wrong tree is this game main timelineuniversedimensionyou know oooh i love the parody of what they made so smart lol super neptunia rpg as i can see they remember and respect an old game super mario rpg think its his parody lol what is the language the song is sung its like a combination of germanjapaneselatin nep for smash ive been a fan of the neptunia series for quite some time but none of the games really stood out enough for me to jump on getting them before they went on sale after seeing this trailer and watching the gameplay demo from the devs showcasing the platforming in the overworld and the valkyrie profileish combat i may just preorder this one heres hoping it turns out to be a solid game soodin sphere with neptunia skins cause thats what im seeing is it me or i saw arbore it is an android game im finaly in the right anime great to see that there is a new game about the anime sees there wont be a pc version me welp goodbye game nep that is alloh wait and pudding i heard tortilah at the end loool i wonder if after or in this game vert willnfinally get her cpu sister ps4 xbox one nintendo switch windows 10 steam another weeab game

on account of xbox stunning music and beautiful visuals butwhat is it about all i can hear is nep nep an siddescroll nepu i would love this so is it only for switch or will it be able to be released on other platforms as well yeah but id rather have the main games no offense but i really dislike how the animate style looks in this game anyone feel the same 100 is that true arfoire oo nice butcan we have another major main line story for the series please its been a long time now thank nintendo for allowing the console waifus on switch i need this and a switch and the characters do not fit in with the mood xd what kind of gameplay can i expect from this game i never heard or played anything from this franchise send this to daitomodachi right now dreams never die and some come true theres no way theres calm and serenity in a neptune game most chill nepu trailer ever created lolis the game i wanna play this but im broke and i cant afford a nintendo swtich and cue neptune making fun of the melancholic music immediately after the game starts ok since when did nintendo suddenly morph into the ps vita stole all the niche games and suddenly become cool well fuck now i have to find 350 bucks on poverty level wage i guess i could try asking very nicely for christmas or maybe get enough amazon gift cards meh im better off looking on craigslist neptunia on switch huh intresting cant wait to get this game on ps4 everybody know a song like this plz be for ps4 too soon i cant wait for a le now to save money for this and a switch nep for smash ultimate whos with me alright i will get a switch nintendo why this exist oh fuck yes i like how the related game is hyperdimension neptunia such an underrated franchise i hope we got a pc release of this or riot beru beru they made neping a real thing lmao this music is amazing alright a few characters and some pretty good music but still i know nothing about thia game this trailer does nothing to peak my interest that song though s2 yes yes yes excellent the world is in my hands and i will never let go uniiiiiverse it kind of look like a mobile game yoooooooooo that soudtrack hmm a game on a nintendo console in a series where the main four characters are parodies a video game companies i wonder whos going to be the main character is this only coming out on the switch aight whos ready to grind what the name of the song and where to get it 99 people will say nep 1 has no clue wtf is this will this be out on mobile please tell me the game is going to be also for pc and not just a switch exclusive hey guys tell me if your gonna play this ill watch it im too poor to buy it and i dont have a nintendo switch ill be a healer i want a switch now nah this is a troll a trap card it has to be theres no way a game like that is making it to the nintendo switch is this only for the switch or we will get it on pc aswell fuck i hope they release adobe flash player for the ps4 the calm music and the background is extremely out of place with the neptunia characters there it just feels wrong something is wrong with this trailer not only shows it the japanese voice actors rather uncommon when theres an en dub of the game but also shows the jp logo which both would show it as a japanese trailer but as far as the official website is concerned it is only releasing on ps4 there i was expecting neptune to break the fourth wall at the end and say something like oooo sweet im in a new rpg and it sounds soooo calming im feeling really mellow right now gonna take a nap now find out more in the next trailer it has the appearance of a game indie lets hope for english release hope its as good as all the other rpgs on the switch lately but im already loving the epic cheesy approach theyre using for this game me rushing to store to buy switch my life is completed if hyperdimension neptunia had a racing game have all your favorite characters drift through the dimensional cosmos of all your favorite areas in gamindustry 50 is a bit much this game look like a fan remade of odin sphere but if they repair that puppet like movement it might be a good game i cant not like this no english voices how dare you deny my melissa fahn its time to kick ass and eat pudding and im all out of pudding i want to buy thisssss will this be on steam huuuuh nep on switch wait rie tanaka as in the one who sang freesia from megamen zero 4 oo as someone who beat neptunia vllr playing rebirth 3 beat perducing perfection beat megatagmention neptunia and playing 4 goddess online this is kind of a let down as far as gameplay visuals go looks amazing cant wait what one of these pedophile bait lolis is meant to be the switch a 2d rpg game huh i dont know if i should be impressed or not wheres noble sweet a neptunia game d wait were getting a sequel to the orginal neptunia a nep game is coming to the switch am i in the right timeline youve got to be kidding me wtf nuuuu oh well ill just get it in the cemu whenever it releases oh blanc ill see u their uwu wait what neptune on switch sold where is 5pb finally the petitions worked real question is will we still have fanservice in a game designed like this wait wasnt that the good arfiore from rebirth 1 sigh again unzips pants dayum the gameplay i miss odin sphere so much xd 0 content trailer what did i expect its triggering that theyre releasing this only for switch it would be okay for me if i only had a switch but no so any plans to port this masterpiece into pc like some other nep games or just give me a discount to have a switch and the new neptunia game in one go so i could have it in no problem feels weirdits like they were placed from gameindustri to a world thats like odinspherenot that i dislike it im intereted to see where this goes made me shed a tear whutnepu on nintendo switch trailer whoa so ready to nepnep there is definitely going to be lewd shit in this game whats that song it sounds great why dont make me buy a switch whats the soundtrack is this its quite nice to hear fuck off the switch doesnt need it should of stuck on sony t h i c c holy shit its nep nep the nep nep fanbase is my favorite fanbase im definitely going to buy this for my ps4 i cant wait to nep some nintendo switch is not family friendly no more time for some fanservice this is a switch exclusive this is new my mouth literally dropped when i saw this 0 this is why we humans are made to create masterpiece like these look like child of light but with neptunia characters i still have yet to 100 rebirth 1 looks like i have alot of work to do why did i have the urge to watch this oh yeahthat is definitely pure arfoire at the endthats interesting perdn si no lo escribo en ingles pero me resulta demasiado similar la presentacin y estilo general del trailer al odin sphere de ps2 sorry if im bad in english but i feel an unespected feel about the trailer is really similar in art and animation to odin sphere in diferents ways id like the neptunia games but im feel unwelcome with this game gameplay looks lame unfortunately alexa this is epic ori and the blind forest 2 look gre wait wrong game but seriously these graphics remind me of the ori and the blind forest i like how all of a sudden they are now shifting from scifi to fantasy from 4go as a gamer theres nothing i like more in a trailer zero gameplay and no hint as to plot slow intros of characters ive never heard of and their voice actors apparently are where its at fucking compile heart now well never get any hdn characters in ps all stars 2 that goosebumps me a bit oh boy has nep grown up to be in a mature epic rpg now i love this already and i havent even played it yet super mario rpgs opening happy adventure delightful adventure sounds more fitting for a neptunia game than the music heard in this trailer what the actual fuck this shit was real im not really sure how i feel about this game from what the trailer shows it kinda looks like another flat sidescroller i hope this comes to ps4 a beautiful scene nature surrounds a soft light reminding of something akin to a ghibli painting soft music plays suggesting a somber serious story awaits neeeep nepnep nepnep nepnep nep nep uuuhhhh gameplay pls yas im so getting this when it comes out in english even if its not still getting it cant wait for this to not be available in my country please give us the option for the english cast that was an amazing cast and i wanna hear em again welp looks like im getting the switch now im doubtful about this if its nintendo there wont be any lewdness that feel when you only have psvita and no switch let noble know we need that season 2 i have been shitting myself since 2014 wtf is this c a l m m u s i c its nep nep nep noire on smash omg a neptunia on switch not a big fan of rpg i thought neptunia games are sony exclusive but this is amazing neptune for smash 510 not enough pudding now its the waiting game what was the music from this called so wheres the gameplay boi the semicolon returns is that pure arfoire at the end and could that book on her waste be historie also is it just me or does this trailer have an odin sphere vibe to it to me this gives off a vibe of paper mario x child of light except replace everything with neptunia would buy its like kingdom hearts unchained x but actually good will this be out in english i can rewatch this forever i have never played any of the games and im so excited to be playing my very first hyperdimension neptunia video game nep on switch i was going to give my switch away but nevermind gonna get this super neptunia rpg is that title a reference to super mario rpg wait this isnt siberia prepare for otakubait though tbh i might try out a demo if theres one out there for it im excited for this i already preordered that game why does the music sound like it was composed for dot hack sign not that im complaining yuki kaijura is a great composer hai there i made cute animation with flipaclip apps please support me i hope you like it owo but i still in practice do anyone know the name of the song god damn im really looking forward to this dammit time to borrow my friends switch i think this has pushed me to purchase a switch the song that plays while there showing thjs is such a beautiful song when will this game realese aaaaghagajagahagg i dont own a switch dammit what is the name of the song anyone else glad to see the neptunia series change how its played again cool a 2d neptunia game and that song is magnificent damn it nintendo stop making me interested in the switch i dont have moneeeey hecc thats all we get please have a playable plutia please have a playable plutia please have a playable plutia awesome music sounds like nier automata neptune is back it doesnt actually look like that right but arent these games already rpgs this is gonna be like 20can right cause this shit look like an eshop title and not something worth actually spending proper money on the graphics remind me of odin sphere hope im not the only one a neptunia game on a nintendo console this will be a first if it is true i cant wait im all for another neptunia spinoff although i get the feeling this is an i s e k a i s t o r y the guardian legend lives on in nep now introducing neptunia for ios and android oh its for the switch in all seriousness the art and animations make it look like a lazily done mobile game not looking as good as playstation lmao as much as i want it as much as id love it it just looks so subpar like a flash game this is not my neptunia omg yes xbox beat that playstation and switch gets the nepu experience im so hyped i have ps4 but would love to have a switch to take around and play some nepu and nowa well thats a thing what is this a neptunes game on a nintendo console lady blanc mustve pulled some strings neptunia game for nintendo can i imagine neptune joins the battle in ssb game series i swear these games have so many different versions each one is so different i love it this is why i hate jrpg trailers scenery is nice characters are okay even showing voices are fine but for the love of god give me at least something in terms of gameplay nep nep hype half hoping its a mmo even though i know its not wow a neptunia game that isnt rehashed garbage waiting for pc version i did not expect a neptunia game to finally be on a nintendo system finally blanc ram and rom on their umplatform dimension now i have a reason to buy a switch nep im now reminded of the super mario rpg rap in terms of character models and music this trailer heavily reminds me of ar tonelico such nostalgic feelings nep nep is my waifu im coming nepu nepu and nepgyaaa44 rom and ram too p so many jrpgs how the hell am i supposed to keep up with all of them well my life is officially wasted away not enough of nep being nep the goddesses are pleased whats with this somber in neptunia i enjoyed the video but no gameplay is this coming to steam what the is nep finally leaving her beloved vitachan for switchsenpai i dont know about the other neptunia games but i played the remaster of the first one and i thought it was quite lazily made since you had to grind so much are the other ones like this im glad to see all those switch owners finally get some neppy sees title and thumbnail me welp all the weebs are going crazy in the comments more of the neps and its giving vibes of a few games like indivisible that ive seen from other previews im looking forward to this the music is giving me nier automata vibes fml i need to buy a switch now this game kinda has the same animation as alops and the dangerous forest p its an a ryona game just for u guys know a neptunia game for the nintendo switch blanc is pleased meanwhile vert is still crying in the corner man poor vert first she wont get a little sister and then her console pc doesnt count is the only one that havent released a neptunia game an dpeople say nepgear is the most bullied these games are too complicated for me as a newcomer to jump into they got how many games now too much for me to have to catch up on hmhmhm nice remind me of the vagrant now let us sing nep nep till it comes out the lewd is coming to the switch holy crap theyre still making these played it during anime expo and honestly i cant wait for it waiting for sony to flip their shit since this was exclusive to playstation consoles beforehand calling it now well looks about as good as all the other neptunia spin offs everyone is here that opening is so copy pasted from odin sphere it hurts xd gone are the days when hyperdimemsion neptunia games were made exclusive for sony playstation nep for smash confirmed is this trur needs more iffy what is this gonna be the super paper mario to neptunias paper mario all of the hype right now why is it 2d cant the switch handle 3d like it normally is fuck me sideway my wallet got another hole ive probably watched this trailer about 10 times and still going the music is beautiful and i cant wait for the game why switch why not playstation anymore so im guessing this isnt a f2p game finally a neptunia that isnt only on the playstation console i got em on the pc but the switch hell yes very cheap animation looks like this is going to be an extremely budget title wow i really hope the game turns out all goofy and fun like the rest of the series so that people who watched this trailer can get horrendous mood whiplash wow thats cool but no playstation release the console that every game has exclusively been on up to now nice very cool omg its so beautiful neppu awwwwwww nep nep nep nep nep nep im definitely buying this gotta work my ass off to get a switch this christmas for this game then turn around and get smash bros zelda just 3 on my list so far omg pls let it come out on pc to i cant afford the switch never really got into the nep games but if this game sticks with the vanillawarestyle aesthetic then im willing to give it a go is this a super mario rpg meme playstation exclusive not anymore wow the trailer does not show any gameplay but the music sounds very good i wonder when is this game coming out maybe in 2019 like all the other fucking new nintendo games its a good thing that its also coming out on ps4 super neptunia rpg it is the only one just for me when i play the game i get lost in a phase then i find out im stuck in blannys maze who needs a girlfriend anyway great art bad animation whhyyyy did atlus help if make this the graphics ect look a lot like something atlus do is this game coming to pc what about megadimension v 2 can we have that well when the switch first came out i wanted a neptunia game on the system and now it exists glad there is going to be this game on the switch it looks good i want to know a release date soon and i still dont have a switch whyyyyyy release it on e shop for 3ds or somethinggggggg wtf wtf someone explain this a playstation game not nintendo lesss go the franchise is expanding i love it also the song makes it sound medieval it reminds me of child of light i honestly found the bgm very soothing i wish i know whats the title of the song so i can listen to it and have peace with it alright neptuno metes odin sphere this better be true even though i use a ps4 pc release qq i miss when the trailers showed gameplay well that explained something seems to be taking inspiration from vanilla ware this time around my wallet cant take anymorehang in there buddy just one more game no male characters outcome train go boom cant wait and the cult of nep nep rises again from the deep of heaven wow superneptuniarpgiscomming nep nep should also be on pc stop catering to switch soyboys make it to the pc and you will have more sales who here thought of super mario rpg because of the title xd i play on ps4 but im hype holy shit its actually on the switch i see they didnt pussy out on the fan service how much you want to bet the us will get the censored verssion hmm while this seeems all and good how about the dev do something different something like this httpsyoutubetoyxbqdbjfm arent they all rpgs except for not one rhythm game i got to say if this is not metroidvania of some sort i will be massively disappointed cant wait if we needed any more reasons why blanc should be in smash besides the fact that she is the personification of nintendo itself then this could be it having a neptunia game on the switch wow a reason to touch my switch after so long hype generic flash game animations good job nintendo truly next gen gaming sigh neptinia video games are better call of duty sucks dealwithit i wanna play super neptunia it is a fun game i still gotta play a lot of neptunia games i have not been able to play them all thanks to my friend hunter not letting me play them cause a female is the main character of each game so i only played the a few or so of them but i wanna play all neptunia games regardless of what anyone says my friend hunter needs to try neptunia games and anime before he knocks them more and more nep please wait isnt nep a fuckin anthropomorphized playstation that makes it really fucking weird to me that theres a neptunia game on the switch of all things the nintendo switch made by nintendo sonys only real competitor in the games market the music is beautiful and the battle system seems pretty good but i really hope they change their clothes to something that better fits the environment though holy neps oh so theyre gonna make like odin sphere now the new girl at the end im assuming shes a girl because if thats actually a girlish looking man this canadian studio is already in deep shit with the fanbase looks so out of place among the neptunia cast all of them have either skimpy dresses or shinypastel colors and the new one has an outfit with toned down colors that covers her entire body by the way it doesnt seem theres any computers or video games in that fantasy medieval setting theyre in now i was expecting vert to be suffering withdrawal symptoms im still wondering why its a side scroller rpg so the first time the switch gets an entry from this series its the first unique one in years im fine with this is this going to be like odin sphere with a character reading a story from a book why on nintendo switch now must i pay nintendo switch to play this game well the rumors are true the hyperdimension neptunia is coming to the switch this game looks trash please tell me this is gonna be like odin sphere another game that i need to buy in japanese neptunia games are known from terrible localization censorship developed by artisan studios of canada yeay the best game ever is back and i m a only poland fan hyperdimension neptunia with nier automata bgm kinda i like it new change of pace from neptunia series song that is friggin relaxing wait isnt it the first time a neptune game arrives to a console other than the playstation black ops 3 neptunia boyz where you at im getting huge vanillaware vibes from this who is singing this whos the composer its beautiful neptune a hyperdimension tail sry i had to it looks so similar in artstyle this trailer is honestly way more calm than what i was expecting from a neptunia game neptunia on the switch yoo neptune for smash someone had to say it seeing them like this is like playing the artstyle of the story sections of the games hyppeeeeeeeeeee neptunia for the swiiiiittttcccchhhhhh crap the one neptunia game ill never get to play my collection is ruined looks like a vanillaware game tbh i like it though see odin sphere leifthrashir dragonss crown 13 sentinels i swear we have to get nep in smash now its also the opening theme for the game though seeing it used as a trailer makes me realize just how well it works for that needless to say im very excited owo if there was ever a harder mood shift between music and how nepu actually is the music sounds like nier music i bet that book is histoire and she must be telling us the story of the human arfoire chrom i love the neptunia franchise beautiful music beautiful artwork awkward movement but ill get used to it so beautiful cant wait for this also the music is awesome honestly beautiful music holy fuck a was just thinking about it yesterday nep nep indeed the first neptunia game i be able to play 012 paperdimension neptunia and the thousand year door that would be the best this is way too peaceful and solema for a neptunia game mebe but all right im korean no region lock please for steam lol right now we playing game from blanc this song cleanses my soul from all the 4th wall breaks and lazy nep this theme bring tears to my eyes so beautiful this makes me proud to be canadian since this was developed by canadians neptune for smash ultimate still hyped for this game well i guess i cant kill myself yet idea factory if you change that lazy animated style and the battle system i will buy it otherwise this will be a no go for me the animations in this are just weird especially the walking or generel body animations i once had a neptunia game for my psvita it was great i invested 200 hours into it i want the classic neptunia games back the background song reminds me of legacy from devil may cry 5 really looking forward to this i would also love to see the previous titles on the switch as well damn a switch logo and not a ps4 one looks like the soyny pissstationpoor has finally taped out god damn it this is my aesthetic cant wait switch version for me not dealing with sonys censorship bullshit anymore bombyx mori is the scientific name for a moth i wasnt hype but then i saw super cute good girl arfoire from a certain games ending and now im totally on board gimme gimme gimme o no steam page but steam is listed also why the degrade in animaiton flash cmon this is an april fools joke right ohhh this music can anyone confirm if the censored version is solely for the ps4 version only this look pretty dam good the music does not match neptunia at all because the other games had upbeat music that inspired you while this games causes depression who wants neptunia dlc for smash that better be human arfoire at the end or im not interested in this game dont buy sony jrpgs people they are censores that also counts for super neptunia rpg buy switch or pc sony is forcing japanese developers to censoe their games now causing delays all over the place huh i see why looks like this game is getting censored by sonypc release when til then take a look at dragon spear my friends im exicted that it on switch hopefuly the other past games would soon follow is this like a spinoff or something g pc release when so i can crack it international idea factory is full of nep nep when the japanese channel is full of yaoi shit that no one wants where is my wife nepgear this art style reminds me of odin sphere i love it now this i need still on the hype train comment if ya are damn good we indonesian actually

series on the switch wtf this will be on switch wth why no pc version or will that still be coming ugh no melissa fahn welp theres yet another neptunia game ill pass on other is hyperdevotion noire whats with the nier style song animation looks like shit fucking newgrounds flash game port it to steam pls the opening is like from sword art online exclusive well this is sad love you idea factory

switch or ps4 this should to be on steam cant wait to take screenshots nepnep path traveler i heard about this nep nep motha trucka so the neptunia series finally said noires console wasnt enough and spread to another one i see also while the game looks good the character animation so reminds me of someone using flash to make the characters move just gonna say that i hate this style of game where the animation has each joint look unhinged and the motion is stilted like how it is in pinstripe that being said a neptunia game on a nintendo console fuck you for thinking im not going to buy it welp it finally happened a neptunia game on a nintendo console i think i can finally be happy i want this please let it be on pc hoouyea i can not be the only one getting ori and the blond forest vibes from this cant wait this looks like heroine anthem zero including the music may lord nepnep be with u gentleman so when can we see some gameplay please tell me this isnt a nintendo switch exclusive plase tell me this will come out for pc too release this game on play store there must be making a game for androd right where are guys oh im sorry but did i hear a nep outside my door i wonder if going to have a pc version of this game now im crying for this if theyre going for chibi live 2d should atleast put it on playstore and put some gacha because 1010 would nep the fuck out of dat gacha yeah this game is not worth it but does it have artillery only if child of light was made by idea factory and compiled heart holy crap anime on the switch its my dream come true omg yesssss im so excited i cant wait sees the trailers this is going to kick assin a good way well it looks pretty good i wanna give it a try the only neptunia games that ive played are vii and rebirth 1 i loved both this opening movie looks boring as hell and i absolutely hate the music blanc is best girl i hope i can buy that game in pc version i cant watch vert drink tea alone anymore i get an strong scarborough fair vibe from this song at 023 043 the characters are drawn stupidly well but those animations look stiff very very stiff game without nepgear cant be good isnt gonna start this game or already i dont even have the switch but if i do get definitely getting this game for sure nep nep ik 99 of the comment section will say this i realy hope its for steam too vv dont think i get a switch that fast where i live at the moment xd delayednepuuuuuuuuu at least i now know what the story is aboutand im hyped rise rise rise rise rice rice rise rise rise and awaken i will probably get a nintendo switch just because of this game well as beautiful as that music is it kinda scares me like its far too serious and melancholic for neptunia copy paste odin sphere neptunia rpg edition release on 2019 game support for ps4 and nintendo switch only for available when for released i absolutely love the art style of the environments not gonna lie but the way the graphic are is like kingdom hearts union cross i seriously dont know what to expect from this game but the good thing about the neptunia series is that as long as it has its characters im always down for it really this series is so full of waifus ahh yes finally some nep might be my favorite nep opening im gonna have a nep time why he s not comin on steam and xbox my soul are singing after this looking forward to the english voices as well top hat boy looks pretty cute please do something about the stiff animations im a fan of odin sphere but this still looks weird please do something about the stiff animations im a fan of odin sphere but this still looks weird may have to get a switch to take nep on the go this better be fucking good remember my dudesif the trailer is insanely goodthen the game will be shit neppu i want this this game is looking so god damn beautiful cant wait i am so excited for this i love my neps so the delay is only for the localized version rip improving the animations that music was beautiful this series is one of my guilty pleasures wheres plutia now you can nep in the go implying the neptunia games arent mostly rpgs already having the word rpg at the end of the name of neptunia game is like calling super mario bros platformer when it is obvious what genre of game it is gonna be i guess the developers were just running out of names so decided to add the word rpg at the end of this game meh dont know what to expect a neptunia game without nepgear heresy heresy i tell ya make for mobile to i want to play because the other game take to much rom and ram and now you make 2d game of it pls make for mobile am i the only one getting a neirautomata vibe from the music wait this will be available for the switch neptune for smash i doubt it but one can dream sigh still no switch on a side note blanc and her sisters are technically getting replaced soooooooooooo at the very least the color schemes dun match p crap i really wanted to play it this year im already getting both goosebumps and an idea of what this game is going to do considering that every game in the neptunia series is a rpg and 1 rhythm game what does super neptuna rpg mean im for real i would be so pissed off if this isnt a metroidvania they made it more dramatic than it actually is d its not final fantasy or tales series i hope this gets a pc port would like to try this game out but shame i dont have a switch dont care what opposers would say about this game am intrigued with this game heres come the hype train since no vita version i was hoping for a pc version but nope the question is if is this canon to the rebirth 2 hyperdimention will it be ported to pc its got a real leifthrasir vibe going thats not a bad thing this is way different tone than what i was expecting from a neptunia game it giving me odin sphere vibe and i love it if you are trying to get me hyped its working i havent been this hyped for a game since well the last neptunia game please take on pc and playstation and xbox by the nep be with you my friends press f for hype f blanc hey guys nepnoirevert what blanc welcome to my snowfields motherfuckers good more neptunia for the ps4 is always great news psa this is not switch exclusive ps4 still is getting it eat that nintendo fanboys and drones was too late to explore the world too early to explore space but exactly right to play neptunia games life is good anybody besides me looked at this and thought dust oh hell yes not for pc not for pc whyyyyy getting ori vibes from this the background seems familiar is this online or another offline neptunia game i dont really think this would be good even with the delay i just cant think of neptunia as a 2d rpg it doesnt work for some reason but i could consider buying it if they improve that horrible gameplay and animation the animation reminds me of a certain unique you could say type of game wow the music and backgrounds give the neptunia world a much different feel why is it a switch exclusive uuuuighghgh damn it an exclusive hope this isnt a sign that the neptunia series will start making console exclusives like what square did with kh sorry im just gonna ask when is 4 goddesses online getting the multiplayer fixed that game cost too much for it to halfwork i know it probably wont get fixed but please im giving it a try fuck ninbendo whens this coming out on pc what language is the woman singing in so its like an rpg mario its referenced a lot around the franchise so it would make sense need song plis what song i want this on pc i really like the way the looks waitso this will be medieval fantasy themedbut they will keep their normal clothes im looking forward to it but i do hope characters like mages uzume and gold third come back in this one the sprite work is a thing of beauty pc steam please october super mario party november pokemon lets go pikachu december super smash bros ultimate spring super neptunia rpg yep life is good looking forward to returning to another neptunia grind are we gonna be able to skip the intro thing cyberdimension took too long to load so im hoping well be able to actually skip the long wait that better be arfoire im happy its coming out next year i like what i saw gameplay wise but the game still needs time to iron out tech issues like the clunky animation oh thank goodness its on the ps4 hey ifi artisan studios dont think you have me fooled i know this game basically rips off agarest war 2s design pattern i winder if this game will be like valkyrie profile this one looks like a buy can you guys release a 3d hyper dimension for switch please one of the playstation 3 ones is fine crippling nepression intensifies too bad its delayed but im still excited man what a bummer spring 2019 this sucks man come to pc pls 3 im disturbed in a good way a really good music with so much vibe that change from the original neptunia spring 2019 cries in american seriously though i can wait as i need to obtain all of the other games so far only having rebirth 3 i want this game d more story of the 4 cpus interesting we better get this on the pc looking forward to it i have a question in the description there is a link for the standard edition does that mean there will be a special edition i hope so i have never had the chance to get a special edition of this series expect to see it feb 22 hmmmm the title seems familiar especially with a forest seen at 030 idea factory international ive got an idea find and ask masahiro sakurai to add neptune in super smash bros ultimate before it comes out in december this year wait the page says fall 2018 is this not coming to the if store till much later interesting dont know if its good im sad i have to wait longer for the nep but the nep will be well worth the wait a man needs a name for the song anyone know it shouldve kept the name brave neptunia ultimate rpg seriously this theme sounds too serious for a neptune game i hope they use this time to improve the movements s animations to make it smoother the characterss moves were so stiff in gameplay id rather it be delayed and good no mans sky wasnt delayed and look what happened to that because the switch exists i got to double dip on some neptunia games now may the nep be with you my children please tell me thats arfoire at the end and on the cover a purified arfoire being a major character would make this game legendary you know if games get delayed its a chance its a good game i have high expectations for this especially on the switch 2019 spring is a long way but we have to understand the effort they are willing to take to improve the game and story like nep say see you neps in spring a six month delay what happened isnt the game being developed in english in the first place being that it is a canadian company again just like i said with the japanese version the opening looks pretty lackluster it got delayed weak oh well spring 2019 i guess so excited the nep nep returns hes selling anime shirts and his whole youtube channel is based on anime you can kill metal dongos with the absorb ability no need for items so the only way to reenter that place is beating the game buu this is only possible towards the end of the game i only played like few hours and wanted some tips but welp i got them late game lvl 70 i hadnt had an issue with them dieing while having both neptunia and blanc in the party breezing through planeptune spamming glacicus edge and terrasa edge depending on the opponent of course if i encountered 2 tororos id use flee to get out of there less i waste a bunch of revives the only complaint i have is that the accessing and using menu screen is very laggy after the download and i dont know if its because i have too much items in my inventory or if ive downloaded too much gamescontent on my switch either way ill find out soon enough anyone else experience menu screen issues and possibly a solution for it this game felt so empty when iffy compa werent playable just wondering if anyone knows this is there an item that lets party members not in battle attain the exp of active battle members also i think the dlc is a bit boring i mean you just get swimsuits and power ranger suits thats it for a mediocre rpg valkyrie profile didnt have dlc but has way cooler battles plus what is up with the confusing skill set party member setup like seriously game has lag and confusion all around i needed to get that out my system i just wanted to play as rom and ram ive been waiting so long im gonna wait when this game goes on sale despise how it looks i just cant seem to connect myself how the combat system even works since it looks so iffy and medicore not gonna pay full price for the game so again im gonna wait for a sale when it drops in price since its a spin off game idea factory back at it with the nickel and diming for characters that shouldve been playable to begin with very good noirebestgirl too bad nepgear and uni havent been added yet once they do though ill die a happy man didnt know the sentai set had helmetsmight have to get it now if and compa are dlc characters in this game what the fuck now im really not buying it i bought the dlc characters before starting the game and got the free gear just noticed that artisan is the one who made the game hehe well having her with iffy and compa made early game easier iffy n compa dlc if is love if is life without if the game will be dull i want to pet blanc thanks for showing the dlc as always i will get the additional characters i havent touched the game yet but is there another playable character besides the four goddesses that isnt dlc cat ears are a good solution to most problems does this mean they could add nepgear and the other cpu candidates this is like paper mario they copy paper mario and other games they did upset the outfit i have the switch version and for some reason there is no option currently available to get noires swimsuit and sentai outfits poor noire she really is alone funny how artisan said she cant help you in battle because she has to lead the resistance yet there she is the whole game through the switch version had some free weaponequipment dlc if im not mistaken making the early game not sure about the ones you have to pay for w all love dlc more dlc gotta release soon i hope i solved this problem with cat ears this is the kind of gaming content i want to see on youtube dot com i havent even played the game yet and i bought the dlc characters and im waiting for compile heart to finish updating and patching the game before i play i have the limited edition of the nintendo switch version if you want to level up the dlc characters late game get some granite and toss it at the metal dogoos located in the secret area inside histoire i havent played the game yet should i start with the dlc characters blanc doesnt wear her hat in her sentai outfit probably because it wouldnt mix together well i may consider getting this thanks yellow its gonna be a while before i do anything but i do plan to get a physical switch copy of the game itself u had me at compa 1 hit ko new members thats gonna get annoying iffy 3 the wife will be super happy thanks for the info iffy compa artisen awesome super neptunia rpg gameplay with japanese voices httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvolhzdhserm wow it really does look like a mobile game ill wait for their next game and see if they do any better i really felt like i was watching some sao memory defrag gameplay 49 20 is a better price for this game but the music is quite good man i saw a few stutters in the video handheld mode please im waiting for my limited edition for the switch version would have been better jp voice dont you think you know its bad when the game gets tossed in with the never ending flood of kemco rpgs thanks for the review blue so sad because the neptunia series is always good ill pick this up when its eventually in a flash sale for like 10 i predicted this when it became known that a western studio is making this game i really hoped i was wrong so sad that a game with so much potential is wasted the 2d concept does still sound great so maybe someday they redo this in a better way thx for the gameplay i played the game for an hour and couldnt stand it especially the combat as you pointed out the presentation is just bad and how the story was introduced was awful the battle system tried to avoid being menu based but suffered for it i think the game could have been better if it wasnt given to a team that hasnt had any experience with making any other game doesnt feel like they even understand what makes neptunia neptunia they re turn back to 2d damn it man i was really hoping this game will be good like not it okay but really really fun and good ill skip this one im surprised you havent mentioned any of the many bugs and glitches like loading stuttering slowdown and input lag that plague the game but then again ive had the unfortunate mispleasure of playing it on switch doesnt even run 60fps you cant even control neptune with the dpad for fucks sake or view the cgs the battle system is supposed to be a parody of valkyrie profile that game also had party members assigned to buttons but fails as for using items it works like tales games in which you decide who uses the item with the face buttons as for running the countdown counts down to the chance of you running when it runs out you run if it was successful oh and its in french because its artisan studios first language i blame the canadians in quebec ima getting wind waker flashbacks from the fans outrage against the censorship for this game people are angry about this game being censored on ps4 but im a lot more angry about rom and ram not being playable and not even appearing in it im not buying it because no rom and ram do you want to know why pc is master race sonys censorship nintendo switchs low resolution paid online service and big prices do people really care about shittunia games sis this phone game cant wait to sell my ps4 and buy a switch ill get it on steam thanks bought it on the switch i just preordered the limited edition of super neptunia rpg for the nintendo switch inb4 the moral busybody idiots who think they have some form of moral high ground on censorship i hope the sjw trash you are trying to please buys your games for onceor actually even plays them for that matter to make up for the actual buyers leaving you why would you take it upon yourself to censor things sony nobody wants that definitely pick up for the switch show sony we dont agree with the pointless censorship by not buying these games for their platform 999 of peoples comments are getting this on the pcsteam or the switch and im one of them the remaining 1 others yeah jokes on you sony but ive already decided to go with the switch version no thanks ill get it on pc thank you censorship is cancer just like feminism why its gotta to be all femaleswhy fck you sony for censoring the nep nep not even nintedo famous for being family friendly sensors the anime goodness in their games im a sony fan too i got your premium phones and ps4 get with the program you guys lack when it comes to software often hey sony i dont know if you relise this but the peope who play these games arent children stop babying us and censoring stuff for no reason btw great job on losing sales for this game dont keep it up its not like youre endorsing an adult game right just a little fanservice to add spice to it is that rei 005 is the nintendo switch in this game is she a petanko travestite loli yaknow because switch lol new to neptunia here whats this censorship thing about they arent dressed that modestly to me honestly your much better off buying the steam version since not only is it not censored its also comes out sooner i think by a week or two and it will also be cheaper something about iffy having a 20 off deal for early adopters game publishers should label games not censor them that is dictatorship and discourages creativity say goodbye is censorship in ps4 biggest failure sony nintendo won this time game if plutia was in it id consider buying switch and pc versions are better so not this time sony you got recked by pc and switch as they are going to get the most copies sold wasnt this game coming out for nintendo switch too edit nvm i already saw the comment confirming it cant wait to play it on switch i wish i had a switch i only have playstation rip me gotta buy the censored version i hate these games gimme a paper mario thousand year old door instead sony we love neptunia but we hate your censorship playstation might as well start uploading the switch trailers for these games hope you guys revert back to how you were before i actually like how this looks more than the previous games i tried playing the original ones on pc not too long ago and got a little bored of the environment and gameplay not another facebook game please censored no buy buying for switch since playstation has gone liberal with the censoring thanks for showing the gameplay sony gotta go buy this on the switch so it wasnt rpg before its to protect the children garbage censorship i dont encourage anyone to buy this i cant waittttttt im getting this on switch as well how come i didnt get notified about this doesnt matter im not getting the garbage ps4 censored version only mod can save this game on steam to get uncensored i love the enjoy the neptune series and i love the english va need more plutia and yet i get annoyed when the limites edition come out after the release of said game example hyperdimension neptunia vii ps4 came out then the limited edition for ps4 then finally the switch version probably with all the dlc so they might do the same when pa4 of this come out and then 5 month later the switch version of this come out dlc included i might get this game on the switch because it has the title super neptunia rpg in it which reminds me so much of super mario rpg basically the titles swapped names im surprised that nobodys even mentioned that in the comment section instead of complaining how sony will censor their version of this game come on people am i the only one who noticed the title swap censored by noire me this game looks fun cant wait comments proceeds to commit world war iii think for a sec do you really want to spend on watered down version of the game thumb down this so sony will learn a lesson what a nice mobile ga wait its on ps4 i want this on my vita gonna buy it so in three years i can triple the price im getting the nintendo switch version anyone else getting the switch version wont buy anything censored im an adult and if i buy games with adult themes that my prerogative honestly im not even sure ill go with a ps5 with all the censorship sony keeps laying down in this video commenters angry they cant get to watch underage lolis cleavages wow a neptunia game that i actually have some interest in anybody else having a laugh over these turbo nerds crying about cartoon tiddies it reminds me of sdorica sunset the soundtrack is promising enough you censored i bought a switch to get them uncensored and stopped my ps plus wow this looks terribly ugly this is just one big cashgrab for neptunia fans thinking that theyd buy this game just because neptunia is slapped on as the title this is garbage dont waste your time with this i used to always choose ps4 version of games over the nintendo switch not anymore lets see how profitable censorship turns out sony avoid this version if you want the full game and nothing being taking out will be waiting for the switch version i never press dislike on videos but i heard that this game is censored so ill make an exception will get it on switch i can see this as a mobile quero meu fan service discensura isso sony censured no thanks nintendo switch here i come as much as i love ps4 im going to switch to nintendo switch for this unless it gets uncensored i really dont care for censorship just gimme more nepnep and everything will be just fine another game censored by sony but not on nintendo switch or steam thank goodness im getting the switch version i dont appreciate sonys censorship policy sorry playstation you messed up when you pushed the censorship nintendo is the new big boy in town not another censored release peck i cant believe im getting a switch to play the game how it was meant to be game on my birthday kappa looks like the battle system was taken from cross edgeagarest 2 would have bought it for vita if it were released there buying on steam youre really helping out valve and nintendo with all this censorship sony keep it up dummies android please gonna grab an uncensored copy on sale not on ps4 hurray for switchsteam uncensored versions i need to buy a switch the dislikes are from the people who arent embracing the ways of the nepnep keep the censored version for yourself ps4 i will get it on either switch or pc why is there a rating system if youre going to censor a game the whole censored thing is stupid as its our choice to view content and that means its our responsibility on another note no customisations for clothes seems to be missing a lot of features so hopefully it isnt expensive what censore i dont see any thing just yet better not censor anything on the ps4 no purchase you just keep making me go to your competition sony is this censored soyny or you can play fgo for free now the only neptunia game that havent released is a visual novel this game bombed in japan and is even available on mobile hence why it looks like a mobile game surprised it got a western release reminds me of invisible a bit remind me of atelier iris just an fyi to everyone thats planning to buy this port it has some altered content and yes its censored on this version picking this up on switch not supporting sony censorship oh its that game which you forced to censor sony no money from me cant wait 3 buy ps4 and switch sighturn based can i give my money for drakongard 3 remaster or the psu title remaster something like that this game got pushed back 5 times ngl i love hyperdimension but this game looks pretty boring sony game censored everything looks a lot like valkyrie profile count me in cant wait to play the uncensored version on switch wont be buying any censored products sorry also will not support ps5 unless sony does crossplay on all supported titles i wish more agreed im not buying your censored games playstation in what way this game its censored i dont play neptunia games but it is a rpg so i will play it this version is censored avoid how much content is censored makes no sense censure in gameswe pay and we get privated of things because stupid kids lol at all these virgins crying because they wont see lewd pixels ive only played a few neptunia games but i dont get all the angry comments about censorship you censored nepnep seriously free multiplayer oh nice sony censoring another nep nep game no thanks ill get it on steam or switch is it me or does this game look terrible lets flood the comment section that we will buy the non censored version on switch or pc nope free multiplayer id buy this by the look of it but its probably going to cost like 80 bucks and it isnt worth that i just want to thank sony for making sure they keep this stuff away from my fragile 25 year old mind i mean how would i deal with an uncensored version obligatory not buying on ps4 because censorship comment ooh it looks great now i really wanna play it a girl awakens in this world with no recollection of anything beyond her name amnesic girls in jrpgs classic troupe thank you sony for making the choice easy for me i cant wait to buy the nintendo switch uncensored version awesome cant wait to get the switch version uncensored a censored neptunia game that looks like a mobile game on a console no thank you looks like a free to play mobile game eh looks like a mobile game though can you imagine the uncensored version free multiplayer just buy it on switch or pc if you have that platform ive never played a nep game but this looks nice sonys censorship censored no buy simple thats why nintendo switch outsold ps4 in japan now why is the comments filled with virgins not buying your censored version sony nintendo switch it is no thanks i prefer 3d platform games if i had the infinity gauntlet i would snap the sjws that are ruining everything im going to definitely grab this game on switch i played the other nep games on ps4 and the ones that werent available on steam but if there censoring it on ps4 ill grab it on switch well i know im buying either the pc or switch version we have to show sony that we wont give in to the censoring of our hobby money will talk when they see their is no profit in censorship i could never get into these type of games but i always appreciate the art work why censor kids dont know how to play these kind of games im hoping one day they will release a nep game similar to dragons crown sidescrolling beatem up didnt even have to look at the comments to know what the comments were gonna be about its that predictable now nice to see neptune in the playstation channel of course im gonna buy and platinum this cant wait to play the uncensored version on steam or switch not buying your censored games sony this game has horrible optimization even on ps4 and game is very blend and boring there is a reason why game bombed in japanese release sorry sony but not buying your censored games nintendo switch and steam versions are the best choice i rather get the game on switch than ps4 since sony uncensored some of its game content i might buy it for ps4 since i dont have the money for a pc or switch is this a mobile gatcha game like epic seven censored nepnep game no thanks to think that canadians did a japanese job

version did you have to send back the ps4 version in order to get the replacement holy shit ive been watching you for a bit and did not expect to ever hear you reference behemoth and cryptopsy that was fucking awesome also great review man been on the fence with picking this box set up so its nice to actually see it in action what the hell a game booklet in 2019 did i like time travel to the past where did you all find a limited collection edition i could not find any i dont know which version i should get what do you guys think the switch or the ps4 version 344 when i say extreme metal its humor like that that keeps me glued to the floor from laughter metal planning to buy it during steam summer sale about the white stuff on the box i have the switch le and i can confirm that no that is not in fact part of the design i believe that one has some kind of damage on it it could be a printing mistake or like how print can be sort of taken off in a way by being rubbed to hard also since you ended up getting a switch replacement for the ps4 one how does it run for you i play it handheld cuz my hdmi port on the dock is messing up and it runs like literal garbage dispite already beating it and being level 84 right now its extremely hard to do the platforming and many battles with larger monsters or esters mech which is the worst one makes it run at about 5fps i did a review of super neptunia rpg on my channel im so jelly u have the collectors edition i wish i could have the pc collectors edition but even if i could the 100 asking price is too muchits just disappointing how many people seem to be giving this game griefwhen they just dont understand it or the point that the games story is all about its a game clearly made for us proper fans not new comers to the seriesif people didnt like stella deus princess crown grand knights history or various other games like that then really they wont enjoy this its just all the grief im seeing people give this gameyet these say exact people come out with crap claiming stuff like pubg is a great game what the fuck they had a limited edition imma buy it in like two weeks for the ps4 hope the games story and battle system are good i didnt want to spoil anything lol mine is still in the mail so i havent got a chance to play it great death growls lol i suggest taking the stuff out of the big box and squish it down if the bottom can be taken apart like other boxes it will save space i might get the uk switch version au150 though i have the game already though thanks ozgameshop for getting it here 1 day before release it released the 28th i got it 27th from the 2 hours of play time i like it but the switch version is laggy af every battle there is lag in the animations like frameskipping pisses me off well unfortunatelyi dont have a nintendo switch nor am i living in america you really purchased the ps4 version fat histy xd i still hope to get physical collectors editions for pc some day i gave up on buying new consoles a long time ago i actually really like the fat histy box design then again im a really boring person so thats probably why naisu that collection looks great so sad i couldnt get the le in australia and im not able to get the game for a few days due to an atm eating my card and the bank cutting it up only a couple days till i get a new one and get my first physical nep game i hope if only that game didnt look like some cheap mobile phone game i got copy of super neptunia rpg on nintendo switch im sad that i didnt got anything for preordering the switch version c big difference between the two is one is censored and the other one isnt lol a moment of silence please for the umio living behind a box on your shelf seriously though do a video explaining your distain towards poor fishman hes not that bad haha i hate how they never ship them in advance of the release date so we get them on time i too have ever collectors edition including rebirth 1 which came damaged i emailed them and got no response you email them and they send you multiple free copies and the japanese pp cause i didnt think itd come out here english one too i also opted for the switch version to protest the censorship ive heard bad things about this game id be interested in a diehard fans take so i hope you review it you should never throw away fat histy you should never throw away fat histy well i can finally say that i actually owned histy the fact that this comes with playing cards makes me nostalgic af i guess i should consider myself lucky that i have a rebirth 1 le because nisa trying to sell it on amazon made it sketchy as hell to get but now we have the iffy site and im glad for it mine just came in today my first neptunia le its a great one but whats the game like im still debating whether i should get the collectors edition or go for the standard version pricey for me but the collector urges is constantly calling out for it this was a good watch im looking forward to hearing what ysn has to say about super neptunia rpg after hes done with it had high hopes for this and was disapointed this places right after the idol game as far as nep spin offs go the battle system is possibly the worst possible thing ever i have seen in a rpg your outro music is fantastic is that an original score or is that from a game welp there goes my first paycheck for neps pudding would love a comparison video for this game it seems to run like trash on the switch but i didnt want to buy the le on ps4 and the game is good but not good enough to buy a second copy for pc the le itself is toptier though so no regrets super mario rpg maybe thats the reason for the title what a coincidence its the first game to be released on a nintendo console to this day that air plastic bag from the disgaea 4 le is still the best item to ever be included in a limited edition got both my ps4 and switch le today for some reason the package for the switch box was slightly damaged must have been the postal service pervs games cant preorder the game in australia but i bought the switch version so that code wont really benefit me i really want merchandise though all i have is the dvd and digital versions of megadimesionvr i used to have physical copies of them and cyber dimension but someone sold them nep too bad its being reviewed terribly even by neptunia fans hmmm maybe i should get supernep now i ordered the switch standard eddition from the if store imagine my suprise when i revived a box containing the super neptunia rpg limited edditionfor the ps4which i dont have a for effort iffy youre the best they always seem to have some kind of damage on the box for you huh lol do all of you guys have the same problem with giveaway link in gleam that im already subscribed and have him on twitter and it doesnt workcan someone please help me but is never ending true stories included on the soundtrack probably my favorite song from the nep franchise to date are the limited edition versions only for the website just curious as i got a standard edition due to lack of funds i didnt even know there would be a physical le release of this game but its nice to see what it comes with im gonna try and see if i can still get one the macros are beautifulrewatched the pro controll video and the lowprofile background just makes the video more simplisticthink bauhaus your videos are good so keep it going i got the nintendo switch limited version yours came better wrapped with bubble wrap where mine was loose the outside box isnt suppose to be worn yours was scuffed whereas mine actually came in clean condition because the box was so flimsy and not plastic wrapped i thought it was tampered with and opened but everything was in good condition but yeah the big box is so boring to look at and the inside box has one of the best designs out of all the limited editions i really appreciate the behemoth and cryptopsy reference 347 i dont know i find neptunia games to fit quite well with behemoth cryptopsy and what ever the hell else that i find myself putting on while playing i buy the le mainly for the plushies lol the neptunia series is so underrated once again another great unboxing 050 someone on the subreddit said they got the wrong version too might be a widespread issue edit yeah that outer box is awful what were they thinking my cats seem to be scared of the puddingo plush it works as a good scarecrow to keep them off my figure shelf the box is supposed to be histy but i dont think shes supposed to be this fat in the game ysn also hello i am an early access comment passing through im going to be drowned out when this actually gets uploaded to the public edit ysn imitating metal has rekindled my will to breathe edit 2 fat histy is not something i thought id hear today if you are interested in the english release of the game check out my review for that version of this game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzglj2l3xpw its a more detailed review memory loss might have just been a joke i like the vita version they should have made that one it looks like they gave the game to some trash ware dev to make sad i hope they put something out good soon nep deserves better i dont like the gameplay they should have made it classic turnbased battle system reminds me too much of rpg makers nah not buying xd in switch runs very slowwww question how long did you played it just estimate is fine i reserved a copy for me in june 25 ive pre ordered my copy for the switch im so excited for it also on pc do you know if this game has any ps4 pro specific enhancements what was that ps4 theme it looked really cool i want this game but the battle system sounds like a boring version of exist archive another game ruin by ps4 policy because of censorship i never played a neptunia game after i finished nep rebirth v its really getting stale with milking spinoffs well i guess the 4 goddesses online looks kinda interesting but im still butthurt with copy paste assets im not gonna buy thier games any more even the story is really boring and uninteresting well for my opinion at least i knew about thos review ever since it came out yet im just now watching it i cant wait to me it looks fun and i love the game series im starving for a new neptunia game ill buy it right away even if its 60 i just ordered this and gonna buy it again when its in english really didnt wanna wait lol what fun would a neptunia game be without amnesia waiting for the switch version refuse to buy a censored games would have been so much better if they used real animation instead of manipulating the characters limbs with animation software that is a technique used by people who dont know how draw animation and it looks cheap like an adobe flash animation its a way to produce something that resembles 2d hand drawn animation but its really a trick to accommodate laziness lack of ability or lack of budget 014 am i the only one wondering about the background well i dont a console its on buuuutttt reformed arfoire hype i love the nep games still waiting for a season 2 for the neptunia anime xc this looks like a shity mobile game from the design and game play i herd it has been censored way to much as well i love the hyper games but this is a hyper game ill pass on i will stick with playing 4 goddesses online for now until they make a better game im getting the switch version of this game neptunia superfan i dont know who youre talking about r3d so i guess neptunia is dying hopefully they had a difficulty selection but id prefer having it on normal difficulty than have it beginner friendly nice review of the new super neptunia rpg couldnt they have gone with neptune and the other cpus getting suckeddragged into a book as the plot point instead of amnesia i just know that neptune is going to reference that in some way yikes i was looking forward to this odin sphere or dragon crown is the best side scrolling gameee evaaaaa add muramasa on nintendo wii amnesia my be over used in neptunia games but not as much as mind control is i struggle to think of meany games in series were one or more charters arnt mind controlled even if just momentarily im just gonna wait until they release a mainline neptunia game the spinoffs just arent for me at all this would be a great mobile game this battle system is inspire by valkrye profile and exist archive o heard a lot of japanese fan though the gameplay was nowhere near as good as valkrie profile as long as the characters and story are entertaining the inferior combat system wont bother me and neptunia cast is always entertaining to be entirely honest while im glad that there are people who have managed to find enjoyment with this game i just couldnt for the life of me find much of any of that myself as much as i wanted to like this game i couldnt get past all the many many glaring issues i found with it while this is probably the best looking entry in the entire series even that aspect comes with a lot of buts the environments look amazingbut they werent implemented well depthoffield issues constant clipping issues enemies can get concealed by foreground elements etc like they were made first and then retrofitted into being explorable fields most notably in the first town where a fork in the road is treated as a separate platform that you have to jump to not to mention while this is subjective they lack any of the series staple usual aesthetic the character sprites are beautiful and emote pretty nicelybut as soon as they animate even a little more than an idle animation li bad game design my natural instinct ok circle as the jump button nonissue i played the original japanese version and always found it annoying that the english switches it to x ive been saying this since the japanese version of the game superneprpg supernepisbestnep agreed my main gripe with this game is that the menus are awkwardly slow and combat sometimes feels clunky af but asides from that once you get your team of 4 and start learning new spells and techniques its pretty fun imo and yes neps dialogue in this games is fantastic jank and weird design decisions machine gun references to video games and funny dialogue save it from being a at most mediocre game game has lots of different complicated systems and doesnt give you a good ui or tutorials to use it jump is circle so what youre telling me isits a hyperdimension neptunia game havent played since v but it sounds like a fun concept but they lacked polish which hasnt changed it seems still might pick it up if i see it cheap the animations are a bit choppy at times and the battle system is kinda what you see at first is the entire thing and doesnt changed much along with so navigation issues and lastly various bugs and lack of polish but has some funny dialogue moments and beautiful art i would give this a 610 yet another average idea factory game that has potential but never really grows beyond that potential 058 sean malstroms dream ive never played one of these before would you recommend the first one rebirth or this one to start this one obviously has some issues so im not 100 sure the battle system is atrocious and its the only thing that holds the game back imo how can it be the best nep game when best neps plutia and adult nep arent in it yeeeessss gimme that sweetness love the neptunia series oh another neptunia game on playstation 4 and going to be censored of fan service no thanks im stick with on switch version i came for the nep is this a sony phone game unfortunately i dont trust sony to not just censor the whole thing with big white rays they did it with just a bikini on another game super censored rpg oh my how lewd bart simpson laugh yet another game censored on playstation while not censored on nintendo switch or pc where do you start if you want to get into this why tho rpg ah another question about the game did you know how activate the skill disaster in leblanc its a rare technique i dont even see yet maybe a rare formation is required to activate or i dont know leblsnc is the official summoner in the game and your techniques are caotics xd great game and i confuse about where are the mysterious grass jajaja xd thanks for the help stop blamming the game guysthey where searching for a new stylethey think valkirye profile rip off will be good the break attacks is really lacklustre these are by far the worst special attacks in the whole franchise i am confuse as to what they are doing hitting or actually teleporting so much about sigh pretty lame considering its not even upto scratch with a playstation 1 valkyrie profile how lame can this game company get to make a shitty rip off in comparison to a game made in the 90s laughable really not just that embarassing for some reason i cant do break attacks theres not many skills 134 white heart roars like a berserker and a beast so white heart roars huh i dont this game becauseme are in him xd blancs attack is the strongest oki like it so no dlc characters for now eh i want to play already awesome i want to own this game but i dont have a switch i love jrpg genres no monsters were hurt in the making of this video the art is good not my type of gamestyle but still good more info httpswpmep7fusp1at super neptunia rpg is currently on sale until december 22nd 50 off omg that voice so annoying i prefer buy mario maker 2 instead i actually like how this game looks but ill wait for a sale why all the bad comments this game looks great if you fan neptune saga you will like this game this game has awesome combat system which i prefer hey nice game i m look after this game do you know i can find it man already preordered this so excited i want to hug that voices always love rie tanaka but this game looks terrible looks like a cheap mobile game wow that looks horrible thats a really bad running speed for an animation that slow so it doesnt feel natural and that combat my god ill have to pass and wait for an actual nep game can you show off the english voices really dont like japanese voices that much is she singing the final fantasy 7 theme song after winning a battle lol first second and third great review i just might give this a shot i dont really see the issue with enemies that reflect and absorb some attack elements its been a part of rpgs for a long time now but i liked this review quite a bit it didnt drag on and got to the point as a neptunia fan i must have every game and this ones no exception just preordered mine through amazon i love what you guys are doing your reviews are great keep it up nice review nothing too deep i like it is there japanese audio output ahh so thats what arffie looks like in her goddess form or is she have 12 ap is dying didnt use marriage garden and instead uses omni cure ok 1543 hypocrisy thy name be blanc im finally up to this video and it says that its only 5 seconds long on your channels videos tab i have only on thing to say on this matter youtube go home youre drunk chrome could be the magnavox odyssey video game unit it was the first gaming console ever created and played really old games like pong im almost near finishing this game thetwitgamer i hope you visit mine too my guess for a console would probably be the neo geo the timing lines up since it was ultimately done in by the introduction of 3d games it also has a coprocessor hence the existence of filyn because its designed to run arcade games most of its controllers feature some form of stick unfortunately the controllers dont really line up with the nesesque controller seen in the cutscene but the neo geo cd pad gets close 2803 lol so many voices at the same time xd epic 2355 kamikaze and then that faint xd lol 544 did they seriously just make that reference 945 i say nes with a soft s like the earthbound character 1337 game console with sticks in the 2d era how about phillips 1015 filyn is a cpu cenadit haha 224 talk about an achievement hunter for the last 8 fails all he wanted was that one chest xd 510 that was close twit you where almost turn into a nep sandwich hmmm chrome playing video games with filyn is a nice parallel to the picture where purple heart and the other goddesses playing video games together i just realized something filyn also has a goddess eye why did i not notice it earlier has marriage garden uses omnicure sounds about right lol chrome heart and will never play as her purple green black white iris yellow blue orange and now chrome so theres a goddess for each color 1540 oh the irony she even cursed in the same breath or maybe filyn is arfoire and chrome being the original goddess i think this game is a prequel to the series hence chrome not being arfoire this one was a really nice ep thank you very much d first of all i love the random anime girls in the intro its nice to see fran get love as for old systems with joysticks some had them added to like atari and i think the c64 did cpu chrome heart its a perfect title d if you go back inside histy back talking to chrome at were the chest was before the dore if you fall you will fing a room full of metal dogoos to fight its the best places to grind for levels maybe chrome is based on the colecovision you did mention she had what look like joysticks on her arms and thats a console that had those also they did release accessory that let you play atari 2600 games on it so yeah that was a thing another goddess wow forget bullet hell how about some difficult platforming with annoying music to drive you insane awwwnoire finally has a second friend hmm is filyn cfw magic hey language come on blanc you also said bad words whenever you transform and go berserk with an attitude in your human form 133 parkour training with twit part 1 349 a giant n 1346 i tried searching it on google and it just shows me google announcing a new console hrmmm also should i call chrome heart blue heart 1527 is it just me or histys books gotten redder 1910 hello chocola can we have 10 hours of twit failing to pass the platforming part so we agree chrome heart 302 it will not happen again that was a fing lie 2555 ooh another cpu its so very interesting curious i think i remember you talking about fran at some point but at that point i hadnt watched any of the fate series and now that i have i love fran shes just so adorable in histoire you missed a secret in the final room in histoire where the chest is behind you if you fall down the hole youll end up in a secret room filled with metal dogoos a new sexy goddess has entered the ring spoilers for endgame captain americas ass blancs bum oh my god in the opening sequence you put fran from fate i love fran shes my favorite servant from the fate series through the psychedelic music and discordant colours our hero races forward to find out what arfoire looks like without a hat is that a mega man reference 921 i never expected to see enterprise and kotori playing video game together i mean she is basically a spitting image of human arfoire from rebirth 1 sorry its a little late but welcome to super neptunia rpg i plan on uploading this series daily until its finished so i hope you all enjoy not the eggplants 1500 that garou reference its been so long since i have been to your channel i am so sorry for not being here for awhile just got cucked by youtube i have the limited edition of the game nintendo switch version damn i didnt know this game came out yet gets switch kancolle reference abyssal sink in to the ocean of darkness why did it took you so long to figure out that you can dash in the air hopefully this game doesnt have any puzzles or you are going to have a hard time similarly to twits playthrough im also looking forward to and also slightly worried about your opinions on this game with this playtrough 0031 the first neptunia game not being made by idea factory was producing perfection the first nep side game that was developed primarily by tamsoft who also made neptunia u blanc vs zombies and cyberdimension 4go same with felistella who did the rebirth games yep and superdimension the nep x seha girls crossoverifs game and sting who did hyperdevotion noire and then we get here now with artisan studios with superneprpg pretty much every side game and every remakeremaster outside of viir was made by different developers and idea factorycompile heart always have a involvement in each nep game of course its their ip after all mainly in character casting story writing artworks and music with supernep is no different now superneprpg is indeed the first nep game made by a western stud qotd the 2d looks pretty good but it ultimately doesnt matter to me a whole lot i can play any game as long as the story and gameplay is interesting enough the art style is just the icing on the cake how do you like the game so far senpai when i first saw purple hearts shadow and it was repeating the same lines over and over again i thought that ethel form fairy fencer has taken the from of purple hearts shadow a game about a game console blade got money but still doesnt care about orphanage lol the shadow at the start is neptuness stand when she attacks she just say shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku shinku ah good to be back oh my it was a long time since ive been on your channel last time and i have no idea how the hell it happened because i like your content stupid yt algorithms im sorry i promise it will never happen again 308 nothing personal kid but i dont like you tseries weird i expected this game to be censored by soyny i love this games ost to me is one of the best ost in neptunia along with megadimension imo qotd i think its a nice change in the neptunia series and i can see that theyre trying enemy knight appears i dont know if im ready for you one shots him damn xd this background artstyle remiinds me of child of light so much it also clashes a little bit with the sprites imho gamindustri really please surprise me next time this game is not cutting it qotd i liked the neptunia series tries to do something different but the execution is not impressing me i would go with 3d i kinda want a crossover between persona 5 and neptunia fun fact bombyx mori is the binomial nomenclature for the domestic sinkworm oops i mean silkworm qotd the 2d layout looks good i would like to see more of it in future neptunia games how come they changed the graphics and gameplay alright lets see how the first westerndeveloped neptunia game does i remain skeptical ever since i posted my comment detailing my concerns about management but hopefully it doesnt translate into the game 1 146 a shadow version of neptune persona jokes aside im immediately intrigued and already crafting theories 2 622 defcon level m4 that line alone is setting off tons of red flags they wouldnt seriously try to go down that route again with a different va at that would they 3 629 okay i can definitely appreciate the art style theyre going for with the backgrounds looks very well made and nicely detailed 4 713 im kind of offput by that walking animation not quite matching with how fast he was moving it looks like he was sliding a bit hopefully thats not too common in this game i cant unsee it once i start noticing it and its kind of annoying 5 1339 i bet its the same directional layout as usual planeptune in this game is amazing of course its made in canada says a canadian senpai blade get drain edge attack from the wooden sword in the shop it is very useful for beginning enemies it heals you even when you miss hello im a neptunia fan and i just found your channel i think your commentary is great very entertaining also sorry if my english isnt very good the game seems to have fixed the bugs i havent gotten any so far dont forget to dash because everyone forgets cant remember anything but her name pokemon mystery dungeon anyone snrqotd suggestion how long have you been with the neptunia series so watching both super nep and xenoblade 2 on your and twits channel so much to do im mega hyped for redeemed arfoire but im going to be seriously upset if the candidates arent in this game also which dimension ares this set of cpus originally from 1352 i think theyre in the same position as the first hyperdimension snr qotd suggestion what do you think of the battle system in this game is it good or should it have been more like classic neptunia games qotd i like the 2d since its already a sort of thing with this game so it looks normal if that makes sense i also like the chibi design in the one cg 3736 that sword is the reason i aint playing this on the ps4 qotd answer the things that i hate about 2d is sometimes they are too lazy to make 2 different models when character faced right or left at very beginning i saw purple heart holding sword with right hand when facing left direction but holding sword with left hand when facing right direction and if the enemy on left position when battle happened i guess ill see so various left handed enemy in the future so far it i dont have a problem with the game being 2dcant wait to get it myself sadly i need to wait till next week to buy it 1 1800 aight lets be real i dont know if i can think of a single story where rebels or a resistance arent actually the good guys at least compared to what theyre fighting against just the fact that there is a resistance in the first place makes me instantly suspicious of these bombyx mori guys 2 1858 in the japanese version they say heil in german and everything no comment 3 2021 by 1 and 2 the game means in the screenshots above two object are marked with 1 and 2 in this case the exclamation mark and the star above the npcs head in screenshot 1 4 2222 by breaking the fourth wall and reading the name above his head obviously xd 5 cypress stick well these guys are so weak you could beat them with a cypress stick neptune episode 1 of the anime 2015 items obtained you obtained a weapon cypress stick nier automata 2017 6 2 1756 the resistance how sonic forces the silver haired girl up there is arfoire at the end of rebirth 1 is it weird that i was eating ice cream during this so the bombyx mori captain found neptune who somehow happens to have amnesia i wonder what that first dream was about though also sink 2529 you cant get up there until a certain point in the game 2644 i wonder if its even possibleit would probably be interesting to have a dogoo in the party 3008 some areas do have areas where you can fall off in which case if you do fall off you probably lose a bit of hp 4206 well thats just plain silly qotd this game being in 2d is an interesting spin to the usual neptunia game given this games story id think it makes sense snr qotd suggestion what did you think about neptune waking up in lastation as the start of the story to super neptunia rpg snr qotd suggestion 2 what did you think of neptunes first dream before she woke up hehe cant wait to see him forgetting to equip weapons again yes ive been waiting for you to play this game glad this is gonna be a daily series qotd its different from what were used to personally i welcome this change into the 2d style it gives us a different way of playing the game compared to previous titles 4202 moment will remain in infamy i heard this game is very easy to the point someone beaten it with the first weapons oh i missed this good game i wish i can get that game for my switch or at steam store with nisas current series disgaea you might like it blade its a tactical rpg series like fire emblem you can use the mascot creatures the prinnes i really enjoy the look of this game its a refreshing style in my opinion definitely getting this on switch its nep time motherfckers ssj3 goku yelling where did you get this 142 cg i have played this game twice and still dont get that cg is it only from big album book cg or have different trigger to get that cg is there a way to rewatch the cg gallery in game i made an edit video using gameplay clips from forgotton anne with this song and it fits well where did you find these pics because i cant find them unless i replay the entire game what is the name of the song looks like the switch version of super neptunia rpg will not be censored im not buying super neptunia rpg because rom and ram arent playable ill get the ps4 version for trophies nintendo ok add everything that anyone wants to see sony no stop showing everything the wet dream for sjws having full control of censorship in japanese games fortunately we still can play uncensored games on pc and nintendo the game is fun period i just reserved my ps4 copy today you ppl are a bunch of pedos getting neptunia on pc fuck this censorship bullshit u forgot octopath traveler on the mobile phones i buy a lot less on ps4 now because of sonys censorship not sure how much i care to get a ps5 anymore god eater 3 on switch is definitely tempting but its very close to fire emblems release so im not sure about that right now most important thing of this video squares lack of loylty search for greater profits do you guys think final fantasy 16 will be a playstation exclusive ot will things change octopath traveler is a good game but entry level at best i loved it but didnt feel challenged at all thank god i bought a switch sony needs to go fuck off f the ps4 and ther censoring mid pc is just as good and doesent f whit the cg neptunias first game on tbe switch will be this one so will pick it up on there along with god eater 3 after i get my makoto niijima statue and my complete se collection that i promised myself this year 3 censored no buy ever egs might come into play if i had a switch i would double dip on ge3 but i dont have one get neptunia on switch or pc everyone sony is getting full of themselves again octopath traveler is the only game on the switch that interested me im so glad its coming to steam i think people at sony turned into gays their diks arent working anymore so im going to buy a switch soon because sony is seriously forcing me to do that this censorship is pure madness anyone can recommend any good jrpg for switch expect obviously xenoblade 2 planning to get atelier lulua for switch too ot finally on steam yes we need to kick the sjw cucks in charge of sony most of small game projects from se in recent years actually always release on pc so it kinda make sense in assuming octopath traveler will also be release on pc since sony moved hq to the sjw capital it became prudish af im getting super neptunia on switch 245 way to be an anti consumer pos namco fuck you the shit about neptunia is fucking old im going to get the new neptunia game octopath traveler and god eater 3 on nintendo switch i love the switch and its great that these games are on it well another nep game for the pc then no problem yup fuck the switch long live steampc yes octopath for pc now i dont have to pirate it oh nice i didnt know about that tales of vesperia content for god eater thanks for talking about the neptunia rpg censorship my principle is not to buy censored games so i cant buy neptunia rpg since i dont have a switch i encourage everyone who dislikes censorship to do the same if you buy the ps4 version you forfeit your right to complain about censorship i thought youd be showing a comparison between modified and og cg c getting the the first 2 for steam i also want to get atelier lulua but since koei tecmo is doing a 80 dlc again with taking and reselling content i will wait untill the game starts to cost around 20 i waited 10 years for kingdom hearts 3 so waiting for lulua should not be a problem super neptunia rpg is uncensored on the switch well i dont even have a console so the new neptunia game getting censored on the ps4 isnt anything i need to complain about im actually slightly more concerned about companies abandoning their existing art styles to comply with sony which basically turns it into invisible censorship you dont see any differences between ps4 and other versions and no black bars in the picture simply because they left out all the problematic images in the first place ps4 will be completely free of censorship again generally i prefer a console version of the game because i can get a hard copy instead of just a license to rent but in super neptunia case it really depends on what slightly modified means if that is their official statement then it might be just honeyed words i hope the port for pc doesnt suck i will 100 be getting god eater 3 on switch ive read that it does not rely on prior entries either when it comes to the narrative for those worried about whether theyll get ported to switch or not having the waifu claire on the go would be ideal as fuck i might go for the switch version for neptunia i know a lot of folks arent concerned but i kinda gotta agree with golden eagle once their done with the japanese games theyll start doing it for other titles as you saw with trishs butt haha heard the guy who does senran kagura is going to work on something else cause of this thank you for introducing me to disgaea im going to try to buy both disgaea 1 and 2 for the steam summer sale and probably octopath as well depending on how much it is and also buy super nep rpg looking forward to super neptunia rpg tbh i could care less about the censorship ill pick up the version that runs better super neptunia rpg do you know the switch version going to be censored i hope not ill just by super neptunia on pc same with octopath traveller since i remember that there will be a switch release for neptunia rpg and nintendo is no longer censoring games on their platform i will wait for that version getting super neptunia rpg on switch whenever it gets released only got megadimension neptunia vii and viir on ps4 since my pc is practically a potato more people get enjoy thisget a fucking console you fucking cave men im tired of hearing about censorship in games sony why are you doing this what bad in little erotic in the game im dissapoint in this politic i will buy neppy on pc i did buy octopatch for nintendo switch but i glad what this game will be on pc i hate it when the censorstation 4 strikes ill support super neptunia on pc thanks kenichiro yoshida needs to do some research when mortal kombat was released on home consoles in 1993 the snes version was technically better than the genesis version however sega was more lenient in terms of graphic violence and included the famous blood mode code can you take a guess which version sold more copies i will get octopath traveler on pc i beat the heck out of octopath traveler on nintendo switch great game but story couldve been better i hope the second one is going to improve the flaws of octopath traveler yakuza 0 on pc first i dont have a pc so ill be getting super neptunia rpg on ps4 my answer nep i need more nep in mah life x and 8 path traveler as well d thanks for the news ill get god eater and neptunia on switch god eater might not be that on the go if you need wifi oo octopath is probably my favourite game on the switch the soundtrack is unlikely to fall to second place in my top ost anytime soon ill definitely be picking up octopatch and neppy on pc sony can f off sonys censorship is completely pointless now all i need is smt v ps4 and p5 switch i like that scroll bar i hear super dimension neptunia is comming to the switch i will get it there if it is no longer comming to switch i will get it on pc then octopath traveler will you come to ps4 wow i just got the notification for your vid like an hour later but great vid and damn you low key psychic or something cuz i would have guessed ps4 for a second release of octopath not steam cuz ps4 is like the home of jrpg just realized i was subbed from previous videos but several things annoyed me from this video bragging about calling octopaths release for a quarter of the vids length is a waste of time and youre not proving anything media outlets reported octo would be multiplat super neptunia is also coming to switch uncensored its only ps4 thats censored while pcswitch are uncensored you made no mention of the switch version octopath traveler cough epic store exclusive for 1 year cough i might get a switch this summer if i have enough leftover cash after building a pc so ill probably get octopath on there oh no two cg that in no way affect story and gameplay are being changed and that i can also look up any other time on youtube easily how can i move on with my life god eater 3 on switch octopath traveler on pc both sounds good to me its always a good thing for a game to come to other platforms i havent played octopath but i was thinking of geting it the pc release doesnt mather to me i will get it on the switch still god eater 3 was a game i ws interested in but after reviws i kinda left behind but maybe on the switch i migth give it a try octopath pc version ill get that for sure what about the switch version of hyperdimension neptunia will that be censored i have had it preordered for the switch since day one because i figured sony would ruin the day again octopath on the pc who saw that coming actually the tales of outfits will be coming to pcps4 in a much later update apparently from the jp presser maybe reading it wrong tho been a while since the last podcast almost 2 months guess you all are busy that and the lack of any major news or releases but with e3 and gamescom taking place soon hopefully the drought will be over but have you got an idea of when the next ones going to take place well i own god eater resurrection and 2 on vita and ye its perfect on the go so i might pick up the switch version of 3 didnt get it yet so why not also ye i aint buying the ps4 version of neptunia i aint supporting those practices and that blows cause im usually a playstation guy but i just wont support bs like that stupid censorship buy it on another platform curse you sony why must you hate the female body sonys censorship thing is really annoying me im not gonna get the pc version of superdimension neptunia because id rather have all the content in a physical uncensored version so the only solution would be to skip it entirely i dont have a switch so octopath travelers off the table and ive never played god eater so i cant play 3 thankfully epic hates anime so we wont have jrpgs be epic games store exclusives thank god if i dont get a switch by then ill get it on steam if i can sony being sony what else is new and god eater 3 being on switch gives me hope that code vein will see a release on the platform as well well i will buy the pc version then for the new nep game the game is really good actually it isnt such a fast experience for the gameplay as the main games but yeah i think only people who like old rpgs will probably like it i love it the combat actually is good it kinda reminds me of valkyrie profileff but the art syle is similar to odin sphere only much better looking since it isnt ps2 quality did they change neptunes voice actor how did you get it early so when are you going to upload dragon star varnir chapters 711 pleases and the all cutscenes no intro music hi i like your gameblay so much ond u r very good why did you pick english voices is it out on pc and im sorry you probably thinking why cant you google that yourself your lazy bastard as much as i am as a fan for the neptunia series the combat in this game is lackluster will it get better later in the game most neptunia games i love the characters the artworks and possibly the music but the combat system is what pulls me back in to play any gamesighhh what is your opinion 2 comments in the video well 3 with this one and it says theres only 1 comment how that make sense xd wait its out already i thought it was due on the 23 at least we still have dragon star varnir currently on sale on nintendo switch and ps4 the music in the vid overpowers your voice a bit much imo thanks for the review tho great video glad to see my dude adg still in the game doing reviews you are developing quite a name for yourself with these reviews good job interesting i might just wait for this to go on sale even though im a big fan of the series but i still have viir to finish so i might be good put my money on dragon star varnir as everyone is talking about it plus i like your vids on it and review when are you going to review fate extella link idea factory rushed this in my opinion maybe snrpg 2 will be good great review as always adg now can you play more attack on titan 2 on adgvsgame you should probably play the other neptunia games and review them too this is a great review for super neptunia rpg but not buying lol im glad im not the only one that felt the delay was too long sometimes got sick and im behind but i hope you enjoy this review and the reviews to come this week isitworthit adgnews adgreviews superneptuniarpg ideafactory iffyteam ps4share looks awful no buy on this one welcome back in the 2000s call me back when youre back in 2019 looks like something i shall acquire once it arrives on the usual discount websites p this looks just like maple story and i honestly hated the gameplay mechanic of jumping platform to get to where i need to go i was really executed for this title but i sadly will be cancelling my preorder i would have wanted a more open world like feeling rather than jumping battles are from right to left hope its possible to change it to left to right yas nep is coming to switch yay their attacks look sodump the animations for characters looks terrible like the lowest quality animation you can make for a video game the artwork also looks bare minimum nepnep for smash and noire turning into her hdd form as a assist trophy i cant be the only person who want that to happen to me the 3d models are still better in the last neptunia games i really liked valkyrie profile lenneth on the ps1 super neptunia rpg seems pretty good to me i like this aspect that looks like vp lenneth of the ps1 you should be doing more games like this even in 3d it could be not bad your game could make a lot of people happy really already me i look forward so much very obvious valkyrie profile influences here i hope the combat isnt as boring as i just watched no release yet hmmm yeahh really like a totally rpg not badnot bad ill take this but i really want a main nep game for the switch i didnt know the switch had square triangle and circle ugh what a disappointment the game is a couple of months away from launch and it looks like a quick cash grab mobile game i remember looking forward to this game but not anymore unfortunately the combat reminds me of brave exvius which isnt a bad thing looks great cant wait for nep nep on the switch the animations look a lot smoother well at least for the battling hopefully the platforming animations get smoothed out too i love how all the comments are about how no one is buying the ps4 version because its censored xd hopefully sony learns its lesson with this yes im getting on steam thanks im just assuming they gonna censor this as well wow this game looks amazing ill buy it on switch is that a havian voiceover i hear okay i have a question what exactly is all censored ive been contemplating getting this but i dont want to support censorship nintendo switch it has my money already preordered on the switch lol no problems with the game no problems the video either i think its a great way to introduce the game thats coming soon but i have a problem with the censorship policy so im buying the game but im not getting it for the playcensoredstation 4 system leanbox xbox lastation playstation loweewii planeptune unrelease sega neptune console ps remove censorship thats why there is a rating system planetune pc last station playstation lean box xbox lowee nintendo awesome buying it on the switch to avoid ps4 censorship sony has the audacity to attempt to sell the ps4 version of this game no thank you the day you guys start censoring triple a titles and not just anime style video games ill respect you guys again and consider it but still you guys should not have introduced the new content policy to begin with also lets dislike the video so sony hears us remove the censorship why does it sound like tamago2474 is reading this i cant wait to double dip on the switch and pc versions and not ever buy the ps4 version blanc is best guess imma get the switch one no thanks sony i do not support your censorship i will be buying this game on steam i cant wait to see the stadia cpu which has no essence or physical form whatsoever like a ghost top 10 retarded series deluxe censorship edition uncensored switch gang ooh careful about blanc sheswell gets so much angry i greatly appreciate you for advertising the neptunia series but you need to stop censoring our games censored no thanks ill pick it up on switch and another copy on steam when it inevitably comes to pc is that the same voice actor for nepnep she sounds a bit diff new neptunia game on ps4 nah ill pass steam when u releasing uncut version sadly i dont have a nintendo so i have to buy the ps4 version and plutia no iris heart no buy kek everyone is so triggerd bout de censorship kek everyone is so triggerd bout de censorship this is why you dont give americans control over japanese games never buying ps game until the censorship policy goes away yeah ill be getting the uncensored version on switch thanks for making one of the reasons i bought sony consoles obsolete which 4 cpus are the best neptune noire blanc vert reply me in order to vote the best cpu in the game mine is vert ps explain to me why is the best cpu in the game pc will always win is it on pc please release a patch to get rid of the censorship i want to believe i can buy and support a playstation title without having to worry or question if its censored or not love all the choujigen game neptune series love the game gonna get me the uncensored version thank you very much ps4 version is censored i will be getting this game on the pc thanks for the reminder the game game is great its too bad sony became the company with the worst censorship i wont be buying this on censorshipstation 4 i will look out for a switch version is it just me eh could just be but doesnt the narrating voice sound like havian people who support censorship will eventually join the battle against censorship once the things they love get affected just watch fyi most of the nep games are on vita and most are uncensored pick a vita up for cheap and play a portable version on a console with 2x the battery life of a switch glances at comment section see noire this is why you have no friends ive got the ps version on preorder but im also gonna get the pc version to do a comparison video thats the only reason i got the ps version im ready to see how much this game will sell on switch steam and ps4 in individual i can see people getting angry at sony for their censorship policy at least ive decided to get it for switch rip satoru iwata video games are meant to be just one thing fun fun for everyone i swear if rom and ram are not playable then i am not gonna buy this game please rom and ram need more popularity because theyre best girls in this series imma still buy it on the ps4 neptunia is still better game franchise than call of duty grandtheft auto and fortnite i dont but censored games i will be switching to the switch getting the steam version tyvm getting the pc version then quite a loss to censor something that isnt necessary when this coming to pc again thats still uncensored right why would i buy the game on your console if its going to be censored i rather get it on the switch on switch what is this switch people talk about and how can i get it please i oppose censorship because i believe people can decide on their own what they want to see and what they dont want to see please listen to the community so im guessing this is the straight up combination of megaman x 2d walkthrough and final fantasy rpg meh if i had played megaman x then im used to this already stop censoring my games before i start buying all of em on steam sorry im not going to buy on playstation 4 version im stick with the switch version or maybe steam if the game are cheap nobody sony think about the children it sounds like havian from the youtube channel buying this on switch seems like a game i would play portable on my bed getting this on the switch cant wait i am looking forward to this game on the switch of course where it isnt censored i am torn between getting this on ps4 or switch on ps4 i can get trophies that encourages 100 completion but its censored on switch the games value will hold longer and it is not censored help the problem is they over censor the neptunia game already censor thier self out just leave it that way but sony made it way worse by just making it distracking censor like a extreme close up or almost cover the whole person censored on ps4 not censored on switch nintendo sold out this trailer actually made me more hype to get a new main neptunia game than the one advertised here then again the last bit of the trailer made it sound like the super neptunia rpg plot is self aware of this lol wait was that reformed arfoire at the end guys this cant be that censored because vert still exhists im confused what are they censoring seems fine to me lol all the comments are about the censorship why is this video losing dislikes dont try to cheat the people censony switch better 105 hey remember the time adult neptune a human held of two cpus with little problem i bought the switch version because of your censorship sony sorry getting this game at steambecause i didnt want any censorshipp sony i really dont like your new censorship policy for one it doesnt make sense in a business standpoint and two it just makes more people mad we have ratings for a reason and youre going a massive niche market to nintendo of all people sony censors cgs nintendoi see this is an absloute win the audacity to upload this while also demanding it be censored shame they didnt mention the cpu candidates is that havian im hearing looking forward to the pc release sorry sony but time to make the switch to switch please end me it has been an honor sony ps4 nintendo switch ill be in your care my main man chris chan aint gonna be happy with the weird pedo stuff being taken out of the game powerful censored share energy children friendly in anime titles think of the children they play fortnite lol lets make an ad for the franchise we censored and see how they like it sony if you dont stop xbox nintendo will win next gen ew censorship it smells crying like an anime fan on prom night flashbacks i will not buy a game on sony until they remove their censorship so hello steam may you enjoy my money i was going to make a comment about the censorship but it seems everyone beat me to it wait why is havian here so unexpected now its platformer when neptunia racing or maybe neptunia horror i cant wait for the game but im actually getting it on switch because of your idiotic censorship as i also did with nekopara and as ill do with many other games from now on revel house also not a fan of censorship so if i get this game i might get it on the switch if i get one editsorry how do you guys know its censored proof or link sorry no i just like pso2style games without censorship sorry dude but i hate censorship where is the so called censorship or annoy lens flares again lol where is the so called censorship etc againlol fan service the dog the game where does it say its censored sorry sony i am not not a child i am an adult so i will buy this game in the switch so the childlike is the patron for nintendo fans makes sense the censorship sony has adopted is awful games like this one will be censored ill just buy it elsewhere never expected to hear a british narration of a japanes game trailer its usually nothing or using voice lines form the game characters or original narration by one of the games character i clicked on the video then some seconds in i thought i was watching a havian video but i was still on playstation channel please sony we want astral chain and bayonetta i dont want to buy a switch what kind of accent does this speaker has he sounds like a black guy from africa lol heh so it seems people will be switching over to nintendo i wonder how much this game got censored by the feminist at sony sony listen to your fans it pains me greatly to not be able to support the console i deeply love because of censorship policies but like 99 of the people here i will be buying this on the switch i love how the narrator cant directly talk about verts chest its once upon a neptunia rpg how to disfigure a series with fan service censorship of the game industry the videogame is it only who doesnt like the english dub version it is so cringey i feel this voice is from the youtuber havian also is sad this game is censored on ps havian is that you remove the censorship the games have a rating for a reason im buying it on switch sure censorship is questionable for a teen plus game but isnt everyone overreacting about 2 cgs that arent that heavily edited all things aside this was well made thanks unnamed editor and narrator aha enjoy your censored game because the ps4 version is censored the switch is laughing at you sony and so will we while playing the switch switch version here i come is that you havian at least the older neptunia games arent censored on ps4ps vita i love your sony games give me a ps4 please censorship me and many friends change from pc because of that sony censorship i love neptunia but this was a terrible title doesnt help that sony censorship has its hands all over neps paper jiggle physics on point getting the switch version desu just out of curiosity will switch uncensored version also rated teen censored version ill buy it elsewhere just a question for comments where exactly is this version censored ill get this on switch anyway but clarity would be nice 251 say thanks later nah bruh the only worth this saga has is the avatars make it uncensored sorry sony but i would rather buy this on the pc or switch where its not censored by your stupid bs policies thanks though so its 4 cpu who are protecting a network i never played her games are they fun how many are there is it popular wow this sounds terrible this is what people are mad at sony about japan accepts sexual themes and hates gore america loves gorebut hates sexual themes thats just how it is people lol stop censoring games playstation hey at least havian is voicing the trailer but im not buying a degraded censored product on this system ill do it on pc game is censored on ps4 people avoid like the plague playstation i would like to formally ablar with you since we have been waiting a long time ago for a title that they promised us and they did not give us that it would be dust 514 the problem is that they removed it from the ps3 platform they know they promised us a game similar to dust for pc but it is a lie we have been waiting for years to come to give us this great title and never gave us and i hope cordially that we debuted this great title as many gamers are waiting to bring it a long time ago and never gave them thanks formally their user valentin garello buy the switch version thank me later censored call of duty modern warfare ripoff hmm not getting as much sales as you have expected sony wonder what went wronghmm i didnt really care about the other games because a friend of mine owns them all and has told me the full stories but im a big fan of 2d side scrolling games i guess now i have a reason to play a neptunia game i own all neptunia games in physical edition for sony consoles this one i am buying for the switch i hope all japanese ips leave your platform you clearly dont deserve them sorry sony but im not getting this on ps4 abolish your ridiculous censorship we have a rating system for a reason sony if only u didnt censored this game i will definitely buy it in the ps4 but i wont cause your stupid policy sony just keep in mind censorship will cost you money getting this on my switch ill buy the uncensored switch version but thanks for trying is sad having the other games on play station platforms but i will not support those who censor i love hearing melissa fahn erin fitzgerald wendee lee and tara platt as neptune noire blanc and vert and yes i also love the current voices of noire and vert which is erica mendez and carrie keranen the ones you hear in the video 0055 rated t for teen im never buying a censored product sony get it through your thick skulls i mean im still going to buy this for the ps4 but i wish theyd get rid of this ridiculous censorship none of your customers including me want you to censor games the higher ups are really trying to turn away their players towards the nintendo switch which doesnt censor their games sony please read this and listen to your playerbase we dont want our games censored and are prepared to buy our games elsewhere if need be still want erin fitzgerald back as noire can we plz get a petition why you censoring games sony what a plot will this game be at this years e3 ohnever mind ill be getting this game on switch since this game is censored on ps4 is that havian narrating i want to buy it but i wont if its censored please sony be more like steam they give gamers the chance to showhide adult content based on individual preference at the end of the day you want more gamers to play on ps and more devs to support the brand and to make more money by being successful right by censoring everything and taking that choice away youre going to lose out on gamersdevs and money dont do that give gamers the ability to play however they wish as all of these products are already classified by rating boards so theres really no need for further regulation just let gamers and devs playcreate within the already established framework and the ps brand will continue to increase in popularitysuccess everybody wins that way so please no more censorship wonder if the narrator got this in one take mhm yup niiice personalities from all trash were switching to the switch because this game is stupidly censored and the game no french version cant wait to get this on the switch we will have something to see or do in this ps4 edition or it will have censorship

to mario and im in oh look another japanese game sony is going to censor havian is that you this game is censored the last of us 2 v is there a way to show the enemy health bars all the time or do i have to constantly check it me huh i think im gonna buy this game where in the universe does it take place clicks on video sink also voice actor of uni congratulations that actually kinda hit hard ngl i found kuzama and no life was also an anime reference neptunia seems to be the most popular franchise on your channel you were supposed to let that sink in neptunia series really improved like fine wine with the years i hope the devs start switching or varying a bit the gameplay styles of their series mainly the ones i know of like neptunia fff if it gets a sequel etc i dont dislike the classic style of the games but it felt a bit too old school idk how to explain it i dont think saving up is correct you take more damage that way unis va is your girlfriend i swear to god this girls memories just fall out of her head constantly she is like a ps1 game without a memory card so is this the latest neptunia game as always i only play games on easy mode that is if this game even has difficulty settings to switch to easy in the first place can we just take a moment that twit just fell in love with the chibi versions on 1739 i sink she sinks shes smart what is this darknep trying to be an abyssal from kantai collection shes obsessed with sinking ships and hdn neptune isnt even a shipgirl in kantai collection shes a ship girl in azur lane there are no abyssals in azur lane go home youre so drunk you ended up in the wrong universe how long do you think this game is i need as much nep nep on my switch as i can get i love the dragon quest reference they made with the cytress stick is the switch version censored too the shadow is ethel in disguise hahaha finally got to this series i like it you lucky twit i want it this episode shouldve been called sink hows handheld mode im still waiting for my limited edition and i play my switch exclusively as a handheld only a few minutes in and i already feel like we have more varied backgrounds then the entirety of the main franchise kurome that figure at the start im guessing is her from her signature sink into delusional god that sink part was annoying 2155 looks at right hand lower corner ill predend i didnt see that finally ive been so excited for a new game and i thought theres never going to be a new one but here we go and my favorite youtuber i was very curious about how the switch version of this game performs i guess your lets play will help me to find out now what is going on with the intro movie though it is quite weirldly saturated or contrasted my first guess was that they wanted to save storage space for the switch version so they cosiderably downgraded the video quality or something 0553 i love how they implemented nintendos established redyellowbluegreen color scheme for the abxy action buttons from the super famicom and the european snes also featured on the new 3ds systems and some models of 2ds to represent the command icons for the switch version matching it with the ps4 version that uses the greenredbluepink color scheme to represent the action buttons since the switchs action buttons dont even have a multicolored color scheme although there actually are some joycon mods that give the buttons this exact classic color scheme whats even more awesome is that all i heard during sink was and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and so on p its like mobile game wtf happend well my friend just informed me that a certain singer that we met at toracon also sang the opening to this game and to that i say omg yes ah nep here we go again contrast really high here will this game get a physical release for north america 528 when you play ac and desynchronized 1810 aw they localize loli into the kid yayyyyyy neptunia is back yay more nep is super neptunia rpg another spinoff a new sequel or a new remake based upon in neptunias first game her voice sounds so different a little bit higher than usual meh were back bitches ive waited my whole life for this aww i was thinking the dogoo would have been recruitable i wonder if you really can recruit it anyway this game looks quite interesting honestly cant wait for what comes next perhaps the npc at the end was the last one you needed for the search quest you were doing ps sink imma watch this video preorder the game then wait until the game comes out then ill watch you play as i play boom i just hope the pc controls are good been awhile since i have seen a neptunia gameplay im liking the new style for this game feels unique and awesome wow cross edge the neptunia awesome xd i didnt know your girlfriend

i am so jealous of your early access to nep all hail i have to wait until the 25th like the rest of us mere mortals eh what is going on with the playstation version and i got the whole bundle of neptunia games so ill be getting to this game on my own as i play through the whole game ill probably let this one run on the background while i do other things to provide support but ill rematch it when i get to this actual game while the game itself looks nice the gameplay seems strangely unsmooth and jerky hope thats not a problem through out the game 1645 shopkeeper please come back anytime d twit i wont d is this game come to pc the skillability learning is similar to tales of vesperia as well the voice of uni sarah anne williams is your girlfriend whaaat ah its good to see some new nepnep again i think idea factory spending 6 month to translate the game into english dubbed pls dont make persona reference or not igor will make a velvet room for you well it would be a giant cup of tea if im being honest gasp youre finally continuing this yaaay yay new neptunia but not fair you got it early i want to play let the 2d madness begins i cant wait for this game it looks great neptunia rebirth 1 was first series i ever watched from you so its cool to see one of these games again also i actually had no idea there was a nep game for the switch blanc represent yes more neptunia i completely forgot why i love youre videos they are both funny and i love youre accent not first yeah i think im gonna watch first before i even play cuz i aint giving the sony version a try wait chrome arfoire the nations are islands is that a continuation of rebirth 1 edit its medium histoire from rebirth 1 its a continuation wait a second so doesnt this mean all the cpu are technically two different people of the same person sharing a single body why does this feel like uzume and kurome from megadimension again time for some good ol nep on nep action 0c0 2503 really did you actually ask that i mean it is in the name lastation what other console has the word station in it best quote to ever exist in the entire neptunia franchise sink 1436 my thoughts exactly also welcome belated back make sure theres no dust kay it took me a while but nice btw ofc nep go dialog she is the is this shadow another one of those uzume blacks in mega wheres that chain unlock when i am thou started 1727 does that mean it is possible to skip this part of the story kind of like that point where you were meant to make a deal with that guy in order to rescue noire and instead went to the amusement park its lastation 4 pro xd whats the matter are you simply going to watch are you forsaking him to save yourself death awaits him if you do nothing was your previous decision a mistake then very welli have heeded your resolve vow to me i am thou thou art ithou who art willing to perform all sacrilegious acts for thine own justice call upon my name and release thy rage show the strength of thy will to ascertain all on thine own though thou be chained to hell itself i am the pillager of twilight arsene i see what you did there a reference to persona series right twitgamer playstation ah stephanie sheh is histy again now i face out i hold out i reach out to the truth of my life 1437 i think both spoiler from other game i wonder how this game will tell the story of arsnore if chrome is actually arsnore in this game im looking forward to it yep its indeed mini histy d oh and while you were away i already went around to finishing this game wonderful wanted to all powered up to the next level great job played sir 2452 i want that console twit when you said is that a jojo reference you shouldve put the jojo menecing around that boy verts animation is too much content you know why sorry this info is for 18 and above this game my god now even a persona reference particulary p5 is here it was about time they actually did that because that was a wasted chance in megadimension neptunia vii with uzume and kurome boi thats persona 5 that only thing that is missing is a talking cartoonish cat that can become a car damn it i guess im doing this now plays that one song from persona 4 for a boss fight and funny considering that neptune herself was not in a persona game but she was in devil survivor and in that world she had big boobs then again blanc was also in devil survivor 2 and she also had big tits nep am thou thou art ne wait 2806 is that a jojo refence i actually was watching your persona 4 videos last night then i wake up to this glad to have you back so during that little flashback with the goddesses dunno if you noticed that dragon larva by filyn maybe it was the same one piax hit when noire was captured but how did it even get into compas house maybe its important or im looking a little to deep on it oh still here hand it over that thing your dark soul for my ladys painting slave knight gael why not its video game quote day you killed me with reach out to the truth is filyn and cfw magic the the same entity 420 wait it is nep team epic nepneps pudding adventure when also histy with the 3 at least its not 333 years 1003 overlay them on each other 1753 and they are still at the closet 1920 metroid 2006 cui trust nobody not even yourself 021 gone but not forgotten 157 so like uzume in vii 917 i thought she mentioned being the protagonist right when she woke up to be or not to be i cant speak like shakespeare hmmm sink sink sink the art of did neptune purple heart reseved his hdd is that a jojo reference whack the book with a hammer well hes not far off from a particular plot beat new or old game but anyways good stream logic a small little person has more health and strength than a machine chocoman 1043 is what you want i seriously looked almost everywhere else for this little devil i seriously hope im not the only one who choose to watch this video just to find out how to do the chase after filyn mission sooo is idea factiry going to use this ending to complete arfoires story with a type of redemtion are later i can see ot now two paths one soulwho will win the former first gen goddessor the monster she became find out next time on nep sphere g or something like thati mean it wouldnt be the first time they went with an ending that wasnt the best one you could get to continue the next game in the storyline so basically either chrome or filyn will die this time around meh not the conquest ending still kinda sad yeah this was the ending i got first and it was kinda depressing damn she used hakai on them not gonna lie that bad ending wasnt really that bad really just more like i need friends to fight to i must do this by myself xd wao interesting gotta try it myself to get it either im missing something or this neptunia game just decided not to follow the normal rules of gamindustri since forever cpus got stronger depending on how many shares they had if thats the case then since near the end bombyx mori was losing several members and tons of people were becoming aware of 3d games thanks to the resistance filyn should have had little to no power and the cpus should have had plenty it should have been impossible for them to lose holy shit this makes me wanna see chrome mode aka richter mode from sotn where you play the whole game but with chrome only so it just starts the game all over again episode 2 2423 edit except this time chrome has broken that ending is quite depressing im getting vibes of ib and corpse party good alternate ending i did looked up all the cgs in jp version and saw that cg thats how you get it oh my goodness i never thought this cg would be a bad ending all right my final thoughts and what i think are the different mechanics of this games world final thoughts sooo is chrome actually arfoire or not different world mechanics the goddess of this world originally doesnt have a human form but somehow chrome managed to and turned the other goddesses humanthis explains the pictures of them in the past both chromes and neptunes gen played games together in goddess form and this explains why filyn still has goddess eyes there is also no mention of hdd which is what they usually call their transformation theres also no mention of share crystal they only mentioned shares but they still doesnt explain it very well like in other games and theres also doesnt seem to be any mention of a console war death end request all over agian im happy that it was so quick didnt want conquest vibes but what will happen if the player accept the final boss paix x three musketeers x poofys offer ah endless loop what an ending so basically the normal ending of derq of all that traveling back to the past nvm best ksha reference hahaha ty i forgot the bad ending x wow that was quick im glad i helped 3 thats sad the only thing i can say rn is oh this is depressing well some rpg games have a bad ending when you fail to win the fight against the final boss chrono trigger is a perfect example of getting a bad ending when you fail to win the final boss fight i couldve gone my whole life without realizing this other ending but now i can say i think ive seen every cutscene in this game that ksha reference well thats too dark and harsh too say bummer i have 499 magic stones i dont have any idea where is the last this tone is very odd considering the story is more or less everyone lose some how and needs to get there memories back and save the world so the next game can go back to being 3d seriously the music brings out my inner member berry for classic rpg themes and the mechanics bring out my inner member berry for record of agarest war 2 this game looks promising sorry cant buy through playasia my bank claims it to be fraudulent even though everyone and their mother says otherwise sad times anyone else got an alternate site to import japanese games omg olive neptune so much she my favorite number 1 goddess ahhhhhh 100 is that really true arfoire curious if if and compa will make an appearance in this game along with the candidates is that purified arfoire at 100 i will literally watch this every day and night until the game releases when it coming out looking forward to seeing it the music calms my soul if we needed any more reasons why blanc should be in smash besides the fact that she is the personification of nintendo itself then this could be it having a neptunia game on the switch is this neptunia zero hype for the game xd any idea whos the composer for the op having good osts is a sign of a good game so how did they get trapped in a book this time histy please explain the song sounds french i think what name the song im getting this for switch instead of ps4 p nier automata music odin sphere style neptunia perfect game 3 hmm idk about this game its 2d who males games like this anymore my goddess i am in love with this song so beautiful wow the music is beautiful i hope you reach 70000 subs this looks promising indeed was the fifth girl the good arfoire wow it looks awesome it has the same style as odin sphere leifthrasir that game was freaking amazing i hope this neptune game be amazing also megadimension neptunia vii played 100 hours and still havent finished the trophies 4 goddesses online ive got all the trophies in less than 24 hours lolits a nice game but a lack of content i am thou thou art i is this a persona 5 reference hey tikal i from india love you 3000 hey tikal excellent video as always if you dont mind my asking i have one important question for you the cpus are at full power again about time too i love these animations xd it makes it so much better to actually see blanc kick the bookshelf than have a character describe it uzume is in the corner with the surprised face why did you give neptune blanc and noire the nut 3 its funny how a 2d game is more animated than a 3d game i think blanc is the most awesome character in this game so far shes always great but angry blanc is just great to see qotd i like reading novels but i would read a manga if someone gave it to me qotd light novels and mangas i am weeb letblanccurse qotd what weeb doesnt read manga videogames hey lets split up the party me oh please no that only works sometimes qotd i like reading novels especially fantasy and science fiction ones hey blade have you seen this contest httpswwwredditcomrcompileheartcommentsc3g36msuperneprpgphotocontest if you playing with jap dub they say the kid with loli lmao xd qotd i like reading easy things and novels with the story that easy to understand is my favorite and i actually ok with weird story that almost seems like made by blanc the bizarre weirdness actually kinda entertaining qotd why blanc cant curse on this game qotd light novels manga and especially visual novels love them qotd light novels manga and especially visual novels love them qotd light novels manga and especially visual novels love them is the game good been a avid fan of neptunia franchise qotdi dont really like reading i prefer seeing the action i guess the most thing i am reading is subtitals qotd manga and historical documents oo so this is what blanc is like on book withdrawal 540 that enemy reminds me of polywrath from pokemon funny how they decided to censore blanc from dropping the fbomb even though she says it in every other game xd letblanccurse qotd books and manga 1 530 if its body was blue instead of yellow is this thing supposed to a poliwrath 2 2243 i agree you cant really take blancs anger seriously when she says freaking cmon ifi bleep it out like when iffy swore if you have to letblanccurse i mean i know for a fact that its not like wendee lee has a problem with swearing the big words like fuck and such when shes acting xd 3 2301 im reminded of the scene in victoryrebirth3 where neptune spent several minutes hyping up blancs rage and sounded like she was legitimately terrified of her something that was never hinted at before that and has never been brought up since 4 so fun seeing blanc being a book nerd again it was nice in viir and its nice here and it really is amazing how these simple animations manage to show so much character and make the scenes feel more alive than just reading what the characters are doing if the next game blanc should have sound a little more angry there letblanccurse qotd booksmostly fantasy novels and different kinds of manga letbladeswear seriously saying shoot instead of shit what else do you say heck instead of hell its a metal dogoo its always metal dogoo have you been playing neptunia and friends if you havent played in a while the characters will complain about why youve been gone for so long gotta say im not really a fan of letinsertnameherecurse i just dont like it when people encourage others to curseswear i just never understood that i dont care about the censorship im just mad that rom and ram are not playable or even appearing in this game wah ps4 nonono cant show their boobs switchsteam nonono cant show their boobs fans booo i hate sony i wonder again why people are so angry about the censorship it never bothers me at all and i dont need fanservice to be able to enjoy the neptunia series hell i dont even need meat or alcohol to survive im sorry i thought video games were supposed to be fun and enjoyable by the way ive planned on getting this game flashbacks to some of my childhood times of being a touhou fan is this game any good heard it left a bad taste in some peoples mouths dose it mean that your main character who you cant see is a boy are you people serious the censorship is so minimal these people were acting like it was so drastic and i also knew it was bs and this shows like cmon so pathetic the censorship in the game of itself doesnt bother me bc its mild and its not like it ruins the whole game but the fact that the developers original vision had to be altered bc of rules that dont even make sense in the first place is ridiculous the censorship is so minor i wonder why they even wasted time putting it in im not bothered by it because nothing really changed just confused who is that red girl and gray girl all the versions seem fine too me i dont know why everyone is so angry about the ps4 censorship its not that bad lets be honest who really cares about the cg its much more upsetting that sony have suddenly started pulling this bullshit as though governmental rating systems werent already in place and they personally need to tell everyone in the world what is or isnt good for them which lets face is exactly whats going to happen when you give americans power over anything rip sony im ready to see how well this game sells on steam switch and ps4 in individual man i do miss satoru iwata and especially the fact he said that video games are meant to be fun for everyone headpats blanc blanc please be a good girl like sanae kochiya sucks about the censorship is there at all oh why so many beautiful and sec ahem attractive girls can only be found in the game ps guys belly buttons are inappropriate sorry we have to make everyone look like they have a smoke body switch and steam you all are the true legends for purchasing the game on switch we will grant your lewd desires by your word when blanc isnt angry she is quite an asmr queen poor noire people is making fun of her because censorship also blanc is cute when shes angry censorship on ps4 very pathetic and upsetting like how im feeling right now after watching this wait does that mean that filyn isnt the real main antagonist of of neptunia rpg i find the censorship for the ps4 version absolutely ridiculous its not like it actually is showing anything revealing compared to how its on steamswitch i hope sony goes back to the way they were ill get the switch version if i ever get a switch im going to get this when it out for pc waitis it on switch if it isthen im gonna buy it and play it preordered on steam cant wait to play it when get home ok so crome is for sure the good arfoire from the best ending of the first game and the rebirth version this game is so serious am i the only one who cant hear noire as noire i dont know how much the va fits her look at itty bitty little compa she looks just like our daughter chu where is part 14 seeing them in their hdd forms in casual gaming clothes and seeing purple heart smile for once added 10000 years to my life span why is part 14 not being uploaded wait chrome google chrome and google remembers everything oh it will be it all makes sensechrome is arfoire and filyn is cfw magic never saw the jap release so im guessing neferpitou didnt know you like hunter x hunter twits relieving himself in the toilet i think the pictures on the top was neptune purple heart noire black heart blanc white heart and vert green heart in hd play games together 1426 reminds me of that one time nep or someone said shed drown in pudding 1554 typical 1754 imagine compa does the harlem shake 2244 you mean the dotted one thats probably chocolate cupcakes 2835 i thought its a bundle of flowers 3115 dont worry this is neptunia they wont suffocate well its officially a new dimension as far as i can tell if is in school this time it would be an interesting twist if the pictures of the cpus arent actually of these four im basing this on the fact that were seeing them in hdd form and casual clothing the only time weve seen them wearing normal clothing in hdd is in the anime which so my guess is fylin either somehow became a goddess or pulled an arfoir and sapped the cpus power also shes such an adorable villain its compa we all love compa right i have watched you play all of the neptunia games on channel minus neptunia victory of course 3500 haha duty calls i have never played a neptunia game before 3350 looks like this game is done after the original hyperdimensional and the mk2 dimension games back on the ps3 2824 blub blub blub i am a fishy fish i was happy to see compa too its been a while since we last saw gamindustris best nurse d i finally get to play my first ever neptunia game i am impressed that nep managed to have self control to not eat ground pudding also i understand why with the other goddesses not being able tell there hdd forms but vert looks the same i thought if was gonna say when she introduced herself the names if im the gust of wind blowing through gamindustri that album is not just any coincidence there is something maybe something related to the main series oh dear my head is so confused the table is finally full aaaand they leave remember when i said about the 5 iq villain well i think i when short in that number 1812 im radical ed im akko kagari its nice to meet you im konata izumi my name is sailor galaxia a pleasure whats with compas passive aggressive yelling ty it was a really good ep d btw i really like the way this story was written is better than rebirth 2 and 1 imo also i like the fact that for once i can feel that vert is relevant normally she is just there imo ofc wow the goddesses look so chill in that one pic in the photo album like they were having a lot of fun obvious as to the meme filynvillain what about if and compa are they still in the closet yknow without context hehe hmmm such a nice photo they how lovely great work as always twit i really enjoy your videos they are the highlight of my day thank you for gracing all of us with your wonderful videos i do understand arfoire in this one she wanted to protect the girls if someone were to die off in this game id be iffy legit serious no questions 318 yes chrome you should be sorry for all the time that noire get killed in a battle 1550 flower flower flower 2642 is the octopus eating or sneezing 2753 its full full health bombyx morons hope they got dolphins in this game giant octillery you know iffy and compa are avalible for dlc party members in the eshop now twit v hmm that octopus kinda remind me of the some of parodius games why a splatoon reference if its based on the transition from 2d to 3d games now that i think about it im kinda disappointed nep didnt get a sega saturn redesign or even a new goddess for the console today on thetwitgamer an early look at shantae 5s new squid baron design maybe make octopus balls from him thats its i discovered a new recipe that introi really appreciate that since sarahs lisbeth is best sao girl d you cant use verts skill if everyone is at full health 3046 an sendoff with octopus andtea you meant red wine right thar load time thing doesnt change for some reason neptune blanc noire and vert are reminding me of ruby weiss blake and yang in that order i should add i dont know why their dynamic in this is just bringing them to my mind neptune and ruby are the excitable ones that easily forgive and forget the latter in another sense too and dont like to work blanc and weiss are easily angered but also very studious lets not forget the ice stuff and be honest theyre very self conscious noire and blake are easily hurt by being wronged by others and dont forgive easily this in this episode sparked the connection for me vert and yang are both mature more than youd think at first but any anger as far as i can recall turns to fury very fast its a thin line am i the only one who sees this connection i mean there is no connection obviously its just that i read enough unofficial digital literature for these franchises that i am very aware of all the characters i mentioned maybe i should go 1036 did they seriously just make a pikmin reference 2008 i feel worse for having to look that reference up its a reference to bokosuka wars an absolutely terrible game for the nes 2328 iffy will remember that 2702 its making ultros noises looks like a giant octorok and shoots colored ink make up your mind about which franchise youre referencing splatoon reference neptune most powerful weapon an attack from it can be gotin a the store on poni iland did neptune made a jojo reference i mean part 4 yoshikage kiras luck holy crap if it is ultros then we need to call terra and her friends asap giant octopus in the thumbnail i think we already know what will happen yikes shame to see this series fumble so badly hopefully they make another action game like neptunia u eventually those are the best ones imo so she looks like old school arfoire has the same voice carries historie but shes not her naaahhhhhh even if shes not i think ill treat chrome as arfoire qotd id name them after theor personalities glamour destroyer goofball and softcore tsin yo i knew that was bsha chrome is definitely arfoire or at least based off of her qotd i like their current names so i wouldnt change them i really cant think of any other names everyone knows chrome is true ending arfoire why developers named her chrome though perhaps to make it more memorable spurting more theories and discussion chrome totally not arfoire yeah sure by the way im playing the game with japanese voices and she also has the same voice as arfoire too qotd i would have named them playstia boxia and wiinia as a pun on the consoles they represent qotd why neptune loves pudding if there guys this is definitely not arfy alright can you please stop assuming things everyone stares at histoire her va and her overall design if everyone yeah how about not qotd i think id name them after some plays on certain weapons names like noire after some play on durandal or even excalibur or just arturia if were going that route vert after gungnir and blanc after some axe or even a hammer probably not the best set of names but the better ideas id have gotten went down the drain years ago i really hope she turns out to be arfoire and that maybe we learn more about her is there anyway this game some of the information could be canon maybe theyll have restored arfoire in the next mainline game wish they would bring back rei in some game too lol if only for a cameo bshas va improved at voice acting it sounds like assuming it is the same actor so i noticed during your battles that you had a lot of ap try spamming the attacks a bit chrome will eat all of your ramdom access memory one thing i dont get about this game is why noire and vert is in this game this is about 2d noire and vert appeared in the 3d era qotd noire nowa blanc blanny blanny b vert pervert if chrome is the true name of arfoireand she got the name arfoire after she got the powers of the deity of sin sorry about my englishjust a brasilian putting the cards on the table i dont think anyone notice this not even on twitgamers videos but you should pay attention to your top right portraits when chrome stop moving she have paralyzed status thunder icon and neptune got skull icon and im pretty sure she died because of that i only play around 3 hours but i remember i read something along doom status effect is chrome actually arfoire or just a lookalike really took ya that long to realize bshas voice i noticed it quickly plus its funny how similar they are qotd vert would be melissa i just think that suits her mature attitude that she shows of blanc would be anne i just feel like thats a name that suits her love of books plus it still sounds similar i know ann in p5 doesnt but still plus its the name of a girl who likes to read in manaria friends and also has a great knowledge on magic noire would be jessica bcz that just sounds like a name thatd fit her being a very confident and hard working girl qotd change verts name to boobs change noires name to friendless loner and change blanc to smolnangry 1 ester corina boettger bsha confirmed on twitter that she is indeed the va for ester so thats one down 2 2140 well she did say in vs sega hard girls that she likes entertaining people 3 2150 al and manu manu al really ifi xd 4 2528 thanks for helping me clean up here have an entire dollar qotd one idea i had was to continue the planet naming scheme that planeptune cpus have neptune pluto plutia uranus uzume in which case vert would be venus named after the goddess of love but the other two i was unsure of i was originally planning to name blanc pluto since its the coldest planet but that names already taken so shell be mars named after the god of war and lastly i thought that since noire thinks so highly of herself she could be jupiter named after the king of the gods or she could be mercury since its status as the warmest planet suits her fire powers another idea i the mad king what is ryan doing in a neptunia game qotd i think i would just give them their nicknames beruberu blanny and nowa for actual names i dont really know maybe something related to their elements but i need to think longer about this the cartridge is intriguing why cartridge i wonder dang it i wanted to be true ending arfoire but hey chrome looks pretty cool so no bigs chrome cena i love hypnosis villains so much lets all be honest nintendo is the best console and playstation is close second im a bokemon i know it im meowth arffie is jessie linda is james mind control music wow this game has so many references shes brain washing the loli have to give paix some credit for a mastermind she is using a different instrument than the standard organ 1859 yeah so much better than poly island harbower i fucking hate digimon surely chrome can figure out that some memoryshenanigans done by paix is the reason that filyns memory is wack wish they wouldve used plutia as the sleeping monster such a missed opportunity after watching this all video i also think paix is the main antagonist in this game if pocketed monstrosities is pokemon then is bokemon digimon at the moment it seems that its interchangeable i personally dont care if its one or the other but i prefer something concrete than just willynilly 2654 use the balls to attack then monsters then monsternap them in a bag or something xdddddddddddd 2514 gasp digimon oh the hate is coming and the thunder is thumding pokemon opening english theme twit you really twitted that one have you not 1946 her name is ashley and she sounds like ash xd 1151 chrome console hint petrix 804 okay be real now guys who else started to meow meow meow gj dude i really like your commentaries d tbh i like mostly the story and interactions everything else is ok or not so ok s sad tho i wish more games like this in terms of writing were made i like the mean jokes but this is really good too so filyn is being manipulate who would guess gotta nep them all ashley looks like ashs crossdressed form ashley just grow the hair ive always wonder if all the nations all of them have only one city like really id expect more cities if its a nation that sleepy monsterlets name it restabit get it restabit anyone 205 more like a good flag to me or that im really bad at english that i dont know what that means 408 thought i saw something weird hello al 2307 alright uzume 2643 scientific 100 2824 ah great hope artys laugh wont attract others damn it i cant resist catch em catch em gotta catch em all gotta catch em all bokemon too much digimon references in this game this is why i loved references in video games for neptunia games theres a lot chalk full of references but i still loving it i cant watch your videos so i can avoid spoilers sorry twit or maybe i could give a likes on your video or else youre on thin ice with the digimon joke i am really sick of those jokes nepemon the new pokmon game great work twit your videos are a higlight of the day for me thank you for everything you do 206 okay revu being a wii u reference the wiis code name during development was revolution is expected from this series but the other one ukon vasara is finnish for old mans hammer didnt expect to see finnish in a canadianjapanese game damn no matter how beautiful this map i cant stop my phobia to underwater view last time also in atelier firis and lydiesuelle the music reminds me of metroid i just stumbled across sang helios playing neptunia shooter he beat all six parsecs and earned just over 270k points you almost had it on your runs twit my heart feels like there is something more is this a spinoff or part of the main series nep did all of this where are the candidates i appreciate the disney reference in the title now im imagining the cpus as mermaids at least they got the motivation of bombix mori abyss im gonna call the abyss watchers to take care of the abyssal beasts in there if we dont get sarah cursing her left lung out in this episode i will consider that intro false advertising d that is gameindustri after global worming uhhh no comment ill do is grinding to make this easier now im hearing sebastian from the little mermaid singing under the sea in my head now blanc would send them all to blankness thats what she would do hammer the bombyx mori straight out of the timeline that submerged tower reminds me of aquatic base from sonic 06 hit its weakness for massive damage wow i skipped 5 mins of random battle i only watch every one of enemy now they are literally sunk bioschok reference 445 ill end this woosh 622 did you just said a cuss word not from a dialogue k 826 its like minecraft loading a new chunk 1355 i am more surprise how that game title is still readable 1703 a men nut 1736 no nepgya 1740 no blanny blanny bii them 1850 the dungeon actually makes nep looks like running inside a circular tower okay totally sure we need sebastian flounder and ariel but if we cant get them i can easily call a certain boy with a keyblade a duck and a dog thats the sink why does the kid i mean filyn look like cfw magic from rebirth 2mk2 am i the only one that thought that neptunia is owned by sony before super neptunia rpg came to the switch i mean all of the neptunia games except this one are on playstation consoles and now its multi platform blancforsmashultimate ok whats the 4th wall breaking catch here oh im soo excited to try this game w im playing all the neptunia spin offs they should make a second season of hyperdimension neptunia well i got something to look foward to this year nep nep for life i dont know what this story about the cpu godesses is am i the only one thinking of limbo when seeing this also god this song always gets me this is pegi 12 holy fuck not the death flag 818 erica can pull it off just as well as erin did chibis shame that if and compa couldnt come but it shows that chrome really does care about those two i wonder if they called her granny chrome when they were little maybe even granny arfy xd but that aint her name in this game 141 in her minecraft hotbar 1133 kick the bridge thing he is standing on so he falls 220 um i think we broke iffy shes been opening and closing her mouth repeatedly this entire time you trying to kill your audience twit one last thing twit gamer there is a new free neptunia ps4 theme based on the new neptunia ova however in order to get this new theme you will need a japaneese ps4 account you will also need to download it before august because the theme will no longer be on the ps4 after that or because after that the theme might cost money here is a link of what the theme looks like the picture of the theme is near the bottom of the article httpswwwsiliconeracom20190708hyperdimensionneptuniatheanimationsummerovagetsanewtrailerandfreeps4theme hey twit gamer its been a while but i thought you might like to know that compa iffy and artisan are all available to be purchased as playable dlc characters for the switch version of neptunia rpg as a bundle on north american eshop for the switch so if i were you i would see if you can purchase it on the switch eshop were you live just to see if you can get the dlc or not and yes i do know you live in a different country but it couldnt hurt to see if the dlc is available also the bundle of dlc characters is less than 500 usd if thats a 3d console why does it have a gamepad chibis and we get chibi histy as well d even noires mouth was moving nonstop at 700 oo hmmmm such mysteries and stuff ty very much it was a good ep this game has nice music yay party pupping pudding pudding for everybody ps loved the chibi version i could die a lot times for so much cuteness for those who dont under the pineapple salad death flags it references an episode in macrossrobotech and macross frontier in which a character asks his girlfriend to make him a pineapple salad later he gets injured in combat and dies in the presence of the girlfriends pineapple salad although in frontier he is only hospitalized rather than dieing when neptune said bokosuka the captions said boca cyka sees thumbnail dies so much chibi too cute cant breathe thank you for the upload thanks for watching do you prefer 2d or 3d games hey bro can i get this game at gamestop i much prefer the reversible cover cant wait to dig into this one later tonight its on switch yay after all this time we finally get to see noire and blancs consoles xd this game really has some great moments in it and to those of you who have the game did you happen to see the noire event or did you miss it qotd id put rei in here and have her as an unlikely allieit would be more cannon to our reality since the atari jaguar experimented with 3d just imagine her on the warpath but on our side this time i wonder if blade even noticed about the pop team epic reference gurren lagann spin on who the hell do u think i am i ran into that event but i was constantly talking to everything at the beginning edit also everyone write that noire information down your gonna need it when she inevitably comes to our world and somehow chooses one of us as her escort xd noire goes out somewhere on nights when shes stressed wow noire cosplays what a nerd the artura x neptune ship is going smoothly also angry blanc is as fun as always qotd uzume qotd nepgear for obvious reasons and linda since i think she would work a lot better in the more toned down world of snrpg i wish there was some dialogue between noire and black heart sam for blanc and white heart oh well qotd adult neptune it would bring an interesting dynamic since shes a dimension traveler since the game is in 2d dimension 647 this might be a persona 4 reference who the hell do you think i am is a gurren lagann reference qotd does nepgya count blade if you see this commentit helpful if your in goddess form and break gauge in 1 bar full you can do those skill like noire say omni crash ver 15 well the design of those consoles was unexpected maybe they couldnt show the real world consoles because of copyright so they just invented fictional counterparts now that i think about it uzumes swirl console also wasnt exactly a dreamcast although it resembled one i only knew about the noire event because the cg was on one of the twit gamers videos thumbnail and i looked up how to trigger the event if not for that i would have missed it qotd hmmm i will choose rei having another previous generation cpu would be interesting qotd plutia obviously not only bcz shes my favorite but also bcz her time was the time of 2d games iirc that is but im pretty sure 3d didnt come until much later so itd be interesting to see her in her natural envirement if that makes any sense qotd uzume uzume all the way or nepgear uzume because of what you mentioned and cute orange heart is cute and nepgear because vert needs someone to pamper artura reminds me of a fusion of iris heart and uzume qotd i would like to see plutia in all honesty for plutia vs artura white heart is blanny blanny back qotd im gonna say pko because i want to see her interact with fylin 1 lastations console interesting design looks kinda like a ps one horizontal part shoved through a ps2 vertical part also very disappointed we didnt get any dialogue between noire and black heart 2 noires characterization in this game ive been thinking about this for a while now and how about this neptune blanc and vert all have a reason to go after bombyx mori neptune wants to be a hero blanc wants to save the worlds books and vert wants to save the worlds games up until she was told she was a goddess what reason did noire have to go after bombyx mori but notice how as soon as she regains her goddess power she immediately starts worring about her nation and her people noire is the most responsible and hardworking goddess yes when she knows shes a cpu and its her duty remember noires heart dimension dream in vii methinks noire secretly wants to be more selfish but as long as shes a goddess shes no blanc going with the chirico vibes though in a less interesting and more embarrassing way qotd i would bring pure afoire heh now jokes aside i would totally bring csha mostly because she was my favorite from the gold third and would serve as a good partner to artisan the poor thing has to manage the resistance alone ok so theres something thats been bothering me noire is a special attacker and ignis edge is a physical move so of course it would be weak when she uses it qotd rei because i wanna see her perspective in this universe since the cpus are gone qotdim pretty sure only few people gonna pick rei so i choose rei ultradimension i got both noire and verts events by accident as i was talking to people to get quests so i could buy a new weapon does the events come out at random because i got noires event as soon as i got noire and blanc its a shame you see noire event at this point of time 245 wasnt expecting a jg wentworth reference but it was totally worth the joke oh goodie they pulled an arffie dragon seriously have these villains learned nothing 538 that is a gameboy lol the title of this video is it a reference to the wonder twins 649 wait are you shadow the hedgehog or the demon king from dragon quest 1 make up your mind x awesome it was the less interesting ep til this point v we need more dialog x ty anyway d tips to kill ultimate life forms send it to the space use lava decapitate it if its possible hit the ultimate dragon with the truth what truth though paix im the ultimate life form mr perfect cell dbza and kars are we a joke to you moral of the story team effort is the good strategy for beat big bad boss 637 liquiiiid wait wrong series why did you not except half the world of divine final boss paixdreigon get the reference i cant put into words how much i loved that cg its moments like this that make following something for a while all worth it imo qotd for me id say arfore brave linda korome rei magic and the original fake vert from the first game and the rebirth remake i would include steamax and afimojus but they actually kinda got a happy endong tada alia has returned this game is everything i wanted out of a neptunia game but only scratches the surface chrome and filyn being new takes on arfoire and magic was a brilliant idea we get teased with the divide between the cpus halves and personally it has a whole lot less fanservice than the other games in the series a bit short compared to vii and the gameplay takes a while to click but that combined with the mega man pokmon and mario fanservice shows a possible new direction for the series thats quite enticing qotd cfw brave actually he could have been brought around so easily if it werent for the deity of sin practically bending him to her will i would have liked to see the aftermath of such a scenario into the present might have made the lastation megadimension arc much more interesting as well 3230 this really makes me want to see the cpus do other activities besides battling kinda like the first ep in the anime qotd i feel like cfw brave deserved a happy ending hes the only villain besides copypaste who wasnt completely evil just a bit misguided qotd kurome definitely she deserves a good ending i just thought of something what if neptunepurple heart was manipulated into sinking her own land if said that a goddess sinked her own land in a rage and remember in the beginning with that mysterious dark purple heart she said sink so it must be her responsible for the underwater city but considering that neptune fought herself must have been her being her real self we all know that neptune isnt a kind of person to do something like that even if her people lost faith in her but im not sure what happened to the others thoughi might be too slow to realize that but eh still very interesting why are you the way you are i saw little if in the thumbnail i click she is so goddamn cute that search a little longer choice was just so you can get the histoire tome when i see that photo album my heart itsits that cpu gaming cg sure gives a feeling of nostalgia specially since its been a good few year since i came into contact with neptunia which was bcz of the anime that came around during the time of rb3 qotd probably kurome bcz one shes my favorite and two bcz she really felt sad when she was about to be defeated as dark orange she did say why does the world insist on rejecting me after all so seeing her getting some love would be nice i feel like they should have put a try and buy option like in vii instead of having you going back and forth between the shop and your inventory to check the equipment stats also the cg almost made me cry a bit and made me wonder what truly happened between the time when the photos where taken to whats happening currently in the game and why qotd kurome wow the story is getting better and better i cant wait to see how things unfold also i think sunken planeptune would have had more of an emotional impact if it werent for the fact we have been to the zero heart dimensions destroyed planeptunes still it causes quite an impact qotd cfw brave does deserve a happy ending and also hyper rei my interpretation of rebirth3 is that hyper rei got mind controlled by a copy of ultra reis mind when she got her powers no doubt croires doing and she not remembering anything fits thus shes innocent qotd kurome that cg man it was so heart warming and sad at the same time im still thinking that chrome is arfoire i refuse to believe otherwise wait so neither the cpus nor the candidates exist in this game oh hey you make a good opinion senpai i like how you make a link between past events in past game and make them connected with this game also on chrome with if and compa picture i also think chrome looks like mother figure for young if compa too it was indeed a nice cg for qotd answer kurome 1 voice actor news filyns va has come forth and its not sarah williams or laura post as i thought but a newcomer to the neptunia series reba buhr httpstwittercomrebabuhrstatus1146618557632901120 httpswwwbehindthevoiceactorscomrebabuhr so the only one left whose va is still a mystery is artura 2 speaking of young if and compa something i realized a while ago theres a scene in mk2rebirth2 where we see the first time if and compa met nep and gear in the hyper dimension and considering how much time must have passed inuniverse since then they really should have had their young sprites from victoryrebirth3 in that scene if they had changed that for rebirth2 it would have made perfect sense from a worldbuilding perspective to show how much time has passed and it would have served as foreshadowing for rebirth3 my guess for if and compas ages if and compa meet nep and gear anywhere from 56 to 1112 nepgear re the cg is great i like chrome with if and compa i like the cpus just playing games and i love how good white heart looks with just a tshirt and shorts qotdi actually dont know i wasnt really connected with many of the villains other than arfoire and kurume and arfoire gets one at the end of rebirth1 and kurume practically gets one through uzume since they are two faces of the same coin 3750 maybe it was just a flag for a future extra event also that cg was just so good chrome with such a cheeky smile was nuts to watch and the cpus playing games transformed couldve been because maybe they spent more time in their hdd forms than in their regular forms in this game at least by the way i just realised that if its true that fiylin i always get her name wrong is a cfw magic reimagination of sorts it would make sense for her to be so obsessed with chrome since she looks so much like true arfoire arfoire still qotd other than arfoire i guess rei i havent played the third installment on the series yet but i guess she didnt get a happy ending per se like how arfoire got hers kurome would come as a close second but i wouldnt dare to touch viis ending in any way or form really agreed i loved that photo album cg it was a good dose of nostalgia and a good way to reveal a part of the big mystery of what happened in the past it makes the story much more interesting qotd tbh i liked arfoires true ending from rebirth 1 i mean she was technically their mother and her pure form was great its unfortunate that rebirth 1 became noncannon changing arfoire into the deity of sin in rebirth 2 qotd i would like to give a happy ending to arfoire actually i really liked what they did with her in rebirth 1 so i kind of wanted her to atleast have a similar ending in rebirth 2 since they said rebirth 1 is no longer canon hmmm you missed one key evidence flynn qotd im gonna choose cfw brave qotd nepgear in neptunia mk2 rebirth 2 anyone else not like ester shes really dull also that cg is pretty awesome its neat to see them playing games in their cpu forms im going to continue to believe chrome is arfoire until the game tells me otherwise qotd i think it could be argued that kurome did have a happy ending her and uzume went back to being a singularly entity which is likely the only way she could ever be happy again so i think i would pick underlinglinda im not sure what her idea of a happy ending would be but id be interesting in seeing it you are a bubbly person im very restrained but im still learning this kind of stuff but i feel energy from you senpai if that means anything ah poor nep getting trashed on yes im early i miss the old noire voice actor first now that thats out of the way cant wait for your reactions no need to change attacks or formations if you can literally just spam x to win and because of shared ap just make sure x is the girl with the most dmg if you think that is good or fun combat system whatever the reason youre retarded sadly its not very good looks like they tried to emulate valkyrie profile with a coat of nep nep got the collectors edition directly from team iffy europe and already gave buyers remorse at least the plush is cute good indepth review ive been on the fence with this one for a while now but youve added quality info and analysis to ponderstill havent made up my mind on it enough to give it a whirl though looks like a cellphone game getting switch version for 2 reason first nep on the go and second not censored its also on switch looking forward for your review you are my best youtuber who reviews jrpg games you are honest with your reviews which makes me love your channel keep up the great work r3d senpai why dont bought the america version i hope they have a limited edition for the switch why the ps4 one the switch one is better thank you so much for your review and by the way nice shirt you wearing where can i get it nice unboxing and ill have an eye out for your review when i finished vii two years ago i didnt realize how badly i would want to play another neptunia game hey do we have a release date for super neptunia rpg for the west yet that description though is erin fitzgerald still not in this like in cyberdimension neptunia you got the censored version oof how do u have this are you gonna be doing more coms my man havent really been watching since bl remastered for that reason it looks good but im not a big fan of platformers would you say its worth getting even though im not a fan of platformers damnit i wish they credit the english voice actors actress goddamnit now i cant stop pressing the replay button this is super nepping awesome why do i feel like dancing i am now a big anime fan if that says something different then i am really trying to say i am now learning japanese konnichiwa tomodachi universe is limited resources is limited neptunia games too thanos this music is beautiful nice ending i want a new canon story game after megadimension also who excited for the new ova w the music is great no english voices nice video friend good game but short hope next nep game will be longer i finish not even a week as well 101 oh god that plug in though put nepgear in super neptunia rpg right now idea factory and compile heart all the neptunia songs that idea factory and compile heart produce is just so damn good i have been following the neptunia franchise for a few years now and it touches my heart for every single game the stories i can tell that they take a very long time to think about it sure this game isnt perfect but every game is not perfect this pumps me up for the next neptunia game they are about to release and i do not know what type of opening it is can you only play as goddesses i like how those three talk to her about goddess hood like they havent done shit that makes me question if they actually are goddess heres hoping people get what i meant by the title xd i have to ask this senpai who are you mostly afraid of filyn is simultaneously intimidating and not threatening in the slightest also im really loving the romance between neptune and artura qotd nope 1519 wait arent there supposed to be two options on the screen oo i wonder what happened to that also artura appeared at the event oh dear qotd nope im currently unable to attend those events this was the first time i see blade getting jumpscared at 1803 qotd i wish i could go to anime expo or something like that this year idea factory is doing a nep shooter competition at anime expo qotd every year in august we go to the canadian international airshow at the cne candadian national exhibiton they showed off the f22 raptor in 2017 and even had the blue angels perform there a few years ago the shows always end with a snowbirds performance sunny con uk just finished that today in a few day i will be going to anime midwest again vote blanc d for president of blancs mind xd qotd no i havent gone to a convention ever although to be fair there arent any anywhere close to where i live qotd i usually go to autoshows there is one here that i went to two years in a row thanks to my dad and its the manila international motorshow there was one time i went to a monster jam event they held here in my country as an event i wanna go to i would say cons cuz i have never been to any one of them qotd funny youd mention that i went to the yugioh europeon qualifiers last friday i didnt enter bcz the european championship was this weekend and i had to help moving stuff bcz im moving to a new house soon nothing big just a different street anyway i really loved being there with so many other duelists and cards that you could buy there too plus it had some fun mini games there as well you could do with others ill definitely try going there again someday or similar events qotd i wish i could go to any anime convection but for that i need a lot of money since there are no conventions where im from so i would have to take a plane qotd answer convention huh i ever tried once an anime convention but not end up well even though nothing wrong on that event i just dont like place with crowded people also whats wrong with the music when arthura appeared its sounds like music when we faced an enemy who can do killing blow in one strike i dont why but for me theres a rule which means if a villain is shorter the the main character my brain just switch off any seriousness to said character and considering the sprites and the fact with the hat on barely reaches neptunes neck nep being 149 cm long sure doesnt switch any alarms on my brain but artura its the same feeling on resident evil when youre just obliterating normal enemies and then boom the scripted invincible enemy enters the scene like whats poppin jimbo and just sht your pants 4 times in a row 1558 thats a bug senpai there mean to be a text box and 2 choices yes of course heres pic from twits video since mine also bugged like that httpsiimgurcomcp9xxdljpg 1803 thats the first time i heard you getting a jumpscare xd qotd no not anytime soon 1 641649 okay first blanc and now noire what are you trying to do here compile heart 2 1225 i believe the term youre looking for is diamond in the rough 3 1328 blanc likes looking at cosplayers takes notes interesting 4 blancside out with a title like that one would expect at least one of them to be anger but apparently not and now that compile heart has opened this door i cant help but wonder what the insides of the other cpus heads are like xd 5 1626 vernal adjective virrnull means of or having to do with the season of spring 6 well this little side event went on for way longer than i expected nor did i expect artura to show up there at the end although i do have to question the logistics of selling what i assume would be magazines or books outside in the winter water and paper usually dont mix very well qotd nope dont have any eve blanc always looks so nice wearing glasses qotd havent gone to any but id love to go to some kind of anime convention what in the hell is arturas theme i need to know two blancs for each arm thats my fukin paradise qotd there are some i would like to go to but i cant afford a flight etc to america just like that 1803 alert alert we have a dangerous redhead in the area run for your goddamn life twits blanc foursome is clearly superior inside out reference anyone this is my favorite cg blanc holding her glasses is me qotd i dont go to any events gotta say with four party members you really get a better sense of the gameplay and apparently it was confirmed that artisan is a dlc member not sure why they wouldnt release that with the game people might finish it and move on by then also watch that cat be very important xd noire was going to clean neptunes dirty face oh boy qotd i dont have a strong opinion of the combat in neptunia but i do like all the crazy moves they do in the other games 2002 jesus christ is now canon in the neptunia universe qotd battle system could be better did you guys know that noire actually is kinda glitched i mean its really not so bad but yeah if you kill one of the main bosses with her using elemental magic the game might glitch out and you cant target the final monster you can still finish the fight by spamming damage items and nothing happens when you win also she might end up doing normal attack instead of elemental magic when you kill ads but it doesnt glitch out when that happens so you can still use her for regular encounters remember attacking enemies with their weak element will gain you bonus ap one of the best method gain ap is by giving someone element bind using ability auto element bind then have them use area edge theres half ap ability in certain equipment and furyblanc only to speed up break gauge you can fast forward fights by using the lt trigger on your controller qotd the combat system is good and certainly different to most other games i have played its only problem is that it only really shines when you have enough party members i dont think the main series gameplay would have worked very well in a 2d game and i think its best that spinoffs go in their own direction rather than just do the exact same thing as the main games qotd havent had the chance to try the game out myself yet but apart from the learning curve it seems functional enough and personally and this is pure opinion i think that spinoff need to have different gameplay from the main games a to make them stand out and b cause otherwise whats the point of making it a spinoff qotd personally i think that the combat system is really interesting but it could really use some polish to fix it up also as an idea for a qotd i dont know if you have already done tis before but what cpu or character is most similar to you 18 40 i got some metal gear solid vibes from that bgm try aoe attack to regen ap faster even without memories nep still knows how to pull noires heart stringspoor tsundere cant catch a breakstill its refreshing to no rehash the erre fighting becausereasons and than thier allies trope again hey wait is it me or does the guild receptionist kinda look like gust from the original neptunia and mk2 i cant get enough nep in my life well erin isnt reprising her role as noire chie in p4 golden at least erica mendez ryuko gon and megumin is noire its sucks forgot noire has a different va nowadays yo is that silver haired chick arfoire yep the bombyx are ausie knew it wat she not arffie or mabey its a code name hrmmmm bigo ah gotta finish that series im honestly not a big fan of blancs current voice actress i prefer the calm and quite voice shes had before i feel like it suits her more whats this a neptunia game that has more than just five skills per character this is new ground all of them got amnesia for once idea factory thought of something else instead of the main character having amnesia everyone has amnesia how did i not realize that chrome is human arfoire you did not just do the jellyugh 3314 blanc what a bi 33003500 blanc im blanc yep is she allowed to say that i love how blanch voice acting is more like ram personalty 35013700 only nep will try to lure blanch with a book that histie is funny with her funny letter c and yet again without her memories nepnep got noir to join with the friend card 3655 noirs blush is cute i guess im completely wrong about the new lady still quite lovely chrome does look and sound very familiar could this be a sequel to the superdimension story in rb1 it has the super bit in the name 759 she also shares the same japanese va it could be connected even if its little like how hagel and another character in atelier totori that had a joke about having the same voice being carried over into dubbing i feel like this might be the first neptunia game i might skip at release thanks for uploading the videos though i watched this twice just to hear more of melissa fahns neptune shes endlessly entertaining ifi must do everything in their power to always keep her and we must riot if they ever replace her p i just realized if cartridges are high tech stuff here why is lastation around im also not entirely convinced that this new character isnt arfoire her name is chrome is that the best temporary name she can come up with also im happy that we get to see blanny again my number one cpu d chrome why is she not a fox at 1854 as in jelly dounts you mean rice balls lol 1854 shes got a lovely little pudding and some jelly donuts im dying xd noire getting hit by the friend card yet again hashtag finish the job yes yes x ty for the video hahaha i thought the same xdddd when you said get back to work xdddd oh and the be friends part i watched that part 4 times hahaha so funny xd nep is just awesome btw yes to think nep wouldnt be the only one with amnesia just what is going on here oh you accepted a quest i hope anyone know the reference anyone else catch the shark tank reference noire made i am liking the game so far hope it can get even better the mad king i heard worse n more intimidating names if theres chrome will there be firefox me mobzilla ie oh google chrome i almost dropped my tea while i saw the notif chrome yugioh thats a lot of food 625 i mean rarely anyone calls her name 645 about that i do seem to remember that chromes apparance match arfoire in rebrith 1 at the good end or whatevers probably just coincident 1934 historie eh i have a little bit of memory or that is she the one that could do dimension travel 2111 id say freeloader 2532 you sell both of your swords 3410 no 10for1 description is old it may be the best grinding spot but no i aint putting up with metal dogoos any more than i absolutely have to you silly billy this is a neptunia game no one can die just wanted to make this in case others needed help like me next ep will be up tomorrow as planned thank you this helped me alot i mean super neptunia rpg is a good game but i think that there a few design flaws myself im playing it right now and most of the stuff the game explains in the tutorials may be self explanatory but it can be so simple to comprehend that it doesnt seem like the actual answer to the problem when in reality it is i think my game must be glitched then cause i only have 3 mystery grass an the map has zero stars on it for me thank you just got to this part and was struggling a bit i find it kinda annoying how the scenery can sometimes blend with the parts you can walk on so this was very helpful the mysterious grass itself wasnt hard to find but you wont find fc land the part after the grass easily if you abuse fast travel it isnt marked on the map like the grass so i had to look up that part i love you for realizing this and sharing it that makes my life so much easier yes this game is horrrrible at explaining things thanks man this video was really helpful thanks for the info tbh it took me a bit but i found them this game is a little rough around the edges the part that got me was when the party split i did not see the a prompt and backtracked for about 2 hours it is a first game by a new studio so i am impressed that it works as well as it dose tip bellow if you want no spoilers have fun get all the elemental skills you can weak and absorb are broken check with the select button to see what they have you can use skills and abilities you dont have mastered if you have it equipped some skills cant be used with all characters as the lead you can queue skills and rotations when enemies have priority it dose not show this to you and can cause frustration when you need to switch to healers have fun if you look at the dungeon map you will see that quest items will be represented by a special star icon in the map itself they didnt explain this even though its valuable information if you didnt know this you can run away without helping and continue on without needing to help him this game is one of the find the clues by yourself game needs a lot of thinking i think thanks man it helps i was initially going to play a section ahead of you before i watch but i got stuck at lowee lol for someone play games you really pick it out uh figure sheet out right a way hello there

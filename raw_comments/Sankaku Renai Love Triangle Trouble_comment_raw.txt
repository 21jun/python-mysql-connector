aw man the most attractive girl so far is the sister i have a bad feeling about this chief xd haha yeah moba games i am one of those dont surrender types although i will if it like 100 looks like we have no chance happens semi oftenhaha the thing i love about this game is that every clique got konosubad just exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness garas voice for some reason reminds me of an ewok from starwars ive been waiting for this series 1228 i burped at this exact moment so i was super surprised to hear bosskwar react with o god a burp magnificent coincidence i just subbed love youre personality 2203 remindes me of dede from cronoclock now im sad picked this one up myself when it came out definitely a good one the biggest pain in all costume gacha pulls is getting a costume for a timelimited character that you will never get again because you lost your chance so that costume is just sitting there haunting you for the rest of your life and the only regret you have when you are on your death bed is that you didnt farm for every single girl in the game so you could use that costume you god damn right is ours bothers responsibility to keep our sisters safe i feel u scott im shit at fighting games too bring it on bro im fuckin ready i got my shirt with omae wa mou shinderiu nani on it and me hat ah yes this man is wis i like this game i played fgo and i am safe to say i rage quited a mobile game 330 i like this one xd 802 i dont think ive seen a vn with a character like this voice and all 1259 i feel like my brother has told me this before 1312 i know your struggles 1352 i appreciate the surprisingly accurate portrayal of the kind of dumb conversations i have with my brother or with lynn 1528 mum is momiji momiji i appreciate this and she looks like lynn xd 2318 screw that noise low maintenance ftw i like this new game i like it a lot you need to do some typemoon when you can fate tsukihime mahoutsukai mo yoru know you have your backlog oh so you played fgo which would of spoiled many parts of the vn hry even if you know those parts it is still a great vn i am 324479292 if you want to friend me i have quite a good team name is gilgamesh this is looking good already oh you play azur lane too at some point you will said nani the fuck all sisters are treasures deserve to be treated as such whether they be younger or older they should be protected if i had one i would most certainly do anything to keep her safe happy haha i knew you would play this one gudo jobu fgo bois we out here thats why i love this channel i didnt even know this game existed and now im already hooked comedy love triangles are hard to come by nowadays hmmm they call it love triangle trouble but there are like 8 routes monkahmm not counting the common route and more than 3 girl monkahmm damn this one was pretty good seems like pres has rank f lucksucks to be him then again my luck fluctuates my most recent 5stars both in azure lane and fgo came off of single pulls 14 minutes in and the 4th wall has been shattered this vn too op pls nerf also the gacha thing at the start is too real for me nerd otaku its us not blood related free to be dated holy shit his sister is sachi damn everyones starting this vn its amazing tho so i understand i might buy it lol this was fun pls do more bosskwar i see sachi gained promotion from childhood friend to sister this will be sunshine balls all over the place 3 maho is best girl shiina best route worth 28 published by nekonyan ill be happy if this is anywhere as good as fureraba glad to see youre playing this vn ive played through a good portion of it and absolutely love it for its comedy and its art is on point hopefully seeing scott play this game will change my opinion of it something about two different love triangles one involving a debate of nonblood vs true incest just sounds not appealing to me but hey ive been persuaded before so come at me game with everything you got the ending was hilarious love the bonding between sousuke nanaru nanaru is the best girl right now for me and that childhood friend has a kinda tomboy attitude he already got rejected this early in the game jesus that hit me outta nowhere for some reason anyways new game new waifu war get to your positions and ready up your comments this might be a very dangerous one if u listen closely then u can hear nanaru sounds like sachi i was waiting for scott to upload this series ps the 4th wall breaking girl best girl you better do her route 1st pps whats that cat dog 301 doing in the background lmao xd nanaru is like my sister its scary by the end of this year this channel will be dominated by nekonyan games lol my first impressions of this is it another fureraba and is that sachis voice actress voicing nanaru this is going to be good yes its happening yes 1032 why is the president blushing when nanaru sousuke told him to jump off the bridge and i am loving cara she is so cute and the way she talks damnit another series starting and im way behind on several others we need to do the sister and the childhood friend route that feeling of anticipation when youre up at 3 am and see this video as private and

though p 20404 they really made it easy on themselves with this opening with it being only a black screen and all lazy bums 20624 dont know if you completely understood it but you should know what to expect with love triangles and here a va list of the characters that appeared on the channel before for anybody who is interested nanaru elina minamo shiina satouin rikka maho chitose editor in wagamama akane yuu 4123 it is another game from asa project hitotsu tobashi renai and no that girl is not trap other than that i dont know it does not have english translation or at least iam not aware of it i just found info about that blondie so i could let you know explanation for the routes first there are choices where first take you for sisters route or love route when you enter in one of those you play that route until you choose one of the two girls for that specific route akane and cara are extra routes that doesnt really matter by the way are you going to do the sisters route personally i just preffer if you only do the love route im not into sisters xd nerds everywhere from now on im gonna post new videos here to promote them since youtube doesnt want to please give these

experience animationrewind cringe httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnvfckjtibuwt1s super smash bros project m httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvagvphal6qjot1044s please shut up i cant hear why is this me and my friend while playing games like this you are doing gods work man even though my god is dead project nope love potion disaster part 4 using tails pls this isnt wincest what the hell god suzu was making me feel so guilty throughout the video im disappointed there was 3 sexy scenes and they censore all even kiss like wtf is point i now its not hentai but still which route are you gonna start with sisters or friends route im actually quite curious edit nvmmmmm i read damn title that was amazing ending cant wait to see others keep up the great work rip this playthrough noble is uploading ltt to youtube that aint stopping me though ill just boost on ahead of him quick edit follow kusk24 and certain play theyre also playing love triangle trouble alongside me at first i thoght they were actual siblings 1029 this got my hopes up tho self roast shiina is thirsty 5501 you had no right to put that there xd this awesome and all but could you finish the other games first it feels like im being left hanging when you skip from game to game also question which routes are you doing already love this keep up the great work i smell incest i love it guys crying just from that gacha he probably havent survived fgo hell a next part please 13216 holy shit i was not expecting a dora reference i cant breathe i saw sankaku and my first thought was sankaku complex its gonna be spicy and i feel it i though i was ganna buy he princess the stray cat and matters of the heart first but this will need to be first yikes seem like have to take this out first another to the buy list childhood friends are always best if not 2nd best girl why are they always rejected i give my signers a sistal every day sometimes twice if they behave it gets old when the same guy is always the source of insults for cheap humor even more so when its the mc wwait was the game making fun of itself xd sword art online referance condirmed 2448 1523 thats alot of drool damn girl 1319 oh fuck that face and what he just said choked me up in a bad way oof why cant he unlock the door because if he cant that means the lock is on the out side 5109 is that saki reference 1123 signers need to be a thing now make it be known to everyone good choice 1130 okey dokie artichokey xd 3157 wait its a real choice moooooore sorry maybe thats a bit much so far my favorite is maho i dont even like childhood friends but there is something about her that that just flips the switch for me she is a bit of a tsundere but not a shit tun of it she is balanced like all things should be i cant live 2 days withou my kisu chan your struggle to make a decision is the best man there were some great gems in this episode this is hilarious xd this is my new favorite game on your channel after grisaia my favorite so far is maho i really like the respect he has for the mc and the way she stands up for him and understands him wait have the ditzy demons are in live with me and this game the same background 4109 rip scoot 192019 yknow if i didnt know any better id think scott is having fun with this game glad you are back though after a couple of days but honestly i wouldnt be upset if you chose nanaru either i like kisu and nanaru choose childhood friend or choose girl you are interested in please for kisu shiina choose new girl im pretty sure they played to heart gotta add to my list and yeah the kisumaho triangle seems to be the best v now i really really want to know about that rejection story use the guide scott shiina gave you all the choices kisu and nanaru are both amazing at this rate this game is going to surpass fureraba in terms of comedy speaking of which i know this is a bit late are you going to do those common route events and jealousy events i read somewhere that there was a backstory for mochoppi in those events 4339 i like how the japanese language has its own special word for best friend friend tomodachi best friend shinyu you hear tomodachi in anime a lot but shinyu is quite rare because so its also in real life you really have to know those people most of your life and really trust them to consider them shinyus 4243 i love how maho always stands up to him and says those amazing lines now im sad that you didnt choose childhood friend notice me scottsenpai 3516 its pretty obvious that choosing the childhood friend option would have pleased maho and probably the sisters since suzu told you to choose that also im pretty sure that just because of one choice you arent locked in any route yet you can still go on the right path possible plot twist shiina was monika all along man two punch man i got to look it up it sounds interesting life tip dont use eroge or any dating sims on real life theyre bullsh and also bruh kisu already says the choices use that the emiri route of ditzy demons is melting your brain signers signal sisters the way choices work you dont have to be 100 percent perfect for all the routes at least for me when i played through my first route my choices didnt match a walkthrough i saw after so at least three of the main four are still open to you kisusenpai route it is boy im definitely all go for kisus route first and im expecting lots of meta jokes and a sweet story i love him because he looks generic perfection has never been this close 4458 whats with those eyes and what does boobiesh means 2927 for me it would be akane naho or nanaru 2456 loved the sword art online reference 4720 and loved the one punch man reference as well this game doesnt hold back with the medahumor at all and theyre all perfect jokes that dont go over the head so glad i grabbed a copy for my own play through 1917 why isnt mc there it would have been more funny hmmm another day another bosskwar video and another test at school there it is the prez kawai face i was waiting for that reaction 1323 seriously prez is the best character of this game kisusenpai is the best girl of this game 618 ahhh that scary kisusenpai face 5123 love that pouty face as well for me it adds 100 points for kisusenpais route 037 normies am i right gamers rise up just letting you know part 5 isnt in the playlist for some reason 2455 i forgot that was a thing holy shit apparently the slang name japanese otaku give to someone with shit taste in anime is kirito thought id just share that 325 love that suzu face she wants maho for herself the thumbnail is a good way to make me instant click on a video literally wait for you to upload this dude lol btw keep goin on the nanaru route plz get a load of these normies love you sousuke third sees kesusenpai in the thumbnail me instantly clicks iam first i passed my exam 2340 she said oniichan finally thats what i wanted to hear seems she only says it when she is trying to be extra cutesy im expecting my sky zoom in at the festival diddly well im assuming there will be diddly there where more then likely its outside under the night sky monkahmm was that extra scene not on patreon 627 she sounds like a pokemon lol cute thats your best ship girl seriously what about illustrious takao akagi i aint judging just curious glad to see youre back scott 612 thats some weak shit back it the common route i think prez reeeeeeeed way better press y for combo chain attack no sorry ill will be leaving press a to smash is that a mother fn smash bros reference only suzu and i are left here weird hearing those words gave me the ability to see the future press a to pound ah yes after a week finally back with these bundle of nerds and i love it 819 implying that prez is best waifu prez route when 2434 god damn it nanaru lmao i so missed suzu for one week 137 and specially kisusenpai she is just so adorable funny and pervy shiina is so lovable and misunderstood love her upfront attitude area 51 will be raided on my birthday very nice also why does every main protagonist have a birthday in september is it just me they break the wall more then nep 1958 that hit a little too close to home 3556 depends are you watching or making best waifu she this taking us to fucking mcd and will give us a happy meal fucking amazing time to show this mortal my hamburger eating skills was it deadpool that create this game because it a shitton of forth wall breaking sou my man i agree 100 i already saw mahos route and she had four so unless they gave kisu more or less then she should have four you do have a history of either doing the childhood friend route last or not doing it at all so its not like the people saying that youre doing mahos last have no reason to believe it besides most of us making those comments are just doing it to tease you for it you probably know that though this is just my guess but i think there is a 99999999 chance that there is a h scene coming up in like 23 episodes all this fourth wall breaking man i freaking love it and thier needs to be a sub route for the mom in my opinion shes the best mom of all visual novals thats just me what you guys think of the mom in this game 4446 birthday cards never fail frfr by now the 4th wall is crushed to dust and not even done with the first route i think for kisu senpai getting maho fora gift was like getting prez to make a decision hahahaha 2900 akane route when xd shiina truly is the deadpool of eroge games the 4th wall is crying for mercy it should be thankful that neptune isnt around btw boss congrats on now reaching 17k subs congrats for your 17k sub d the 4th wall breaking is incredibly funny no matter when it happens physical combat oh ya cant wait for thatoh wait this is youtube damn it oh wait you can upload it on pornhub monkas the kiss scene coming up is actually pretty adorable and the after sex scene is pretty fucking hilarious whenever shiina is doing anything scott always says oh no like something is about to happen pfffft hahahahahahahaaaaa something always happens so excited for the birthday party episode will we see kisusenpai get a kiss or will we get an hscene 719 calling out the platform while their game is on that platform thats a thin ice youre stepping there nekonyan asa project shiina 2712 wow suzu said it we are on kisusenpais route they always have a new 4th wall break every episode and i love them all 636 i love that teehee face 1000 points added to kisusenpai cuteness 1722 hasnt stopped yuzusoft for one of their heroines 3456 definitely agree with you scott though it depends on person as much as i wanted to buy a friend of mine an eroge i decided senran kagura would be funnier xd 131 i love sousuke he doesnt freak out that kisusenpai is at his house 140 same thought nanaru sousuke is slowly becoming a chad every episode bosskwar pls put the 18 patch in the game folder 3 shiina goes into second best girl rem will forever have 1 y no music tho show of hands who else is here after lost pauses latest upload oh lord 12h but it will be worth my time edit is there no music in the background shiina route best route siscon eww people dont appreciate how much work was put into this the games been out for like a week and hes already done alot of the routes i just hope he gets alot of views for his hard work this route makes me feel bad for maho like that hurt alot but glad sousuke try to reason with her etc cant wait for the next part great review just one flaw cara is best girl i totally agree about the pace no scene ever dragged in this game i also love the dumb choice you get once per route amazing review been playing this one enjoying the comedic dialogue great review great review havent had a lot of time for vn lately but seeing reviews like these get me more hyped to find more time for them the art also looks great in this one omg this series is so funny 2018 damn 4th wall breakers kisu senpai is probably gonna try to get into every route until the end of this game 3410 this game just went from a 9 to a 0 at best two hscenes in one episode thats a bargain xd i like it scott is getting well into this ok maho get on the table lol just check that desk for drawers scott there maybe a difficult puzzle to solve with them lol im gonna make sure that room from 999 will haunt for at least a little longer lol sousouke is getting more bold and shameless being pretty forward about his desire for maho 2015 bro this game gold but wait sousuke said either of your routes does this mean a secret suzu route im convinced kisusenpai can control the game but only does it for comedic reasons having intercourse in the clubroom is enough but getting horny over a smell 2231 gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah whyyyyyyyy must this be soo funny 2719 can i read it maho i just want to sea you in a swimsuit laughs sarcastically 2950 i love how they even give a threesome and they try to bring you on kisusenpai route i dont know why but i cant wait for nanarus route no problems in sex life then sweetly smiling how can a character be so perfect and so deficient at the same time how can she be so good that you just want to throw her out to space and yet so awful that you just want to throw her out to space damn you kisu i think shinnas hair antenna i forgot the weeb name for it is in fact a diddly detector cuz she knew at first glance granted sister a sister b knew but they walked in shortly after the deed and would have to be idiots to not notice the smell right away i feel cara as the next chose is the most logical since her split is right when mahos start plus it feels right to finish this trio before moving on the sisters triangle so can i give suggestions for what order you should do the remaining routes in since weve seen the choice that led up to it id suggest doing cara next get all the love triangle route branches clear and after that either suzu or akane though those 2 will be a while later because you have to do the sister triangle route stuff first i love the reference made at 600 but i also like it because it sounds like the kind of nonsense she would make anyway even if it wasnt a reference scott ok maho get on the table ah yes more saxharder daddy wait what first wtf means the pones in the vagoo and like that were in alabama territory now xd finally almost caught up with the series only 10 more episodes to go which means i have to spend the rest of the week watching this worth it 2840 i heard the term funsized for girls like that xd 4656 i love lovecraft references scott how dare you betray the ultimate wingman suzu 010008 assassins freed if you do not want to labeled for copy write just give them goofy names xd suzu is so cute really both sisters are cute 1940 to quote super kami guru everybody needs a pooper thats why they invited you party pooper party pooper bosskwar listening to you say erogay in a spanish accent is 100x more hilarious than listening to you misspronounce it erojzuh d 5957 the spy everybody is country now i feel personally attacked it took 18 minutes and 17 seconds for akane best girl after suzu to appear in the episode what type of fuckery is this finally the sister route lol assassins freed i love this vn caesar is different from kaiser its pronounced more like seizure what incest marriage is legal in japan what happens when deadpool makes a vn part 32 cant wait for sweet home alabama 4642 was that a reference to strike the blood ah i remember the good old assassins freed back when it was just hidden tongs and throwing spatulas the following routes are a work of fiction do not attempt this in real life last episode only 20 minutes long this episode clocked at 1 hour and 10 minutes perfectly balanced as all things should be and so it begins the all important question in family bonding is it more immoral to diddly your stepsister or your bloodrelated sister goddamnitjapan 1733 love to see that ending first so excited for nanarus route i hope it doesnt disappoint us shiina is the queen of thicc it would be funny if he was like penis you fucking traitor xd can we get the 1st for maho today yet about the disclaimer at the beginning of the vn i actually thought up two theories pertaining to that and other vns that do the same thing theory 1 in the setting of the vns people start school 23 years later than they do in real life theory 2 in the setting of the vns theres a 3year school curriculum that occurs before high school and maybe middle school which ill call annex school meaning theres more grades to school just thought i could share this with you woooo time to watch mahos route a second time shiina no dont leave i need your weebishness to sustain me childhood friend not last for once hype for maho only 23 minutes of this videoi want refund now that the joke character is done i betcha that the h scenes are gonna be less funny maybe even close to creepy especially suzus route im just not into the whole incest thing sorry i do agree with comedy vnsroutes not knowing when to end or how but i definitely liked this route for its small punch of greatness all though the other routes do feel kind of different they definitely have their own greatness seeing maho next route us gonna put a knot in my panties man so used to seeing shiina lol but either way im hyped for next episode 306 that mutter made me laugh who needs tear jerking conflict when this route has been 100 pure unadulterated comedy shiina senpai was awesome and now mahou oh boss if you think the comedy will wane any now that shiinas route is over youre in for a pleasant surprise you couldve put this 23 mins 39 seconds in the previous video so this couldve been maho route right now shiinas route is definitely a like from me fourthwall breaking characters are always a favourite of mine eyyyy maho time shiinas route was funny af 1010 you know that feeling when you just opened a bag of lays and after a few seconds you already finished it and now youre just sitting there contemplating on what just happened no just me then i am shinnasans property i am her personal sex slave 1914 wow i never thought that shiinasenpai is an aggressive type best reaction are of prez akane senpai coward do the mini route first cause thatll be one ep only 220 does dr phil even solve visual novel couples problems the beach theme is really reminding of brazil second now i am so excited for mahos route another one shit im starting to think im not on youtube god this game just keeps getting funnier hey everyone comment down ur favourite since so far this series mine is drill sargent suzu people might think were banging lets do it mahoi guess im ok with that me its time 1703 or a shit bro plz do nanaru next also love your vids mate your hilarious hmmm why does the lead up to this h scene seem rather creepy than the shina one shinas first h scene build up seemed natural and funny this one seemed uncomfortable like she didnt want it that much or at least it seemed like it was rushed into it hey scott will you play this game when it launches httpswwwkickstartercomprojectsdevgrupmeinwaifuisthefuhreraparodyvisualnovel 2246 we should have her talk to tensai shiro maho lets wear our old uniforms me gulp kisu yeah you know whats going to happen 3 why are you here again 2258 who knows scott we might even see more interesting than a time machine on 20th september at area 51 i personally thought the diddly scene with maho wasnt as funny as scott described it with shiina probably cuz shes just bat shit insane although the aftermath scene was more cringy then funny also this game just dropped a god damn steinsgate reference im homeaho how mahony of these carrots can i have imaho so lonely without her wtf is wrong with sousuke first i love how sousuke is giving hscenes happening hints alabama lite xd the newest craft moonshine 4452 onii kiss is so damn great those siblings are so sweet to each other i never played a game with a greater appreciation of siblings love before the whole game can give you cavities i dont think its lewder than any other game its honestly more sweet than lewd it has 4 little sister but thats kinda the point so i hope youll give it a try after you finish this game or when you have the time and see how it is currently there is only one non commentary lets play on youtube and thats kinda sad maybe just play one route and see if the sweetness captivates you for the others damn nanaru was really sweaty this episode ill see myself out hey bosskwar are you sure you wanna dis alabama you have seen that bigass scythe she twirls around right and those thighs alabama lite has been achieved officially her normal temperature is 962 somebody take her to the hospital hyperthermia starts right below 97 degrees what was the point of cleaning herif he just dirtied her with diddly dirty boy so scott howd you like them inverted n you know nevermind 1013 a lot of dudes think with their penis seconds later 1022 id be okay with that now we know which camp you belong to xd oh yeah its only have been five hours since they confessed and they are already didlying this is vn in its purest form 1010 you would think that shiina with her fourth wall breaking mastery skills she could reprogram the game to get the legendary harem ending at any point in the game cuz i as hell couldnt find it in my play through or on the online guides oh boyage restricted ps harem fan disc pls spicy fufufu wow so there is a vn game where you have 4 sister routes and all are blood related 1526 thats was my reaction after watching the live action of death note first wow an hscene so fast guess incest is the wincest 000 so youre changing your channel name xd it is really hard to see such a noble and generally nice person fall so deep in such a short amount of time maho really needs to rethink her life choices if they lead her into a life full of criminal activity she would have such a bright future if she could just stop herself from being chased by the police the whole time its a shame really i hope she gets her act together again never gonna give you up and if you think this game is a shitshow as you put it you should be prepared for lamunation after i finished the first route in that it feels too me that it has sankakus humor but on drugs so you can just look forward to that i dont want to say too much about it beforehand i cried with katanagatari truly a masterpiece this is one of the few i actually just played one route on maho cant even start any of the others its impossible he got rejected by her in their middle school years and now she accepts him great character development im only here for the hscene awesome nice 7saeni oh i feel everyone that plays vn after all i already finished every route in this game 14314 anyone count how many times did shiina confess her feeling anddd he chose maho route heh then next time i want shiina route shiina route made me feel bad for maho so much mannnnnnn i love this vn mahoorouteeeeeeee man this episode hit a little too close to home for me you can say we witnessed a bootiful moment and so much laughter came about as a result i think we should do suzu route next since at least she tried good to know you think the h scenes are decent because there should be 3 more back to back this just gets better and really love how into it you got with showing the pain and anguish sosuke was feeling as their first time was being memed to hell and back there at the end melooks at title sees meat potato wut also meunderstands why meat potato precedes to lmfao for getting caughtyou will be wear a bag of shame 406 funny thing about that statement the full 9 yards statement thats actually a military term i dont remember which aircraft it was for i think it was the hellcat maybe the wildcat or even corsair i just remember it was for one of the navys fighterbomber planes from ww2 anyway the statement was coined because when you lined up the aircrafts full autocanon ammunition belt it turned out to be 9 yards long when they told you they needed you destroy something theyd tell you give em the full 9 yards pretty dark when you think about it lol 3126 you say youre not into ntr yet you gleefully did reikas route in ditzy demons its okay scott we wont kink shame you lel nice job i watched the h scene elsewhere its funny funny misshaps everywhere xd its always nice to wake up and start my day with some pretty damn funny stuff i was worried the whole stupidity after the first hscene mightve been cut off along with the rest glad it wasnt now im getting kinda pumped to see mahos route easily the second funniest after this one and even funnier at times 2635 my house with my parents and sisters in it what could go wrong 3430 this is surprisingly sweet huh 3742 this damn thought process and music xd 4134 well then good morning sister dearest xd 4056 eww 4102 oh god i forgot that was a thing 4408 oh for fs sake ya dun goofed xd 4718 the fuck momiji 4803 fucksakes xd 4840 what is this game xd usually sex stuff just makes me uncomfortable but for once i was busy laughing for most of it xd 4414 i am speechless scott get maya please i need help i struggle to breathe complaints can understandably be made that this came quick but i think that comedy gold after scene definitely makes it awesome scott you passed me again i havent been able to play because of tests but i am almost free the absolute madness of it all can someone even keep a straight face when playing through these looks at title ah shit here we go again bro how fucking awkward would id be if someone was in sousukes place holy shit the bteam had the right attitude about how to deal with these love struck idiots not too extreme as kicking them out for being lovely dovely normies or bomb bard them with random ass questions just ignore them until they catch the hint they dont give a shit about their love this vn game is so so good in comedy department i loveing this game so much and that after sex scenes was so so hilarious poor sousuke im actually fine not seeing that h scene what followed just made my day lmao also she looks cute as hell in that after diddly cg 4412 wow we can see shiinas butt and i like how sousuke is just waving finally the hscene has come but isnt this to fast to have a diddly after becoming a couple for 1 day i honeslty think youre trying to mess up my sleep schedule at this point lol is this the legendary mythical fifth base no it couldnt be its too early ten minutes later the fifth base is enlightening 2610 that is a nice wallpaper oh i forgot to ask sooner you gonna play ditzy demons sugoi ecchi if that gets released in our lifetime hey look another upload literally in early morning thanks scott i didnt need sleep anyways wow the afterevent doesnt dissappoint lmao mahos like dd from chrono clock the best wingman this is the golden episode first 1857 i would have a loved a harem ending than a sad maho face am i the only one who thinks suzu can be a little scary sometimes eeeeeyyyyyy finally caught up describing someone as camp is kinda saying that their a bit flamboyant or just plain gay im also really liking mahos teasing and she has a incredibly cute side of her as well im definitely enjoying her route is mahos va the same as azur lanes zuikaku i feel like theyre the same you dont simply throw the controller away wired ones are around 30 bucks and wireless around 50 plus battery packs another 20 dont throw money to the walls kids you know that maho knows that this a date she cand hide from it id never peep on some plainass ho like you killed me this shit is why i watch your vn playthroughs so scott about the routes order for this game remember when you said it was a good thing youre doing yuunas route last for mml because youd feel guilty doing the others routes after knowing about her circumstances well you might want to leave suzu for last in this game for somewhat similar reasons or not also a sky full of starstyle bullshit we need suzus route next campest or campiestmeans sassy gay how do you not know this mahos better when her tsukkomi tendencies mature ahhh almost there 5012 aww why did you end there cara just wanted sousuke to feed her 4344 is like the cutest laugh ever when the h seen starts you got a friend in me salutes for our dear comrade kisusenpai she sacrificed her dignity love and pride for the greater good godbless kisu and godbless america anyways maho my darlin that dress is drop dead gorgeous but im soooo more gorgeous than you are disclaimer its just a joke ohmy fracking god did you just call that maho moment right there with shiina sending maho and all thats amazing xd haha suzus inner yandere slipped out for a little bit as always im impressed by what things the japanese use english for such as dv 232 ahh what a sweet girl is suzu cant wait for her route suzu is an amalgamation of all the weird fetishes on the planet cockblocking one night ultimate wingwoman the next day shiina has the childhood friends wrapped around her eroge obsessed finger first glad to see kisusenpai as an ultimate wingman in mahos route the music is so calm and nice and thats what i like calm music you had a bad day you just listen did something bad calms you down i know i am months behind but for the sake of us all never do this voice again xd 1421 if nanaru likes deep mature voices then she should meet kratos 658 im sorry but did that motherfucker just say he mixes cereal female student b what she said sounded pretty pervy espacilly the part with white sticky fluids does anybody agree my friend got zhuge liang a ssr the best nonevent ssr on his first roll in fgo change the font back i cant read it i love how momiji cooks a huge dinner for the whole family and then the next morning its just fuckin c e r e a l i might be more of a capn crunch kinda guy but that shit is just too real whispers idle group of course they found the secret stash bro its like any other anime its like some girl comes back to the mc family and the other little sister doesnt like her its so funny to me idk why xd scott it because fruits is fucking delicious both i want both fruit and oranges please i think we may have fucked up holy fuck they are both alive holy shit akane is alive no dude i think is hell yess this is what i crave the decision doesnt matter in the common route there will be laughable decision for laughs when the decisions comes you now which to choose that will change the route instantly 4900 he be like excuse me what the fuck yaaaay thank you scott boss im loving this vn 3640 rapege you say hmm maybe we understand each other after all shiina glad scott enjoys this so much it get me excited more as well 3437 oh my god that cute innocent question asked without a ounce of scorn or distain take that you crazy fujoshis those are the kind of questions you dont have answers to nice one suzu 2300 i love when akane said brocon and nanaru is like why are you looking at me thats so funny xd i swear this game is so great btw nanarus voice actress is the same voice actress who is doing sachi in grisaia if you listen closely sometimes you can hear a little sachi out of here corn flakes is not hard everyone knows how to do it you take your yogurt and your corn flakes and mix them together scott idk mom and sister think some cars are cute shiinas dialogue in 3210 is a reference to fate more precisely carnival phantasm we have quite the cross section of characters for this series it might be hard to keep up with all of them as time goes by yes it back guys if u ever played doki doki lititure club doesnt the dad and momiji look like nauski and the main character but older 3015 read that as gangrene spelt as gangreen 3410 in before shes pegger xd 3445 your ship isnt canon is what she basically said to the fujoshi xd 4500 thats a character arc nani the fuck physical porn is huge in japan why i dont even know xd what madness is this is this game gonna be uploaded daily thats too good this will sound weird but im genuinely curious if akane has a route cause i support it and then kisu senpai route for the memes so scott while i wont spoil any of the choices ill try to explain the basic structure after the common route based on the choices youll either end up on the sister triangle route or love triangle route am i the only person who verbalises the triangle in the titles which branch off into the character routes the cara and akane routes are available on separate triangles so each triangle route splits into three character routes also cara and akane can probably be finished in a single episode because we dont need da porn on youtube i have only seen love live once all the way through but i think the pianist was the best i think her name was maki i know they explained earlier what happened to the a team of the manga research club but how can a school allow a club like the super glue club exist with such a suggestive description i love to see some shister fights my head hurts because of kisu senpai the jabs she gives in vns and games in general is both hilarious and scary she is just the best dont me i also like nanaru i really like her personality she is a bit of a tsun tsun so thats a minus but i really like her interactions with her brother it feels very natural and light hearted it doesnt feel forced guess i am one of the weird ones i do like realizing its a va ive heard before i find it fun nothing wrong either way i like this vn cuz of so many of the references of things so much cliche things 1010 kisu senpai route confirmed ps there many sides to suzu 1115 is she may part ii 4900 james charles be like the poster on the back has the blonde girl from kore wa zombie and the blue haired one is from dears if i aint wrong nani the fuck ah this vn is filled with so much jokes i am loving every bit of it and cara is still cute love her way of talking thanks scott for uploading new episodes so quickly i am loving this vn and still kisusenpai first man you are on the ball with these my favorite two are kisu shiina and nanaru nani the fuck d i just started playing this game today and there are some scenes i want to hear your reactions to because youre reactions are great the nani the fuck scene was one of them and the club introduction scene and ofcourse the scene at 4856 right on time i just finished watching ep 3 of this d suzys just such a sweetheart she wants to help the environment by saving water by taking a bath together 155 i think thats papishiachan swimsuit version so papishiachan is a cute loli prez has good tastes suzu the tryhard suzu is really desperate for you to do her route lol its kind of cute suzu going allout even though this isnt her route will nanaru be this bunkers in suzus route you can see a bit of nanarus nip through the towel in the hot spring cg just thought id warn you incase your didnt notice i hope we get a lot of nanaru on suzu route to make up for this otherwise imma be real mad damnit suzu damn suzu be sticking to her brother like glue suzus brocon tendencies have increased at this rate she might end up digging a knife on nanaru or any of the other girls or even force herself on her brother insert filthy frank meme its time to stop its time to stop okay no more who the fuck are your parents where are your parents im calling child protective services because its time to stop suzus overdoing it in nanarus route xd suzu with a ponytail and nanaru with her hair down looks awesome oh this cg has nanaru with a towel covering her front so we cant see them inverted n you know what never mind 1730 i like to think that mc actually says those dots 921 why does this remind me of when koharu hit toubu in the solar plexus and thought he caught a cold xd yas boy so cool 833 is that papishiasan on the prezs tshirt 433 destroyer sasagawa well it suits akane pretty well suzu trying to hijack the route but no youre too late girl when theres a yin there always be a yang while mr sousuke here is the luckiest bastard being with two lovely girls prez is like the unluckiest being in the world with two walking mass of muscle beside him akane did you say a 3 way with prez me uhhhhhh no i didnt even say that perfect thumbnail ignoring the love triangle troupe bs that occurs with that thumbnail its actually kind of fun to see the crazy antics that the b team gets into at summer comi in this side of the story i cant fucking stand watching prez when hes wearing something like that also nanaru with her hair down is hot i already know this is going to be fun again that is one hail of an opening by the gods i know im late to the party but with every new vn after i watch 3 episodes of bosskwar playing it i know if i want to play it myself or not nutaku take my money i want this right now and well i kind of get what the dad is trying to say but damn suzu is his own bloodrelated daughter all the talk about it wont work out if even one of the others has a problem is a bit idk i feel like normally youd prioritize her a bit more huhh now you got me curious about the story of your own mom normal sibling interaction at their age hey mom said to help me out with this why mom said just help no fuck you youre such an asshole retard mom said to help fucker too bad piss off kiss him not me is the anime you are talking about ive watched it and it is funny mom i can do nude edits even on your sister 3 me im interested note i joke about this and i have a step sister and no i wouldnt actually do that even though my step sister says i would 549 naniiiiii does not compute the anime youre remembering here is kiss him not me i know that weightloss scene xd real incest is wincest whats better than one potential insest route two potential insest routes i just finished the game last night leaving my favourite girl for last that being shiina shes definitely best girl also question would 47 411 be considered loli height cause thats the range shiina and cara fall into and the game refers to them as loli all the time milfiest milf milf of milfland i dont like shiina very much either i wonder why you think shes the most popular in my experience the most popular is nanaru by far is okay yuu we are here fandom unite suzu is the most polite character in the game shes like a canaden suzu is so god damn cute i just cant ahhhh daniel has died by cuteness guys im taller them all the girls in this game im 1686 cm nanaruexe has stop working probably for some people but not for me do i speak not the truth mountain doo is a very shity drink not nearly as good as drpepper and yes i learned the art of the smartass from my older sister so like what the fuck is up with that dad you see your daughter after so long and you dont have a thread of emotion for her youre straight up questioning her like shes some stranger and like she used to be your daughter like how friends become he used to be my friends at the end of the day shes still your blood and real daughter for fucks sake and i really feel bad for that girl she had to endure so much and there was no one really to lookout for her nanaru route please i already did maho wow youre fast i didnt even finish laughing yet from the part 2 nice and cara best heroine v 140 1849 this game and its copyright evasion xd 221 hot chocolate is my cup of tea 549 it took me a second shes a lot more adorable now 1628 she registers more in the child category for me 2704 i mean i started to be interested in girls after my brother did but hes way younger than me xd 3158 vn ops keep getting better huh 4851 what what is this game xd 5108 i think momiji is my favorite xd shes like the lynn of this game its great xd second is prolly nanaru after that as you can have a conversation with her about anything and shell just roll with it plus her face xd and i like akanes design and attitude its not a love triangle btw im really not understanding the deal with suzu i mean after their moms death wouldnt custody have gone to her father not her grandmother is that not how custody works has anyone else noticed the dog and cat on the shelf in the clubroom this is awesome cant wait for the next ep this is a good visual novel to watch after starnova and so far it is a good strait to the point visual novel i like it 1028 this songs fucking great kiss him not me is the anime you were talking about right where the girl loses all that weight one of my favorites i like this game as well did you know most heart attacks happen on a monday 550 she has eyes pretty green ones too 635 here we go again with cute i cant handle httpsloopvideoscom73s6cs7gidqfrom394to396 935 pick caras route first i cant take it any more xd 1239 i wanna scream so badly right now 1640 one that aint loli and two that reference though or the love triangle means one girl with anotherimagine the combinations i think kisu shiina is nuts and she bugs me and it is one route i probably will not do i like how suzu calls him niisan while nanaru calls him oniichan i already like the 2 sister characters i wonder which one of them exactly is the younger sister and which the older and will the younger sister call the older one oneechan later on or will they stick by their first names anyway little sister ftw my favs are nanaru and maho definetly want to know more about that rejection story this protagonist has a real feeling to him he is not a shy and unsociable idiot he says what he thinks and is not dense like other vn characters its a ramune popsicle japan is big on their ramume soda it taste like lemonade nanaru or shiina route scott dont disappoint us i seriously didnt recognise that it was cara when she first showed up as always i kept my eyes closed during the opening to not get spoiled by future events i just listened to the song so i also had to mute what you were saying right after the opening all i can say is that up till now i like the 2 little sisters the most im curious how its going to turn out and that reunion made me really happy i felt for them 3141 great now i got that initial d song stuck in my head again thanks scott 005 ah no not for me she is a crazy stalker and i dont like stalkers the sisters are clearly the best and they also got the most exposure they seem like the main characters till this point 4933 oh poor yuu but i love momiji she is the best mom you can have im just gonna say it theres basically 2 love triangels in this game based on what route your on sister route or love route edit damn it he addresed it in the vudeo all i thought of during that popsicle scene between nanaru and sosuke was wow nanaru has some thicc thighs my guy thicc thighs save lives and will surely lead to no mans demise im with nanaru im not really a person who can just accept someone yeaah its ok but the feeling of uneasiness plus the feeling that youre the only one that doesnt accept a person makes you feel and look bad im glad right now but i am uncomfortable thats what i felt when mom introduce her new boyfriend my sister and brother arent really uncomfortable but me eeeeeeeeeh nani the fuck i played the game cough and i say some good ol references ps kisu senpai best senpai xd people get offended when you talk about losing weight but its honestly just better for you you feel better and are overall healthier and nobody has a reason to make fun of your weight i lost 60 pounds in the past year and ive never felt better fatshaming is bad but it should be known that being overweight is not healthy after a certain point 2530 that expression change loving nanarusousuke moments the return of old little sister and an unknown magical transformation before that we finally have all the pieces together for another great love comedy lets a go hmmmm welp i bought this vn because i needed it 555 cara lookin cute and acting cute imma just say i felt really awkward with the reunion with suzu dont know whyi do know why this is srate game 2003 ahh that cat face i want to beat her but she is so kawaiiiiiii cara is the cutest i dont know why but suzus appearance make me feel a little uncomfortable momiji is probebly my favorit mom character so far the mom from saku saku was also nice but being your teacher as well is kinda akward damn that game to that step the sister is blood related step im horrified just thinking about it nanaru is my favorite kisusenpai routes first scott please im right about cara scoot hell yeah thanks for the quick upload lets go kisu shiina this was quite the journey of a route that ended up getting right into the point at least the sub route is over the real meat of the game is in nanarus and suzus route its incest routes time for scot didnt you say that you hated than you hate when games remove all characters when entering a route also this ep was so sort you could prolly have combined it with the previous one also why even bother making videos age restricted you dont include the h scenes for everyone reading including scot caras route was too short had 2 h scenes if i recall correctly didnt have cara speak in her true accent at all and was way to rushed in general hope nanarus route is as good as i imagine it oh man cant wait for suzu route honestly she moved up in my list with her hilarious antics and comments also incest is wincest dorky cara is loveable oara xd 400 or unless it is a hentai we must get rid of the thot shouldnt akane be last since she hijacks suzus route also if i remember correctly her route is a little shorte than caras so its definitely possible to oneshot it sausage is amazing bosskwarscotscooter 2019 was caras route interesting yes cuz we got to know her character a little more not sure what nationality cara is though was there a good story oh god no its literally diddly with historical humor and you know what thats ok but hey now we can finally move on to the long waited sister love triangle oh boi realfake incest god help us sister triangle time some hypothetical dude so whats the best vn in the history of mankind me do you have 20 minutes so these sub routes are really short 1649 fucking kirby xdddd shiina everywhere majima can learn from her the power of love is bullshit the power of swords and violence is wat u want i know its late but i feel like shiina is the developers laughing stock i think im akane if im looking at my personality i love snacks i love bl i have green hair what is this game and why do i love it the sister was offering her butthole to you so go for it i say ok fuck that as soon as you lie like that and try to get me in shit like that its over your chances with me become negative the way she is breaking the 4th wall is cringey just make a vid on every route give the people what they want scott whats the upload schedule for this vn omg this is sooo good theres literally not a single character i hate so far the writing is actually really good its just fantastic holy s kisu shiina thanks for the details but that is alot to remember i like you high spirited personality and voice actress is awesome i think i would like her route i am not going to lie i usually do not like imouto anime or in vn but i actually like this sister and shiina is cute dude please give me more time between your videos so i can watch them all i m afraid i spent the past nights catching up on every single one also im pretty sure senpais name is a play on kiss scene this is a woman on drugs and this is a sempai on love shiina breaking the forth wall for love ohhhh boy this is crazy really crazy like fureraba and i like it p shinna sounds like she is going to be one gigantic meme machine and i love it stfu everyone will heard you and im not ready to die guys she is deadpool im going to whop there asses im watching is in my diy clothes for school ohno this is going to be doki doki literature club all over again isnt it if you dont shines route then we are all doomed there needs to be more of this fourth wall break incarnate a lot of you will probably hate me for this but i gotta say it this isnt a love triangle its more of a love pentagon a love triangle is 3 people like a triangle that has 3 sides and 3 angles but since there are 4 girls and 1 boy it makes 5 people which would make it a love pentagon since it has 5 sides and 5 angles this game what is this game 410 what is even going on 420 screenshot it boss 508 i cant that was too cute xd httpsloopvideoscomklxwmnjukoqfrom308to310 2418 uhh sir i think the correct word is pervert wtf does this game even have a fourth wall shiinas route first d hands down shiina is best girl okay so this episode we have a crazy girl and she is great we also have a dying cara maho hating on big breasts and a great face from nanaru scott i have a feeling how youre going to go for ahem repeat of cronoclock okay from what i am guessing and mind you this is a guess those 10 things under routes could mean branching story like maybe love route is maho and shiina while sisters route is a branching path for the step sister and blood sister so insted of uh wich save was related to choosing spesific route i want to try next you have an active filter damn i have to be the only person who finds shiina annoying after a certain point lol but at least she provides quite a bit of humor xd the introduction of kisusenpai without a doubt the best character in this vn in my opinion love the 4th wall breaking first choice picking a possible stalker as a first route could never end bad right right 3243 again a reference to the movie 5 centimeters per second i love kisusenpai 3032 aww that cat face and i am loving kisusenpai please do her route first scott shiina is deadpool then 1010 fun fact kisu senpai breaks the fourth wall while in her h sceneso ya lmao xd ps not 100 confirmed that happens lol pps that movie reference thou 3241 346 what a cute 4th wall break shiina was only in the video for like 5 minutes and shes instantly best girl its over i already saw the one i like the freaking pervert fourth wall breaking love at first sight megaphone mouthed hyperactive senpai the perfect girl for me our sister is a nerd too she like fantasy actions and she will arrive at next vid right retreat retreat she over 10000 i maybe jumping gun here but i think we immediately found priority 1 with shiinasenpai here hyperactive stalker love at first sight giving off the pure crazy vibes in her introduction all scream pick me first scott 3029 oh my god that faaace xdd cara going to lose her weight and we didnt recognize her at all so i actually wasnt planning on playing this because of exam season and by the premise it didnt sound that interesting to me but after watching the first part of your lp i loved it and now im like 8 hours into it xd its been really great all the way through and i cant wait for your reactions to some scenes the first route is always the easiest no matter what happens tbh in the second and so forth you remember the other routes and know what kind of future and happiness you could have had still nothing beats amagami ss in this aspect it purposefully shows you the other girls to make you feel the pain this vn is a special cause because of the triangle damn wowi didnt notice this episode was updamn i thought scott didnt uploaded episode at all ps its no fun playing games on mobile their screen is just too smol rather getting a bigger mobile just get a pc or a laptop which run good quality game monkas play more love triangle trouble the good thing about this game is that there are no scenes that are the exact same on the other routes once youve decided on doing mahos route then everything from there to the end are exclusively on her route only one good example is the night at the hotel here 1810 did sousuke seriously do a grisaia reference on us xd bruh we have to do suzus route next just because of that sister punch im still laughing how can an unfortunate random comment ruin a confession like this ugh this goes to show that although friends are nice they can be a pain in the ass at the worst of times lets go mahos route d edit dang that backstory though finally some good childhood friend romance brethren careful scott cara might highjack this route yet if you were the ones who decided what maho gets to cosplay as what would it be bruh cara be faking her accent im done i forgot how much kisusenpai has evolved since this part of the series kisu senpai still is socially awkward in this episode compared to the end of her route honestly kind of makes me sad who else is also excited for mahos cosplay for the next episode wait thats it felt like a really short episode whens the next one i already feel bad owwww i got ptsd from this being rejected by your best friend i know that feeling all to well that herts way more than it should thats what she said ghost paranormal activity as scary stories nah retirement aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh new heroine same great wacky comedy lets a go long live princess cara oh yeah were doing maho well time to learn what happened in the deep dark past i like the video so since youve unlocked the extras section i want to mention that mahos theme is called friend zone edit damn i forgot how long this section was before the next choice oh well still allows me to comment requesting you to ntr the maho fans for a bit longer when the next choice comes up maybe one or two more parts before fully starting on it xd its your choice do what you want 350 well for your information maho guys dont buy porn but they watch porn online 2107 i almost completely forgot about that childhood friend route woohoo oh no scott hates us awwwww the humanity finally mahos route my favourite because the relationship is the one that feels most natural out all of them first so excited for mahos route 610 again i have to ask what is this game oh shit i forgot he was going to do kisusenpais route shiina really is super busty im actually laughing so hard at the crossdressing comment about maho maho which sounds close enough to mayochiki the anime about the crossdressing butler ooh good times 1404 btw it says cara on her school swimsuit 3902 yeah 1000 i want kisusenpai to greet me 2245 for some reason the background music reminds me of brazil andl loved the beach episode maho and kisusenpai had the best swimsuits 1540 thats going to be a nice wallpaper 1553 that one is even better 918 glad that prez is still hilarious as ever which friends route should scott do first like for kisusenpai comment for maho you accidentally chose 3 options for sempais route congratulations go back to ep 2 if you want to know what im talking about he best do kisu or i will abuse scott bruh the options towards the end made me rofl i like your voice and reactions dude it makes everything more cool yeah lets start off with 4th wall break senpai she kinda reminds me of neptune but with an actual body to flaunt hey at least she knows what she wants hey scott you are picking all shiina choices it is meant to be souske x scott man made match in heaven ultimategurupowers akane has the right attitude try to get away with as much shit as possible on purpose also you broke the video at a terrible point boss there was this sweet talk with shiina and the very next scene would send it crashing down in flames hilariously you should have cut it like five minutes later for maximum effect cakemonogatari really xdd this vn gets better every episode xd ok so if the manager is praising the anime of two punch man then we can establish that this game takes place in 2015 cuz we all know that s2 cant hold jack shit to s1 and the brilliant work of angryhome lol yes finally a day without updates for this channel is torture scott got me hooked fuck i really like kisu but i think maho is a bit underrated shes very reliable and literally comes to the mc aid when he needs it not to mention they have a deep connection i wanna see that route for sure i got on shiinas route the only thing i will say is that shes still shiina atleast where im at i think i passed out near the end of the episode the comedy made my head go to space and meet the last remnant of a lost civilization and that last you are my crush after all line struck me like my dad hitting me with a bamboo stick when i was little uhhhhhhh i think i blacked out ten seconds ago he literally picked every option kisu told him to when she said how to get on her route scott you better pick kisu senpai route or i will find you and i will kill you lol i cord not stop lol ok now i mite get this game i like akanes swimwear the most tbh pls do mahos route first pretty pls lol finally something to soothe my nerves 2711 the cement how i love maho route i wished it longer when i finished it too hes honest about wanting to fuck full points in my book for that cant be helped its kinda like we men are partially programmed that way can fight your genetics fucking hilarious dialogue im done everyone boss so cara next do the sisters route scott boss and pls do more vids per week only 1 is too much wait pls pls pls i agree to do cara next especially if you wanna do suzu last then akane can be the last one of all and the order will the same for both triangles since cara hijacks mahos route and akane hijacks suzus its not all diddly for cara and akane its bl and cosplay too lol but seriously i wouldnt mind seeing them first or at least caras first how is a love hotel something cheep isnt it the opposite of an idea for a cheep gift oh well at least she looks good before the diddly i suppose lol 051 omg thats literaly my mum but she jokes about it instead of getting argry mahos really cute i dont care which one you do first i like both sisters i am excited to see which one and what is everyones reaction im actually in the middle of caras route myself and if you take out diddly scenes you might be able to finish it in probably 2 or 3 episodes i think it only matters if you want to see what their characters are like in a dating environment scott yeah im cool with that cara next then nanaru then suzu and lastly akane yeah tho the question is how long is their route without the h scenes and can they be done in one lets play part oh well i like mahos route but i cant wait to get started on nanarus route and this is coming from the guy who gets kinda awakward around these sister routes guess it goes to show these characters are truly something else and well crafted milf route oh i meancough mom route monkasfan disc where ya at xd bonus she got the level 5 badge on steam lmao there funny disappointing at the same time lol i feel the sub routes are worth doing well at least akane is but if you do one you have to do the other id say go for it you did the ditzy demons routes after all xd as for the sister triangle routes my recommended order is suzu akane then nanaru suzu i feel is a lot better on the routes outside her own sweet endings are soo good id go one triangle first the extra girl in it and sister triangle later i dont know why but for some fcking reason i thought they are going to kisu senpais house i think i need a doctor but anywho i like that its not as funny as kisus but i like it sooooooooo cara time right i cant i cant anymore this game is too damn funny for its own good that ending as sweet as it is had me not only laughing at the random ass anime name drops but question why they picked those particular shows for the jokes i mean one piece dbz eva pokemon gintama through out the common route i understand for their popularity but gundam ibo s2 and drifters is so absurd the only thing that makes sense is that the developers picked shows that specifically were released in the fall 16 season just to establish an in game timeline god damn this game is funny af akina route when you do the sisters which sisters route do you want scott to do next like for suzu comment for nanaru or the bonus caras route first first awww mahos route also ended urrgh these two imoutos are annoying then im quitting the game then alt f4 1533 1545 that part had me laughing so hard that i played it back a couple of times xd 2355 is to funny but yeah your other ending had a good deal of zing to it this one seems a bit more tame personally naked girls is the best way to get my attention xd why are you playing eroge with her because hes a man of culture loving this new series so far so lets see where this goes oh my god kisusempai is literally the best god anytime one of her scenes appear it never fails to make me laugh shiina a true cultured woman honestly i only did shiina route so far but i think the hscenes are worth reading its not filled with moaning for all of the dialouge as for other routes i have no idea you should play the vn called sickness what is legedo suppose to be munchyroll sounds like it should be a crunchyroll for pothead movies man all chars are amazing thank you scott boss for the best vn 2951 i still like that we have a face and also that suzu has the same eye colour like us 4217 yes maho finally someone is putting that crazy girl in place i like how she stepped up for him 4324 yeah fuck off shiina hscenes are important for the bonding of characters so i dont agree on cutting them out only during those private moments you see sides of characters you wouldnt normally see just like in real life 3843 yes those fucking all ages version get shit on thats why i will never touch any of them the dialogue changes the obvious cuts how can anyone like that 3627 america and youtube is getting called out there xd i like it 2115 sasuga imouto sisterly power yes they are getting there i like fucking romantic comedies i dont know how my friends at school found out about but im pretty sad that they found out someone please help me why am i not getting notifications for this one i am for everything else kinda wish you go with maho first and then shiina her route is really sweet i think shiina is too pushy and she bugs me to no end is this going to be daily i watched so much moe anime that i became moe bosskwar upload an hour long episode 23 times per day swears and doesnt feign happiness like most youtubers in 2019im so happy i searched for the gameplay for this game there playing a visual novel in a visual novel and then had a argument about porn i love this gamealso sousuke has some good taste in women twin tails are a gift from heaven fucking shiina playing her eroge in the club room next episode its maho time at the arcade xd why not go at a double date at the arcade with maho and shiina xdd idk if anyone has pointed this out yet but in the background the cat and dog plushies are having the diddly you can see it closer in the cg with kisusenpai you are not locked in shiinas route yet the next choice however will split you into two possible paths each of those contain two main routes and a miniroute cara akane if you want to know more details like which characters appear in a path together or the consequences of choices since they are pretty tricky and misleading just ask me i will not tell you if you dont want to honestly you might like the hscenes in this game they hold the comedy back a little but dont completely remove it and its great also theyre not the 30 minute power points like most eroge so it doesnt even take that long 3005 aww i love that face 3040 and this one is even better 3154 she sure loves harem kisusenpai best girl this is whole rivalry of who is the better little sister is too much for me just have the two pull a king solomon and split poor sousuke in two down the middle and be done with this already 39083922 reminds of the vn translation provider moenovel with the debacle that is if my heart had wings especially amanes route oh boy one of the greatest vn community discussions i ever read thanks for the fan translators and their patches though it got better also 4326 childhood friend romance enthusiast here woohoo oh sousuke is the best vn mc ever nanaru and lewd senpai are best my personal waifu ranking so far maho nanaru shiina cara suzu akane the real number one though of course is prez 1311 ahh sousuke you lucky bastard you have a girl that likes erogames i also want a kisusenpai in my life as well 1354 and cara is as cute as ever please kisusenpai first scott so most probably idola can be love live or the idolmster legedo is most probably tengen toppa gurren lagann wow i never knew that talking about sex can be so deep get it pfffffffffffffft i wanna die 345 why does suzus boobs shrink while nanarus boobs look more bigger than usual 4min in and we are already fucked this is going to be a good episode hey guys how are you doing so do you know what route youll be starting doing also keep up the great work kinda loving maho personality tbh and suzu as well sup fuckers im second it says so weird that all but this one seems legit that classmate reminds me of ninja cat or ninjapoes wait the minute this aint twitch haha 118 damnit bossky nyan xd 407 yeah so can i xd 827 huh 1729 oh yeah the talk 2244 i love it when you do the dumb commenter voice xd as for voice actresses its nice to know theyre getting work but thats about it for me 3218 me too its adorable 4037 cries in back pain xd 4113 she seems about normally dressed less frilly 150 scottexe has encountered a problem and is nolonger responsive press ok to terminate the process or cancel to wait for the program to respond she might be your sister scott but she is still a girl actually i was kinda thinking i only have a brother but if someone would ask me if i could fall in love with my brother my first immediate answer would be no cause im not gay it wouldnt be no cause he is my brother that would only be my second thought so does that mean that if i had a sister i would have said no because she is not my type and only my second thought would be that she is my sister or would that be reversed i will never know since i dont have one but it is interesting thinking about after last weeks painfully short episode i hoped for an at least 3 hours long episode but my hopes were brutally crushed 3223 i like how mom and nanaru have the exact same eyes welcome to hell bitch do you plan on staying or are you just visiting the cat talk between classmate a naru was so hilarious ohhh classmate a wanted to be the main heroine these sad sad spriteless losers they really think they can achieve main heroine status or date a box cover heroine that easily come back when the sequel or fan disk gets announce and then well talk animation is good just because of what can be done with it i kinda disliked the new vivzie pop pilots but god were they pretty i know im probably the biggest offender of hey scott guess whos voicing this character and the actor choice does influence my fave character rating but its minor enough that i can say i agree judge on the character 2400 me when i found that they were airing promare at more than just the one cinema in perth i think candy bar is the word youre looking for also anyone else here hate popcorn hell i hate snacking in general but anyone dislike popcorn specifically 3900 theres a local brewery i went to a few months back and i tried some of their experimental beers one of which was supposed to be amchoor indian sour dried mango essentially and sencha flavoured kinda a disgusting combination especially for a beer in all honesty but hey same ingredients as tea i suppose made in abyss is coming with a movie i am like so excited made in abyss is like my fav fantasy anime man anyway nanaru you get 5 points respect respect for nanaru this took awhile it seemed im just taking a quick look at the background but is their school just one massive fuck off hallway i honestly cant tell if or when the building gets thicker 720 well this is awkward 2057 every part of my existence is screaming maia and saki and i love it prez how do you know about the current status of america xd 1018 sometimes i wish we played as the character like prez the one who isnt a part of this madness most of the time and just a spectator who tries to comprehend what the fuck is even going on i will agree that this is the funniest vn that has ever been made kuddos to the writers they take the 4th wall seriousness and comedy and put it in a blender on high and sees what comes out any one else love how they keep breaking the fourth wall i have to say the nanaru is my favorite route so far but i will love suzu the most i am sure suzu is so great 2959 500kg is 110231lbs or about half a metric or us ton 004 the sad huh xd 400 id be down for that in this game itd prolly be the everyones happy route 628 damnit kisu xd 727 hold the f on how the f is this game this topical xd you started playing this in june hes only getting impeached now 1009 damnit sisters xd 1237 this is why i watch you all the random stuff you add xd 1429 more than one waifu will ruin your laifu 1742 yup lynn and i are basically just flatmates that cuddle on the sofa and watch visual novels on youtube xd 2336 nanaru the f xd 2435 youve got to talk about these things in a relationship bosskys life advice xd 2640 fing hell nanaru xd 3128 yuuji no xd 4447 luke i am your oneechan xd 4654 yeah it really seems to nail it 720 um is this a new game like released in a 4 year time period 1245 oh no xd 2100 god i hate those things nanaru is there a harme route in the end cuz i havent played all of the routes yet lmao xd ps nanaru gonna be best girl in suzus routewait she cant be best girl when your going out with suzu or could she monkas man i love this game and its stupidity lol oh my god the sprites are so much brighter its like im watching an entirely new game hooray for new computer on that note this game was released back in october 2016 which means that the devs must have known that when a certain someone won an election of a certain country that the person in question would be on the verge of impeachment at some point and look at whats happening now in that certain country thats not meta 4th wall breaking people thats god damn premonition best joke of the game and top contender for vn of the year i hate you shiina i hate you so much godammit my head hurts and my stomach hurts because of you course you your jokes and your fourth wall breaking waves at kisu feel free to step past the 4th wall anytime 3 253 no matter what happens we all know why shiina is best girl for this game xd 721 fuck me i forgot that was a thing its been so long since i finished this game god dammit suzu making me burst out laughing literally one in the morning to almost get caught by my dad watching scott video this is why i love suzu edit then to only get combo on by shiina god damn it it not even her route and she still hella funny when akane goes full bl mode insert persona 4 boss music she is the true self xd i havent finished any of the routes yet but the shiina route is definitely a fun one so far the first time i ever seen a rickroll in a current game and its so hilarious im dying of laughter the references were real this episode xd best episode just because of the rick roll this game has just become godteir the choice you picked is one of the main ones that could lead you to the love routeaka maho and kisu senpai are you going with that route or change it later never gonna give you up but kisu and nanaru are best with suzu alright behind just love on all the girls except akane i couldnt picture myself in a relationship that is only interested in bl one wordshiina i was going to comment about the rick roll but everyone beat me to it 4647 we just got rick rolled the memories xd how can you get rickrolld and not love it when its made like this xddd id have loved to have the song in the outro xd 4648 and there kisusenpai actually gave the right answer suzu wanted to hear from her brother 1504 can meme suzus into that nani meme with this and send it to me 1056 ez just buy ice cream always works for anything wait isnt that a rule of the internet already if it is animate exists it can be made gay legends of the hidden temple nick arcade guts all of the great kids game shows wish they were still around also 4645 is the beginning of the rick astley rick roll i didnt expect to get rickrolled today much less by a visual novel what has life come to the best part of this particular playthrough is scotts reaction to all the hilarious shit ensuing too bad hell have to skip the hscenes some of them are the funniest parts of this game 4526 so just getting over it and giving up is the right thing to do scott scott you have played too many vn to know that giving up is never an option even kisusenpai knows that and i dont want to agree with her 4540 funny how this response totally contradicts his canon thoughts he had before on how he needs to cheer her up no matter what so you really want to avoid the sister route first right i cant believe we got rick rolled i am just speechless 040 nanaru is the only one being a wingman here xd this is also after shiina was getting grilled for her behavior earlier so what was the point if they are just gonna drown her out 3715 oh god thats old xd holy shit i used to watch legends of the hidden temple too back in the day that was the shit man 4318 thats actually an interesting question what if maho had a male body but was female inside would that be considered bl so according to akana it would hm interesting 1734 thats the kind of understanding sister everyone of us wants to have good one nanaru yes there will be something with maho though it has to be certain action well descion and i think you might liked it but i prob gonna guess you might be doing kisusenpai first which i dont mind since youll be doing them allll around 200 when you ohohoed you sounded like the the look at this duuuuu dude no matter how mean its still gonna fet us to kisus route i never thought id see the day where id be rick rolled in an eroge of all the times i avoiding getting rickrolled then blam a rickroll on this vn im dead no one expects the rick roll in 2019 especially not from a vn xd 1st route kisu senpai 2nd route suzus then you can pick what ever after these two d i just got rickrolled by a visual novel what is my life lmao damnit even in vn you can never escape the rick roll omg legends of the hidden temple was the shit back in the day haha xd watched that too hahaha legends of the hidden temple xd i hate and love kisu senpai uuuuuuuuuuugh that rick astley made me cry out of laughter i feel light headed i hate her because i like her so much dammit scott i need to study for my test but i cant when you upload videos because i need to watch them this is a fact i need to watch these videos 1815 is that a dog or a fox on akanes dress and i liked casual outfit of cara maho as well i would love to have an animestop in my town all i got are a lousy gamestop best buy 1537 ahh hentai kisu strike again and love the sailor outfit of kisusenpai 1503 mission find the anime dvd so that i can get headpets from niisan 1015 aww club prez 1020 poor club prez a gacha 10 roll where i get shit all whats a gacha anyway 746 that dvd angel is so funny 152 aww cara is the best speaking girl of the club really cant wait for her route 113 aww poor prez why hasnt this perfect man got a girlfriend yet 4539 i love how bosskwar become a lazy old man first the suzu thumbnail is so cute anybody here after watching lost pauses newest episode in this series on this visual novel shiina is the shit honestly shes too good this is too damn cute ahhh feels bad i already watched a 12h stream of shiinas route shiina route hmmmmmm this will be interesting thats the only thing i didnt like about this vn is feeling bad for the other girl im surprised this dating sim has vc big step up from a lot of others as an old person who watches animenot a weeb or even an otaku just watching anime as a time waster theres something oddly satisfying about characters talking about sex casually japan seems to think sex is like a forbidden ritual or sth 1704 because its enticing and everyone secretly or not likes it no matter how much you want to say no in the end true love wins a forbidden seal has broken brace yourself lad its not karaaaaaaaaaage its karagay its basically japanese fried chicken not to be confused with kfc though is it too late to abort the route lol i just noticed the three videos scott uploaded of this current time right now have thumbnail that entails something lewd in it it was a long road but we finally reached true sweet home alabama sweeet hooommmeee alaaabamaaaa shits wild boys 4038 in the first age in the first battle when the shadows first lengthened having seen nanarus route she has no place to talk about things going fast alot was happening but all they really could do was say each others names and state the obvious like i am having sex with you i think they got married or at least engaged at some point i forgot this would be picked up back here we started this really fast and heavy uncomfortable time its uncomfortable time me im so uncomfortable evil me me too i know were weird but good me yeah finally alabama is here minasan at im first and i thougth i was socially awkward but suzu we cant think of ideas on empty stomach i love this vn they all roast each other just like me and my friends would with just the right amount of memes sprinkled in 2945 was that a jojo reference 4230 that would be eroge h mo game mo kaihatsu zanmai feed the chungus lol i am telling you kisu senpai best girl hands down i just love how she has no shame and im not even sure we have seen all of her sides yet i want to get off this wild ride why cant people be like shiina wait wait wait a god damn second here is the prezs name a mother fucking jojo reference cuz part 3 is one of the best parts of jojo and i seriously doubt you wouldnt use one of the crusaders name for a random ass joke if you had no attention in making a jojo reference 4250 bruh sousuke is not a normie light novel protagonist though shiina hes a chad visual novel protagonist 1930 funniest moment of this episode cant wait for the next episode lmao some surprise is coming your way scott monkas big titty loli senpai girlfriend thats a unique name of kisusenpai i gotta say thumbnail of this episode is hilarious your my fav content creator bosskwar for doing all the routes 3 scott with the classy thumbnailsasking youtube to demonetizationbut you give zero fucks imma right or am i right lol i am just loving this freaking girl its not the funny stuff that gets me with her while they are fcking excellent the small talks hit me hard the most she is just so honest and straightforward i really like that aspect to characters the i dont give a fck about what you think of me characters are the ones that always gets me i love being the first person to see a vid xd nani this get to crazy and same time they think money can buy doujin nope they will reject well i like drawing if they ask me like that i might reject i am here for the anime titties 533 ah yes the ditzy demons approach or as shiina aptly put it herself the nukige approach i completely forgot the ahegao sticker aaaaahahahaha my god that thumbnail xd pls make a pornhub account and post it there for uncensored what the actual fuck am i looking at im here watching fureraba friend to lover and about to finish senpais route and then i see the notification and seen the thumbnail i need healing but still nice how long his her route why so early in the morning we need to do something free how about we buy some fireworks everyone is acting like it fucking doomsday le oof my penis can only get sooo erect 1334 we have found a translator for jbubs and then scott did mahos route last because he cant help but avoid childhood friends like theyre some kind of diseased animal another vn which has a common route focused on your group of friends is majikoi its seriously great cant wait to see all these routesbut senpai will have the best routeim sure damn so the fan disk will probably have all the girls doing the dirty with mc at the same time oh boy i hate to say this because i love maho but i think you do her last her route when you can literally having sandwich between the 2 in the game 4240 this game should never call cara a loli again alright boys we did it mahos route is no more as much as i love this vn its a first for me in that i absolutely love the story but im just okay on all the characters with only nanaru starting to rub me the wrong way me sees that thumbnail okay so shiinas route i am gonna get the sad again wel not really sad but kind of sad tbh we had to choose kisu senpai she gave us her guide to her route prezs waifu choice has me worried then again it did say earlier when cara lost all the weight that he liked lolis so how about this scott you do all the route simultaneously then no one will complain lmao xd oh you got the 18 patch lol thats why there was a panty shot 1820 d 455 dayum scott you got some weird tastes there makes the prezs shirt look tame in comparison lulz well scott if you appreciate the common route being about a group of friends rather than the mc exclusively maybe you should try majikoi that games a true classic by now i also love how this entire game until now has been about the group as a whole instead of just a few focus characters wishing it to stay that way even when we get further down each individual route sees thumbnail me definitely didnt see that on mahos route no need to look what route he went lol anyways i respect ur choice hahaha but after playing mahos route i kinda feel guilty if i watch a shiina playthrough oof do all of the routes reeeeeeeeeeee how dare you not pick maho im triggered reeeeeeeeee as fun as comiket would be its wo doubt an otaku war zone one wrong move and you could get trampled alive before even entering the building thats why theres so much security and safety processors in these convictions each year that beach scene was so beautiful hope to see more that scenes later in the game as well yessss its shiinas routeget fucked maho scott thank you for this gift i am gonna cry so i didnt want to make any decision spoilers but while yes all of the choices you made are exactly what shiina spoiled at the beginning besides a few in the common route the only ones that actually matter in the love triangle route is this one and to get onto the sub route for this one you have to pick maho after which youll get another decision which is another blatant which cgs you want decision so yes you couldve done whatever you were always technically equal parts on maho and shiina xd 3212 speaking of fandisc when will you play the fandisc of a sky full of stars 2133 i have got a miniharem here wtf is even a miniharem 947 aww she is so considerate to buy us an eroge game i am glad you choose kisusenpais route first loli rape doujin is that legal 128 prezs tshirt is hilarious and so cute second seeing the thumbnail oh you sousuke lucky son of a bitch sees thumbnail yes 1206 as a british person i feel like the game roasted us good here lol 5144 not a lesbianyet maybe in the fan disc lmao 340 suzu trying to teach nanaru be like httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvh5kz4uiuc0 3939 you think needles going up into your fingernails is bad an old torture technique was locking a persons wrists hands and fingers to a table then take fishhooks and get them caught where the nail meets the pad of each finger and thumbs then tie fishing line to each hook and then tie the other ends to a large but thin plastic bottle being supported by a pulley then slowly let water drip into the bottle until the fishhooks slowly rip their fingernails off and theyre forced to suffer through and watch it happen i cant remember which country likes doing that for interrogations but i think its one of the far east ones excluding japan and south korea needless to say you catch wind of some pretty fucked up shit when you serve in the military for long enough for momoji not only would i cuck dad id even let him watch suzu deserves more hugs so glad we are exploring more of her character 052 shes still broken xd 523 this is really getting too much suzus pretty much doing everything but bringing in money now 1157 damnit that one killed me xd 1326 momiji is best girl xd shes the only one id prolly date irl id love to see something focused on her but id feel bad for yuu if he got kicked out 1510 it feels like shes put a debt over everyones heads 2413 the family has so many screws loose the house was littered them but now its suzus route shes cleaned them all up so no ones going normal xd 2459 that sums it up perfectly 3338 maho you have a gift xd 3853 thats just an insult 4908 when someone tells you youre a 14 of a century old and 13 of your life has passed man i swear the relationship between these sisters is so great i love it 2247 yeah you let her carry you and i bet she did the princess carry i was laughing so much after i imagined suzu carrying him like that xd i keep cleaning my screen every now and then when momiji is up her mole really looks like filth 1940 no surprise at all that line was coming oh i get the reference about the cassette player i am glad sometimes to be old but those things were hard to work and set the clock or timers people would say man you look about as crazy as someone talking to a cassette player bc people would get so mad an plead and beg for it to work is that a higurashi reference at 3940 i love that vn and anime nanaru is so kawaiii acting like a toddler moments in this episode remind me why i always say translators should always take liberties when translating instead of doing a 11 translation as long as they make sure to get the story across even in non comedy stories sometimes it just makes it better have you ever played gsenjou no maou its a great visual novel 1731 thats the virgin damn it suzu theres a thin line between the good girl act and overbearing kindness and shes well past that mark this reminded me when my best friend left me for her bf after that i never truly trust anyone unlike suzu who wants to keep everyone i just dont care if anyone left cause when even your own best friend can leave you anyone can 1155 theres the line i was talking about last part xd 3935 i still need to play the vn but no dont remind me of higurashi please 4753 i petition for nanarus monologue to be in english class material when they teach you about them yes new suzu episode excited to see what happens from here 1208 so you guys dont have the common thing of being female suzuki and nanaru are traps they finally did it but still feels bad for maho 2800 i want to say thats a huniepop reference 4300 half wonder how cara and akame would have a triangle if they were full routes i want this to become an anime good afternoon and i liked the video 2527 big facts we can all be nerds and its great fuck being normal scott you will cry feel bad and possibly want to reset the game but it will be worth it 3040 that feel when youre about to put mayo on a sandwich and this shit happens finds it easier to talk to people online than irl me in a nutshell make pleasure pals a thing is that a motherfucking huniepop reference so anyone know what fifth base im pretty sure its anal but it probably could be any type of kink 3302 wow what a way to ruin such a perfect romantic scene kisusenpai i dont feel particularly sorry for maho even though shs my favorite girl in this game because 1 she gets to have her romance in her route 2 she does jack shit about it in the other routes even knowing the mc would take her on the spot at any given moment is she asked 3 she comes to terms with it all easily enough its a comedy after all ohscotts not dead d suzus innocent we all know that normiesbegone 610614 that was so so hilarious thats why i love kisusenpai so much im not addicted to game im addicted to the girl yeah we all weebs are attracted towards kisusenpai 112 ohh i feel so bad for her if i feel this sad for maho in kisusenpais route i dont how sad i will feel for senpai on mahos route 3507 finally the kissscene happened remember when she was throwing herself on his back back in episode 2 maho made the ultimate sacrifice but it was all in vain these two degenerate nerds are getting worst with each pasting day hell by the end of the video they could possibly blur the line between nerds and normies i have began to adore kisu senpaistill i cannot wait for mahos route how am i going to enjoy this route if all i feel is sadness for maho this feels so realistic aaaaagh i am dying the sweetness the cuteness the normie powers the heart of the cards the humanity remember me cool so cool it one in the morning scott sigh looks like im going to be late to school lads edit i instantly got knocked out and fell to sleep half way into the video rip this isnt a date this is a youtube video how does this only have 1 thousand views 242 jontron i dont like where this is going 317 jontron stop 1852 jontron stop 3812 jontron stop the line at that timestamp jesus could that be taken the wrong way out of context lol this game is comedy on par with alluna and brie suzu is just so pure and happy and just nice momijis still my favorite though xd sweet home alabama finally suzus route but i am also sad after her route game will be finished 2608 yeah just gotta give me a ptsd attack why dont ya scott 1235 suzu is staring out at us like she knows were on her route shes scaring me momoji asmr this is now best route 3002 to explain that a bit suzu was always using polite speech while talking to momiji but she slipped and was using casual speech towards momiji for the first time son na koto nai yo at 3006 she immediately corrected herself using polite speech again and ending her sentence with desu son na koto nai desu shes too cute and she finally calls momiji mama she finally accepted her new family 2120 the thoughts nanaru had there is also new dialogue from suzus route cause she was thinking about the situation from before feeling sad the scene only ends after the inner monologue of nanaru so you skipped over some emotional stuff that you should read again the reason why the text had a different color was probably cause you skipped through it to get to akanes route and now we enter the route with some of the best comedic moments with the things that are said in all the vn sadly some of them are hidden in the h scenes but o well its still great romcom o yeah and theres kind of a heart warming story in there too finally i was waiting ages for this illl say this again momiji needs a sub route because she is best mom 3338 even windows found it adorable enough to cheer excuse me waht 150 i wanted a rendition of sweet home alabama to play when you pressed the suzu route button but alas i am not too disappointed bc it is still going to be the best well im just going to say this lads before the video even starts all of us are now on some sort of alabaman weeb watchlist xd the perfect little soster doesnt exi this video never mind the only boy i want is you aagh my heart and my stomach is turning i dont know whether to feel dread or love agh pack your bags guys cuz bosskwar is taking the weebathon on a cross country trip to sweet home alabama sweet home alabama so theres 2 more private parts oh its just the same video 3 times in the playlist oh well next episode we get another amazing one liner first view comment and like 2408 i wont be naming who but some people would comsider that a plus instead of a minus oh thats rich just cause they got more numbers then the guys thats a bad way to go i can take all of them cause of my weight difference and strength difference dont think your numbers will save you girls you thought it was 5 star hotel room but it was me garbage room choose kisu senpai i think her route will bemore interesting fuck dude this game is killin me the jokes are just too on point cant remember the last time a vn made me spit out water from the dialogue i recommend doing mahos route after but its just a recommendation big chungus reference when i saw that i spat out my drink from laughter this game is too much at times and i love it i think it would be more than entertaining and funny as hell to go with senpais route there is so much that can happen compared to your normal childhood friend i just went super crazy even if it wasnt i took the scene at 2144 to 2205 as a miraculous ladybug and chat noir reference thier names were chiyoko and arisa is thier a reason this place look the the place from japanese school life when that guy was at this place with those 2 girls also this is one of the best visual novels it making me laugh so much especially when they do the fourth wall breaking scott will you do a series of dracu riot who will scott pick hmmmmmmm to be honest if mahos route is really great like some people said then i prefer if we do it later than being first also i just love kisusenpai and fourthwall annihilation the last time i had a porn conversation with a girl i ended up with stab wounds in my hand suzus entire character changes between the love triangle route and sister triangle and is honestly funnier overall its brilliant i hadnt forgotten about big chungus but your reaction was what i expected and i wasnt disappointed xd next choice choose maho to force her on that cosplay lol for the loli thing i think its best to remember it doesnt always mean looks like a little girl who doesnt have a figure sometimes its all about perspective thats why oppai loli is a thing something this vn is missing is something sabbath does really well is even when the sprites are on screen showing the different heights perspective so the reader can really feel how small or big the other characters are thats why cara and kisu dont feel small because they look the same height as the rest even though they are extremely small compared to everyone else you will see it in the cgs 4615 big chungus really chungahoo chungahoo chungahoo i love how maho solution to awkward stuff is just running away i cant take the awkwardness and the dishonesty dude it makes me all jittery and it irritates me so much i know there is a reason i know there is but godamn its irritating just be honest godsake the next choice will decide whether u go in maho or senpai route so good luck for that personally i think maho route is a little better 1654 loved that pubg reference you are sickand your not dead and make a kisu senpai choice or u will be desick sousuke is having a deep philosophical thought on the pros and cons of childhood friend relationships while sister a sister b are being infected by akanes bl disease never a dull moment with these nerds noratoto the princess the stray cat and matters of the heart is already out on steam if you feature it that would be terrific or someone pls gift it to scott so he can play it 1157 what are those books akane 1042 never get tired of these 4th wall breaks 317 aww cara wants to became a commander and command her friends oh you have not died congratulations on your return to youtube whos route do you want scott to do first like for kisusenpai comment for maho and super like if you want maho to cosplay im 1st bosskwar pls ping this comment tt maho felt more of the true route to me i just love her too muchbut not as much as nanaru 4626 i feel like kisu just made a filthy frank reference who wouldve thought mahos confession cemented the fact that kisu is the best character in the game 815 im getting princess x flashbacks mayukos route to be exact scott nevers goes for childhood route looks at the other walkthroughs he done hah lol anyway love maho route cant wait you do sisters route suzu route is prob my 2nd favorite i wish this was daily i really enjoy this games dialogue damn she lewd af m8 man they are akward but really cute together i cant imagine what kisu senpai will do to push maho to the next level to diddly its gonna be fun apparently kisu has read xxxxxxs route from one of the majikoi fan disk maho finally was honest with her feelings now to see all the lovey dovey and awkward situations to commence kisu senpai best waifu wingwomen confirmed holding hands how lewd r e s p e c t for our fallen brother we fought long and hard but we cant win a war that we already loss in the very first day its like chewing gum we can chew all we want but in the end we still need spit it out weird but yeah shiinas reverse rpe explanation was very high detailed for a simple joke thank god we already know that she doesnt actually have the will to pull off such a disturbing and highly criminal act but maho is adorable and that got corny at the end but cute idk why you dont like the childhood friends scott this puts a geniune smile on my face 2253 is that a jojos reference 2742 awww i so so feel bad for kisu even thought i know it was coming 3213 i will never forget you senpai i really look forward to suzu and nanaru i am usually not into the sister routes but those two have to have a hilarious route you know its going to be an amazing episode when it is started by cara asking us to feed her and the thumbnail has a kissscene 3852 finally the kiss happened feel more uncertain she grabbed you and puckered her lips that right there should have made it clear she wants you xd its not so much mahos design i like her slightly masculine voice its different in a good way its not just you mahos design is immediately eye catching and very cute in a more mature way her face is pretty her boobs are nice but those thighs 3314 at that moment it reminded me of a funny meme and it made me burst out in laughter prez really does have bad luck with gacha me i got two five stars servants on fate grand order yesterday without spending any money 4557 i love that expressionless stick face of sousuke maho cannot wait for next part maho is showing her true feelings you like mahos design wait until her route becomes funny itll be a blast i like how no one is left behind in the routes xd really like mahos design yea i can underatand that point stroking my beard hmm very sexy indeed hot damn she so sexy wishles i agree with you on mahos design it is really good even if im not that big on her voice acting her design itself is top notch this vn shouldnt be as funny as its trying to be but every joke is practically an 8 or higher i mean you have a foreign loli with an obsession for japanese culture cosplaying as commodore perry making diddly jokes phasing it as historic events its just god damn hilarious also maho looks fine in her not street fighter but it is street fighter cosplay please do a series of visual novel game called under one wing youll love it its not just you boss i like mahos design as well been waiting for this maho is really the best route imo 302 woahhhhhhhhhhh as well maho is looking hot and sexy as hell first awww maho is looking so hot in that chinese dress and cara as well in that butler uniform not gonna lie i thought maho would told suzuki nice mahochan is dead it is only me the winner kgb is the first soviet anthem starts playing our countrys police is always in first comrades the great thing about this vn is that someone other than the mc can be the butt of the joke sometimes i hear kgb and first thing i think of is tf2 i want to be mad mad at sousuke for missing what maho said but i know for fact that i along with every other male in the universe would have also missed that 443 in that exact moment a bead of sweat rolled down my face as the doki doki theme echoed in my mind 125 fuck the oscars 1740 i kept thinking of that one game creepy crawlers 4450 i need a stop right there criminal scum reference so bad right now xd 4620 hold the fuck up you lying little shit did you honestly forget the roasting you gave everyone when it was new scotty whens your next stream how could you not like the red haired hot headed delinquent that is maho and she got that little ponytail on the top of her head i l like twin tails but there is just something about that ponytail with her hair down that just makes her so amazing oh and her voice is also so good to listen to and she likes fighting games as well how could you not like the amazing gift sent from heaven that is maho her first instinct when police call out for her to book it outta there lol maho why the voice acting is this game is godly we have lewds i love how maho heard the police were after her and she just dip out and got caught 2630 i bet sampei will beat her cant wait for suzu inner demon to get out lmao xd scott the name says part 10 but its the 9th episode you cant trick us no matter how much of your guru powers you use more like the pause button 2103 literally everyone that plays a fighting game without any practise the worst part is learning it incorrectly because you dont have friends youd consistently lab with thousand yard stare thinking of times in smash and tekken 4643 i was wondering when we were getting to my favourite screen cap from this game wat the devil this isnt kisu sempai oh its the childhood friend the final boss u can taste the salt 734 about two years ago the police were looking for someone in our neighborhood at night and were going through the backyards not knowing what was going on i went into my backyard to see what was going on and they thought i was who they were looking for and put handcuffs on me fortunately it only lasted about a minute but still i believe further references to maho and the police will happen in her route which is funny as hell by the way shiina is wysiwyg by comparison 718 every time nanaru makes this facial expression she ends up looking like a mix between endo saya from dagashi kashi and chocola with lavendercolored hair lol also i feel you on the thing about cops scott i remember back in 2014 i had a blowout on one of my tires on my car and i was on the side of the road waiting for the tow truck to arrive as it was before i had a spare tire this asian cop pulls up behind me and asks if everything is alright and i tell him yeah had a blowout waiting on a tow truck to come get me so i can get a new tire the next thing i know he sticks his head into my car and starts taking whiffs and said it smells like alcohol in my car when it has been over 6 years since i had anything to drink at that point which i tell him that then he tries to accuse me that it smells like weed which i do smoke cigs but i sure as hell dont do pot but i let him know that not only have i never smoked the stuff in my entire life but im also an honorab so because we didnt embrace our inner fighting demon does this mean were on kisus route now i was a fan of fighting games before because i have my best friend but now im more into moba now atleast there i dont feel alone ring the alarm its the maho episode the swarm of maho fans are coming do not falter men hold the line alternative title maho playing video games at the arcade at night gone wrong parents called police friends worried that mahos almostarrest by the police will gonna be the brick joke for this vn forever why does the gameplay of maho is reminding me of jojo 2017 prez still the best character 1625 loved the crying face of kisu 1639 and now prez is also teasing maho 1831 and suzu as well 1447 aww cara is such a cute delinquent i want cara to cosplay as a delinquent 914 is that a neon genesis evangelion reference dude i think theres a typo in title what are these scenarios they are so weird and i love it god damn these references are killing me best part about them is that it feels like they not being use for a cheap laugh but actual conversation examples any otaku would make 1 minute in nanaru i am done with this shitass world first well be back with cara next time you mean the credits plus one ending scene that suit of armor that cara is wearing really reminds me of highschool dxd im so glad you are doing caras route first and after this can you do akanes route as well straight into the serious stuff damn i like the video bro im looking for new subscribers on my youtube account objective 616behold shadowfox on a further note i hate seeing the calories on menus oh my god holy smashing right into the 4th wall at mach speed then you should do akane next because i want the sisters route best route to done at the last wow cara gets to business real fast and by business i mean diddly scene cara is like a lot open about things xdd the evil the evil magistrates may refer too the phoenix wright show the iron samurai and the sequels where the antagonist was the evil magistrate xd best route thats all ill say it be funny if her route ends just after this h scene lol so who has had the funniest h scenes so far this one with cara seems right up there with kisus first diddly scene right they skipped all through to the dating part how preposterous and i just know that cara share the saw va with maia from hapymaher so yeah yooo i know this a subroute and all but this is going way to fast 40 mins and already an h scene they didnt even show how they ended up a couple sad thumbs down thats the wrong sword general shadowfox i forgot they finagled a lord of the rings reference into this game i know this is a somewhat short story with mostly diddly scenes but i cant help but laugh at the thought that all it took to get on caras route was to complement her commodore fucking perry cosplay god this game is hilarious can you play ouchi ni kaeru made ga marshmallow desu please ive been wanting to watch it why i cant even open hscenes for nanarusuzucara and akane only ive seen maho and shiina which episode is the shiina route oh god this is why this game is sooooo good 81046 at that part video was skipped cause of hentai scene tad bit sad no background music but its all fine been looking for this route haha thanks bud 4th wall what 4th wall we broke that shit down to rubble why you fockin have all them botches ill give ya 20 grand for those definitely not being scottish this lucky bloke take your controller nanaru firmly grasp it xd 3807 why scholastic of all places i would have told the teacher to fuck off nobody tells me what i can and cant do this 000 whaddup looks funny monkas when scooter brought up the actual cover art got me dying i would do senpais route at the end just to make her wait xd everyone is falling for kisu senpia but i see right through her kisu senpia is not a real part of the game she is really a person outside of the game who has been able to hack the system think about how she breaks the forth wall a normal character could not do that what she is doing is appealing to what people like because she is part of the people she is fooling us all 708 i still think the second choice is the better one for nanaru cause it would have given you alone time with her and thats ultimately what she really wants and then there were two shiina is clearly best girl well second best after mom i can see maho an shiinas next confrontation already maho i win kisusenpai i kissed souske first shiina pics or it didnt happen 3209 its okay maho its the love triangle route so shiina has to share with you shadow realm wheres the yugioh cards when you need em 5046 she gon send sousukes peen to a certain shadow realm later 4250 is a fuckin mood 045 a fan of fate maybe 2735 this fucking coward pretending to be a normie xd 4215 thats just mean suzu wow if my sister was watching this series shed develop a nervous tick over the constant mispronunciation of her name the first three letters of the name cara is pronounced care not car before you go i can pronounce it however i want imagine mispronouncing your name knowingly or not over and over again over the course of fifty or sixty episodes its the one thing that has always made her mad ever since she was a kid i would have thought shed outgrow it but nope it never fails to piss her off maho or shiina man this is a tough decision i like nanaru the most but maho is a solid 2 cara is in love akane in sister i got akane by mistake due to choices one thing i love about this game is that caras and akanes routes are not merely subroutes theyre route hijackers kisus farts probably smells the worst 10008 woah didnt thought maho would actually kiss him now i want mahos route first then kisusenpais route glad you choose love route first best routes in my opinion maho has the best romance and senpai has the best comedy so either is fine for me 5309 scott doing postvideo edit its rare you edit videos after recording though that maho zoomin scared me a little 4518 i want to see maho cara doing cosplay oh god help me i am addicted to kisusenpai i need help ugh can you be honest with yourself maho you are not worried about him you are worried about yourself you are worried that sousuke will be taken from you and yet you always put it on sousuke he is this and that like just be honest this is maybe the thing that i hate the most on vn characters not saying that i dont like maho just be honest it pisses me off now even scotts videos are reminding me of what i have to do im watching youtube to procrastinate why does it have to remind me that i have to study for my final test week of the year rip akane i guess thats one less subheroine to check off the ol diddly list 3126 what anime references are those scott but kisusenpai has a weird picture of summer and i love it scott play the princess the stray cat and matters of the heart ps scott you better do kisu senpai route 1st then you can see mahos cosplay in her route lmao 2421 ahh the best 4th wall break ever 4422 the sweet honest girl as you were described as in your character bio ah these 4th wall breaks 1849 aww i want that peek of panties kisusenpai 1458 balding vice principal 412 but maho behaves like a boy any way akanesenpai ah yes yoshitsune the only knowledge i have of him is that hes the most busted persona in 4 and 5 yep iirc you made all of the choices that mattered to get onto the love triangle route pick new lover in the vn sandbag in the fighting game tournament and get nanaru to play with you guys cara and akane routes are accessible on different triangle routes ones on love triangle the other on sister triangle wont spoil whos on which one consider them more like subroutes to the triangle than for the whole game thumbnail of every episode is as hilarious as ever scott please also upload sabbat of the witch 1 hour episode next dude your content made me happy during my school finals you got my thanks i think im still team kisu even though i really liked what maho did in the end 1241 your daily waking up rooster i saw that shameless azur lane plug you right about that though suzus va really knows how to hit those voices like in a past episode hah like a delinquent and this episodes co co co co co one of the best parts about suzu is her sadistic side one she rarely shows but maaan when she doesits hot suzu called you oniichan when she was younger i want her to call us that again just like nanaru awww loli suzu is just so kawaiii she is the cutest girl in this game 300 i actually thought that sousuke hit him in his peepee or stole his first kiss or something 028 yeah the new sonic is more likable and i quite love it so excited for the movie now poor lil suzu shed rather have an oneechan then be separated from her oniichan parents falling apart huh tell me about it this conversation with little suzu is heartbreaking here we go i am excited to see how the family and everyone handles this relationship suzu is getting dumber as time moves on i like maho and senpai but i feel really bad for maho right now having to almost fake happiness it must be incredibly hard yay roses leave the flower background for kisu for next epis why not both most i choose between chocolate and strawberry the saddest thing about the scene with maho after the party is that she put herself in that situation right when she builds up the courage to try and break the status quo that she created souske indirectly tells her that she took too long you can just feel her heart shattering into a billion pieces you could go for the maho version of the birthday if that is a thing for on your birthday its sad how maho tried to break out of the friendzone towards the end now that were in kisus route this game is still hilarious tho i love how scooter does the flower edits xd now i just think about it does scooter like kisu because in a way she looks like misaki from fureraba 3919 the mad man mysterious ingredients x y and z is she trying to create the powerpuff girls 3008 if he wants to know what its like he can just ask rei xd fucking cheese cake sounds awesome right about now yeah i did maho first before shiina mahos scenes in this route where you can just hear her heart shattering got me you know scott ive actually been kind of thinking you could technically record and upload the h scenes you just cant upload them to youtube instead you could upload them to google drive or something like that so your viewers could download the videos so they can both view the h scenes and your reactions the channel 7saeni does a similar thing except they dont do commentary they also upload all of a routes h scenes at a time at the end of a characters route ie youd upload all of shiinas h scenes once you finish her route chocolate all the way for me man this is making me hungry for cake now someones gonna get hurt its in the title love triangle troubles tt pat the cutesy shy shiinaxd shiina is lucky her route cant be hijacked like some other or scott would definitely have fucked up by now ahh the steinsgate references put a smile on my face also thats why unromanced suzu is my favorite her savagery is the best scott is a vn protagonist and he went the yandere route after maho route do suzu better then nanarumaybe lol 1425 wow the first episode of shokugeki no sousuke s4 looks good wheres sousukes cardboard box every nerd knows that if you want to tail people you need to hide in box so they wont spot you in the corner of their eyes i am really starting to like suzu she is funny when she speaks her mind yeahlet the childhood friend loosehahahaha avoid the age question so we can maintain a harmonious environment oooooooh i hate this ooooooooh i freakin hate this this is why i hate harem or love triangle vns and animes because i feel like shit i like kisu senpai so much but i just cant stand the hurting oh my god it hurts and will hurt further more in the maho route because i like kisu oh god i feel so bad ooooooooh so close to first comment gotta keep the meme going zack nods nani the fuck lmao 15730 i laughed out loud is there moms route if there some i want to see it first 73612 weird flex but okay maho why no s3x seens but damn maho still cute as fuck and now im h0rny nannnnii sousuke pull a ssbkx10 on poor shiina 72500 this man has a dick of steel the studying scene actually hurt on an emotional level as someone who got straight as and is now a state employed professional tutor two days to watch from the beginning to this point work needs to slow down a bit cause its cutting into afterwork fun this game xd 3023 thats a really nice face be a shame if someone soiled it the cake is a lie this game and all its 4th wall smash 3849 your in the endgame now two h scene in one video what is this scott grisaia gameplay please dont tell me we are gonna have some eroge loving baby shiinas running around now i saw it all online is this the legendary titblow fuck lol and you did the c inside lol for the bathroom one at least yeah recalling it now mahos route might be funnier this ones awesome too 1325 scott were you about to say trust me did something happen do you have a child 2021 that face still cute change my mind as soon as i clicked on the video i realized it was age restricted ah shit here we go again again of course shiina has to make everything sexual shes literally a walking eroge encyclopedia i forgot how short the routes in this game are resulting in 2 scenes like this today probably just one more episode before next route by using my amazing senses i predict the next h scene will be at the beach 4301 pls dont isekai the whole bteam shiina we dont want a truckkun to kill you and your friends toe translation and localization team are doing a great job here xdd shiinas getting bolder hehe wait what is the record for most hscenes in a video i want to know for research purposes of course shiina yeah right 3 how did you get here eyyyy ma dude be keeping up with the shield hero me this episodes thumbnail looks interesting 10 min later hscenes appear oh my god calls fbi hello we got ourself a troublemaker bland featureless erogeprotagonist face isnt that usually the face of every vn mc first bees fuckin knees how old is that joke anyway 60fps for a vn that is static sprites if it were trinoline with some animations then sure but this isent an fps sensative game only a source for feminazis anger if you enjoyed the video dont forget to leave a likecomment subscribe for more well i would preffer shina first and then maho its funny bacause you feel bad for maho in shina route but in maho route shina is almost the same and this was the episode where the illusion that suzu is the most normalsane character crumbled into pieces also congratulations to maho for winning the first route selection was kind of expecting this though it would have shocked me if you picked the sister route first and the rest was more or less 5050 great video pd when you finish majikoi are you gona play majikoi s i love if you played it because i already see the prologue and is super interesting i think they actually censored the shirt prez was wearing at the convention i am pretty sure he had one on with what i presume to be his papishiachan swimsuit edition its not exactly vulgar but i guess i unterstand why they would remove it 15710 her route is only around 30 minutes anyway since its more or less just an excuse for scenes in the 18 version you could probably do cara and akane in the same video or put them at the end of some final episode that was too short on their own if not youre gonna end up with a very short video otherwise while i do feel bad for wanko too i can fully understand you reason xd i bet those voice actresses had a lot of fun at the set 1820 glance is chira btw nanaru created the ultimate bioweapon xd legend has it that in the faint embers of the evening nanaru glows nuclear purple so bright that it can be seen from miles on end xd why akanesenpai maybe suzu wants more general knowledge on guys so she can learn how to make her brother happy yet akanes warped knowledge could get suzu to get a misunderstood info on guys causing awkward situation between her and sousuke as she puts the knowledge into action 300 fsakes xd 602 this is how i feel about my cooking xd 933 ive given myself some real bad food poisoning before but damn nanaru xd 1315 its just kazami yuuji occupation student mk2 keeping an eye on her for ichigaya xd 1438 what if its the cameraman for the game xd 1924 she does 2200 ok i get why the girls are excited but why the boys xd 3855 2930 bossky jumps out of a bush puts an arm round suzu and nanarus shoulders and says idol group then the cast of son of a b drag him off and apologize xd 4217 thats half the reason i dont want to see sex scenes the other half being the sex 4356 oh ho ho youre approaching me xd but really why why akane well suzu is too famous for sousuke now rip the sweet home alabama dream things are about to get spicy lmao 3954 god i love shiina also theres a new one thats pretty good in that regard suzu will be the pure idol much like sasami like sasami huh flashbacks of the sasami route a weapon to surpass metal gear nanaru omelette aww i am already missing the toddler nanaru im totally gonna use his dads line when i have a kid instead of telling them how proud i am that was hilarious this novel is great 424 this hits surprisingly close to home 1711 fsakes xd 1827 even momijis here xd 2319 feels ba wait thats us xd 2857 damnit dad xd 2748 momiji the fuck 2830 oh no theyre teaming up xd 2959 uni me can relate xd 3204 thats one hell of a speech 4723 it makes a nice change from games where the other heroines disappear when you pick a route if you thought the confession was funnystupid wait until the first hscene in this route 4418 ooooo that sweet nice delicious booty i mean thigh totally meant thigh the most i ever did was 12 but the reason behind is actually really depressing leave it to the group to make everything akward af even his parents got involved which was a wacky twist in itself this game keeps getting better and better ok be real is there gonna be 4 h scenes the 1st h scene is quite something that us all so next route maho confirmed asthe club members seem to do everythingand be at every event together includingthis love confession does that mean they will be there for the h scenes oh god that would be awkward and possibly hilarious at the same time honestly this visual novel is probably my favorite its amazing so how long is kisus route this is the sad fate of love triangles so much heart ache to overcome just to be with that one girl 2755 where can i find myself a mother like momoji she is so understanding 4338 honestly i pissed myself laughing when he said that xd 2105 i really love this games 4th wall break you gotta experience that in my route 2116 yeah same thought sousuke 2048 aww poor prez i feel so bad for him whats his name anyway 4351 i likiey the confession party 745 i loved that yandere stare 347 cara only still cares about her cosplay this visual novels great next episode will be gold if it is what i think it is wait what happened again oh right the confession uuuuuh am i the only one that didnt like this that much i mean i like the maho parts alot but i think the confession itself got drown out by all the comedy i like my comedy but just tone it down a bit because this didnt feel like a confession its just my opinion ok please dont kill me you wont see this anywhere else xd wawawait now i know i just see you through the notification but does this game make you choose a wahmen yes yes yes scotts alive kicking thats what matters more third first alright thanks to the internet i can confirm in japan incest is not illegal i also learned that in some places incest is solved with the death penalty the alabama has truly started now weewoo man dad prank on poor little suzu was a bit of an overkill i would say to take away the whole room you need to be careful with the face zoomins now it needs to be lewd enough to not be kids content but also not lewd enough to violate community guidelines wait a boarding school dont tell me she was transferring to vincennes 4951 man dad really really really didnt want her to go i think he might have even suffered more than sousuke he wanted to respect suzus own decision since he is a nice parent so he couldnt stop her directly but he did everything he could in the backround he also sensed that suzu didnt really want to move and he was counting on his son to stop her eventually what a great guy the funny thing is if sousuke and nanaru didnt went out to chase after suzu she would have come home that day normally suzu would found her empty room and sousuke would be able to talk to her and convince her not to go so everything would have been fine without the chase through the city xd 4339 he only said that as more of a joke or an empty threat right after that nanaru said lets get real and that she is the only one here who could cause problems she mentioned how dad was giggling to himself the whole time cause suzu is back in his life this route still creeps me out like ahhhhhhhhhhhh sure nanaru was a sister too but had no blood ties and she always felt that way but this is weeeird 3102 that jojos reference though lol i can already heard the sounds of nascar banjo and ar15 from afar i still say that each girls best moments happen outside their own routes and this was nanarus this broke my heart when i played through this section because nanaru was my first route for this game 3200 nanaru i think those are two completely different camps 3600 ill laugh and get pissed if they argue about the relationship after trying to hide her moving away and kinda bribing their kids with sweets 4950 i think i hate both the parents right now 1323 that mom is so understanding about the situation of love war nanarus dealing with her unanswered feelings always hits me the hardest for some reason i think its because her feelings arent really given that much spotlight outside her route so when youre reminded it really hits you looks like its to finally time to whip out the alabamian banjo music xd as a visual novel protagonist dealing with a life alternating crisis theres only one decision when three choices pop up and thats too look up towards the sky for the answers that was hilarious but also creepy nanaru kept making that wink cat gace sweet home alabama ps i choose the sky too lmao it was funny as fuk goodbye my first love shit why would you say that nanaru fck she broke my heart that actually made me cry my ass out nanaru that actually made me cry our priest has nothing to do with this it was honestly a little uncomfortable watching you have so little fun with this maybe you actually do need to take a step back from this game and pause it for a while if you dont enjoy playing it at the moment kind of defeats the whole point of playing this in the first place otherwise dont you think as much as i would like you to play this it doesnt make sense if you dont really feel like it about nanairo reincarnation i have seen a little bit more of the steam version by now its not inherently worse in any way just different i apologize if i made it sound like the game is bad without the 18 patch because it isnt the changes are only noticeable in a few situations for example when characters make a really big deal out of kissing you know this was originally something different it is definitely worth playing through at least once for the main story also i have heard that the developers dont allow people uploading the 18 version anyway so you dont have much choice i like the shiina route too and its funny but not gonna watch the sisters route though pd if you are accepting recommendations can i recomend you one about vampires and school i watch the anime version and love it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgouw0znnupg woo hoo finally caught up i wanna chocolate volcano now or chocolate lava cake whatever theyre called get out of my sisters body satan during sex begone thot 445 brother doombringer sounds like a name fans of doom call each other 1330 yep akane route next xd 3650 they are trying to summon baron dante what is this dialogs on todays episode i mean this series had it but seriously this ones really freakyyup said right here i like this kind of game that makes boss laugh at everything but im sure ill also like when nanairo reincarnation make him cry worse than grisaia its all so entertaining bro this game is way ahead of its time well i guess nanaru will be licking on some candy apples at the festival if you know what stop it why why did they reference that brain dead fate meme but i havent seen one god damn jojo reference student a people die when they are killed well not s sherlock 1326 i was trying to remember which route this line was from its got the exact reaction i was hoping for 1655 every article of clothing in an eroge i look at makes me wonder now how are they gonna fuck with this 2449 or you mean literally anyone in japan isnt the computer literate population in japan hilariously low next part is probably the finale for the nanaru route if i remember my events correctly and one of my favourite cgs in the game is coming up biggest question now remains whether well get akane next or suzu i really wish theyd stop bringing up the sibling thing you know certain genres and hobbies appeal more to men than women unless you buy into gender theory which is bs men and women are a real thing not just an opinion fortunately in japan they still live in reality worse gender theory devalues women giving them the status of identity if careers worked like that i would identity as a doctor or carpenter devaluing the career nationalities disorders you name it construct or not it is devalued by lowering their status to identity and mere opinion dont buy into gender theory dude men and women are different but human equality before the law is not the same as tabula rasa politician out tbh hand holding is like base 100 question why so scott ready for some grade a bullshit soooo how far do we go before the facezoom ins now i mean we dont want this to be flagged as kids content but we also cant have full didly shown scott you didnt face zoom it while they were hand holding how dare you i thought you wanted to sheild us from such lewdness but nay you didnt xd 2312 why dont you play fortnite 3953 that cat face is so funny ok scott that is messed up dont end it on that scott unless it fell on a sanitized floor you seriously shouldnt reuse utensils or eat food that fell on it the bacteria literally sticks instantly the xsecond rule is a myth sure many wouldnt get sick because their immune system will be able to fight it most of the time but considering that floors are often in contact with shoes and 93 of shoes are contaminated with faecal bacteria itd be better to just not risk it wow it got intense quickly under the awning tell me about it the life of an anime fan is hard i am an addict for buying anime vn and manga so i have to cut myself off after 1k a month or i will not stop a happy lovey dovey date with suzu what could possibly go wrong on the road to sweet home alabama 5 hours later no suzu what are you doing you cant possibly stop the breaks on the road to sweet home alabama when were already this deep in especially with such a sad face after dropping a bomb like that manthe video ended as fast as it startedi hate cliffhangers 745 this hit me so hard the first time considering how everything i tend to write is negative even when its about something i really enjoy you know i just realised i like all of the main 4 girls more on routes that arent their own 4622 the price not to be disclosed right now sanoba witch nene figure looks at me at least i paid with my own money home stretch now boys putting a bet on 3 episodes more she beautiful she like angel iwae i love you niisan i dont know i feel like satan is breathing down my neck but you know its cute so its probably ok just seconds indamn sometimes gate keeping is necessary 5135 ah yes i believe the word your looking for is sane girls and panzer i love that adorable tank anime kisu and sosuke with the back and back roast session had me in tears kisu is obviously best girl outside of mom of course i fucken love the dialogues and thoughts in this game also i think kisu surpassed nanaru in my book so uh quick questionwhich version of the game are you playing the all ages version or the uncensored 18 version just curious one piece is two piece now what the fuck is this game as great as shiina is i think i have to go with nanaru as my favorite shes so freaking scummy and for some reason i love it girls and tanks huh kinda reminds me of the old movie tank girl were she can even use beer as ammo does anyone remember that movie the best thing about maho is that shes even more of a tsukkomi to everyone elses boke than the mc thats why her route is gonna have so many funny moments hey i like girls und panzer great anime of course its the best anime girls and tanks are moe i dont really like maho feels like she just cuts in at the best times between sousuke and shina im not saying shes not a good route or anything im just pissed off about it she should just stay out of it if she wasnt apart of the conversation in the first placeim not trying to hate on her again im just annoyed at what she does maybe we will get some back story and know why shes like this but so far she in the last on the list for me everyone else is great like i would trade mahos route for any other one of the girls any day and im not just hating on the childhood friend route this is my personal opinion so dont hate on my comment just cuz we gave different opinions im sure you are a great person even if you dont agree with me besides that i really love this visual novel its just super funny and there are so many references also here something pretty cool i found out about this visual novel httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdqw4w9wgxcq 355 what the utter fuck is wrong with sousuke 3550 thats just lazy xd 4415 oh no im into girls und panzer should i feel insulted or understood xd 5800 no here comes the insults 10135 she just doesnt give a fuck today xd the majority of the girls in this series are best girls love this series subscribed akane would be my best girl if she just had more screentimehad a proper route edit never mind i often forget just how amazing shiina is ive been wondering this for a while but why can you say amane but not akane its only one letter xd so far i think cara is the best shes just so adorable yes maho is sane which probably helps with liking her and especially with both looking out for each other well as close as sane get to anyways because everyone here is still a bunch o goddamn nerds xd shes still a fighting game demon that beats everyones ass someone should tell akane dont get high on your own supply lol those daggers flying man xd its good no one got really hurt akane actually was really cute this episode im interested in her route now i hope to god caras route comes sooner rather than later 5120 now i want one of them to say parry this you fucking casual thatd kill me 5923 that burn man kisusenpai is on fire 5750 so kisu can read minds now haha kisu keeping it real with her opinion and the burns about the anime all it was missing was a fourth wall break and her pointing at the screen saying aint i right whoevers playing this damn roasted they need some milk and ointment 4232 i also hope that this vn should be adapted in an anime as well just like how they did with the fruit of grisaia 4218 loved that fourth wall break i so love sousuke nanaru they both are better brothersister than suzu scott on his way to the best girl routed just call me the greatest general of the modern day all hail general cara this game is so spot on with its jokes i even thought that if you replace candy with drugs the store explanation from akane would still fit in without skipping a beat and they even compare it to a drug deal which was hilarious the rick astley joke from last episode was by far the funniest most random ass shit ive seen and it still makes me lmfao remembering it 3636 edit and 5828 that doesnt age well according to wikipedia entry of girls und panzer bluray sales of the first anime volume in japan reached third place on the oricon charts in midfebruary 2013 whilst sales of the second anime volume bluray reached second place in late february with 24733 copies sold within the first week of release edit also beyond the timestamp above is similar to anime circlej community or at least what i see in youtube 1912 shcrew ball ohh cara is cute as ever and loved her teehee pose in the thumbnail of this episode 908 same bro i used to do that in my childhood as well ahh prez is so relatable 533 prez is even accepting the haunted pussy prez still the best character 353 wtf did you said sousuke that lady looks so old and wrinkled that her pussys is haunted u got take note on those references boi i love your vids keep it up amazing cant wait for next part great job thanks for the video my man btw what was the bg music in the end there are you or kusk going to do the akane and cara routes thx for the video and i believe it will be shiinas route next its kinda ironic actually you basically stop playing because the game makes you feel really bad for maho so technically the game is too good at what it does xd thats what i meant when i said it hits surprisingly hard for a mostly comedy orientated game and since suzu and nanaru have the same problem as maho albeit to a somehwat lesser extent i dont know how you will deal with that should you ever continue this 1105 yeah same here only that i am used to this pain by now so it doesnt affect my enjoyment of other routes on the contrary actually if a game can evoke those emotions from me it makes it all the better would be boring it if wouldnt so did ya record lamunation yet if so how is your opinion on it so far i hope it can lift your spirits i really dont like seeinghearing you being so down

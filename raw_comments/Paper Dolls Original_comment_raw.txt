this is the silent hill game we needed at the moment john needs to appreciate the lack of empty drawer in this game more my cousin said that it was because in his past life he murdered all those people so they want revenge sadly we live in a society you do not deserve to be in yins family im chinese and i remeber we leave food for the dead and we pray somehow i feel like my country is like more being watched by something the paper money should be one typical chinese traditionfor ancestors dear john you dont want to try this on vr trust me i know this is a very small detail but i really love the sound of the locks being opened idk why its just a really satisfying sound and its nice that its not just the standard unlocking audio used in most games the audio actually matches how i imagine that lock would sound when opened lol loving the game so far overall hmmm john has a video with chinese tiltle xd i cant wait for you to play paper dolls chapter two this is some tedious adventure game obscure bullshit lol its all very good except for the boice acting not a big fan of instakill tho they arent too punishing in this game from what ive seen they dont throw you back too far samurai slice in a chinese game xd i cracked at johns hehehehe lmaooooooo dude taking his daughter somewhere then theres a wreck and she is missing gee this doesnt sound familiar what is this game loud field get it eh man just in time your testicles will drop and the immature stuff you do and say will stop happening so much love the games you play but you make it impossible ur terrible even with a lock the door shouldnt be that strong it just wood and paper i dont what it is but the graphics remind me of resident evil 7 and outlast omg john is so brave he doesnt even flinch hes that kid who wont leave us or throw us to the ghosts when they appear we need more john in our life chinese contemporary art is the fucking best that guy in the beginning sounded like william afton from fnaf 6 i think this is great especially considering the state of horror games coming out lately weird the voice actors dont sound bad but the writing and the way they say their lines sounds like its trying to be uncanny silent hill 2 style can someone please give poor john some kind of reference sheet for how to pronounce romanized chinese in the future im lucky i grew up surrounded by mandarin speakers because there were high populations of several asian races where i lived john afaik was born and raised and still lives in texas i dont think theres much of any kind of asian population there i wouldnt know im canadian lol but yeah i imagine it would be helpful in future chinese horror game lps i just came back to pt 1 and um its actually you do not deserve to be in yins family ok same i love this game the protag is kind of reminding me of a schizophrenic but when i look up the medicine its used for anxietyrelated disorders maybe some ptsd or something also social anxiety works because of how he is towards others he seems a little standoffish towards them me thinking why the creator of this game did not put chinese voices this kind of things was always haunting me when i was little girl english dub is so bad paper ingot are like currency for the chinese afterlife asian horror games always give off an interesting vibe i always enjoy them remember dreadout i dont know why but this game is kind of giving me visage and resi 7 vibes the hands coming out of the ceiling remind me of silent hill 4 the room haha i remember making those paper ingots for my grandmas funeral its like origami and you offer them to the dead normally for family members so they can use it in the after life its basically like origami i remember filling up bin bags full of them there are also people who are insanely good at origami and make paper houses dogs watches etc and sell them to people who would burn them for the dead in the after life roaches are spoopy edit lets see how this goes i put on headphones i wish pewdiepie would play this game so i dont have to watch this guy for me i feel like the chinese horror games are way different than western games they both have their perks i just wish companies would collab so that we would get something in betweeni personally studiet a1 level chineese in university so i wish there was the option to put chinese audio and english subtitlesstill the game is quite good and original damn can u be more bad playing this too scared for vr so much a puzzle gamenah forget about this game not scary but headache well i am chinese but i am not good at hokkien i only know two hokkien that is siao crazy su ku stupid looks like you missed johns new tweet you know what that means passive agressive glare i think paper dolls to chinese people is like crowns to american so many of the animations just got stolen straight out of resi 7 huh ghost are afraid of light in china in china paper crafts such as house car and ingots are burnt for the dead so they can use them in their afterlife creepy hands come out of ceiling everyone nope johnnie wolfe can i jump maybe they will grab my head d falling asleep while watching this was a mistake love the bright blue flannel nice graphics hi john i am from india and i think your channel deserves at least 4 million subscribers you are very humble my friend surprisingly im liking this so far the first part was meh but its the exploration and the small strips of paper that interests me hopefully youve got enough of those to form a coherent narrative in your inventory how can china think of such a scary game we need new horror game ideas if he can only sprint for 13 of a second he needs to workout my guess is this guy was lord yin this house owners wife in past life she was accused for something she might actually had never done and was killed for that i believe lord yin is hiding some secrets in the 2nd floor which may be the reason that cause this tragedy actuallyits a sad story i think mrs yin ist betrayshe died of the blind loyalty of mr yins people now thats a hawt thumbnail god this would probably be so much more effective if it had actually been in chinese instead of the god awful english dub this house is called yin hoise because the family name of the lord is yin the creaking doors sound like trumpets john i think youre not legally allowed to swear when quoting coryxkenshin yin its one of the chinese last name yin house means people who used to live in there are the yin families i always love your commentary technically roaches can bite you if they are especially hungrybut it is still uncommon and they cant really hurt you and even if they do bite you out of hunger they have a tendency to eat your hair and nails first they are called tiger bells edit oh it already told you 300 hiding system the feature i want most on horror games 3 try watching 1966 painted skin the chinese guys even do math in a horror game this game needs more doors finally a game where the protagonist is in the same physical condition as i am i needed that relateability in my horror i think it is more creepy for eastern asian people because we can recall similar architectural and interior element in our memories literally feels like these can happen to us the game looks cool even if the start reason is kinda well crappy lets be honest the overacting of the voices tho its just terrible even ridiculous maybe its just a problem in the english version this said so chinese silent hill at least with the beginning intro haha hmm it said that paroxetine was for pain i wonder if that was supposed to be translated to something like anguish because i take paroxetine and its for depression and anxiety wow that insecticide is super effective vs roaches wonder if its also super effective on the user with how instant the effect is 2715 was that a coryxkenshin reference loving this game play catching up right now its fun to change your language to chinese then the protagonist speaks chinese dad sounds remarkably um inappropriate lol 2714 minutes into a horror game youre now playing sekiro paper dolls die twice unwarp the record by heating it up every time there is an option to hide i get really scared of when ill need to do that oo imagine waiting for money from your children but they gave fake papers instead it would be so cool to explore an ancient chinese home or village wish i could i love asian horrors one you learn bout their culture two their horror is way more gruesome please continue r u horrified about this game that is in chinese culture after all most games r about devil and cult actually roaches do bite i half expected that record to start playing the song from layers of fear im liking this so far always nice to see you play something other than crappy itchio horror games 1627 achievement unlocked there are ghosts here yeah no shit john you angry sassy boy xd 2138 gross squishy noises wow i didnt expect this to become a hentai 2502weird noises that end in a moan ooooookay i was joking but this got weird quick not helped by the fact that she was clearly crying before and shes old i searched paper dolls by shawn daley then this showed up always nice to see you enjoy yourself john whenever a door is unlocked it sounds like someone loading a gun anyone else notice that yin house means i love the game and the atmosphere is just fabulous i hope you play more chinese and japanese horror games it looks really cool though i really dont know anything about the culture and history i like asian horror maybe because its just so different from western stuff my first thought until now how the dad landed on an abandoned ghost house after his car accident theres no road or crashed car 2528 those are jingre berrs httpsyoutubese154vtgzms the chinese aesthetic is nice but the story seems like every other horror game story till now still hope it gets better also its not scary i samurai slice these mother fckers chinese horror game with english voice acting is there at least an option to switch the language to chinese this game is really scary leave it to asian to make some creepy games why are all asian horror games so perfect thats neat thats neat thats neat thats neat i really love your tiger feet thats swell thats swell thats swell thats swell i really love your tiger bell wow what a diamond in the rough you found i love watching you play bad games as much as the next guys but its great to see you actively engaging with an absorbing new title looking forward to the rest of this thanks for being john wolfe ok so im like 10 minutes in and i can already tell this guy has some sort of schizoid affective disorder hes very paranoid and has lots of auditory hallucinations hope it adds to the gameplay like some of the enemies or noise cues arent actually real but you never know until the last minute i think i prefer devotion over this game but its not too bad concluse is even better imho ever had a roach crawl into your ear doesnt need to bite to f you up 2645 that jumpscare made me jump literally two feet in the air wtffff in chinese culture yin house mean this place is only for dead people live which mean this house is haunted we also call graveyard yin house this game is neat to watch but leaves alot to be desired in gameplay nothing like early horror games doom silent hill manhunt the suffering these games were great at creating a sense of panic resident evil was a scary series at first back when the camera was static in the environment making it difficult to aim when they switched to third person and included screen prompts during fights the whole thing became too easy and the fear of the unknown was lost kid dies in a car crash at start johnhahahaha who else realized that when the guy brushed the bugs off and the menu looked like the animation and menu from resident evil 7 i would get lost within 10 seconds of entering this place even with a map 830 false you need more electro the paper dolls in the game are actually something we chinese will burn for the deceased as servants in the afterlife molly doesnt sleep anyone that have met her knows that 1311 loads pistol with malicious intent 2715 samurai slice these motherfuckers aye coryxkenshin why they used shotgun sound effect for locks from now on im gonna start naming my keys key 1 key 2 key 3 etc they really should have thought about the sprint button what about a light jog button instead would he be out of breath with that too if i were a betting man i would put my money on the father ending up being a negletful parent and had murdered his wife its so refreshing to see you enjoying a game john love it this game is pretty good and i found myself getting sucked in as much as you were most likely because you were so into it haha looking forward to part 2 also to answer your question about why molly might have run away from the car crash perhaps a sneaky ghost was impersonating her mother i think molly is still alive at least i hope she is im kinda tired of the child has really been dead all along horror trope 2715 samurai slice that like buttoncoryxkenshin why didnt we play it on vr john are you scareeedd i think that paranornal activity game messed you up for life love you 1 pile of paper ingot it is used for consecration generally people burn paper ingot for consecrating gods or ghosts as the currency the ghosts are normally their died family or friends in contrast the paper dolls are burned for gods or ghosts to let them use them as servants or facilities in the other world they are both related to taoism they are both made of paper 2 the newspaper found after pile of paper ingot the newspaper had four chinese characters and a pile of paper ingot on it that means in the world of ghost after people die they go there paper ingot is used as the currency means the world of ghost means this can be used by everyone this game is elaborate some decorations are very traditional i heard it that some vases and drawings in this game imitated some old culture relics that are actually existed if what i said has something wrong please correct me lol love the coryxkenshin there john 2714 why john doesnt play vr games anymore its scarier so we essentially summoned a spirit through fire to give us raid oo that series of rooms with the creepy hands from the ceiling was legitimately cool a bit of a shame that the voice acting is so narmy but it does add some charm to the whole thing its nice to see a game that actually gets to be split into separate parts been a while since that happened afaik samurai slice these motherfuckers ah i see you watch coryxkenshin silent hill remind me the beginning crash car and the daughter vanishing towards into the misty or darkness gloomy either its good they caught good fonts of inspirations wow the second time looks like the commands on keyboards changed wasnt it this game feels like a ripoff of re 7 the animations are almost the same when the bugs jump at you and the movement and gui also look like they have been ripped straight from the game just to put this out there starving roaches will attack living flesh soooo if those are hungry roaches you are gonna get bit samurai slice coryxkenshin the thing about yin house is that not only did the house belong to the yin family but at the same time it has the same pronunciation as purgatory in chinese i love this chinese folklore based game im impressed by the clarity of where hes pointing when hes referencing the map john has id be so confused backward forwards upside down ugh the ghosts look like paper mache held together with gore and undead grudges paper dolls original or paperman chapter 1 dont stop playing games pls your not like other youtubers you dont go yo guys i think i just found a key oh guys what if there is a ghost ohhhhh im hype omg theres a ghost we gotta run john oh hello ghost ive seen you before lets just close the door u should just always let us see ur cursor its a benefit that english dub is really killing me here you say ewww at the roaches in that way like it wouldnt bother you to go in without the insecticide did you forget that many of us saw the insectident of 2019 where you and kimmie had a boss fight in your own home i dont blame the guy for being afraid to touch the roaches ive met some pretty aggressive flying ones in hawaii just looking at them will make them fly right at you paroxetine is generic paxil i took it for years never had an urge to pounce tho its an antidepressant me sees dead body me oh fuck yeah this is gonna be lit i never understood how developers have the eyelid and lower eye area closing when blinking my eyelid closes but not below the eye 1915 whispers its bradley hand well i thought the voice acting in mandarin is just okay but didnt see the english version can be so embarrassing hummm so 2 minutes in it seems we are playing a samurai and a big demon named aku is talking to us beautiful game but gameplay is a little underwhelming games looked interesting but why is it in like 50fov makes me dizzy just looking at it bro i love your channel and i also hate it because its creepy am not supposed to watch your videos in the night man todays 420 youre safe now that jump scare toward the end got me is finding keys and opening doors all there is to this game with the occasional jumpscareghost apparition it seems really repetitive and boring to me for now i was expecting something much better based on the comments nice visuals and asian culture dont necessarily make a good game im kinda suprised john hasnt played the return of the obra dinn yet it seems like a game that would be right up his alley just finished it myself but would love to see johns take on it holy shit can you ever take shit seriously or are you just gonna ruin every note you ever read in every game you play paper man chapter one am not the only one that this looks like resident evil 7 just for the info those are madagaskar roaches and they can bite u and decently strong and even normal roaches can bite u most of the times people just dont gave them chances for this so dont tell they are just roaches p interesting game i would love to see more love this game so far very well done john the only problem i have with this video is that i cant find the second part p this is just a new resident evil 7 i hope the monsters arent fast cause that guy is screwed this game feels like re7 had a baby with fatal frame its awesome do you tink is possible that you can make those funny intros like the concuring hauses for example is there gonna be an extreme gore scene like devotion someone plz tell me that creepy voice at the beginning sounded like one of the gods from skyrim anyone got the devotion vibes 2714 cuz my name is cory kenshin this game seems pretty cool really reminds me a lot of re2 really excited to see more interesting 2714 cory reference i love john i love ancient history im so excited for this i also love seeing john enjoy a game guys voice um john samurais are japanese i got resident evil 7 vibes from this game am i the only one the speaking is so unnatural they pause and elongate parts when speaking that wouldnt sound normal thats why the dialogue seems cringy for me lol still seems like a good game 2530 it really makes me sad how theres no one to laugh together with john theres a dad a daughter and a car crash you killed your family calling it now boy attendant ming i thought ming is name for girl lol a lot of chinese and korean games i like so far they come out with some pretty good story telling games can john play this game with chinese audios and english subtitles instead the english voice actors sound really bad and cringy lol yin house yin fu yin fu sounds like short for yin cao di fu which means hell that guys voice reminds me of molag bal paper dolls what if conjuring house were good i know that i never really comment on ur videos but honestly i love youyour content and every video you have made and i just want to wish you an awesome job for entertaining me for the years ive been on youtube besides im only 11 but a really good job you have done thank you john the amount of times john and cory reference each other in their videos makes me happy i thought the title said rape dolls john will you play when day breaks soma mod please someone tell him when i saw there was a hiding mechanic i thought to myself is this finally a game where youll have to hide from monsters and feel in danger and not one of these boring psychological horror walking simulators where nothing happens besides a few jumpscares the english dub voice acting just kills me xd i dont know if john reads his comment section id imagine but i wanna know what his ideal horror game his perfect horror game just something i was thinking of how fast can you run in half an hour without being exhaust johnny boy theyre just roaches theyre not going to bite ya says the man who lost his shit when a roach went across his screen while playing danganronpa with kimmy yin means after dead while yang means before dead there clearly was a lot of effort in the making of this game and its really refreshing to see something set in chinese culture and history which is a shame cause the game is not that good how did you know that one lock was easy to open john i think youre right im asian myself and my mom had a makeup thingy which used one of those locks all you needed was a flat rectangular piece of metal to insert into the slot and push the lock open but i think anything that could fit into that slot could also push it open like a nail file devotion is way better than this chinese crap lol just to celebrate part 1 i gave you a like lovely its looks alittle like my favorit ghost game project zero 2 so im looking forward for more of it aww its nice to see john enjoy a video game for once now if hed play lone survivor like i keep saying maybe itd happen more than once a month first time ever hearing my name in a horror game i hope molly isnt a little ghost girl this is kinda giving me conjuring house vibes with the key puzzles but in a way more interesting and unique atmosphere cant wait for part 2 i like this game good video and gameplay john puzzlekey hunt with an eastern flair its too bad they dont have a real sprint they included qtes instead of just a stealth or hiding or a certain mechanic like the candle being lit to fight the paper ghost we know the father is ill but we dont know why hes here how the house relates to him so i wish the story was deeper interesting tho i laughed when a writing said they were taking paroxetine to help with pain boy that is anxietydepression medicine and t takes like a week to even work lol otherwise cool game i love asian horror games they actually can give me chills lol ffs wolfe why did you go and start a playthrough of paper dolls now i have to decide whether i watch your playthrough or the one cju games has also began obviously i am aware that i could simply watch both and i could but but and its a rather sizable but i am nevertheless still left pondering whose videos i watch first this may appear completely irrelevant to the rational among youbut to me well this decision could very well ascertain my level of regard for the game as yet i do not intend to play it myself so this will be my only experience of the gameoh mywhat a bothersome dilemma first world problems and all ps and yes i am fully cognizant of my penchant for pontification i love words i dont consider this as horror game but its a good game i always like to watch a good game played this game is like a chinese version of the conjuring house former title looking forward to this series been a little since a game started stressing me out lol im digging this a lot think gggab would play it too is it just me or does it slyly remind anyone of resident evil 7 this was actually very well made episode 2 pls walking all the way back to fill the vase with water seems tedious we couldnt have just filled it with dirt plenty of it on the ground this game really surprised me it is really good horror game this game is super cool so far this game doesnt seem too bad the animation is a little rough and awkward but everything else seems pretty good keep playing its so funny d john you really should consider open a channel on bilibili chinese people love your clips cool game i liked the doll balancing puzzle and i actually like the little girls voice actress lol looks like a chinese version of dark occult kinda wish the ghost will start becoming more of a threat as you progress otherwise whats the point if the hiding mechanic that diary was a trip from start to finish someones been decapitated the title reminds me of the band kittie cant wait for part 2 typeface vinerhand you need to play maybe fortnite ones cant wait for the second part im really enjoying this game ugh dubs always ruin the experience for me it doesnt matter if its a japanese anime an italian movie or a chinese game the horror is always ruined by the subpar dubbers that think they have to overact everything id rather listen to a game in its original language with blaring yellow comic sans subtitles than listen to a terrible impression of a little girl and an overacting teenager the name ding xiang is pronounced as ding shiang in mandarinits actually a kind of flower like clove i believe and in the past maids usually were given nicknames like this they were named after certain plants or other things that are close to the nature im a bad fan i totally just let this play in the background and as it ended i realized how excited you were about the game and now i feel bad because i have no idea what its even about gonna watch again see whats got you so hyped the game looks good looking forward to part 2 somehow i like horror game more if it take place in asia but dont like them in real life haha it just a weird mindset i have with asian countries for being an asian myself not sure if anyone is like that as well ima help ya john only because i went to a museum in toronto and wondered this myself a little bit the yin house is the house for the dead and well meaning hades the yang house is a house for the living youll notice by the colors they use and typically the material thats made out of also the artwork is different as in yin is dark so that the yin is the passing in spiritual sense and yang is more bright colors for the living and fit for the living family full of hope and both black and white sides of the yin yang are used both have an equilibrium yang turns to yin and yin needs yang to survive theyre both halfs of what is believed to be our lives if i had not been in toronto i would not have known some of this knowledge of the houses and why they represent this chinese horror games are the scariest im very exciting for part 2 i dared my friend to play this game on vr and once that thing at 1325 happened he threw the headset on the couch and quit playing watching at 3am this should be fun sarcasm intended really enjoying it cant wait for part 2 at first i thought it was johns dramatic sarcastic narration he does sometimes when he plays a game nope its the game from the trailer it looked like a combination of resident evil 7 and amnesia not gonna watch your gameplay for now but after i will play it cause it got my attention learn chinese with professor wolf this game looks really good cant wait for part 2 i love it when you get sassy im really early in the video but i really hope they licensed out the re engine for this and not stole it somehow 157 when you have a 2 minute limit presentation but didnt prepare anything to say this was pretty cool sort of reminds me of conjuring house but better calling for a john and cory collab 2713 this actually looks really good i always love when there are active enemies running around hiding spaces and puzzles most indie games are just activating events for you to experience like poofing ghosts that walk in front of you while youre exploring the house eyeroll oh its just bugs boi if i have 20 cockroaches festering over me you can bet your ass im not sticking my hand in again who said tha who said that creepy crap to me thank you john i know the reason you show the monster in the thumbnail already but meh i wish you didnt do that it feels less exciting to watch knowing what the monster looks like john you should play dont escape 4 asian horror is the scariest kind of horror too bad their vr version was an utter failure omg this is really good and cant wait for more thank you john i really like this game i look forward to more of this in the future keep up the great work john other youtubers wears normal shirt johnathan wolfe only the finest most classy plaid button ups i like your style so unexpected what a neat game 1627 granny ghost slams door shut after failing to kill as a gesture of courtesy reminds me of this game called hospital bear that i played one time youre in a hospital and you try to masturbate in a dying persons room without the staff catching you you have to pretend that youre a family member and have to make up reasons why youre there all the while trying to masturbate without getting caught in the act by the staff and the patients real family members and then there are other people that come in trying to masturbate alongside you and you have to keep them out because theyre competing with you and if a staff member comes in while youre both masturbating then its an automatic mission fail it makes you think on your toes oh and if the person dies while youre masturbating then the cops show up automatically and you get charged with murder theres also a ghost called mr kentucky in the hospital that jump scares you sometimes oh and they even have the nerve to put in microtransactions as well that game is really really bad unfortunately this game seems to be getting review bombed from asia if you go to their steam store youll see all english reviews are positive but most of the chinese reviews are negative this seems like a pretty good game though looks like 8 people who have watched this video are uncultured swine xd in all seriousness though im really looking forward to seeing more of this game its definitely been a while since ive seen you do a multiple episode game this game also seems like it could be a decent horror game and it actually has a decent storyline so far that has me asking to learn more cant wait to see more yin houseyins mansion yinis a surname in china but yinand yin are homonyms yinhouse means hades in chinese would love to like this video youtube seems t have encountered and error chinese resident evil 7 i agree with you about being pleasantly surprised about this game but holy shit that sprint is pathetic is it me or does every door we unlock sound like a gun being loaded just me okay edit plus i think that whenever you happen to touch an item connected to the spiritghost they appear the first time was a necessity to learn the ghost mechanics and the second time you touched a cloak which looks exactly like what it was wearing although this is the first video ive seen of this game ever so dont completely take my words as the answer potential puzzlelock warning for john it may be too late by now but there is another puzzle that requires a match so try not to light all the candles keep a match on you at all times 3 a common theme ive noticed is that asian doors locks are very honor system based or atleast they rely heavily on the idea that surely no one would use force to open them the locks in this game reminded me yet again like japanese paper sliding doors or the toothpick locks from this gameas well as doors locks from other games in real life from all over asia fattest man in the world investigates haunted house john episode 4 of dont escape was released but you havent played it yetare you holding out on us please someone put that 1010 into some remix hahahsh very cool game so far i like it this one is surprisingly interesting though you do make me dizzy every time you barrel through a door ease down champ xd i like puzzle game like this cant wait part 2 of this game from u jhon keep this up like you said its basic but still cool and you play it so well and professional im really digging this silent hill 1 chinese knockoff so far this game is awesome im waiting for the next video when does a new puppet combo game come out john possibly likes a random steam game what have i died this game looks very interesting john cant wait for part 2 shes walking off because shed be safer walking home then riding with dads junkie ass lol random question but what is fmv looked it up on youtube and its a kpop song in that case does john like kpop oo not to complain but why is it in english unless john picked that in the settings wont be mad if not its just i was expecting chinese with at least english subtitles i was losing my freaking mind with that mirror puzzle it took me way too long to realize i needed to turn off my flashlight hi john i wanna say this in the start of the game if you dont know why you need to burn up the paper ingoti think that make the soul of the head guy go into heaven and the dark wont be there anymore need more ingot paper person chapter one yin house shadow house in mandarin the title of the game translates to paper dolls the first page this game looks pretty fun to be honest but the problem with playing it non vr is that it looks extremely zoomed in to me other than that i find it interesting im fascinated by this game the doors are so detailed it feels very authentic and the main attacking doll is beyond creepy pretty good so far im excited for a part 2 like you said for the first time in a long time need more ingot interesting game so far id definitely watch more intriguing awesome looking forward to the next part decent game so far really enjoying this too nice to see a horror game that is not just absolute garbo for once that beginning giving me the first silent hill vibes wow super impressed so far both the graphics and the puzzles have been good glad to see you enjoying a random game after a couple of stinkers will follow im excited to see where this goes its great to see another decent horror game from another country 107 literally me when something serious takes place and i laugh it off looking handsome in that plaid johnny kinda weird to see you outta the black and red colorscheme you love but definitely not complaining i love these types of games i love eastern mythology beliefs and lore so much its so interesting the only thing i got to say is the sound the hands make give me shivers this is pretty interesting im glad youre gonna play more cuz im enjoying it so far the hand ceiling was pretty creepy the noises it made were unsettling for sure but that was also a pretty cool visual wow great find john very cool game cant wait to see part 2 nice find john paroxetine brand name of paxil is for certain anxiety disorders i know approximate things from work the id badges are self explanatory i dont know why you dont just forge them ive seen them in dramas im glad you found something to do multiple parts on its been a while if you exclude twolfe still need to finish v3 so sorry thanks for playing and editing looking forward to more is this nanny chen hentai sounds intensify cool game cant wait to see more d 325 its a floppy disk please let this comment sink the ending sure thing harshlycritical hi john please check out this kinda new horror game called ang ospital d i love these chinesejapanese horror games but i always think that theyre not the best for playthroughs as they often come from a place of ancient oriental mythologieslegends and so a westerner such as john love ya cant understand using that lightly most of these types of games but then a part of me also thinks that if these sea companies go to the effort of translating their games itd be pretty neat if they maybe included like a document thingy explaining the cultural aspects that make the game what it is so john wouldnt have to say what are these paper ingots for and why the hell am i burning them to get some insect killer ya know has john gotten so bored of american games that hes started to play other country horror games the even scarier chinese horror game is nothing happened at tienanmen square i love this protagonist i swear it looks like every single door he opens he opens with a kick just fuck your doors edit eh maybe he just pushes them open with that weird wave but i like the idea of him kicking every door open like hes in some cheesy action movie more this game seems promising the writing is a little wonky here and there and the daughters voice acting usually elicits a chuckle from me but the game itself isnt terrible which is saying a lot these days besides john made timore of all games a fun watch so this will definitely be enjoyable maybe the dude is just phobic about bugs wow a game thats pretty good legit saw this in steam and was debating on playing it nice video man whats up with the shotgun sound effect at 1313 i was wondering if you are going to play this you are the best john oh god john i have been going back and watching some of your longer playthroughs and i so miss these types of games so badly i am screaming with excitement cant wait its been a while you must construct additional ingots ask and ye shall receive excellent im watching your lethe series right now so hopefully this is good extra creepy im very excited for this playthrough series 165 to comment but this is scary lol achievement unlocked there are ghosts here naw shit sherlock almost didnt click your video because chinese characters on english youtube is usually tied to some boot leg compilation video with watermarks from a bunch of other youtubers this is definitely a good change of pace not that other videos have been bad always enjoy the content but im also excited to see a multipart well made gamevideo series i think the literal translation of the title is paper people the first chapter haha what a coincidence im weaning off paroxetine im excited for this game is this using the same engine as resident evil 7 i am really enjoying this its just spooky enough and i am really interested to see what story the little paper pieces lying around will compile into 515 paroxetine is a prescription drug for depression i took it but had an allergic reaction to it and had to stop you are going to ignore the fact that this game is the same as resident evil 7 thanks john cant wait for pt 2 this seems pretty damn cool looking forward to more why does that monster terrify me so much definitely looks interesting a lot more interesting than i was expecting it to be judging from the voiceacting haha paroxetine is a medicine for anxiety and depression i take that medication for those pretty sure it can also treat other mental illnesses like schizophrenia which would make sense with the deep voice at the beginning might as well think that this whole thing is an hallucination of some sort and the ghosts spirits could be a representation of the voices he hears like the you dont deserves s divinity dunno some probably already commented that or you maybe already figured it out o anyone else paying attention to his shirt im really enjoying this so far while i enjoyed devotion it relied heavily on lots of snippets of audio and video and while it was a great story sometimes it felt like it was bogged down by too much information too quickly this has a more relaxed approach while being in my opinion more of a straight horror game why do we not see vr anymore john you holding out on us or is it because your afraid youre so cute i wish you were gay so i could take you up my ass sounds like hes suffering shell shock really interesting cant wait for part 2 it is working for the diary in chinese but it becomes cringy when its translated into english also its really exciting to see a horror game about the qing dynasty dont hear too many references to black adder anymore paroxetine is used to treat depression panic attacks obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder it works by helping to restore the balance of a certain natural substance serotonin in the brain paroxetine is known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri waiting for another part its like re7 without the combat system which makes sense because fighting ghosts is pretty pointless is this the engine they use for amnesia it looks very similar i was wondering when you were going to play this saw another person play this it looks interesting great gameplay john as always love watching your vids i am guessing you use the tiger bells to open the door once you get the sequence dont forget jhon you owe us 2 games for still scary sundays i your video john oh no is it another deep psychological horror game excited for part 2 ya know mr wolfe in china mtd code red is a delicacy in chinese culture we burn paper ingots for the dead so they can use it as currency in the afterlife or to please the spirits and stop them from creating mischief either of the two lol bring it on john its so nice to watch something you enjoy playing this is nice and all john but ive got one question for you wheres the next episode of sally face are you holding out on us looks like pretty solid game so farhyped for the upcoming parts games with nonsensical puzzles lack creativity imo as if your character is somehow supposed to know that he needs to burn the ingot so that the shadow ghost appears and gives you insecticide resident evil has a similar problem but at least those games have good action a good puzzle makes sense both to the human player logically in terms of its mechanics how to solve it as well as the context of the game worlds setting boy i wish the voice actings in chinese i loved hearing mandarin in devotion damn excellent game tonight last i heard its illigal to depict beheading in china due to its massive cultural meaning and what happened in nan king during ww2 so im actually shocked to see a statue having been beheaded so far this is a cool looking game kinda liked this game not gonna lie im a big fan of games with themes like this one especially if it also involves asian culture aswell exactly how many games now have featured this negligent dad trope i hope he didnt kill his wife this time yessss a series been hurting for a new horror series since resi 2 dropped i get so happy when you and cory reference each other even if its something tiny yall are my favorite youtubers so it gives me the warm and fuzzies 41 mins early do you really want me to die okay as in he is questioning why they are not giving him the right meds so he is like its like the medical staff wants me to die the poor guy also has a pounding not pouncing prob typo in his head hearing many voices shizophrenic part 1 eh its been a while also i resent that theyre just roaches comment im living for these asian horror games i got an ad for literal porn wtf my first theory js that the father has some mental illness and hes losing it his daughter mightve been taken away or she died with him and hes getting punished in hades for killing her or hes in purgatory idk looking forward to part 2 every chinesejapanese horror game ever start of with a car crash only chinese and japanese devs can make a badass horror game hands down even if it means having the typical story plot that man is a bitch just a few bugs lool johns plaid shirt is such a happy shade of blue the beggining is literally silent hill jus roaches my ass another bad dad horror game yay wonder what the story is going to be for this one that colour looks really good on john 244 tbh yeah its cursed but its cute so i will take it the game looks like resident evil 7 especially with the roaches on the arm part im afraid this is going to be another walking simulator horror game an update just when im asking myself that maybe i need to go to bed because it is 3 am but unfortunately i see the that john uploads a new video so im fucked i need to see this xd what a perfet timing to see a new horror video games with the john the best i dont know about anyone else but the way the game looks reminds me of re7 are chinese horror games gonna be a fad now 3 am yeah this sounds like a perfect thing to watch right now never really felt that dolls are scary still they are a pretty underused concept as far as horror games go john the opposite of a normal man to the point where he laughs at horror games instead of being scared of them im going to make paper dolls out of you finally early again the thumbnail looks like the monster caught john eating krabby patties well at least the game is open about the fact that the father is responsible for his daughters death at the very beginning you should play minecraft horror maps john you uploaded while i was at work so i have to wait till i get home dude im confused my youtube says this was uploaded 3 min ago and people have commented 14 min ago when i think paper dolls i immediately think corpse party oh yeah this is gonna be good last taiwanese horror game was a blast john when is sally face episode 5 coming out are you holding out on us 123 am i the only one who thought they were trying to pull some silent hill sm shit here can we get john to play a vr horror and see his reaction can they do another game jam where horror games cant use car crashes or mental illness to make things spooky me i wanna fix my sleeping pattern john uploads ya see the issue here as good as this game looks car crash and child running away right as you happen to wake up cliche is a big red flag thank god u posted u have no idea how much i needed a distraction i take paroxetene and its an antidepressant medication that has nasty withdrawals at least from what ive seen makes sense for the narration of the story hey john will you play dont escape 4 love your vids twelve likes eight comments six views youtube logic lord the monsters in this game lowkey scary hey john have you heard of puppet combos buzzsaw blood house just got done bingewatching maize passed it up so many times because sentient corn cant believe i almost missed out hi john

httpsyoutubebehcydyctwk part 2 httpsyoutube17dwxzwyleq part 3 httpsyoutubet5s7m5besm how do you save the game the puzzle at 11904 i dont understand that worse game ever the controls on this suck so bad and the game looks and feels like it was produced in someones basement waste of money does this net u all the achievements trophies is this game fun scary its on sale for 14 on psn should i get it ok i have a theory about this game the father crazy thats why the daughter said did you take your pills dadthe spirits are really the wife and her family trying to keep the daughter safe and the voices are in his head anyone can add onto this wait this mean that you are trapped inside the house with mr liu awesome video thank you i wasnt sure if i could sit through all the letsplay vids but this way i can enjoy the game with you good job whit de game and good lack and i see you next tame awesome video wolftooth when are you gonna play some extracurricular activities again reminds me of silent hill pt and the dark occult tv14v for the game its like a same of resident evil 7 but taste of chinesemantul this is going on my to watch someone else play list lol cant handle the horror by myself whos here because of searching paper dolls by shawn daley i know brushing bugs off your arm isnt some original concept but the animation looks pretty identical to resident evil 7 waste of money so basically resident evil 7 right sign me in cant have enough of that basically a resident evil vii35 rip off ill pass looks really outdated and boring pass i really wish if fatal frame series to return on playstation platforms the controls are bad for this game have they been updated paper dolls original our pt im going to make paper dolls out of you sorry i had to another pt cheap knockoff playstation direct updates again thanks sonys please ghost of tsushima gb fantasy relink concerete genie lost souls asides wild part 2 etc thanks ps5 too all official release dates new ips games plays trailers too ps5 release dates or weak launch games again or bundled etc too prices too thanks sonys playstation direct updates again thanks aka states of plays thanks sonys i see roaches i close the video this is giving me a fatal frame vibe and i love that game definitely going to look forward to this y u no like xbox you to should be friends silent hills anyone not enamoured by this fatal frame spinoff nothing new but me likey because teen loves blood and violence the bird cage looks very resident evil 7ish xd i dont even know but i got off and i got on and it says sign to playstation network hey sony im 11 but i lost my account is there a way on getting it back ima definitely try this one its not chinese horror if no jumping vampire cool a new dlc for resident evil 7 i was expecting a horror game like little nightmare from the title chinese re7 re7 re34 gameplay with ghost here is the game theme playing this stoned in a dark room with surround sound by myself i didnt know they made a this old house simulator my grandmother will love it 051 minecraft death sound people in the comments section are going nuts again man some of these sound effects are older than i am digital only looks like it should of been a psvr game to bad it isnt might of bought it then very fatal frame speaking of which are they a lever doing a new one fatal frame is that you in another sequel will there ever be a game like this but co op reminds me of fatal frame only part i liked of that was when the main characters friend slapped her no jumping vampires action reminds me of fatal frame for some reason is this resident evil so it basically resident evil 7 with chinese ghost its not the horror game we wanted silent hills but its the one we got oh no not another idiotic walking sim i remember when poiised played this this the game from the go crazy go stupid meme wow this game remind me of fatal frame which is great the horror atmosphere was spot on this game has been out on pc and its absolute garbage fatal frame reboot is this similar to pt t rated horror game interested but highly skeptical it said a hint of asian culture really thats a a whole rip of their way of life mayonnaise always try to appropriate someones else life and called it interpretation how is this different from the game i bought before is there now paper dolls and paper dolls original whats the difference 039 is that the creature from the black lagoon is this vr waste of development shouldve made peetea pls free rhe ps pluss this game is trying too hard to be re7 they even copied the cockroaches scene almost exactly the vr version was terrible in b4 rip etika people comes along resident evil 7 is that you why name it paper dolls original are the monsters real life origamis or is it something else theres no review for switch version actually looks pretty solid i wonder if this is a long gameplay rather than short come on gang we gotta mystery to solve so what is this game puzzle horror wtf this moment 534 really haha looks scary more info httpswpmep7fusp1ry i will be playing this one on the switch looks good but yeah hard gab lol x really enjoyed this playthrough gab ive been subscribed to you now for quite sometime but i honestly hadnt watched much of your content until recently glad im giving your channel a go because ive been enjoying your videos the recent and the not so recent ones it makes my days a bit more enjoyable and bearable ps you have a nice smile i can tell its genuine are you visiting la or did you move there been thinking about grabbing this for psvr did you enjoy it think it warrants an import this mans last life was the hostess of this family and then ruined the entire family yeahlast life he was a woman while i appreciate the new cam i definitely preferred the less intrusive outlined silhouette in the bottom corner did you hear about the guy who 3d printed a paper ball joint sex doll he draws faces on it and colors it they look oddly beautiful and would be great for decorations he apparently has a twitter this guy runs three steps and gets tired excuse me gab dont make fun of people who can only run three steps we have feelings too the game looks so awesome i like the atmosphere and stile so gab is a equally nerdy equally adorable gamer girl equivalent of zna productions the universes are overlapping again i see red candle games confirmed to rerelease devotion 3654 do you have ninety minutes whoa cool background your camera looks so good its been awhile since i watched youtube glad to see such a pretty change is she america hmm thats weird maybe they didnt think of having english subs or subs in other languages while having the dialogue in chinese i always prefer hearing the dialogue in the original language in games movies etc headache the fov wait a minute you and sean are in area 51 this doesnt get any betterr and i wuvvv chuu the new gabcam surprised me o also thank you for posting new asian horrors again d 5621 gab smacks the mic laugh youre telling me this is indie horror looks amazing i remember watching your original clock tower for snes lets play when you were under 2k subscribers you know sometimes i regret buying new headphones when old ones start dying because it means i have to get used to jumpscares actually getting me all over again you should let felix borrow your camera once in a while love this game please finish closed spaces soon thanks gab you rock pockets like mary poppins bag i like the atmosphere of this must try it out cool beanie hi gggab how did you get these games i never heard of it nice i wonder what it is that makes old asian homesteads so much creepier than western ones just hecking screeched and im supposed to be asleep the camera looks awesome af and again pls play bayonetta some day nice nearly puke sound xd that reminds me when sean it does cool vids by the way i was gonna get this game im glad youre playing this because i want to see if this game worst of money or not but theres twelve views yess first great review downloading now on switch didnt see it available in xbl store visually it looks awesome and thank you for the good commentaryyour really good at this nice commentary from the sandman that looks like a good game i just wish it wasnt so dark lots of objects to discover monsters ready to jump out at you you pick up pieces of voodoo doll for a ritual hmmm maybe i need to play this lol the one thing that annoys me really with the game are qte and that the fire in the first 10mins doesnt give off light 4529 that is their lord he is the only one in the story but not in the game yet the protagonist is actually the reincarnation of mrs yin which can be seen in their diaries when they like to look at their childrens clothes in a daze is the kid just gone wth i let out a little scream in the first scene lmao tht got me good how i feel when i open a new bag of chips 1302 basically this game its just like any fatal frame games the only difference is there is no any combat with camera nevertheless this is actually my type of games meaning first chapter apparently therell be other chapter coming out because even in death the madam has the urge to succ hello boy what is the most scary game that you can recommend by the way your channel is great congratulations i almost peed in my pant at 522 lol tfw you struggle to emotionally connect with your daughter so you replace her with a house full of ghosts that hate you annoying as it was i appreciate how the focus of defeating the big bad was a more complicated ghost sealing instead of a plain old boss fight i guess itd have to be since shes been instakilling you throughout the game itself edit nevermind also mr liu was the original spilleroftea whats her most treasured item is it you saving your fucking game i was sent here by matpat gt live channel and now im subscribing man this game is somehow challenging johnthis feels like a trap metotally does anyone know who wrote the music for this game the end chase scene song is awesome u cant know the meaning of the puzzle unless u know chinese most of the puzzle is related to the chinese ideograph 4923 flashback to that review on the jeff the killer ripoff there was sapost tp be a kabooom i was able to read open the door john please play fear this is a lot like chinese fatal frame but without the frame part and with really inconsistent puzzle difficulty lol excellent scary and original the only issue for me was the level of obscurity of the puzzles omg john thank you for the marvin reference that made my day i appreciate how composed and clever you are you remember all the details and truly are the puzzle master lol i mean its entertaining when people are scared but you dont let it stall your progress like some people who would just hide in the closet the whole time lmao the easiest part of making a game nowadays is to make it look good the hardest part of making a game is getting the gameplay right which this game fails miserably at i really dont know what this game is trying to achieve poor story telling non sensical bullshit puzzles poor copycat hiding mechanics dumb ai and i dont even want to complain about the qte the entire game is almost a chaos and im not even interested in the story because i can sense its so mediocre and not worth reading speaking of that ill go ahead and read the story to prove im right im chinese and i dont know what the puzzles mean its just bad game design i thought the game was very well done just the language barrier made it a challenge the horror aspect comes knowing ur helpless and slow the lack of a sprint is annoying then again ur a car accident survivor likely with a leg injury sooooooo i agree with you on the instantkills i think they should at least give you a fighting chance with the ghosts the protagonist also needs like a stamina bar or something so you know what his stamina even is i like the concept of the game but the playability looks super frustrating at times i was even getting frustrated watching you play oh my goodness i dont know why but at around 2858 it just made me laugh so hard the noise he makes i loved this game so much it definitely had its faults but i think the developers did a pretty good job on this so youre told to go upstairs because its midnight only to get the credits and be booted out at the end you get an enemy rush while your character has a stamina of 5 and in all this focus of puzzlesolving sealing playing hide and seek with ghosts the game has lost focus that the mc has his kid to rescue my thought from the previous segment still sticks regarding the qtes and poor execution into the horror and seeing as theyre making a sequel to this i do hope that the devs consider what theyre about to bring on the table especially for the western gamers hell id also would rather have a chinese audio for the characters with english caption as itll keep the verbal nuances intact but thats just me can someone who clearly knows the story explain in a comment essay i would love that the guy at the end is maybe mr liu whoever made these puzzles is a god damn maniac or someone needs to know chinese you mean dolla tree 1440 trumps voice china the localization of this game is really terrible because it is really hard because of the culture and language difference 4145 go upstairs now in chinese version it is more like it is the midnight all the seals will be broken go upstairs now according to chinese tales midnight 2400 is the time when the ghosts power is the strongest and theyll come out this doesnt get translated at all and not to mention the code puzzle the whole poem is not translated and the vital clue todays password and yesterdays password also dont get translated at all as soon as i saw those illustrations of those deaths i thought the killer with the long hair was whoever you said she was but i also thought that see was the protagonists daughter as well because the nanny said it was all because of you i havent seen the end so dont take this as a spoiler im sure someone must have mentioned by now but i think this family is related to the player character they made a point of mentioning the really conspicuous birthmarks on the madams face and the dads 4522 thine t pose hi john do you remember finally you are back at beginning of part 1 if you read my diary and liu diary again you will understand the plot was be connected protagonist his past life was the madam and he was be killed by yin family and liu who told them the truth but the truth isnt truth so the madam soul wouldt want go and she killed all the yin family clue go to hell birthmark child toy here have more clues but i cant explain all in english because im not a good english speaker thanks please correct my mistake i assume this was the bad end for not 100 great job the combination of the 4 wooden tags are the chinese words open and door 2938 this reminds me of videogamedunkeys silent hill video combine the horse shoe with the wax doll and the lighter of course how could i have been so stupid 1724 in mandarin chinese symbol it means khai men or open door that is why that is the puzzle for open the door they just got lazy with that ending it seems also if think we could have been the madam in our previous life considering what wang yong said when the daughter was saying let me go and he said that not even the madam can save her can there be a video that only shows the diaries the drawn deaths and puzzles for this and also can someone explain the story so far or this game i have read a lot of comments here that connected some dots in my head i find this game very interesting and i do look toward to the next chapters as well as john playing them lol you can see the sword guy spawn right at 1428 the comparison to the dark occult seemed spot on when you made it a game that looks really cool n fun to us watching but isnt as good in reality before editing glad you are able to turn a somewhat frustrating playthru into an awesome to watch video series great work as always john im so frustrated that you cant run faster in this game definitely not a horror game 2425 play at 50 speed can quite clearly see samurai mac spawn behind the desk looking straight at you on the right side before you turn left was wondering if this game had actual roaming enemies or just spawned them in at certain intervals at certain distances from the player guess its the latter the character puzzle was actually very easy if you read chinese characters the two characters were and both of which were on the note the complete character means door and the incomplete one means to enter basically you were constructing and placing across from it to symbolize entering something i am chinese and i have also no idea what to do with the last 2 puzzles appreciate john for thinking about the code big time cant believe you killed yourself with the firecracker anybody else hear somebody say help me whenever he open the doors the ost for the boss fight is lit tho indeed this game has excellent art design sound design enemy design music and atmosphere unfortunately its all overshadowed by the excessive amount of quicktime events the story that doesnt really go anywhere instant kills that are often impossible to avoid overly cryptic puzzles and that absolutely pathetic sprint oh no a ghost time to take a few quick steps and then calmly walk away from them to be honest im not looking forward to the sequel yeesh i cant even begin to tell whats going on in the puzzles here im not a fan of qtes either so i definitely understand your frustrations still it had its upsides and im hoping the devs learn from this experience to improve the sequel assuming it does come out itd be fun to watch you play that one as well i know his fort is like harshly critical but this was a very well executed survival horror game they dont make them like this anymore yeah the passcode is kind of difficult if u dont know how to read chinese 2844 yeah you are actually expert on puzzles very cool awesome congratulations john wolfe guys like you and me from west world places hardly achieves figure out the riddle from east world places but cool congratulations john wolfe you were quick to uncover those emblems puzzle the hint was so hard convoluted puzzles and would prefer chinese voice acting with english subtitles also i feel like the whole set up to the game with this guys daughter has nothing to do with the rest of the game other than that pretty good game the gameplay looked like a slog to get through which is unfortunate the story also needs work it wasnt very clear and i feel like those not familiar with chinese culture or maybe anyone really missed a lot through lack of storytelling poor translation and plot holes to hopefully not be continued dude you are scared to easily in case you fake it for views after 30 years of gaming if a monster grab me from my joint i will not even noticed you will become that way to soonnn i dont think a chinese game translate into english version will put chinese puzzles without any explain plus the puzzles are using traditional chineses sadly it isnt the majority i know someone have only learnt simplify chinese cant able understanding every traditional chinese words lorelai is out is there even a point to play this game with that ending where did you come from feeling the pain is this caleb hyles secret channel lol he committed suicide ignoring the ghost girl in the picture right behind the guy lol i thought it was a pretty interesting game like you said the environment and character designs were well made i think they should really add an option to differentiate the speaking language and the subtitle language that way we can listen to the chinese like the characters are supposed to speak but still understand what is happening for example i think what they did with the notes was great you got to see the authentic note while still being able to read it 1750 the wax is a chinese letter puzzle so it may confuse the nonchinese speaker traditional chinese the simplified chinese word is means a door traditional chinese the simplified chinese word is and yeah it is one of the wax when you put them in the specific order you did it combines to which means open the door obviously 2755 its actually a very easy puzzle is the third and the symbol is also the third so you can number the letters in the verse from the top to the bottom for example is 1 is 2 is 3 and so on also the symbols can be numbered in a similar way from the bottom to the top then all you need to do is to remember the number of passcode letters and pick the patterns in the same numbers some aspects of this game remind me a whole lot of fatal frame ii although clearly a better game this wasnt horrible by any means it was actually pretty fresh but i definitely think it needs some serious polishing love the heavy metal death horror music at the end you know at least 1 of the 29 deaths was johns fault he blew himself up 2630 29 symbols there are definitely 910524 symbols right john cant count confirmed failfish lul youre really brilliant as a chinese i can understand those characters but i cannot solve the puzzlesso damn difficult you are so good really john you almost solve a mystery puzzle but somehow youre having difficulties in quick time event button mashing this game has similarites with fatal frame ok someone tell me who said whwhat at 1435 amazing to watch annoying to play my quick opinion earth shattering kaboom theres suppose to be a kaboom alright baldi man that was a go impressionor was it i could never solve that puzzle omg so the main character is a reincarnation of the madam since they both have the birthmark and same symptoms and his daughter is probably the reincarnation of the painter wow john on a wednesday yeeeeeah yeahhhhhh love it yahhhh story was hard to follow so i was sort of confused the entire game i loooved this game i would prefer the audio in chinese and subtitles in english hopefully the publishers offer that in the next chapters 1433 it seems not right it sure does not hahaha u can change the to chapter 1 or will make viewers confused if this is a part of the games name i would like to see the next one but it sounds frustrating to play though i enjoyed watching so in dolls 2 he will find his daughter or mad twist shes now a paper doll to and hes did all this for nothing lol personally i think it wouldve been an awesome touch if the ghosts spoke in chinese with subtitles at the bottom game is run on unreal engine my suggestion is that if youre making a game where the main gameplay and puzzles are heavily based on a culture the you should include obvious hints and explanation of what exactly the player needs to do especially if you plan on making multiple translations including a whole new dub to sell the game to foreigners some of the puzzles are straight up impossible to solve if you dont know mandarin but then whats the point of playing a game if you have to look up a tutorial for the puzzles it was a great but hard game play pamali again because theres something new this really should be called paper dolls the first floor that ending but looks like the sequel is all about the 2nd floor the note said a troupe lived on the 2nd floor this game kind of reminds me of fatal frame thanks for playing what was the point of the child like wtf the question is will john try out the sequel like a conjuring house i like to watch how john is playing this and somehow thailand and china games are really in coming john dont trust the dead bodies i think the guy who made the timore series made it i am not sure but please play it theres a gavel here lol thats actually the vajra hammer which is a tibetan buddhist right hand or method weapon of many deititespretty bad ass just a quick commentary fix the guardian didnt actually commit suicide the girl was possessing him from the looks of the outline around his body also john it would be nice to see you rate the music score in horror games as well from time to time if possible it amazes me how you never look at the map my map memory must be garbo i was so stressed out for john when the quick time event vs the madame was going on i held my breath and everything when he turned around and the sword guy was behind him it scared the ever living daylights outta me one hell of a way to introuce a physical version have floating cds flying around i liked this when you get jump scared its the best because its so rare solving the da vinci code with john 4154 thats some sweet music who is the guy in the last cutscrnes who push us back into the house this is one of those games that i was really happy to find your videos for the atmosphere at least at first was really cool and i love the setting if they could clean it up overall it could be a really cool series of games i had a blast and im really glad you played this the jump scares would have pissed me off and i would have quit xd my favorite part was that girl who kept undoing your seals yall just kept casually walking past each other while working on the seals xd the ending was a bit instant this game looks pretty good from what ive seen love the environment and feel of the game re7 chinese edition everything was fine until you didnt fine your lost daughter lol congratulations for finishing chapter one regarding the wooden tag puzzle the 3 tags you put on the same side combines to form the word open in chinese and the last tag on the other side means door the exhibition hall verse actually has a hidden message in which you have to read diagonally from the top right towards the bottom left which translated as open door to see treasure and yep it is rather unfair for international players not surprised that there will be a sequel since the chinese title is literally paper dolls chapter one ok but does anyone know the song during the final boss rush thats a good song you should play the sequel bc i bet itll pat down its weaknesses in the sequel its the same for me it had a lot of potential and polish but it fell flat as a game on so many points great atmosphere and aesthetic but needs to be longer i really enjoyed this game playthrough i loved the aesthetic i hope that if they do get to making a sequel that youll still play it for us maybe theyll fix some of the issues if i was playing this i can definitely see how it would be frustrating but from a watcher it was a really good series the game looked great graphically and the ghosts were scary and original so i loved it id love to see more of this game when part 2 comes out great job even with the mentioned flaws i dont feel like ive seen john fundamentally enjoy his time with an indie game as much as he seemingly did with this one in quite a while im down for a chapter 2 if they make it in a way that you wont need to complain as much i enjoy your videos but it sucks hearing people complain about games hell it sucks when a game does something complain worthy i hate having to complain about games and i hate hearing about it cause it lessens the enjoyment of the game for everyone every game has some kinda little meh thing but when theres so many that everything that comes out of your mouth is wtf or is this for real it loses its entertainment value plus did we ever find out what happened to the daughter this is not a complete game by any standings its clearly got issues no real resolution on where you are or what happened to your daughter theres so many qtes that i wouldve thought we were watching a shitty chinese ripoff of until dawn the designs and music are good it really felt like i was watching the aftermath of one of my favorite wuxia novels and trust me when i see you havent anyone know what the story and ending is about youre doing a intro for thursday hope so john knows go asdhhdfjgfjgkgkfl haha im so use to his schedule i havent watched until thursday this game is pretty bad but at least its better than some crap actually the plates on the table are the clues of the puzzle too there are 2 sets of password in cloakroom password note yesterdays passcode and todays passcode the plates on the table is referring to yesterdays passcode thats why you pick the third plate on table as your first passcode why his subscribers are not raising fast paper doll original theres more version of that game the guardian was actually possessed by the ghost and killed him yesss a wednesday john post some riddles seems difficult for john to solve because it was written in chinese oh man at 14281430 the sword guy literally just poofs in the room with john right there admittedly it took like 5 rewinds to see it clearly but i am rolling lmfao xd xd and about the cloakroom puzzle its actually a lot easier than you thought the third character on the first column reading from right to left is marked with a 3 while the icon marked with a 3 is the third one from last and on the first column reading from left to right so at this point you just have to find out the number for the characters on the second pictureup to bottom right to left then go look it up on the third one bottom to up left to right both picture 2 and picture 3 has 24 charactersicons i really appreciate your effort to solve the chinese symbol puzzle thats some next level knowledge right there gee the localization did a garbage job on explaining some of the basics in chinese culture the first thing about candles is that in common belief candle lights glow green when a ghost is nearby the most infuriating part is the puzzle that contains a hiddenword poem if you read from the top right to bottom left its open the door and the treasure shall reveal itself and the word open is split into 3 wooden pieces basically place open on a side and door on the other somehow the localization team never thought itd be a problem to those who know nothing about the chinese culture but what happened to the story that made him go there like his daughter so john broke his schedule because there is something big coming huh well if john gets excited over it it must be good right knowing that john is a hardcore horror game player this new game should be pretty darn good lets hope it lives up to the hype no idea what it could be tho and his daughter iswhere exactly yo john not recommending the game is a bit hard dont u think its pretty good compared to most of what we usually see its interesting to see these games based on different mythologies and stuff like that some of those puzzles were nuts though yeah i dunno why what happened to the daughter is left up in the air like that unless i missed something playing this must have felt frustrating but i really enjoyed it as a viewer the ending is weird af i hope you play the next one despite some of the gameplay being annoying i liked watching you play this one scary games in china is just at its roughly start so therere still many flaws in them paper doll original is like the first decent scary game that ive seen i know the game wasnt that perfect but please give it some time by the way ive found out another scary chinese game that worth played with its called the 3rd building the game isnt officially released yet but the free demo is available soon please play it as well and record it for us thank you a lot not as good as conjuring house imo and that game fell off half way through aww you add my friend to steam bbut you dont add me shame one of the biggest problems with this game apart from the ludicrous puzzles seems to be that the main character is a slowass bitch i spend hours of each day sitting on my ass and even i am better at cardio than this guy xd 4000 i guess sealing the ghosts was only a temporary solution nanny chen cant be nanny chen cause shes dead realizes is a ghost sealed someone looked at the conjuring housedark occult and said how can i make it less fun and more tedious the literal translation of the game title is paper doll chapter one and there is going to be more of this game as for the 4woodentag problem simplified chinese and traditional chinese means open traditional chinese means door the rest two tags are the left and right part of the solution is assembling traditional chinese open door my name isnt guys watching john break himself trying to decipher chinese puzzles in a completely different language has made my night the aesthetics are nice and all but the gameplay seems more tedious than scary or exciting i they just need to remove the 1 sec lasting running bullshit and it will be a truly decent game you would have certainly died way less if you could just run as for the exhibition puzzle that was actually fine because you were just supposed to figure which one of the characters displayed on the paper that you can form with the pieces thanks for breaking your upload schedule for this it was enjoyable to watch you play jon what were we doing again oh yeah my kid was stolen i like how he says he gotten better at the quicktiming towards the end but then fails hella afterwards lol 3127 nope he was stabbed in the back our lady assassin is drawn in a light grey while the victim is in a bolder black color kudos on trying to solve the puzzles on your own but damn the end part was a lot of what you werent strong at the qte i enjoyed chinese ghost resident evil 7 even though the story had some gaps or localization issues and the ending wasnt great get on that lil misfortune on itchio thank you really enjoyed this game i made popcorn during the first ad and as soon as i opened the door i got scared shitless because all i heard was heeeey from your intro at max volume the popcorn didnt make it loved the vid you should definitely be able to juke the ghosts thats not fair what the fuck happened to the daughter the unlocking noises remind me of cry of fearthey sound kinda similar i have no idea why but 1434 jump scared me lol i about jumped off my bed 2533 that life when a puzzle game becomes a class project so to summarizetheorize the story of this game for anyone whos having trouble understanding it or even wants to brainstorm with me you play as the painter who came into the yin family to make paintings i assume since its one of the only mentioned characters aside from lord and lady one of which we can rule out by default that has no paper doll i also conclude that from nanny chen saying you ruined the entire yin family because the protagonist is the one setting in motion the ladys madness by impregnating her with a child that she then loses also wang being like not even the lady can help you now when chasing him she probably tried with her husband plenty of times and couldnt get a child it just seems to me like one of those stories also by the the painter comes along and the lady immediately gets preggo didnt the lord think anything of it diary part of our local gossip queen just kinda gives me the vibes i could be wrong anyhow their s did the game just like totally forget about the protags daughter lol hopefully if a second game does come out it will clear it up i know you had your issues with the game so did i but i greatly enjoyed the atmosphere and the plot minus the daughter part it was interesting and spooky and i loved getting to know the drama in the house when theres a sequel i hope you get to play i loved john cracking the code it was really funny and awesome too watch keep up the great work john are you going to play dont escape 4 anyway the visuals are goodbut i completely forgot about the main characters kid i love john he deserves way more subscribers than he has boss rush music actually slaps thanks for the vid john im happy about the chinese culture incorporation i am iffy on the quick time events the story is why are you even there wheres your kid why would it matter if youre on anxiety meds and i dont know if sequel baiting is right its episodic im unsure it does suck that it has some barriers on a cultural aspect its hard to judge an episodic game until you play the whole thing thank you for playing editing and hope to see lorelai when it comes out i wonder if john is gonna play days gone i was really excited to see the end of this thanks for uploading early it looks like its a game that would be frustrating to play with so many instakills and qtes but it was really cool to watch i always love seeing games that draw heavily on another culture it makes for really different kinds of experiences than the typical steamitchio fare i do agree that the ending is abrupt and im still not sure how this all relates to finding his daughter but i still enjoyed this playthrough a lot cool game concept and mechanics im curious to see how the next one turns out unexpected surprise upload from john yesssssss this is going to be a blessed day i played it and i liked it its a decent game my experience with it was fun my favorite thing about it is the atmosphere 2742 when you try to solve a puzzle so hard you become asian john acting like nicholas cage in national treasure ik theres going to be a follow upsequel but i feel as if the developers lost the main goal of the game to find a missing daughter we never got to find out how we went from driving a car to some old creepy house thank you its mrlui i love how he patiently waited while you sealed his soul for all of eternity loved it even with the quicktime stuff cant wait for the next time hope you play the next one john you should play sonic forcesits so good btw love your videos keep doing you something big on thursdaygonna take a guess heredays gone gameplay nice play kiss your vegana from india the death of the guardian image actually looks like she possessed his arms and made him stab himself you can see her smiling face next to his and theres a wobbly ghostly line around him 052 actually got me for some reason xd did anyone notice just how hard he was hitting that e in that last part devotion was better 0ooooooooooooooooh oo youre the best 723 dammit john dumb sht like this is why i keep coming back lmao i thought this game was amazing thanks for playing john i feel like the developers forgot there was suppose to be a daughter shit your still not dun with this game i didnt watching for two i should have to do that before i watch this one its almost like you have to be chinese to work out those puzzles oh wait i believes the full release of it moves is out now john i know its been a long time but i think it may be a good experience edit i personally was really impressed by paper dolls the localisation translations sounded off because it can often be really hard to translate chinese to english without the over exaggerated wording the puzzles did have answers that could have been worked out although hard and i think that worked in the games favour i myself really enjoy having hard puzzles to test myself with but maybe a hint or two couldnt have gone amiss great series john just from watching your playthrough i would say they need to make the sprint longer decrease quicktime events and instantkills maybe put in some more puzzle hints for those more difficult ones also agree with others that you should be allowed to choose chinese voice acting with english subtitles and text maybe the chinese voices are better haha did look beautiful and interesting setting and story though hurry up and learn chinese for the next game john chop chop no commercials did this video get claimed or something i hope john is making some coin for this at the beginning she gave you her sacred slurp neat game localization is a lot better than just so many foreignmade games i think the overall positives greatly outweigh the negatives im excited for tomorrow first time ive been invested in a story for a while at 1427 you can see him on the right side of the screen for a split second kind of just pop into existence lol at that moment you saw the female ghost your cursor went nuts cry of fear confirmed the guardian looks like the swamp thing dressed as a samurai i dont speak for all chinese but i dont see the connections between the verse and the last puzzle maybe i am just too dumb the wooden tag one however simplified chinese for open simplified chinese for door and dont know if it is relevant the traditional chinese for open is john announces he has something big planned for tomorrow me gets more hyped for the tease than i do for a nintendo direct john guys hey its maybe this was like a test game im so confused on the storyyoure in the car with your kidand what that sword guy either wang yong or yin zhong came out of nowhere when you were solving the clock puzzle literally scared the shit outta me 1431 1858 2034 okay this guy is starting to cheese me off even though the screen with his random teleporting bullshit ugh 2132 ooh so the madam is the same woman as here 052 and here 1154 that killed all of them and drew pictures about it maybe the one telling us what to do is the lord hm ok so i know you eventually had to look up the cloakroom puzzle solution but the fact that before looking it up you actually got 3 of the 4 symbols correct on a rather difficult puzzle that is also in a foreign language and not just any foreign language but chinese is truly a testament to your mastery of puzzle solving abilities you never cease to amaze and impress now if only there were no quick time events lol i have been waiting for the ending of this game i really like it its got great atmosphere and interesting puzzles i think that if there are instakills the sprint should be more that a couple of steps because you really cant run away i enjoyed watching this though as its a bit different from most horror games yeayfinally been waiting for this upload pronouncing a chinese name purposely wong seems a touch offensive wang not wong you wang i really liked the visuals and ambience of the game and for me who likes watching youtube videos of horror games rather than playing them that made it a very enjoyable watch i also liked how the story was slowly revealed to us that was the worst ending ive ever seen in a game start game back up and ganked one thing i kept noticing that bugged me throughout the entire playthrough was that the noise for unlocking a door sounded a whole lot like reloading a gun in other games lol get ready for the sequel plastic dolls am i going to be featured in tomorrows video i better be edit ill dislike tomorrows video if im not mentioned the game looks reslly impressive but the payoff wasnt that great the ending was confusing and didmt give the player enough for beating it 1228 not the first asian game only saying this because i cant speak about other games ive only seen korean and japanese games do this and now chinese i guess ive seen that doesnt translate something a game thats kinda like 999 and vlr virtues last reward called steinsgate 0 left a few things like notes untranslated mostly emoji responses to texts nothing too important like the letter here with the hall verse possibly might be because its a bitch to translate to english kinda like the japanese kagome kagome but then again like thats your job as a translator find some way to translate it and a kinda sequel or game in the same universe as steinsgate called chaoschild legitimately leaves a fucking entire route untranslated in the sense that you cannot complete the route becuase a map wasnt translated i guess oversights happen but what is with these games leaving things untranslated to give the korean example i believe white day left somet i agree with you on the strengths and weakness of the game the atmosphere was really well done i sometimes had to pause the video because i got too spooked the symbol puzzle is just having the chinese characters from the verse listed from right to left top to bottom so is the third character while the symbols from the cipher are listed from bottom to top left to right so for the left code itll be the 3rd 10th 15th and 22nd characters though the chinese says its the code for yesterday and the right code in chinese it says its the one for today is the 15th 23rd 11th and 6th characters in that order transferring that to the symbol cipher and youll get the sequence play little misfortune well the demo this had a lot of good elements to it and overall i liked it a lot they need to fix sprint and auto kill and that puzzle is awful for anyone unfamiliar with chinese characters also what happened to his daughter omg i hope the ending if the 2nd one blends into the gameplay better than this i think the bosses should be a little easier to escape from or at least the quick time events should maybe use different keys overall the game was pretty great until the end while i do agree with everything john said i actually really enjoyed this game and am looking forward to the sequel if it ever gets made if it gets released could you play ti and let us see what its like thanks john love you 3 man youtube is all kinds of wonky tonight i keep trying to comment and it just keeps making my timestamps wrong are you holding out on us youtube im pretty sure you were on the right track with the last puzzle you just needed to rotate it 90 degrees and you would have had it not quite sure what the clue is for rotating it though started watching maxhorror play this but the no commentary gameplay stopped me from finishing so i was really glad you decided to pick up this series a nice change from the random horror games that i still thoroughly enjoy and he dies like 55 seconds into the video including intro i was not expecting the swordsman when john gone back to the clock 3 3 3 an unscheduled john video thank you im curious about the surprise playthrough i cant wait your such a tease lol i am going to do a steam review but thought i would put this here in case the devs see this video and read the comments this really makes me sad this game looks so good and has such a unique concept dont really like the intro and thats how the mc ends up being there somehow feel like there could be such a better intro story of why he is there with his daughter love the paperdolls and doing the rituals to bind them the story is interesting to learn i like most of the puzzles i bought the game and when i play it its going to be on easy so i can enjoy the game without the majority of the involvement of the enemies feedback based on the videos alone please devs do an update to increase the length of the running time a lot make hiding quicker like after you click ctrl you hope into the closet faster add the option to have chinese voice acting but with english subtitles and english document translations when looking at items in the inventory i was thinking that firecracker had a short fuse didnt expect it to blow up in your face like that though that had me laughing just in time for my lunch break hey guys its john and today we are playing paper dolls this isnt sponsored so dont ask ok lets get to it rip upload schedule love ya john i mean i guess there should be more of the game because ending on that would be not great since yeah etc about his daughter and 2 nothing is really solved apparently the spirits arent even sealed and he didnt escape the house or realize there is no escape and is even further from the exit so it seems like an unfinished story i would love for the surprise to be days gone its my birthday on thursday and im so excited to see what is coming up i hope its more of you reading your stories good thing you uploaded the last part earlier wouldnt want to wait until the weekend for an ending that borderlines youescapedpng well the end was too sudden for me hardcore music changes abruptly into some softcore track house seems different in the credits scene too and then we get a to be continued and the house looks creepy again and wheres the protagonist daughter what a disappointing ending imo ps what was even the point of sealing the dolls if they reappear at the end i guess they werent that grateful after all sorry you are wrong this game is made in china the story is also coming to china it is not a japanese game the whole intstakill thing was a drawback for me for sure it went on sale for psvr and if i am in the helmet i am the protag i dont think i need to die 100x and rage quit to see what i am really made of if qt events are involved chances arei already know tecnically you did solve it by your own because theres was now way getting the 4 circle maby the walkthrough did what you did and just randomly puting in so yea folks its the last episode of sally face thats the big surprise thursday looks like a fun game but the quick time puzzles seem like hell ending was not even slightly fulfilling i really liked the game and im exited for a sequel as you said it had a couple rather shitty and easy to solve errors the puzzles need a way to be as hard as they are but not as confusing it could easily be solved with more translation or puzzles that dont include language symbols the ghosts needs a bit more time in between from when you start to hear their footsteps and when they closed you in a small space i think the quicktime events were alright and being a challenge was cool the end part was awesome imo running from them all at the same time but sometimes it just felt like poof you died from how fast they reached you for the rest id ask more of it more ghosts more puzzles and improved more rooms and hopefully a bit more space to move in more mechanics too whenever a key goes into a lock it sounds like a gun cocking also of course the dude is out of breath in the sequel trailer lmfao johns version of totally japanese 2126 i will come and feast on your flesh remember to spice it well john who else was all christmas came early when they saw this up just me whoa an upload on a wednesday is this the return of other john pssssst whispers hey if you are other john please let real john know about this free ps1 style horror game on steam thats actually worth his time concluse thanks unless you missed something i dont think they gave you enough information for the pass code sequence john uploading irregular to his upload schedule he really was holding out on us he hates his faaaaaaaaans unrelated edit that ive been too hesitant to say am i the only one who thinks the unlocking noise sounds like a gun loading ffs they ended it with you getting chest bumped down the stairs after being frightened by flowers i think those were flowers anyway not even a hint of your daughter besides getting a bunny chucked at your head id have even taken just a girls voice whimpering or calling out for her dad something they spent so much time building up the plot of the homes ghosts and severely neglected the story of the main character and his daughter i got the vibe the house is the wifes ancestral home maybe which is why some of the ghosts say things like you dont deserve her or that you brought shame on the familys name so next one will probably be about fighting the circus troupe in which case maybe some freaky contortionist visuals to look forward to not flowers its actually paper money burned for the dead thanks to ralen gao for the correction you know what would awesome if the something big john is talking about is a jeff the killer game um actually go is called weichi in china jk jk jk really frustrating with that tile puzzle it feels like there is zero possibility you could get three of the tiles correct and not have been on the right path i wonder if they just put the wrong solution in and messed it up somehow 4515 spooky chinese ghost bursts open door and aggressively tposes at unsuspecting man im so excited for thursday what do you have up your sleeve john you uploaded on a wednesday you spoil us when did he seal up the ghost i was looking for this im new so i thought you just gave up omg is face at 1436 xd i think i never saw it before xd is dungeon nightmares 1 and 2 still scary 1440 into video john where did he come from curious me slows video to 05 as to see where the sword man spawned also me sees him insta spawn in the right corner and goes straight for john rest in spaghet of unfair spawn xd yoo much love never fails to make a man giggle tears of joy i completely forgot the protag was looking for his kid isnt that how the story begins 3702 johns tongue tho i wonder what john has planned for tomorrow im always excited to see more of his great content keep up the awesome work john 535 walks right into the closet right in front of him hell never find me in here hi john with regards to the cloakroom puzzle if you look on the cloakroom verse the symbol marked with 3 is the 3rd one down so you start with 1 at the top and count down from top right to bottom left assigning each symbol with a number then for the pattern code you do the same thing but go from bottom left to top right ignoring the symbols where the page is torn it makes 24 on each page then you find the symbols that are on the password figure out which number they are on the verse and then find the same numbered symbol on the pattern code hope this makes sense that marvin the martian reference made me so happy thank you john d 4028 aint nobody safe whhhaaaa i really like how this game was made and set i feel like maybe it gets a little repetitive feeling eventually but i dont mind with storybased games i love folklore and i love trying to piece together how everything happened with notes i know its not a new concept but it falls into the category of devotion what remains of edith finch and unforgiving it may not be as developed in the way of storytelling but i think it the developers did an excellent job and should be immensely proud of the final product i know not many of us like the voices but i think that could be overlooked episode part 3 thursday john is it dont escape 4 on thursday or maybe hmmmmmm marvin the martian impression was perfect 647 i blew myself up achmed would be so proud of john wolfe im might be able to watch the uplaod he secretly watched the walkthrough lol anyone notice how quickly hes figuring everything out insert comment here just kidding this is my reward for passing my test today notification squad hollaaaaa this game is

youll get easter dinner with your family at least and a bit of rr please do another video thank you for thr hard effort to making videos for those unfamiliar with chinese culture that basin he had to put the gold ignots in the beginning is used as a form of offering to the dead im going to guess that one of the plot lines maybe is that pretty maid girl got raped and her spirit became vengeful so thats why they put those bells in place also those red seals on the doors are usually to keep in or ward off evilghosts so it would be pretty interesting to see whats behind them cant wait for part two ha ha happy easter hope the frigging bunneh can find you at work to drop off some goodies this is an interesting game moar please i would really like to see part 2 hope everything goes well at work and you get a good rest afterwardswe will be here for future parts stay good cju would love to see more of this is it just me or does anyone else get a resident evil 7 feel in the graphics at least fun walkthrough though nicely done its defiantly an interesting game so far i am noticing a few things that might be a bit concerning and i looked up the game an so far the reviews are mixed most reviews are in chinese so it is considering if the small issues that im seeing might become a big issue later in the game yes i love asian horror games this one has such a creepy atmosphere please play more cju never a good sign when someone asks the driver if they took there pills today definitely we want more more please i want another video i got home sweet home vibes i certainly do want to see more of this game its worth waiting a few days for the next part it was so cool i loved it love it cant wait for part 2 the game seems very interesting and its asian so itll definitely be terrifying as it progresses and yes keep playing this this looks good thank goodness for this channel because john wolfes channel went to shit im so offended your video wasnt recommeded for me or the notification who click cjugames video in immediately hey guy love your videos i was just wondering if you were thinking of ever doing a top ten best or worst games youve played or recommending the

mirrors edge king of fighters xiv 60 second conjuring house dark occult dd ive been waiting for you three days man finally aw shit here we go again omg tq laowu for ur hard work iloveu i think you would like shadow corridor i am here because i cant play the game on my own just watching you play seems im the one playing anyone else a fan of similar run and hide horror titles such as remotheredhome sweet homeoutlast 1443 that is actually a modified name for vajrakilaya a tibetbuddhism vidyaraja hey chris would you ever consider playing the fatal frame games 1926 reminds me of that and i oop video i was instinctively pressing shift as you ran that was the most terrifying part of the game so far black sugar thats what she called me hehehe 2805 nigga i threw my phone what the f why cant the character go any fasteri am completely caught off guard hahai screamed that running mechanic is the only thing that sticks out like a sore thumb the game looks fun but for the run to only last a second it might as well not exist at all someone asked if maybe youre supposed to tap the button to make him sprint lol that sounds silly though please make part 3 fast 2814 best jump scare yet jesus christ love ur videos bro keep it up maybe tap shift to run probs not but worth trying gets violently stabbed i was reading fair point cju loving this this episode was very entertaining i am always impressed how smart you play i am ashamed a little how randomly i do things in games all those deaths were fun the first time i even gasped when he opened the wardrobe doors another horror mansion with multiple rooms and puzzle pieces you need to remember that brain on you is a masochist part 3 please seems a bit too unfair that you cant run properly love this game though love yo vides keep it up hey you should play days gone according to the clues dingxiang did not kill herself nanny chen killed her and faked her suicide walk away very slowly while someones trying to kill you game logic character must be a heavy smoker excited ive been waiting for this whilst enjoying your other vids love it cant wait for part 3 those ghosts are freaky af that is one creepy looking bad guy well doneoh not really i believe you will solve this case omg keep playing this game please its amazing simply amazing you are putting up a fight im liking this the lack of stamina makes me worry game is rough harsh but interesting thaaaaaaaank youuuuuuuuu multimegahappyfunscarybloodydeathssimply the yin and yang of it this game isnt fantastic but its a delight to watch you play it i think the sprint is bugged might as well take off the sprinting mechanic if they made it like that its more like a stride than an actual sprint this game is definitely a diamond in the rough i hope the developers enjoy some success with this one so they can make the next game amazing is the boy in the secret closet ming and screw that firebell puzzle wow cju i tip my hat for you that was a beast of a tiger bell puzzle youre the first person ive seen figure out how to reveal the full tiger bell document and the entire tiger bell door puzzle good on ya run just ruuuuuokay forget it take all the time you need its not that important to survive honestly we should give this guy a rollator the truest horror of all is your main characters love of old man shuffling and revulsion of brisk jogs maybe the main character did do something to cause the fall of the yin family what if those voices he was hearing in the beginning to go to hell were actually the voices of the ghosts of the yin family members i am really enjoying this game its a shame the character you are playing as is so slow this dude needs to have a talk with the madman from scared of monster game thingie and that is how you sprint for more than 1 sec also you might wanna try and stand on their heads youve probably tried but im curious if you tap the run key repeatedly does that not work for running faster because the time of the sprint is just ridiculously short doesnt make sense glad youre continuing this game roses are red violets are blue i could watch pewdiepie but id rather watch cju ok ill kill myself now cju have you ever met any of your fans on the street or anywhere else i would definitely like to take a picture with you but sadly i live very far from uk do your thinking in the save room smartest revelation i have heard yet from you while you play this lol maybe you have skinny jeans on restricting your range of movement looks good so far hope you had a nice easter even tho you had to work really should light all the candles anyone here just because dont have courage to play game on their own wooooohoooo wake up all thanx cju finally i almost sleep finally im intrigued im digging the atmosphere so ill keep my eye out for this and the opera masked guy is the strongest monster in the game 154 the guy is a good guy the knife is to kill the opera masked guy dude john samurai is japanese buddy this is chinese haha im not a big fan of the patrolling ghost honestly the reason why you cant run is if you remember that the little girl before the crash she said that you stop taking pills that may be a reason why you dont run a lot the main character may have some kind of condition nanny is everything and everywhere john the samurai is after me weebs everywhere samurais are japanese 222 the sound of the falling boards repeat john you call him a samurai one more time im gonna hit a vape and cut my lungs out so it looks like my ghost is leaving my body maybe to get the key you need to light the room first and then samurai ghost cant be there the menu tells you to light candles for a reason maybe thats it john i love you but sometimes your brain doesnt process things and it just makes me smack my face fire is put out john wolfe is also put out not mr liu i wanted to hear more hot gossip john the wang in wang yong is said like half of want and half of hung so wang the yong is said like yo and half of hung not wang as in how its said in the first half of wack hahaha that old woman ghost reminds me of the mimics from prey 2017 i hate wasd quick time events to i type really fast but find those a pain and it sucks that its instant death i wish it was a damage system oh he is patrolling what an asshole made my fucking day mischief was because the kid used to hid in the cabinets and they would still reward him with candy and then he would give up the key its a good game but you have to face the cultural differences i have seen a chinese youtuber playing the game perfectly hehe this is how fast i run in my nightmares did you ever finish this game i enjoyed it sarcasticjohn has no time for shenannygans p odd most mimics are monster chests not oldladyghost chests it sounds like they could only find two or three voice actors to do the english version and then had them either physically change their voices like with nanny chen or pitch shift it afterwards like with molly 1640 shaggy was smoking alot in this place you either beat the wang or the wang beats you outstanding voice acting love it ha im gonna be honest as a horror fan as soon as youwe saw a hiding spot i knew this game was trash like its fine to have a horror game with combat that doesnt make it not a horror game but these indie games seem allergic to having combat in their games and it literally always always always get reduced to this lots of running around lots of hiding and in this video lots of reloading save points from instant death enemies its boring antithetical to fun and a blight on the genre what sucks is this game has some great production values and pretty clever puzzles but its all wasted when the same enemy kills you every two minutes or a puzzle is impossible to really soak in because some asshole keeps stalking you for some reason i dont think this game is scary came here because of matpat watched all the way through and because you told me to i subscribed can someone tell me what to do i move the vase at 2722 so i cant open the door to put silver bracetles on statue can someone help me please my chinese name is shi min and yes i know it sounds like a girls name and yes i am a girl is just i dress as a boy thats all hmm i dont know now what to think of this game the exploration sealing and finding pieces of the lore was interesting but i felt that they couldve done better with the scare factor the repeated qtes not to mention the voice acting was putting me off cant believe you couldnt notice the sound of that dripping water and it was putting out the fire i love how you save using the incense i remember as a child my grandmother putting those incense sticks into little cans and bowls just like that filled with sand 1158 bruh with your triple chin lookin ass these puzzles are pretty dumb no fair the evil spirit can walk through closed doors made me realize ive been binge watching your channel without being subbed fair enough subbed this is the storymiss yin was found to be with child after the artist come but actually there is no evidence to prove miss yin did something with the artist but yinzhongthe butler and wangyongthat red guy and chen suspected the artist was the father and liu exacerbated there dubt so yinzhong killed the artist chen killed miss yin and dingxiangmiss yins maid and then miss yin became a gost she killed everybody in this house mollys father is miss yins reincarnation this is why the butler sad you are finally back by the way molly maybe the artists reincarnation great 2528 thats german you ignorant sack of turd in the save room above the incenseis that guanyin honestly this reminds me of that game the one that he played it was very forgettable and 20 hours long this game is like that one done right in my opinion it was called something house i think edit just saw the name in the comments its conjuring house everyone i found out a huge piece of lore when john seals ming xiang he says help me sister ding xiang the madam is so scary does that mean we are the madam in our previous life as hinted in the first video with the note on drugs wait what the boy said when he got sealed so the madam is the protagonist in his past life i like how the notes actually have relevance it tells a story and gives hints like the comb and the beard if you want to solve the bells puzzlefirst you should get the paper wetthen you could see several different patternsyou just need to count the number of same color patternsascending is the order you should pick the bell fire is put out not goes out which implies that something put it out sorry to correct you but deutsch is not dutch it is the german word for german xd i played this game myself and i did enjoy it but my only criticism as an international player would be that the developers really need to explain the significance of what you are doing as i had to look it up and learn though it was extremely interesting it would have been nice to learn during game play as i had to look up after it really takes away the immersion john ha thats right walk away ghost walks away john where did he go the thumbnail looks like a glukkon from abes oddyssey i hate it when i say its an achievement when its something you already have to do no matter what so is it really an achievement is everyone whens it gets one or whatever thats not an achievement is just a mission completed so stupid lol this is really good yes i get the draw banks are pretty harsh but loving the multi part game videos reminds me of coc last november nice to see john finally enjoying a game he actually cares to put time intobeen a while since iv seen him find a game with such promises congrats john 305 monster reminds me of creature from the black lagoon from the 50s unfortunately the guy who holds a sword and chasing you is wangyong 365000 i hope the third part will be coming soon i really like this series gj john deutsch is not dutch by the way its german its nice to see how the gamejohn progress i enjoy it 1830 lol omg ive never seen john get so scared in my life from when i started watching this channel that was hilarious im from san antonio big shouts john calls himself a puzzle master looks up how to solve a puzzle dutch and french are odd choices lol well educated man i would really love to see the end of this john what happened when the light of the light turns green it is when they appear quickly run to the room to save the game or hide into the closet my favorite line of this whole game oh he is patrollingwhat an asshole this kinda reminds me of death mark missed a paper in the cabinet you opened with the match and the book love this game but cant shell out the 20 for it right now hope you upload part 3 soon 2516 i havent issues with the english voices acting in asian games neither others johnthats good to me at least d will you also play blackout do you have to tap run repeatedly to make him run maybe have you checked sound option sometimes the voice over is under the sounds 2042 with the little string on the door a drop of water was dripping on it that water is what was putting the fire out so the drop is blocked when you move the book the full panic on johns face when the guardian glided through the door right in front of his face priceless 2422 granny is an evil sheep hes patrolling what an asshole hes patrolling what an asshole 808 so good this moment what an asshole oh no he spot me now hes mad xddd im guessing the player charactr is the reincarnation of the madam for some reason thatd be a nice change from oh we murdered our childwifewhole family there was water dripping the dark occult really conjuring house developers whens the next one been streamed cant wait i not sure why but clocks are seen as offensive in chinese culture or at least as a gift i think so it makes sense that every time you touch a clock in this game that ghost attacks you i love all your videos youre awesome this game is amazing imo im only saying this because john seems to like seeing the logic or the reason why behind things with these puzzles in the room with the rope that you burn there was actually a leak in the ceiling causing water to drip down onto the flame before the rope could burn entirely which is actually referred to by a note that the guy who likes his beard wrote and john even read that note after he burnt the rope that is why the book had to be moved from the end of the cabinet to the center of the cabinet so the book would block the burning from the water leak that is why there was a constant dripping noise in that room i just dont know why the water drops were so nearly impossible to see i only saw like one myself and thought it was nothing till i finally put the dripping sound with the flame going out there you have it john your semi reasonable reasoning behind the puzzles solution again im only clarifying this because i didnt see any other comments that didi scrolled what the heck yt unsubscribed me from you that pitch at the end really saved me lmao love these videos tbh the visuals looks really nice but man the instant kills when will the next part be uploaded theyre going to have one of the saves be trap i just know it and thats just terrible he is patrollingwhat an asshole lol i noticed tgat ypur hear a wooden beat whenever the patrolling ghost is near did somebody noticeboth the madam and the player have birthmark you need put the tiger bell file into water so you can see the turns that open the door the flame of the canddles will turn green when the ghosts are near hopes he goes back to check 2102 for that wooden card are you going to open the caption option john i want to translate them into chinese if you dont mind pls as usual it was awesome clock in chinese it sounds like deathendso chinese people would never send someone clock as a gift because that would sound like you wish them to die leave those dangerous clocks lol 2425 are those hindi alphabets haha he is patrolling what an arsehole how are you so fucking bad at qtes lmao git gud ffs good lucking beating shenmue about the bells you need to place the paper inside a bowl of water to reveal its content although i already know the plot of the game i still want to see the reaction of people who isnt a chinese so im looking forward to your next part well when hearing the sound of wooden fish in the bgm it means the ghost is coming find somewhere and hide use the water in washbasin to clean the paper of tiger bell you will get a full picture of total order and ringing times of bell hoping to see the game get finished not that it matters at all but deutch means german in german deutchland is germany the ending of this gane dissapointed me very cool 2430 that voice i miss having johns videos divided in parts john the game is good but i still hate it john im subscribed i love you and your content and your sense of humor 3 i was watching this with my chinese friend bin jiang and he was just laughing so hard it functions like the conjuring house its simply a key hunt but the enemies are more interesting in this game conjuring house felt like a chore when it came to remember all of the specific door locations yeah still not feeling this game you know what game i really enjoyed playing and played again to get the true ending c o n c l u s e soak the tiger bell paper into the water basin then the paper shows all the color on the paper its annoying to save it evry time to not lost it stop disguising yourself as a clock lol hum john i think calling this ghost samurai guy is wrong samurais are japanese and this is a chinese game so i dont think he is a samurai youre welcome john please play house of velez and buzz saw blood house another puppet combo game john u miss an id in the room wher u had to place a black suger cube on the right side inside the cabinet ther is an id hope u see this comment are we expecting a dont escape 4 gameplay soon someone better be talking about that metronome audio editor sound thing that went off apparently random or ill start to think im was just going insane this game is resident evil 7 with qtes which is what re7 avoided doing in the first place for a good reason meh the obese asiansounding guy runs so slow hoping for a patch to atleast lengthen that meh the obese asiansounding guy runs so slow hoping for a patch to atleast lengthen that dutch and french oh my god john is so ignorant guys wouldnt have made such a simple error i was just thinking that this game reminded me of the conjuring house thoughts if you dont have ghosts that kill you or quick time events then what do you want the instant kills are perfectly fine given that you can save continuously and never actually lose if the ghosts had to chase you down and hit you repeatedly they would have to be fast enough to catch you and then you would complain because theyre too fast either that or the save feature would have to be removed or put few and far between to compensate can we just face that theres never really a good way to make games like this without someone being upset by it these games have critical issues in that their genre is in a loosey goosey hole of formulas that dont work water was dripping on it lol the book blocked the water so the video walkthrough guy was holding out on you john now you know how it feels 2421 oh shit you sealed rita repulsa away again for another 10000 years shes gonna be pissed fuckin ghosts with their no clip hacks smh and about why you want to light all the candles is that when a ghost is nearby the light turns green wang yong appearing through a locked door seems like a bug to me ghosts are allowed to walk through locked doors or walls thus making the sound of doors opening and closing is a good indication for ghosts probably my favorite horror game released in a long while i guess you can say that john really has a survival instinct after playing so many horror games lol yes ghost can see you if you have your flashlight on in a closet or under a desk game needs higher fov to count the things with same color and it means the order of the tiger bells 305 this what are you made me laugh too loudly while the christian members of my family were praising jesus for easter i got some splaining to do thanks john wang yong is a good guardian lol havent played it myself but i was thinking the quick time events were giving too much time maybe instead of thinking of them as letters think of them as directions i like it awesome play cant wait for the 3rd part youre right john i wont sub now i do enjoy your videos but dang it you had to say subscribe maybe if you tap the shift button hell run continously they seriously cant have programmed a 15 second sprint button man he found out i didnt sub to him if he likes this comment then i guess i have no choice but to subscribe to him ghost walks though door john you cant do t h a t for those who dont know deutsch is not dutch but german so the game basically is about in the late qing dynasty theres this yin family mr yinmilord yinloved his wife lady yin you can see that he even prepared a theatrical toupe for his wife on the second floor in the stewards diary but lady yin has never been pregnant until a painter came to the house she was suddenly pregnant then it turned out that lady yin had cheated on mr yin and the painter ran away lady yin died i dont know how and became evil spirit then killed most peopleexcept the servant girl ding xiang in the housenot sure if she killed mr yin then heres the ghost 1 liu is the first ghost youll be seeing he wanted to steal something from yins treasury after thees drama happened in yins house but decapitated by lady yins ghost through a disc you cant just remembers he is a ghost i guess you can guys dont forget to like the video john deserve better i just realised i was randomly unsubscribed from this channel what the fuck i feel you i can type fast but when my mother used to have me do speed typing tests in school the pressure was real john wolfe im a fairly new subscriber i found you because you play horror games and i like watching them in the dark at night i see i have a lot of them to catch up onso far im enjoying the content on this channel may i know what software youre using to record this game ahahahha the ending me not subscribed yet hmmmm i know youre out there sit caught me can you play dying reborn please its just like the jigsaw movie i really like this game but the instant kill and the constant distractions are annoying im not crazy about qtes either so i get your frustration there that being said i really like the sealing animations that part of the game is pretty cool and at least it doesnt kill you whenever you fail it hopefully the game will have a strong finish i like how the ghosts were super fast in the cut screen and can insta kill you but chasing you aww ima just go snails pace over here now aw man all this ghost love to play hide n seek 251 the fastest chase ive ever seen nanny chen favorite hobby is disguise as clocks john when you were trying to burn the string off the cabinet the reason why the book needs to be placed there is to stop the water thats hard to see from dripping onto the flames and putting it out happy easter everyone i really enjoy watching these longer series also love the game bc i think its interesting you know i love it when you hide in a horror game from a monster i feel so comfortable how you lookes into if visage will be continued or are they having financial issues please continue krampus is home they updated it westerner struggles to comprehend chinese culture okay i admit that isnt fair youre trying really hard though the translation is not the greatest it confuses you the most frustrating thing in this game and games like it is the inability to just run what is with these protagonists and their refusal to run in these situations i may not not be totally in shape but if i were being pursued by anything trying to kill me i would try harder to save my life this guy just takes a huge skiplike sprint then gives up and always sounds out of breath like either the guy is wearing 500 pound weights on his ankles or wearing a bar bell as a backpack john would be a great voice actor for dubbed anime the ui and elements of the presentation remind me of re7 if only that samurai dude said welcome to the family son before eviscerating you i personally dont mind the instant kills but im with you about the quick time events youve always been abysmal at quick time events love ya d 1 i think you missed a note in the exhibition hall cabinet 2 it looks like you have to do something to the tiger bell note some kinda disappearing ink thing going on 3 samurai are japanese this guys runs so freaking painstakingly dont mind me john i am just a commen visitor here 2100 you missed a nametag there john next to mings disappearing face the enemy looks like the creature from the black lagoon had sex with a kabuki doll how to defeat the paper dolls just add water im sorry im not being a picky bitch when i correct you on this the language in the menu is deutsch the german word for german not dutch im a bit of a language nerd forgive me i kinda want to see a is paranormal still scary vid lol samurai guy what an asshole i found the proper solution to the color door puzzle if you put the file in the water bowl it soaks the whole thing revealing the rest of the colors from there you count the number of each color and that is the order i swear i walked around forever looking for solutions to all the puzzles man i also made the exact same reference as you did that it felt a lot lot the conjuring house and that aint a good thing yay part 2 i really enjoyed part 1 hey john i think you should check under the sound setting for the voice option if john say you to subscribe you have to subscribe damn it yin just try to say in in english zhong combine the ge sound as in page and own wang try to say want in english but without t sound yong just say yo and own together omg i cant believe john so bad with qte hahahaa you could play dont escape 4 too p best voice acting 1010 1830 a ghost cant walk through walls reeeeeee im liking this game the animation for sealing the paper dolls is really cool and i havent really seen a mechanic quite like that before its pretty cool also that bit with the bunny did get me a bit i was not expecting him to be right next to you suddenly after he pushed you down the stairs haha maybe its a mistake the dev made that you can only run for 2 second i may be part of the few people that actually like qtes especially if its more than just wasd the tiger bell file goes into the water it was driving me crazy too so i had to look it up for myself lol you are suoposed to put the paper in the water and then the complete intruction for the tiger bell would show up damn john be salty af about that clock d awww its ending so soon and why not subscribe thanks for playing and editing feels like it has been ages since theres been any like decent story horror game please play vampire the masquerade bloodlines would love to see a multiple part play through again please play it for this or your second channel i really think youd like it maybe tapping the shift multiple times like not just holding shift that samurai is super annoying if sprint worked a little better that would improve it a bit hey not sure if youll see his but theres an id badge in the closet where you put the black sugar cube 2025 there was water dripping down onto the cabinet where the string needed to be burned which is why it wouldnt burn until you moved the book over it there must have been a glitch or something but i could slightly see it in the video just barely thoi thought the clicking sound was the dripping water but maybe it was the clock that why it doesnt hurt to exist in a more expansive world within your games dont just live within the 5 feet horizontal 4 feet vertical look all around the cieling to the floors your might notice some things this guy needs to work out this game is kinda decent comparing with the multitude of garbage horror games on the marketi am enjoying this john john im so confused walks to locked door ghost enters room and now youre dead hiiii i am so excited to watch this john looks very young and handsome lol this is cool by the standards of today thanks john joooohn check out yatzhees pixel games like 5 days a stranger also theres lone survivor which is a kinda pixelated silent hill esque horror 734 vajvakilaka sanskrit in chinese it is is a buddhist artefact it was used as a weapon in ancient time about the bells you need to find a bowl of water to wash that paper to make it show all the information 21092111 cause this samurai guy is out for my head but this game is chinese john samurai are japanese geez man i finally subscribed happy now john love this playthru waiting for the next episode i looked up the bell part and apparently you have to put the paper in waterto make the color blocks show up and you count how many color blocks there are for which order you tap the bells in i enjoyed part 1 last night cant wait to watch this one im a new sub so dont mind me too much i like that john is one of those yters that still actively play horror games my only qualm is that johns critique for the game feels more like satire and sometimes whiney so it doesnt help to set the horror atmosphere checked his other vids out and hes usually laughing at a poor conceptdesign saying hell talk about the issues later eg at the end of the video not even asking for no commentary on these types of games because thatd be boring but blending in with the atmosphere of the game would be nice once in a while still going to remain subbed and watch content just wishful thinking is all thanks for part 2 on this game john its nice to see him do a game thats more than just a one off type of game we need some bigger games with more parts conjuring house vibes but this game is scarier to me and more interesting as im typing this john makes a similar comment have you check in the option under the sound menu maybe you could find a voice languange in there well then why dont you learn chinese or korean john huh take your career more seriously im just kidding but im sure someone out there is thinking or talking like that lmao thanks for another great video john 1832 really caught me by surprise this is a great game but way too short everybody wang chung tonight im curious of who the lord isis he the creepy voice that is husky i called it i commented in the last video that this game is like the conjuring house now john said it too the graphics are very cool voice acting eh jump scares not so scary but still kind of fun those two names yin zhong and wang yong the zh in zhong is pronounced like a j and the a in wang is pronounced as ah just in case you wanted to get the names straight i was curious if the bell paper was written in the way you would edit read manga i had to pause at 829 on my tv and play the video on my phone to see if my hunch was correct i noticed both sides does not match up to the sequence you ring the bells on the door however what is with the mask ornament on the bell paper perhaps a clue on the color sequence i think you should try spamming the run key to run reminds me of re7 this game is good but not a fan of no combat in my horror games d it is german not dutch under the language point but i really like the game it reminds me somehow of project zero might be because of the story told by the different ghosts to get one whole and the riddles just once i want to hear him scream like ruby rhod i have trouble with wasd quick times too the one at the end of dying light took me a shameful amount of time to get right l the bunny the bunny whoa i love the bunny i dont love my mom or my dad just the bunny the bunny the bunny yeah i love the bunny i gave everything that i had for the bunny i dont want no health food when its time to feed a big bag o bunnies is all that i need i dont want no buddies to come out and play ill sit on my sofa eat bunnies all day i wont go to church and i wont go to school that stuff is for sissies but bunnies are cool i dont want no pickles i dont want no honey i just want a plate and a fork and a bunny i dont want a tissue when my nose is runny i just want a plate and a fork and a bunny i dont want to tell you a joke that is funny i just want a plate and a fork and a bunny i dont want to play on a day that is sunny i just want a plate and a fork and a bunny deutsch is actually german for german not dutch love this you gonna play some mk11 d you dont have to put the tiger bell file in the water and it will be complete please dont be mad at me for saying this i watch your videos religiously and i noticed you scan quickly in these kinds of games and miss things that cause you to backtrack often i know its different watching than playing but this game may have went smoother if you checked each room thoroughly before advancing to the next please dont be mad i love my john wolfe i think the fire is put out was because of some waterfluid dripping on it and moving whatever was on top of the cabinet blocked the dripping was hard to tell since the sound was louder away from the cabinet but it makes sense apparently for the bells puzzle if you play on vr every time you pick the right bell order the bell will lights up so yeah idk why it doesnt light up on the original version edit on original version people said to use the water on the paper so it shows the whole content i do really like the videos that end up being multiple parts its always kind of like watching a long movie i like the game so far but it does seem to not explain itself as much as it should it looks good though and the ghosts are creepylooking also i like that you arent a complete hardass all the time in your videos your humor sets you apart from other lets players so if people dont like your style they should really go hit up another channel what a slow chase scene xd this game looks awesome always a treat watching you play as well john freaking mimics so i looked up black sugar on a chinese medicine blog and this is what it said this type of unrefined sugar comes from the island of okinawa and has many health benefits not found in white and brownred sugar it is believed to help lower cholesterol levels and neutral blood fat contains molasses potassium iron calcium and other minerals necessary to our diet while chocolate might be the comfort food of choice in the west for many women during painful periods in japan and taiwan as well black sugar is the soothing medicinal of choice as iron and calcium help ease the discomfort bringing ease and relief during the menses while the mellow sweet taste and calories muster up energy to help endure it in chinese medicine terminology we would say that it treats painful menstruation by moving and nourishing the blood httpschinesemedicinetravellercomarticletestaddarticle2 game title change curse of the never ending dripping faucet damn you are bad at playing this game but i still love you in another way of course rove you rong time wang long anyone else notice that the tiger bell is present on both right and left sides depending on the orientation of the page maybe that factors in the solution i too have been attacked by the long wang oh sorry lang wong nevermind play dollhouse please lmao i died a little when he just walked through the door hmm i wish there was more content like puzzles or something just would like to see more activity and not just silly jump scares does the graphics and sequences in this game remind anyone else of the conjuring house not like the game itself but just the way that some things look remind me of that game and it has a similar feel to it in my opinion thanks for uploading the second part shortly after the first one always look forward to your videos even though you got rid of guys lol jk great upload sir and always critically think sorry that was lame ill go home thanks john hate to be all nosey here but why is this video adfree hey john i think you should play advanced education with viktor strobovski again it got alot of new updates and the game is not a baldi fangame anymore but a game on its own there is new items new enemies new ambiant occlusion thing and stuff 2 new levels if you beat math you get to the language level if you beat the language level you get to the history level which is currently not finished 050 im guessing that would be rape hey idk if anyones mentioned it yet but just so you know q is pronounced tch and x is pronounced sh and zh is basically pronounced like j for example qingtching xshing zhjing if anyone thinks im wrong pls feel free to correct me i dont actually speak mandarin come on people we need more likes to persuade john to put up the next video w johns contempt for nanny chen that second ghost looks like the creature from the black lagoon john seems dissapointed by the quantity of matches i relly hate the ghost with the big mouth achivement unlock critical master hey john good try on saying those names but theyre actually pronounced as yin zhong and wang yong half a million subs round to 1 mil john keep up the good work yey part 2 thanks for not holding out on us john jonh looks up walkthourth dom plays welcome to the dark side watching john play this is reminding me of playing tag

that one of the hardest ghost battles was literally who can go slightly faster than slow and hit three points wow i have so many question for this game but one is whats about daughter i am confused with paper dolls they attack him is kind of ghost and mummy oo this game is really scary xd but fun watch i would like to see the to be continued part when it comes out this game is a great example of how not to make a horror game shit voice acting especially shit movement shit sound design shit environment shit qtes shit ending iq 200 player love from china though it is still difficult for you guys who dont understand the chinese characters to solve the puzzle thats a big problem and the game team has already received the feedbacks on this issue maybe they will make it better in the full version damn youre too good proud of you sir inside your boxha and master yepwish it wasnt cut this waythat just seems kind of cheap i wasnt a fan of this one i didnt like the whole try to run without running thing you were so expressive in this series loved watching it it was interesting for sure but im definitely with you on the ending i just want to know what happens at least have the daughter say something so you know youre still after her what the heck the verse actually showed a paper being turned around with an arrow pointed up then a rectangle shown landscape then portrait then another arrow pointing up so i got the idea after counting a few times with the video paused that one was upside down its not intuitive but the clues are actually there maybe sell us tshirts that say puzzle fucking master on the front eh eh eh d d d alright put it on a shirt puzzle fing master in big red letters 20 bucks a piece i was so confused by that end you did such a fantastic job with the puzzles though play very noob puzzle fucking master lol im crying precious if the ending was when credits start rolling i would feel really bad because ive been asking you of more of this series still disatisfying but a bit better and does anyone else think cju is super goodlooking in this video like hollywood actorwise i love your youtube channeli watch your videos daily nd please bro if u use instagram let me know i want to follow you lots of love keep it up it makes me sad that this game home sweet home and pamali have not been finished some of the coolest folklore and horror games but with no ending how was it daylight when you went up the second flight of stairs the ghost said it was almost midnight good job the ending was oddly anticlimactic but maybe youll get your daughter in part 2 are you going to finish afraid of monsteror could you play lorelai love your channel puzzle fucking master id imagine its very hard to make a good ending for a game that hasnt been seen before but overall i liked it pretty good modeling and texturing on the characters and the environment and so to the coders that make it all happen thank you for another awesome series and amazing attitude buddy i enjoyed about that at least good the last puzzle is too hard good and congratulations needs clever to solve that in one video cool yes you need to bring to us the continues whenever will be release very fun thank you to have brought to us this cool ending nice to watch you again and ever cju youre a puzzle champion chris dang chris youre the first one ive seen who actually managed to solve that puzzle i think you can definitely crown yourself the puzzle master after this mad skilz mate if you dont work for mi6 you bloody well should plot twist you are your daughter all along tun tun tun it wasnt bad nice to see a game from a different culture wouldnt mind seeing more talk about anticlimacticlol will need the second part for closure for sure i have watched you make those ginger bread men dozens of times seriously it was hilarious call back to that you did better at this one lol p thanks for the upload you rock sad this is the ending what a wonderful game thanks cju probably gonna deal with the family members in part 2 and i hope they fix the sprint a piece of piss what thanks for uploading chris as always loved your lp lol oh man the lock pick puzzle was by far the hardest you figured this one out really fast wow what a disappointing ending what ill remember most from this game are all those squeaky doors and the walking pace from a comatose snail i also hope that therell be a second part because the story makes not that much sense right now but the ghost designs were pretty cool and the last puzzle was very neat thanks for playing excellent game i love the way you play waiting for another asian horror game love from india there is a sequel to the cat lady did you ever play the original there has to be a reason the character was there he was probably the missing man out of everyone involved in the drama the mistress he probably slept with the lords wife and had a child the daughter that keeps missing cool i think the game felt mostly like a proof of concept who knows the circumstances the developers had to face to get this out the door but they shouldve at least answered one of the many questions maybe they didnt even have a clear story idea thanks for playing it though i had a blast that puzzle i was about to say if they didnt have an ending can you please play lorelai id really like to see that well that was interesting a few loose ends that need to tie up thats for sure overall aside from the sprint that you really needed not too shabby maybe fatal frame 2 next or corpse party though if you do that one i highly recommend the 3ds version since that is actually the best way to experience it praise the puzzle master oh well i guess all i can say is i hope in the next chapter you can actually run for more then 23 seconds that puzzle was fucking confusing well thats one way to end a game the one who kicked you down the stairs at the end was probably the lord youre going to be very mad about the ending of this game i would guess that it was the lord at the end since he wasnt on your list of people to deal with i feel like this could be a really good game it just needs a bit of tweaking but yeah the story what there is of it is interesting enough that i do wanna see more hopefully we get a second part soon you are a master of puzzles im also liking the atmosphere a lot but the qtes can break that quite a bit hopefully they do release a part 2 or something and tweak some things like accessibility with vr puzzle help not being able to leave a room because of enemies etc will love to see you play the next part when it comes out cant wait for next paper doll 2 i still dont understand how you did it after watching your explanation lol i have no clue how you made those sqigglies into numbers maybe it makes total sense if you were familiar with chinese and i am not in any way i can say thank you and its snowing in korean thats about it i am just gonna stick to motorboating my bowl of popcorn i hate when games say yo push that button then you need to push that man comon i only have 2 small hands and a cracked memory drive in my head 26 saves has to be a record for you of course i totally understand why with this game and bravo on the puzzle solving i wouldve googled that one for sure idk why but i loved this game so much i really hope that they do make a sequel would you play our little indie horror game called dia hi cju are you gonna play lorelai on this channel i have just finished the game and thought it was quite good i just love horror gamesyes the ending was a bit crap and the run was non existent i just wanted to say thank you i have only just found your channel and have been watching nearly all your videosyou are awesome love your channel keep up the fantastic work puzzle fucking master is right everyone else ive watched has had to look that puzzle up and even after they did they still didnt understand how it was solved great job lmfao this game did a pineview drive ending sort of i can pretty much see why this game is getting mixed reviews like its okay but this game just really feels empty like there are story bits but nothing strong to connect things together and worst of all is this games overuse of qtes im not fully against qtes but in this day an age qtes are not always viewed positively and honestly you really destroy your attempts at horror when you constantly distracted the player with flashing button icons i cant believe you figured that puzzle out my head hurts just thinking about it youre literally the smartest gamer ive ever watched hey cju just wanted to mention the developer of the cat lady has released his new game lorelai a few days ago yay been anxiously waiting for this third xd yay first again you are just hilarious you make my day im finally done with this game i enjoyed doing all the puzzles and of course the actual game days gone next stay tuned fyi ive done the clock puzzle like 5 times and i always had to put different times just turn your clock 5 minutes at a time and youll get it right eventually firecracker puzzle 234 wooden tags puzzle 555 cloakroom puzzle dingxiangs treasure 1220 laowu g502

of the kids who tried taking their lives back in 2012 i believe i found out about it a couple years ago and showed my foster mom and she had more of an understanding as to why it happened i wish i

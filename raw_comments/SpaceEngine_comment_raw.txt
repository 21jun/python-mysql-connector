omg what a game 0 feel bad because my pc cant run it idk of that one creator was actually from nasa is there lore like reading stuff about stars etc while speaking do not make chik chik soundyour mama havent told you that when im in the game i can move but not move camera and it keeps saying loading in the middle help what is that 610 those white like snow what is that what a beautiful offering so are these real planets cause ridddle used this in a video so idk im found black hole he is in center of our galaxy milky way space engine isnt a game or a simulator its a celestial body emulator as stiekeme henk pointed out simulators are deeper simulators involve modeling the underlying state of the target not just the look is it possible to make your own planet with your own terrain its not a fucking game you moron this game is not beatuifule lmao i wish i can play this game but my device is too old it would be nice to be able to build your own structures on the planets and pretend you are master of the universe i havent played this game but as i understand 9999 of the planets here are fictional still fun i guess what the difference between this and universe sandbox 2 i think space is a the best idea for a vr games needs higher textures and some actions then it will be awesome can you show metell me what buttons to press and what they do its not beautiful its incredible this is what they use to make some documentaries did you get around to doing the easter egg video of this game id be interested cheers interesting but a made up fictitious galaxy or how it might be based on available information give me the game download link im gonna play this for hours wile playing journey of the sorcerer on repeat space engine should also include quadrillions of other universes the multiverse they could add these planets in ksp thrive is another but still in heavy development james north your arrogant i hope you fucking know that and dont test me i will send a hitman on you from the deep web tor theres an engine that allows you to look at a blade of grass then rise up into space eventually youll be able to travel the galaxy this engine seems obsolete in comparison universal google maponly if it was real i dont think that this is a game its a simulation program i fucking hate that i dont know how to download this game can it be used in a comercial purpose this videos when made i wonder if there is a human in a city on earth with his computer playing space engine o this is not even a game you keep saying game but what are the golds what do you have to achieve a game you win or lose at the end and some have levelsthis just looked like a fake simulator of a made up universe can you explain what is the game play this game while high iam geting this program today iam super excited to explore the universe this with star citizen would be pretty cool better than no mens guy what are the systems requirements better than no mans sky p why do laugh a lot your explanation is vague and all over the place you say nothing about its development this play empyrion would blow no mans sky away emyrion is already better then no man sky and only has 3 planets takes a little longer to get to space but makes you earn it why that star at the end the little blue one isnt spherical is this supposed to be real the earth is flat holy fuck are we humans a sort of god oo what do you think about universe sandbox 2 in comparison is universe sandbox 2 better or worse than space engine is it possible to create your own stars planets moons galaxies etc in both software i like to make mimics of landscapes so i could use this game to take screenshots and copy the landscape down on another game site maybe build a city or something on it and give it lore fuck yeh omg space engine its very very beautiful i play this game for hours d in this period im obsessed by space games i have download all smartphone games of this category about this i would suggest you starfly if you like playing on mobile device its a new game i leave the link im not spammer im only a very nerd girl this game has a multiplayer mode more peoplemore fun d android httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidittinygamesstarfly ios httpsitunesapplecomappid1115642123ctsitemt8 i am impressed how i could discover a planet over 10 billion light years away the terrain it render there seems to be glitchy and i find random planets i never know and would probably never be able to find ever again how much video ram is needed to avoid pop in textures wtf this is spunj from renengades csgo i am trying to sign up at the site but the code wont take i think its using the cyrillic alphabet and i dont know why it wont translate to the western european one the one used for english help because i want this simulator is this space engine game based on the actual stars in our observable universe or all just fantasy if its based on real space time then wow that would be incredible to travel the known universe with software imagine if we used that to find actual life out there how did you disable the annoying gui its not edge of the universe its edge of the observable universe if you could actually get there physically in real life you would just see the same as everywhere in the universe more of another billions of galaxies its just when we are trying to look into this distance from earth then thats the border beyond we cannot see anymore we see the big bang there due to the light physics you know this simulator just didnt put anything more there because well we dont know whats there anymore my dream space game is something like kerbal space program and space engine together basically you would start out on a random planet in a random galaxy since you start out in a random star system you would have no knowledge of the other planetarystellar objects around you this would allow you to build a space program from the ground up so you could send out probes to distant planets and find out useful information like the atmosphere gravity and other physical properties of a planet essentially your goal would be exploring the entire galaxy and potentially the whole universe i know that this is similar to no mans sky but thing about that game is that every planet in the game has life on it and thats not realistic at all that sun at the end that is 105 au means that light will take 14 hours to cross its diameterwhoa i think light can go around the earth 748 times in 1 second for perspective earth circumference 40075000m speed of light 299 792 458 m s only reply to this comment if you can include a ton of stats you just need to play no mans sky blows this outta the water completely cant wait for mac release but its not a game since there is no gameplay to speak of its a 3d explorable universe program its not game yet buuuuut yes i have it and i love it d this is the perfect setting to introduce building and ships capability and just add explore and colonize how good of a pc do you have to have to run this well imagen if someone put in the ability to control intelligent live wow this game looks beautiful never heard of this game before how is this a game how can i purchase space engine simulator copied in dvd awesome but is it only me that gets this chilling feeling why is it so its kinda awe mixed with agoraphobia i think especially when dramatically zooming in to a giant start boom when i do it i apply it like i was told and i am missing a mouse cursor and all of the information have you been able to update to version 0973 easily it free looks amazing ill give it a try hey btw press g twice to travel faster to a star and great video 1sub thankyou as it turns out a use a out dated stuff and it cause error sorry but now i get space engine space engine error it said null 21 null help everytime i see space games i become so sad because i keep remembering spore d rip spore if only no man sky help space engine improve this game this game would be an amazing game isnt a game you dont play you explore nothing else anyway its interesting thanks for sharing so the game is shuch a good game about space i downloaded it it wont open holy shit this makes universe sandbox 2 look minuscule a lot of planets dont load for me s it looks so real i fell in love with elite almost 20 years ago playing elite ii frontier i love the genre but sorry this is not a game this is very sweet indeed i wonder if there are quarsars for us to look at its so awesome what if we can create our character and creating a spaceship to explore the space and what if we can enter a planet then we can explore it and find some resources d i gotta wait for the updates of this game this is so awesome thank you for making the game free no mans sky is like this but more interesting how can you have such a good frame rate while recording i have an r7 250 and my game runs at 6070 fps while playing but it drops drastically to 20 fps or even less when recording and it is totally crap this normally doesnt happen with other games how can i fix this what are the graphic settings i should change the game really beautyfull but how dont you get a copyright for the nice intro music imagine universe sandbox in this game engine also if you click so you have a galaxy marked then press ctrlg then you will get directed istantly to a black hole im not sure the globular cluster would be at the center of that galaxy theyre usually at the outskirts but then maybe it wasnt globular no matter im splitting hairs this is a great simulation ive enjoyed for quite a while and i still have fun with it once in a while i just wish the planets didnt all look so much alike im really looking forward to no mans sky that looks pretty awesome too of course space engine is a little more scientific i hope in 25 years there will be better graphics and controllers the hot asteroid on 503 looked like a ball of aluminium foil hey this game looks pretty cool think ill have to try it out myself maybe make a video who knows sir you have outdone yourself i just found your channel and thought well he must be up there with people that have a few 100000 subscribers i subed because you actually got me to download the game very few people can get me to do that if you think this is beautiful just wait till you try elite dangerous does it work on a macbook do you detailed get terrain like if you zoom in enough does it show trees if it has any or does it just have what you look at from afar space engine is not a game its much more than that i think now i know why humanity exists to play this beautiful game ofc a black screen is one of the most extraordinary things you will see in this game how do you play the game without the interface borderless imagine if something like this and outerra mixed together oh man yeah thats the way to hide that big ugly blotch at the beginning right in the center of the shiny spot well done d i am at a loss of words i am in love ill show you the edge of the universe in just a minute its pretty cool well dont think anyone has said that to me before its not tecniccly a game btw so its like scifi google maps of universe i kinda hoped for something sandboxish stuff to do this isnt a game you cant play anything for some reason i double click the space engine icon thing on my desktop and the game wont start can anyone help i have the game and agree with your opinion it is great more a simulation than a game though question who created the game and why give it away for free hope there are no viruses in it wow shit ass graphics looks like something from 2002 elite dangerous 2014 thanks so much for making me aware of this sim where has this been all my life whats the opening music how do you make objects move and how can i make the graphics amazing like some of the videos posted online how i can get this game for my macbook pro in new york nasa should make an engine of the same way but map out our actual solar system and all that we know of the milky way and other galaxies of course there wont be much data to work with versus this game but the fact that we can just roam at least in the solar system is crazy they must have updated a lot since this came out can u find earth i go from like a clean smooth fps above thirty down to like 10 x but i dont care because like you said man its more of like a art piece and honestly the lag at times makes me appreciative the scene more if i got this game i would actually start going insane i would be really freaking happy but terrified of the power of the universe you know that disccircle galaxys are the biggest galaxys ans not small galaxys spiral galaxys are smaller just as a small hint if you double press g on your keyboard it will make the autopilot fly much faster if you dont want to wait this game story super win imagine star trek farscape andromeda in this game now only if we had technology that generated good random voices to negate the need for real actors hi i was just wondering if anyone could give me abit of help regarding whether ikr not i can run this game my laptop has a dual core 25 ghz i5 processor 8gb of ram and a 1 terabyte hard drive however the graphics card is only a hd intel 4600 card im new to this so can anyone tell me whether i can run this this is soooo freakin awesome mind blown more than a trillion star or even more but how they make it thought the virtual game how how how the video capture in this game is so hard and slow been driving me insane 900 i need cheap sunglasses play rodina its a bit like this with a space ship and enemys and objectives this is the largest game in history wat a cheap video this is not a game can you create your own solar sistem i think the creator is planning to make it into an actual game some time in the future mother of game this is beautiful this is something id play while high 3 i needed some help building a engine can anyone help ill fork the cash ive seen things you people wouldnt believe attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion i watched cbeams glitter in the dark near the tannhauser gate all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain time to die you should show everyone black holes would love to see more i liked this video more please looks awesome would love to see this engine used in a game start on a planet with nothing harvest materials until you can make ships go exploring find enemies make truce or kill them all you should definitely do more of this game it looks amazing thanks dude for sharing this awesome game is there any osx version cool yes beautiful meh its not quite up there with eve online or star citizen what happens if you go into a black hole really interesting thanks holy dick slow down when entering a planet it makes me dizzy oo very cool dear gods that looks bloody brilliant fly a sh s h u t u p a n d t a k e m y m o n e y will definitely play this game also whats the name of the song playing in the background this game will probably have your pc sucking in the entire universe without you knowing 2010 but can it run crisis 2020 but can it run the whole universe space engine artists we are looking for a space engine artist who can make astronomical animations for use in our brand new space science center in ostend belgium called astropolis we are a non profit organisation that has worked very hard over the past nine years to build our dream being a center that combines astronomy and space science in a fun and educational way in our auditorium we want to show our visitors the wonders of the universe with the use of space engine but lack the experience to do so this is why we are looking for somebody to make some great movies for us examples are the iss in orbit around the earth moon and solar eclipses a trip around the moon and each of the planets moon rising in the sky and so on if you are interested in helping us please send a message to infoastropolisbe when will 0990 come on the space engine that you have to download well then this is going to be interesting because this would be perfect for a setting that im working on i had only just discovered this game today and holy it looks beautiful unfortunately im super broke but its on my steam wish list ill get it one day its like star citizen when youre on the surfaces but without the ships youll have my money on monday no need to pay get this wholesome experience getting the game for absolutely free at httpssteamunlockednet get all kinds of games from triplea to horror games preinstalled you read it right there is no need to install anything the only thing you should do is unzip the zip file minimum requirements requires a 64bit processor and

work with mh crappy laptop i cant even get all the updates for universe sandbox 2 or it wont work i have to play it 2 updates shy of current coincidently enough my laptop plays sims 3 and all of the sims flawlessly would have thought for sure thst universandbox wouldnt have been that bigbof an issue this just makes me hate the person who stole my alien ware even more for the life of me i cant understand why nasa esa or whichever space agency you want has not developed such a thing already its so freaking awesome nice add but it does not do space engine justice this simulator is this good and better i have had it for three days and just from this little time i will never scratch the surface of what space engine has to offer amazing software if space interests you then you just have to have this there is even a free full version to try out indefinitely or buy this new one with even more bells and whistles why are you still reading this comment go get this thing now lol is it worth the money can you put a destination to the pillars of creation i havent been able to find that at least my laptop meets the bare minimum requirementsbut sadly i wont be able to experience it the way its meant to be in 4k on a screen that takes up an entire wall existencial crysis the game song please whats the name of that epic song what is the background music name whats the music somebody show this to a flatearther ah so thats how the universe was createdby the russians hahaha thank you vladimir romanyuk for this masterpiece its here its finally here yessssssssssss omg you really changed how nebulas look omg cant you download this for free or is this like a revamped version for steam anyone know this song cant find it for the life of me but i think the song is awesome next update alien live on other planets and humans on earth hopefully youre all trying it in vr and not just in 2d its fkking terrifying i love it people talking about how this will melt your computer i can run this game just fine on my laptop and its not really a gaming laptop so im assuming people who have a pc game system and can play all the new games would be able to play this game amazingly i suppose the music of this video is the favorite of the creator of this program does anyone know name of the music worth buying a 4000 new home pc just for this game alone think ill do that first thing next week imagine if youre some higher dimensional being and our entire universe and the law of physic is actually one of their game mind blowing awesome ive been playing space engine for years truly a magnificent piece of software buying it today and looking forward to more updates congratulations on release im so excited i have an earlier version but i am going to get the steam one to support this program its amazing the only thing is that those guys have a really bad taste in music thats probably the downside i might buy a whole new laptop just to use this windows 1945 isnt great omg it looks so compared to it first came out this game is actually the best way tp learn about planets can wait for the 10 version with new great features i hope this becomes free when the beta expires i would like to download it on spaceengine website time to ditch universe sandbox im so happy that youre making lots of money of this now now we might get 10 before 2021 maybe thanks for a decade of hard work for this beautiful program what music play in this video i thought this is a game engine lol cant wait to see 500 earths and planets being thrown out of orbit in this this looks sick please tell the name of soundtrack this is like a dlc for google earth okay if markiplier played this then he would be freaking out someone needs to inform him about this game context httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuldwie4j2fi what if the real reason for earthlike planets planets capable of supporting life are so rare is really because they cost too many green gems in the freetoplay version of spaceengine that god is playing this is the space simulator we deserve i want to buy a new computer just for this alone maybe ill get to play it 10 years from now soon well be able to simulate earth and watch the humans evolve to make their own simulation cant wait for sometime in the future for something to be released like this but with real time raytracing would be magnificent kids spending hundreds of dollars in vbucks insted they should invest in this masterpiece of game it would be a lovely educational program indeed or perhaps a very neat background thingy name of the song is se subtitle by lokijar for those looking for it the ad breakes my laptop this game is gonna take out the power in my whole city me this game is breath taking keanu reeves no youre breath taking youre all breath taking i dont like the fact that there are no more free version updates its online make this online its will be cool very very cool im looking for a new computer preferably mac that run this game with ease does anyone have any suggestions a 1 to 1 scale universe simulator haha you live in such semulator 1 to 1 lol d you wont have cpu power ever emulate one to one d haha music sounds a bit like ftl should make a commercial ver to import 100 real life data and researchers can keep adding new data on it can we land on planet surface will a gtx 1050 ti and an i3 6100 run this i thought it was space engineers 2 or something like that what are the hardware requirements now we need a multiplayer if you were actually wandering through space you would only be seeing this close your eyes meanwhile inside ricks car battery this channel is stupid i also hope i can do this in vr 3 i hope the steam version comes native with all the ultra high resolution texture packs the music is out of this world xd what is it called i need it plz imagine having the option of vr in this engine by the way what do you do about time do you use only earth time or do you allow to control the point of origin and stuff thanks so much i could start a campfire without a match amazin but still that sun surface texture wth looks like stained glass computer exists spaceengine 0990 im about to end this mans whole career sooooo eve and no mans sky had a baby oh thats so cool my computer cant handle the rendering thanks is all i can say i like the bgm so universe sandbox 2 but on steroids take my money my pc handles extreme overclocking me im about to end this machines whole career so how does it compares with universe sandbox 3 wolf 359 i saw you hanging around back there my machine would collapse and turn into a singularity when i run it incredible i also love the ambient breakbeat music in this video can anyone enlighten me on the artist or is it made specifically for this trailer thank you we are living in a simulation reality is an illusion this is your daily dose of recommendation space simulator i can only imagine how much space this takes not great but not terrible until it looks like minecraft on release day universe sandbox 2 has left the chat omg so this version can do or add something like changing planets than the first version checkmate flat earthers its a simulation and not a game right it looks amazing though and must have taken forever to make what if space is fake and this game is what we have been shown by the government nasa for years my space engine has been crashing since 2014 lol standing ovation my laptop master please i beg of you pl me launch space engine my laptop please at least on low set me ultra settings all thats left is multiplayer and alien life this game has come so far and is made by one dude keep up the great work finally youtube can never do anything right thought id be watching a space engine trailer instead the video is just live feed from nasa pff honestly this is an ideal starting place for researcher to start studying their material and theories this musta been some amazing colab guys prolly lots of nasa based data and esa based data culminating in there too collaborations enable gamechanging pieces of work no doubt the tweak part 115 looked eerie though ie where was south america lol crazy stuff damn finally oh it costs money ive been playing the alpha for a while and it was free now i unfortunately have to buy it oh well this game is worth it dont mind me just gonna download it legally i just want a new spore c markiplier would adore this meyes space engine is on steam sees price 2499 meshoot now i have to wait again thanks lots of jokes about people buring their pcs here but its actually more optimized than minecraft i picked a bad week to stop dropping acid time to collect all of the infinity stones imagine being able to simulate space battles in this me watched a scott manley video about this game youtube here is the trailer buddy me watched a scott manley video about this game youtube here is the trailer buddy i actually found this game by accident a friend told me to check out space engineers good game too but i was high and googled space engine cant wait to get this on steam after payday more early access crap you have to pay for we will see how long this scam will last universe sandbox has left the chat wait till graystillplays get his hands on this and fucks it up sounds like its time to fry my cpu trying to run this flat earthers have left the lobby anton petrov is that you i would happily watch visuals like that for hours while tripping at a rave this would be good for eve online space engine 0990 trailer my computer ah shit here we go again i downloaded it a while back and still cant figure out how to use it i think its the most awesome program thats ever been invented basically universe sandbox 3 will this run on windows 98 looks like i finally need a pc well time to oof my laptop when is the steam release my potato computer cant handle this uhm frontier wake up buy it do what next god simulator and the creation of the world the next big thing is to make it a gtalike game 102 tf is this if you like this you should play phantasy star online games 036 plz say those are colliding galaxies also can we please please get this game on xbox my pc is too bad to run good games like this awesome now all we need are playable characters and the ability to blow stuff up having a mobile version wouldbe epic time to raid the nasa facility to rob some of their computers anybody wanna join in what about a mac version been waiting for 6 years ye screw you i been waiting for so long and it cost money i would rather play gta then dis shit space engine 10 better be free or i will unsub lol adding to my awesome space games to get list i am in the discord server lol space engine came a long way good job universe sandbox 2 cool ok whos up for playing pool with planets the ability to recreate a universe and you know just know most of it will be spent flinging black holes at suns and making things go boom i dream a collaboration with ksp the game no mans sky shouldve been holy sht how much space hungry is this beast looks at my steam wallet oh this is not good whos smoking weed and playing this me spaceengine this annoying music why couldnt you avoid that like the universe sandbox but with more detail and the potential to melt my computer sign me the hell up that looks real nice universesandbox3 is there any chance that space engine will be playable on linux one day awesome trailer btw i dont know physics but i love to destroy earth in this type of simulator games i dont know about space but i am going to melt my pcs engine hahaha hah welltake that flat earthers we need more people like this guy wonderful this soft has inspired me so much with this elon musks world computer simulation theory is proven what sorcery is this cant wait to pirate this one wow the audio quality if this video is really good hi i have a little issue with 60 fps when i move the camera nearby planets they appear to move at low fps even if im getting stable 60fps any suggestion but space doesnt exist according to eddie bravo this is just basically universe sandbox kind of unrealistic though the earth is a sphere can someone tell me how this compares to universe sandbox awsome i domt understand the purpose is it a simulator and the goal is to explore the universe oo is it time to leave earth nice i can create my own sun on my laptop i hope this game will be released on playstation one day so is this like elite dangerous but with a capable developer holy crap this blew my mind vr please also this would be badass to play stoned in the middle of the night with music holy sheiit its here finally this looked absolutely amazing on my iphones amoled screen can we get this on mobile surely it can run right whats the difference between this and universe sandbox who needs space engineers when you can have space engine hell yeah oh cool look around explospaceships unity technologies has joined the chat the people so when can we expect for space engine to roll out in a big way space engine devs yes ps i am in love with this you took the education to the next level thank you see how many good space games there are when you just ignore star citizen space engine more like god engine theres always a catch finally this game got attention finally my dream is gonna be true a realstic space exploration gamehold my beer i am playing this on vr 213 ah jeez why are black holes so unsettling to see its getting hard to tell the difference between the simulation and the simulation you cold make some really cool videos with cinematics taken from this my computer is going to hate me yeah guys thanks for that now my good old core two duo exploded just out of fear i could install this piece of code b e a u t i f u l so now i know where nasa takes footage from flatearth left the chat okay so have to buy a thread ripper system prepare urselfs 5g is coming now i can create videos to blow peoples mind the best childhood game for nerds space is where we belong to is there any way to import an fbx camera into this thing and then output a rendered image sequence simple rockets 2 am i joke a to you beautiful wonder when a phone could run this is there also a flat earth mode but does it have ray tracing as an astrophysicist i want to say finally that how much lines of code has gone through this is more mysterious than the outer world what is this edit so this is no mans sky but in space so you made a universe sandboxcosmoteer hybrid nice what an awful music for a theme like space beeurk type of stuff that should be used in school astrobiology classes can you make a realistic simulation of space orbit launching ship to space entering into atmosphere with air drag effect because fun part of se is its space ships imagine youre living in that not space engine 09 but space engine 30 or so controlled and created by an s ai this is not too abstract is it my phone overheated just by looking at this video born too late to explore earth born too early to explore the stars but born just in time to play spaceengine the time has come but can you shoot aliens this is what nasa uses to fake space my laptop cant even handle the normal version although a flat earther p but im loyal to this project ever since it came out im happy for the success it shall get soon d everyone yay i love space engine im gonna create a beautiful universe graystillplays hold my vodka as i shall reign over the entire universe and traps it in a constant loop of life and death where everyone can enjoy their starbucks coffee and deserved a death sentence right after that perfect as always simulation hypothesis is true whats the name of the music cost edit well its cheap buy i would like to buy it at 90 discount kspuniverse sandboxraytracing is it in vr because something like that should be in vr tfw you realize that you could theoretically use this game to create other games if the team allowed the player base to generate their own planetary systems or bodies to export imagine being able to take a planetary body out of here as hipoly model star citizen meh no mans sky meh elite dangerous meh sex meh life meh space engine holy f christ this would be awe inspiring in virtual reality if i cant battle other ships then its a waste of money because i didnt see anything in here that didnt look as though it was a ripoffed android game my universe will probably be stuck in time whats 103 cant wait for the james webb dlc id pay for it damn what else is there to add now i guess better graphics this has come so far star citizen who reality can be whatever i want i didnt even know this existed so do i need a nasa computer for that is this ever gonna happen basically how our universe is to god looks good going to make a lets play of it so basically we play as god wish i could give 500 likes nice i cant wait to get a gaming computer best thing to use while being high the game when its realease gabe its a card game of space customer what gabe its a card game of space give me your money i hope they will add alien civilizations for future updates like add cities lights at exoplaneys ive been with space engine since the beginning its amazing to see how far its gotten finally my pc will be able to run the universe what my friend says cool download time me yea me t my computer im going to stop you right there what is this like universe sim on steroids looks awesome tho everyone how much planetsstarsnebulaesgalaxies will be in space engine vladimir romanyuk yes somebody tell me what this is im confused is this a hd textures in this video or default frontier need to hire this guy to implement atmospheric planets in elite dangerous would blow star citizen out of the water space engine is one of the best things that happened to the world of gamessimulators at one point the black holes have to be removed its not scientifically solid anymore kind of loses some of the immersion for me can someone please make an a game on it maybe something similar to the expanse astronomers will be a thing of the past as the trails from airlines will finish the skies by 2049 in one word bullsht people there is a real life around didnt you know go travel make something real spend the time with friends family actually doing something not wasting it on this and similar oh i thought this is spaceengineer please join hello games space engine combined with no mans sky would be the ultimate space game 3 why would humans ever explore space for real when we already got this program spaceengine free desktopbackground creator thornezytkow objects when thats come a long way from a screen saver as awesome as a trailer can get are you able to make black holes and shit and throw shit like universe sandbox whens 0990 coming out i would live in this game welli am the only one that thinks this game is going to get the most boring game of the year award can i explore it on mac now deamn that looks good good now put it in ksp these generated images look better than nasas cgi its such a revolutionary application will there be a linux version i dont want this game i need this game only for vr brazil love this game thank you question can i put my own 3d model in this as a spaceship my laptop gpu starts bleeding after watching this hey anybody know who made music for this trailer this video make my computer crash even i am not playing the game lmao cant give you real so they give you fake this is great earth is flat interesting idea the cross between ksp and universe sandbox itll be an experience for sure imagine if this game went coop vr multiplayer what an experience that would be i been playing this game since 2016 and im going to be supporting and buying very soon what a load of rubbish even this mob of developers state in the games description it is procedural generated planetarium of the entire universe this is a lie even with predictive algorithms we can only state our observable universe because we do not have any information on our universe outside the observable i find this claim to be criminal at the least and it also tells children that we have observed the entire universe when that is a lie we have no idea how much of the universe we have observed i think you should add cave sistems to the planets also new intelligent life still waiting on that flat earth engine lol id rather stick with my free version thanks looks nice butt whatsthe music pleeeeeeaaaaaase impressive this is truly for the hardcore space enthusiasts i remember tinkering with this last year and now its become even way better underrated beautiful work guys spaceengine 034100 and 132155 very very greattt universe sandbox sweats nervously so what is this game is it like ksp but a much larger scale same as universe sandbox 2 im waiting on that free to play update its all dandy and cool but then you go to download it and then unexpectedly get hit by the paywall what a dissapointment the reason why it was free well because its an engine program and not an full fledged game where you would play it daily or every weekend it was always more of a very casual program that you would probably enter in only like 3 to 4 times per year something very very casual but now since it costs now so much money it would be a huge waste of money for just a program that you would enter only like 3 to 4 times per year what a terrible snobbish and overall low move to lock graphical update patches behind a paywall that is really some sort of eaactivision style dlc marketing mindset i would never though atleast they never told us that space engine is going to be pay2play thats also really low move to suddently do such decision without even watching this i immediately went and bought it on steam had no idea it was out already been waiting years for the big release o is it no longerfree can we please make this a crossover with kerbal space program and if you find a planet with plant life by stats youd still see nothing when navigating not even mentioned in this awesome trailer is vr support let me tell you its amazing to experience in vr i had the free version years ago and forgot about it for a couple years until i saw this in the vr section of steam and immediately purchase it i hadnt conditions to buy a better computer but patience and maybe 2021 i will literally the best news of 2019 i think im gonna cry the procedural generation algorithms are stunning fantastic work we have been a wait to see this come out for 1000 years no mans sky of a healthy man my i3 and gtx 570 is gonna tear up some frames man so delightful been waiting on this for some time universe sandbox or no man sky or kerbal space program or combanation of all them turn of the sound and play your favorite space atmospheric song and this is much better the new no mans sky looks dope how many i7s and rtx 2080s do i need for this monstrosity i am so happy to see se reach this point it is an incredible piece of work and an unrivalled tool to explore the universe in a realistic way to anyone who didnt know about se and feels curious about it just go for it no hesitation it will be an experience unlike any other ok frontier ask them how much does it cost make a deal plug it into ed and youre done hows this different from universe sandbox 2 if we imagine that these simulations will get extremely precise over time then elon musk was right we would eventually model the universe and ourselves again and we are probably the result of one of the almost infinite number of ancestry simulations ourselves made by the beings that are one stage up from us they probably look like ourselves too or like one of the other intelligent species in this universe assuming there is one its not a game its a simulation programm and a very good one linux support does it run with proton very realistic im a crazy lover of astronomy i never thought a game like this would ever exist thank you for creating this thank you to the producers ill buy this as soon as i can cant wait ive been waiting for this since december of last year i already know my graphics card will fail miserably but im buying this anyways just bought it and would buy it even if it cost 3x more 3 i didnt quite understand the actual gameplay need elon to play this someone get me a 4k raytracing vr capable cpu because this is insane is this a strategy game as well i see you can control a armada how does this compare to universe sandbox please dont be another no mans sky please dont be another no mans sky please dont be another no mans sky please dont be another no mans sky please knew you were busy with the steam version but shit such an extremely underrated game more people should be aware of this masterpiece is this a game pls add this to elite dangerous wonder what the surface of earth will look like nasa has entered the chat i hope i live old enough to see spaceengine 10 what about vr interesting you show a solar eclipse on earth i made a video about an unusual eclipse on my channel if you care to look and se was what i found for examining the details i tried universe sandbox first but its not an orrery and although it would give highly accurate simulations it doesnt know where the bodies were at any specific date and it doesnt run backwards so there was no way to get to this historical event with accuracy nasa has published charts and maps but thats not the same as seeing it happen in 3d space engine the free version available earlier this year was the perfect solution i verified that what i was seeing matched the nasa spreadsheet and then just watched seeing it happen in 3d is really the only way to gain an intuitive understanding i picked a couple viewpoints and added dramatic music thanks for making this software the unusual thing about this particular eclipse is that its track moved backwards thought it was spaceengine eers o i dont see any flat earther p someone needs to build a kerbal space program with this engine omg okay lets hope it makes a good cup of coffee love the audio guess whos buying this me well done amazing piece of software space engine aka wallpaper simulator dat muuzik i needs dat muuzik space engine just launched like minecraft and roblox its unbelievable that only one guy made this whole thing this would have required a lot of work can you imagine using this as the base engine for kerbal space program the most important game i expected at e3 anyone knows the source of music i see space but where the engine at how many stars does it cover space engine yes how is this different from the free version who else read space engineers and got goosebumps until it see the real title nasa shit panics my computer burst into flames just watching this in a word you can express this game amazing got my copy only steamplease come to consoles this game has a really really big future such an amazing game i really regret not knowing about it might aswell just buy it and enjoy my time on it anyone knows the source of music people should stop calling this a game would they ever turn this into a rocket sim like ksp or simple rockets 2 where you can pick a planet to start on then build spacecraft to explore the universe ive bought it but i cant build a spacecraft i dont have the build menu in the spacecraft manager how can i solve this issue thanks for reply love the music wish breakbeats were still popular nowadays even on that you can see curvature but when you do the test in real life we clearly doesnt live on a spinning ball what i think the must is we living on a flat dimension and if you reach the end you come back from behind not because were on a ball but because were in a 4th dimension with loop in spacetime that mean you cant leave this world you cant go on other planets because nothing from what we see in sky have life on it earth is a dimension for life not a planet but a planet for terrestrial plane or dimension its a long time since i use the first stages of your amazing simulation my daughter learn a lot about space thanks to you i wish you a great succes your work really deserve it the dude is an absolute legend oh my god ive been waiting for so long definitely buying i was hoping for game like univers sandbox where you can control ship this needs a linux port space engine now a epic store timed exclusive vr please what about se 1 its 3 years i waited for this moment i cant wait to buy it this does put smile on my face one minute of silence for all those people who dont know this game exists looks great but can i create my own star system with planets and everything including real physics with this we will make our own star citizen with the oculus it si haven t words ok this game has a bug already where if i go to tools then export skybox it will not let me leave it if i go to the back to the main menu it wont give me out of that mode idea not sure if this is the case already but make the version on the website paid for new users alpha or beta testers like me still get it for free for getting it early on but still have the update i think that only the game part should be paid not the simulation its nice of you to make a short trailer in addition to longer videos lets us get a glimpse first any one know name of song i love this song already got it congrats vladimir youre a legend it will be nice to have everything kept up to date by steam can i import my favourite places from 098 i just got the game today went to the trappist1 system was disappointed by the fact that c was the only habitable planet multiplayer oof i use this to learn instead of school i know you need to make money but it sucks that its paid ive been waiting for this update for a while and knowing that its gonna take a long time to buy it sucks impossible travels speed of light mind blowing especially because it is for vr i only buy gamesexperiences which have vr support at least i still remembered when i downloaded 0760 damn almost makes me wish i could go back credit card i choose you omg i am so excited going to buy the early access now i guess i better start writing more space music i am going to be capturing a lot of video i am glad i just upgraded to 32gb of ram any chance se will ever be on ps4 i think that space engine must costs much more than 10 you did amazing job its perfect simulator for all space lovers i really hope you will continue to improve your creation goog game i buy space engine steam yea its finally here can they make galaxies spin this time and add pulsar jets and the m87 jet and quasar jets bought it as soon as i got the notification email for the release ive been a fan since three years wooo cant wait to download i hope it costs money so i can give you some it is often said jokingly when praising someone this man is a god in mr romanyuks case is that compliment not an actual truth the man has created a universe in what way is he not a god holy shiet its finally here cant wait to melt my laptop with this ive downloaded this game and it keeps crashing as soon as its loaded is there a bug that hasnt

get to the star on planet when you click on them what key tab or what button do you press reply back what happens if you land on satern that warm oceania was 114c hey spike theres this really cool wiki where you can post your own planet you discover and make up a backstory about it or its inhabitants how he hit me maby noat i know how to go over the max speed use the and buttons to go into giga lightyears i found the edge of the universe please do more of this 1738 he had a life multicelular planet on da mouse u deserve more subs more views more and more likes you should try the trappist1 mod did anyone see that it said the sun had 13 planets warhammer 40000 space marine 2011 explore in youtube gaming youtube youre better than this space is boring the planet you surged was glliese 581 c whats the tax for the galaxies the dwarf moon looks like a butt im pretty sure the aliens have more lawyers than me can you also play space engineers it is a bit similar to astroneer but it isvery realistic i dont know if you can go to other planets on the game but it starts off with you in space with starships and rocks in space and you can mine in the rocks the biggest earthquke in the world in philippine 109 in january22017 years earthquake 1000000000 people die sun and earth become too hot because sun sun yellow 0 years to 2019 years sun red in 2020 years science people think sun is red in 2020 earth getting hot people want to go mars mars is cooler than earth donald trump say people want to go mars science think sun red only i know it earth getting hot in 2020 years lake and ocean wii dry we are moving to mars to be safe in mars mars have life think you very much donald trump say that in april12017 years what happened to the sun wait when we go to mars in 2020 years good bye earth in 2020 years 75 million people we are moving forward to mars to be safe in mars science people know about sun yellow in 0 years to 2019 years now science people know about sun is red in 2020 years science people is fake maybe real i dont know ask you science people know about sun you do how to make the lod kick in simply land on an object and stand exactly still spike on their website you can download a earth hd mod spike can you search for sagittarius a and when you find it go into it back first spike you can right click on a planet and then click the option moons and then that will show you all the moons to that planet yay space engine i like how you said we can go to interesting places now duude earth is the most interesting place you are going to find d anyway good videoreally interesting game and nice commentary the oceania you were on did have a huge ocean you were just under the surface and moving along the ocean floor thats why it was so dark d please do more of space engine keep up the good work go to betelgeuse 84 and if you want to see a black hole go to sagittarius a you sound like a completely different person from 2015 can you do more of this 16th comment but 135th view i think im dumb so im most likely wrong if you want a blackhole location i can give you one oh and im downloading space engine 0975 i have space engine but my computer hates the game and when i go onto the surface of planet it can barely load mountains and you can see through the surface because its so buggy i get jealous with your computers skill at loading surfaces congrats on the road to 1mill i remember when i was watching orbiter films still a good game this simulation is life be good if you could fly various ships from scifi franchises like star trek and simulate actual journey times between stars with whatever multiple of c their ftl drives can go they have to be pretty high mind you for my own scifi idea i started off with journey times first then worked backwards the first primitive ftl ship takes just over a day to go about 5 light years but thats still well over 1000c i thought i was making it slow might make the journey time a week instead this is scary af we would be gods if this had an evolution script if you tap on a planet and go to main menu watched this while capturing my spacecraft around jool using electric thrusters with insufficient power thanks scott i wish this game has a new uptade like do some stuff like universe sandbox w myn xd sorry but you just pronounce it in a fun way d nasa should see this this is one of my absolute favorite simulations and i too have often on accident referenced it as a game however right now i tried downloading it on my laptop and stars and planets wont show up when i fly in closer so i might have downloaded the wrong version or my computerlaptop just cant handle the graphics god space is cool why there is no app for this wow just wow beautiful what happens if you zoom in on earth in spaceengine can you see people walking around dogs cats horses fish etc i cant use space engine it is completely incomprehensible and useless i am just clicking stuff and i understand absolutely nothing worst most pointless software ever horrible interface from hell abiogenesis has never been observed to even be possible yet its pushed as fact every single observation has been the opposite showing that life only arises from life and never that life can arise from nonlife the constant pushing that it is fact because it is the only option is the antithesis of being antiscientific am i the only one who finds this game scary dont say mneplease is earth the only planet it says has life what is your favourite continent russia maybe our universe is just a simulation on a hard drive in a computer on someones desk in a different dimension nano nano so is just me or could that be the oceania the planet in subnautica are there really downloadable world textures that are up 600gb if so i hope a university or google will host a super version of this print screened at 2300 epic screensaver somebody needs to make a flat earth simulator and implement absurd physics to make it work and then shove it into flat earthers faces if this shit has space ships im in it no questions asked 315 whats the name of that music calling you scott manley from hawaii it wont start dear scott could you make a series of this awesome sumilator because you have space ships and all that love your video and how much knowledge you have over astronomy makes it so much better because i know nothing about it yet i find it very interesting i find it amazing that one man has made this spellbinding software first class effort eve like my fav planet in ksp is in this game sounds legit yes i know its not called eve scott i always wondered to myself since this a is procedurally generated universe if at any time even at a very very slim chance that eventually our universe will be somewhat simulated so much to comprehend but truly beautiful this is why i love gamesprograms like this give some reasoning to the pointless madness this is just like carl sagans imaginary cosmic travel definitely going to check it out put this game on steam now on earth that was not light from cities that is actually a map created by someone to show areas with most social media use the yellow dwarfe you said would super nova wouldnt it would just nova because it is lacking the mass to super nova at 1140 that would be gravitational eddies forming the surface or perhaps depending on the size it would be catch as catch can in formation with material just dropping on to the surface okay maaaaybe the crazy theory that we exist within a simulated universe isnt so crazy just one quick tip for everyone if you find pressing g to go to a place too slow you can doublepress g to fastgo to it which takes no more than a second also if you have a solid body selected you can press shiftg to land on this soft wear i actuallyfount a planet with multicellular organisms that are panspermia i was really surprisedthe funny part there like birds becauseit said thatthe organisms were aerial it wascalled a warm ice giant with lifethe average temp was 87 f then i found another planet in the same solar system that was a frozen gas giant its average temp was about 378 f it was another panspermia planet with more bird thingys xd i literally started tearing up because this is just amazing im going to download this right now even though i have astrophobia i will play this so much that it will just go away now to make a comment by using words the app suggests to me you know what i do not know the difference between being able to see you soon as you want me too much to ask me if you want to see the new version of the human rights group that has to be the same as the a lot of the fun of and i dont have to go out and about i love it when so ri and a the i have to a party and the first time half a million years times dollars i would download it but the world is actually flat and everything revolves around the earth and the contents of this game are fiction and lies designed to stop people from accepting religion wwwpenny4nasaorg imagine where we could go if nasas budget was doubled like this comment so people see it spread the word help start a new technological revolution spores got nothing on this are there no pictures of the milky way in an exoplanet there is ice form by water at high pressure so ice can form because of pressure thankyou for some fact d press g twice to go to a planetobject faster i am absolutely loving this programme wonderfully made so relaxing and educational damnit i misread the title i thought it said nothing to do but explode i was sitting trhought the whole video thinking when are you gonna blow stuff up oh well this is not a game this is art uy scuti is not the biggest uy canyus majorus unfortunately it still seems like theres more gameplay in this than elite dangerous and then they asked for another 3999 for an expansion the first thing i clicked on was a planet with cellular life wait wait wait wait wait wait this is free i was planning on not getting this even though it looks awesome since im super cheap but now that i hear its free ill donate 4sho a lot of writers dont figure out how long it takes to evolve life well we have a sample of 1 for all we know evolution took far longer to reach the type of life we have today on this planet than it usually does wherever else life exists uploaded a 1 hour and 20 minute video of spaceengine gameplay check it out imagine an rpg game based off of space engine it could go far beyond any such game available today holy crap i need new eyes just to comprehend this efolwiuffwnjfnwefwwlnvfkwjefwflwflewfwpefokpwefowefplwfkl kdied of prue epicness does it inidicate whether an object is real or procedurally generated eg a generated small extrasolar planet versus a nearby extrasolar giant planet of which some of the attributes that have actually been observed or have been assigned a likely guess since of course most observed extrasolar planets are large because theyre more easily observed north korea yep when they invent starships im going to build one and name it the uss manley dude this guy is so boring how long does it take just for him to enter a blood planet id love to get space engine but i cant get my head around how to download and install it tutorial please does this show comets and astroids went to some galaxy tried to get close to a big cluster of stars instant crash at least not as much better than ksp iswhat do you think scott how big is this game in terms of file size i guess it would be around 10gb to store all the code to generate that much information about planets i should stop watching space videos its making the hype for no mans sky even harder to bear oh my god yankee ok very good hamburger ever ok oinc oinctoo many burgers i wish i could watch someone explore space engine and commentate it with a scottish accent for the rest of my life theres just something about it why does it just end at one point and theres nothing but emptiness thats cool i know it can render gravitational lensing i definitely need a pc with windows i found planet with organic life very quickly people know almost nothing even about our solar system just many theories without real confirmations its called ice7 wow that dev guy is really clever and talented has the hubble not been beyond the milky way i know its likely a stupid question and i expect due to the vastness could take thousand of years to travel that far but if it has would it have an image of the milky way what platforms is this on a 20 million years old planet would be loaded with plutonium 80mya and curium 10mya w considerable amounts of technetium 4mya and neptunium 2mya the plutonium would be non fissile it would be only pu 244 but the curium and neptunium could fuel an interstellar civilization for millennia it would be a lovely place to mine i will nevrr not love space engine and se videos bring this to ps4 play with the exposure and you will find the satellite dwarf galaxies of the milky way scott manley hi man i wonder how i can get the planets surface to get more details like u showed that on selena d but water is at its densest state at 4 degrees celsius and then it is liquid you should turn on comets and asteroids so excited for this game to come to steam this summer 2238 well duh who would not know that srlly gheez imagine this with vr extremely cool this brings back so many memories my planet textures dont load pleas help me fix it this isnt actually a game yet its a space exploration simulator it has most of the cataloged starsplanetsgalaxiesnebulablack holes and so on everything else is procedurally generated currently there is a massive 10x10gpc cube for you to explore thats billions and billions of galaxies you are free to go into every galaxy to any star to any planet or moon and land on the surface theres terrain oceans lakes rivers mountains and now volcanoes black holes have lensing nebula are 3d rendered gas clouds you can fly through even land on planets in star systems in nebula thats quite beautiful each galaxy has a super massive black hole in the center its very accurate and realistic with current physics it list in depth detail about stars planets moons and so on the lighting is realistic theres comets with tails theres even life in systems that life could generally happen scott live in california i thought he lived in uk because of his accent love the vids but an easy way to find planets with life is to go to the star browser in the menu on the left hand side it should bring up a u lil menutab type the distance of light yrs in the search radius and the search button then click life tab should bring up all planets in range with life hope it helps bro keep up the vids i love space engine but i am having a hard time recording renderings i have all the bells and whistles to run the program but when ever i record full frame it takes about a minute to record 34 seconds of data any ideas on which program to record i have been to the website for help but have had no luck i have a brand new pc quad core processors 2 gigs of video memory and 8 gigs of ram any help would be appreciated thanks is wish mr manley would keep exploring the space engine i have space engine but my graphics are not good enough awesome as always scott i have a problem in 0972 where every planet is see through i only see the clouds and atmosphere also i crash near blackholes im on windows 81 wheres planet x really makes me wish i had a real gaming computer acer just doesnt cut it you should look upaplia cengagekepler186ftau ceti fgliese 581dhd 85512bhd 40307gkepler22bgliese 667ccgliese 581g the engine itself is very powerful i hope someone finds a proper use for it at some point besides relaxing exploration sorry what 1440p pixel rating when did this happen nothing to do but crash this build is quite unstable so i hope were not waiting 6 months for the next one ill probably lose interest in it this needs to be greenlighted you can just search for life with one of the menus google earth water normally gets less dense when it solidifies so it is hard to make ice by increasing pressure but it seems like it can be done 100kbar at 600k ice skating actually works by melting ice with pressure and reducing friction that way httpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb008phasediagramofwatersvg725pxphasediagramofwatersvgpng what about ktype stars they last for dozens of billions of years sometimes i like to think what if like people who dont have a constant place to live in on earth today just wander around like pilgrims or pirates in a possible future with ftl possible those people can just go fuck it ill just find a new planet for myself oh my god oh my god oh my god this is the coolest thing i thought you lived in scotland i need a new graphics card for space engine imagine kerbal space program in this space engine o i dont know how to get around in this thingmaybe a tutorial how are you liking elite dangerous ive got a question in space engine uy scuti is located around 144k ly from earth wikipedia for example says it is located 995k ly from earth something has to be not right does se not position them accordingly that last one there with the eve planet and the 82moon giantrs 84091353617160668 youre welcome now this game just looks fantastic this universe sandbox 2 and star citizen have really whetted my appetite for space games its a good year to be a space man bay area rocks yes ive been waiting for earth to get night lights it felt so weird looking at it before now it feels complete kinda funny how the life bearing planet is a desert and its lifeless moon is a temperate ocean world google earth is also amazing for looking at mars earth and the moon i have many hours spent just flying around so ill definitely check out this one someone should integrate this with an rng turning off all the display info and allow it to be played as a sort of screen saver you could just zip around the universe beautifully damn i wish kerbal looked like this and had this much scale what an incredible piece of software this is a great game except for the fact it crashes a lot about a quarter of the systems i visit crash space engine every time and one system i visited completely crashed my computer any ways to fix it also screenshots also crash space engine have tried it at least 10 times on different planets scorched muhnnn only bug ive found in this version is when getting close to a pulsar star the program crashes i got chills when he flew through that sunrise at the end this is really cool did you know that you can download highres textures for the planets in our solar system just 37 gb httpenspaceengineorgloadadditional3 is the blue star bellatrix new discoveries suggest that the milky way is more spirally than initially suggested it is not a game it is pure tranquil beauty based on scientific research the soundtrack to this is amazing quotingarcher scott did you ever play noctis iv its kind of like what space engine would be if it came out ten years ago isnt this sandbox universe 20 because the first attempt kinda suckedhope this is better i found a hypergiant in some tiny intergalactic star cluster didnt check its diameter but that would mean its bigger than a supergiant correct or is the terminology different this makes me wish for procedurally generated kerbal worlds with graphics like this you can do more than exploration you can terraform planets or moons and create fantastic landscapes or create your own star systems and change every celestial body at will its a bit clunky though you have to edit textfiles at some point to make it work i sincerly hope it will be improved in a future build this engine is so much cooler than elite dangerous in my opinion ihalfexpected the info on earth to say mostly harmless would have been funny i have found a beautiful water planet it had an also beautiful moon with an yellow atmosphere orbiting around it that screenshot i made of it is amazing i wish elite dangerous looked lke this the planet textures in that game are crap scott when your looking look for gliese 581 and see what you come up with you know the documentary of another earth you will know if they got that right or wrong in a case of minethe peope of the episode of the universe got that wrong you will see for yourself if you need anymore information go to my website httpwpmihqwixcomastronomyucbwelcomec1n8s scott manley jan bilang thats the point where space engine stops being a cosmos simulatorgame and becomes a piece of pure art that engine was going to be the foundation of infinityquest for earth right how is it possible that a desert planet with no atmosphere could spawn life but its moon which is half the mass of earth cant this is crazy but so amazing herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqe9qslyk5q4 at 248 is the magically appearing canyon scott mentioned around the 27 minute mark of this video because i know quite a few people will probably be curious to see it but too lazy to search someone please mix ksp with space engine where the fuck is isq found a couple truly weird planets if anyone wants to take a look if you can see this scott it would be awesome if you made another video like this where you went and visited a bunch of viewer submited planets rs 00015005430814362012 2 here is a planet that gets purple starlight from its suns and rotates at just the right rate around just they right stars that every other day one eclipses the other and the color of the daylight changes so every single day on this planet has very differently colored daylight in a continuous cycle rs 00015004093814978183833 22 and here is an improbable little ocean world where day is darker than night because of its proximity to the galactic core its tidally locked orbit around its parent gas giant and the dimness of its home system midnight is actually the brightest time of its daynight cycle and noon is the dimnest enjoy scott you should absolutely do more space engine videos love watching this game being played on a good machine if u like space or science write a down below lol at that canyon httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnm1r37ziboq i dowloaded dis version because i enjoyed when i found a volcano calling all ksp modders or 2812 2930 earth and eve from kerbal space program lololololhahahahaha i think this is a perfect platform for you to talk about astronomy hope to see more i can not wait until the goal gets reached for mac support for now im stuck playing universe sandbox i will be patient scott manley you should do a space engine exploration series it would be fun and educational at least in my opinion i love the part when you talked about the white star yellow dwarf binary in the smc though you gave up looking for life too easily lol you should have clicked some more stars the music in the background is incredible why was earth not described as mostly harmless also why is one of arcturus planets not called mengsk this is why i love your channel i didnt know about this one i just found the planet where no mans sky trailer was recorded ddd search for this rs 8409135371365935154 b3 ace combat fans dont you think it would be cool to see strangereal in this game you flew straight through the horse head nebula and didnt even notice i wonder if they have a model of ic1101 scott you mentioned some sci fi authors not considering this or that important factor in civilizational development id be interested to hear your commentary on which sci fi authors or books or series are most worthy of attention in that regard so wait you found a laythe orbiting eve awesome omg the best free space simulator out there got an awesome new update adding city lights better rendering and procedural stellar flares plus scott found eve and laythe xd i stuck a habitable planet around cygnus x1 he needs to make the kerbol system cx can my intel i9 and gtx 1080 run this game why did i have to see this video away from my goodcomputer i need it now not later the orion nebula looks a tad better in ed scott you should visit it there ksp needs procedurally generated solar systems scott the new video codec youre using is disgustingly bad for video games anything thats not moving quickly the background is only animated at a few frames per second and the whole effect is horribly jumpy is this a side effect of some new video software or a bandwidthrelated choice doesnt this m with the circle and the dot mean mass of earth or sun i dont think that means mass of ss i love space engine so much but its vastness scares the hell out of me every time i travel atimmense speeds im afraid ill go into a black hole which i did in the middle of the milky way i am always so afraid to turn around the camera after i go somewhere unknown because there might be a colossal planet or something right behind me anyone else get this weird feeling as well it unfortunately makes this not enjoyable for me i would love it if you could make this into a series scott maybe pick out some interesting places and tell us about them for example sagittarius a and why we believe it could be a supermassive black hole or maybe the tidal forces that create geysers on europa im sure a lot of people would be into that sorry bout the 4x post combo but at 1000 you found tatooine temperate desert in a binary system with lots of moons tip from someone who has played with this far too long if you hold g you go there much faster thank you for posting a space exploration video in honor of the 404th anniversary of the discovery of europa the first recorded discovery of an extraterrestrial object its a coincidence probably but really january 7th should be an official atheist holiday just yesterday my 5 year old relative came home from preschool saying she had just started learning about space i showed her space engine what do you want to see saturn x zooms out for a top down view of solar system with orbits and markers x do you know which one is saturn the six one well lets count the planets and figure out which one saturn is 1 2 3 4 5 6 ok thats saturn now press g to go we had a lot of fun i know she is going to tell her teacher about this i only wonder how if you hit the button with the little dots on the far left you can get a list of stars within your specified range and itll tell you a few details one of which being how many planets have life within that system help for downloading 1 there is an english button on the top left of the page 2 for the love of god dont use the first download link it takes hours the google one took a few minutes for me hmm i just cant find charon plutos companion this is not a game this is art scott the star browser will allow you to look for life this video relaxed me to a point where i nearly went to sleep they do have the orbiting galaxies there just hard to see 730 yes i felt it too guys having downloaded this and explored literally a tiny fraction i came across a tiny minute star ball or stars and within there i found an similar earth like planet with saturn style rings around it and 8 moons orbiting it with 1 having a greenish tint to the atmosphere it looked incredible i screen shot but i have literally no way of getting back there you late playing i wonder when well be able to take a galaxelfie one of the new gas giants for ksp should definitely be an ice giant hey scott i just wanted to tell you that i love this video and would love to see you do another space engine video youve got a great knowledge of space science and i love your commentary in all of your videos this is such a beautiful and impressive game i dont know what to call space engine and its great hearing it narrated by someone that gets it im downloading this wonderful program right now and will be donating on your recommendation ill keep watching for another space engine video and in the meantime ill continue to enjoy all of your other content hope to see you in star citizen at some point i hope you will play no mans sky when it comes out the developer should really set the life forms category of mars to robots why are the black holes at the centre of the galaxy giving of light is it supposed to take ages to download or am i dooing something wrong why do the other stars look allmushy small tip for people trying to download this dont bother downloading from the mirrors hosted on the site itself mirrir one and two its way faster to download from one of the others big difference between 8 hours and 10 minutes estimated download time 2120 i think you flew through horsehead nebula you are the reason why i am doing physics gcse i wish i had money to back this still pretty amazing though now just imagine ksp with these graphics why bother ever leaving the basement ever again can you do a 3 hour version of this video stayed up all night playing it thanks scott found my new addiction saw a planet half water and half desert like a half destroyed cadbury egg it rotated and revolved perfectly so that only the water was ever exposed to sun even after thousands of years the desert tundra half always faced away from the light just do a lets play this game is fantastic the website is russian i cant understand it in the game insert the coordinates hip 12468 1 and freak out probably the most insane planet in the universe holy shit how many gigs is this game scott do a video on the aborted spacex rocket launch that happend a few days ago you can look for life by bringing up the star search panel and the lifey planets are indicated on the list there i want to know where the databases are for these celestial bodies nice like to dislike ratio going on here life on eve confirmed o shift or was it ctrlf3 brings up search dialog where you can find stars which have planets planets with life and in 0972 you can finally apply filters to look for terras with life and such also the last planet scott visited was purple because it is assumed the cyanobacteria inhabiting the surface would be purple you can even see them changing colour according to climatic zones its truly an amazing universe simulator scott manlay can you make a review or at least have a look at universe sandbox i would really appreciate it and of course i think it perfectly fits into your channel and reflects your passion for space i just really wonder if the looks of the far away planet you have visited is based on some reallife evidence or knowedge we have about them or its just random render great video scott to find planets with life click on an icon with dots on the right side of your screen it should say star browser select a radius search and then click on a life icon so you get the ones with life on top that looks pretty cool gunna have to check it out myself for sure makes me think of roy battys final monologue at the end of blade runner ive seen things you people wouldnt believe attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion i watched cbeams glitter in the dark near the tannhuser gate all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain would be fantastic if you could actually find giant ships burning in space off the shoulder or orion tapping the g key twice will make you travel to your target at a higher speed for if youre impatient like i am as soon as i saw this video my first thought was harbinger dawns going to be in the comments section d as a side note space engine is an amazing simulater ive had it since 0970 and i can certainly say that its come a long way since then hats off to space engineer scott is it real ingame music i was hooked on space engine the day i found a planet that no shit looked like a giant chocolate chip cookie wont link for reasons of spam but yeah space engine is absolutely awesome wonderful couldnt help myself seeing it flying above the last moon conversion is in light seconds speed of light is 299792458 in ms to 1 c cover to lightseconds is 31560000 y i change to seconds your moving in seconds per seconds the speed is mind blowing so ever y 1c speed of light and from there on your adding a light year next is i dot remmber but it can going x 100 or 900 time that of speed of light thend it changes to 1 astronomical unit 499004784 light seconds next is 1 parsec 102927125 light seconds change it to light year and it 32 light years every second next is maga persec 102 927125 672 000 light seconds or 102927125 1014 light seconds so every seconds your moving that number to light years 3261000 light years every second next is 1 gpc 102927139014000000 light seconds or 102927125 1011 light seconds change it to light year and it 3261000000 light years every second remember u can change the speed so every time u hit the next level of speed u can still x it my 100 or 900 dont remember if i remm gotta get these graphics into ksp could you imagine if elite dangerous adopted some of these characteristics horsehead nebula at 2120 and when you found the life planet in the orion nebula i couldnt help but think aliens you found the ancient astronauts wouldnt high temperatures and pressures promote water to exist as a liquid instead of a solid since waters phase diagram is weird due to ice having a higher molar volume than liquid water im assuming you can take screenshots with this can you make the buttons disappear for that hey scott why exactly are the super giants all lumpy and often ovoid if someone made a game akin to pioneer or elite dangerous using space engine i would lose it that dessertocean planetary system at the end of the video was practically made for terraforming d i wonder if the fermi paradox takes panspermia into account standard candle915 i openly admit i was not expecting to enjoy this video as much as i did seeing all the planets and watching stars and galaxies whiz by the majesty of it all was incredible its hard to believe that those lowflying shots werent filmed in real life xd it totally devels to continous still no pulsars eh it would be interesting to see how one of those looks in se wait if life on earth came from mars then that would make us panspermians or whatever the correct word is right so if life on earth originated from mars would that mean if we moved to mars we would remain panspermians or would we become abiogenetic since weve returned home about the science fiction thing i agree which is why im not doing that with my book in fact both of the humanoid races have stars very similar to the sun and the planets orbit is only slightly closer or farther to change the temperatures dramatically and humans couldnt survive on either one has radiation that would kill a human over a number of months and of course has a different atmosphere the other is too cold for humans and once again has a different atmosphere makeup wow thats pretty impressive for one guy an en before the url will get you the english version enspaceengineorg wouldnt it be cool if we could find the kerbol system in this i havent been able to run space engine since 095 which is confusing since the system requirements havent changed why cant can there be a ksp add on that adds a whole universe to explore are you gonna make more episodes of this because i really like your commentary and scientific input on the different stars age and so on now you have to fly to all of these places in elite dangerous challenge issued awesome i was wondering if you were going to do another video on this with the new update and all i hope youre able to bring a little more attention to this amazing project i still cant imagine how awesome v10 will be whenever it releases just imagin this game is going to merge with kspish gameplay one shall be allowed to dream was kinda hoping youd show off one of the enormous black holes in the center of a galaxyoh well d next time try to find trenzalore or kerbin screenshot simulator 2015 lol planets like people are hot when they are young add physics add ship construction and u have ksp on a whole stack of steroids you can find life easily by using the star browser and sorting the list by number of planets with life either the games ground terrain has gotten a little bit less detailed or your graphics card is starting to get a bit dated scott maybe its time for an upgrade mindblowing i could watch hours of you flying around and explaining things tbh the music and your voice dont really go together in the best way actually i dont really care a whole ton for the music put your sunglasses on before 1808 i love your space engine videos and this was uploaded on my birthday couldnt have been more perfect just downloaded this today endless places to visit how long exactly does it take for life to evolve for people who wanted to see the magical canyon it gave me a good chuckle watchvnm1r37ziboq to see the genesis sequencehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnm1r37ziboq what if this game merged with kerbal wow wasnt able to stop staring at this beautiful images i had to go video still playing to his homepage and spend a few bucks it looks so gorgeous the largest star is vy canis majoris does the procedural generation change every time the game is run for example if i tried to seek out that exact world you found the one with 16 moon could i install the game and find it or would the game take shape differently on my end and i might find no planets around that star the one thing that the video taught me was how some stars are literally just alone for example the second star scott goes to the biggest weve found or something there are no stars near it or if there are i didnt see them could you imagine if our solar system was just like that so far away astronomically speaking at least the closest star is like 4 light years away but that is still pretty huge from any other stars with the only other object other than the celestial bodies in our solar system were the milky way which would be thousands upon thousands of light years away idk i thought it was a cool thought shit g to go on a surface there is a black hole in the center of the milky way that is interesting to look at games like this make my head hurt the size of space is simply mindnumbing thats why its so fascinating could this engine be used as a game engine to create a space game this would be awesome if they could mix in a bit of spore gameplay though more fun then original spore have you considered that these game devs and book writers dont think theres life out there are if evolution is a fact there is a search function you can look for specific types of planets even if they have life i imagine this is what it would be like to be a q i think the reason youre not finding life is you seem to be clicking on the brightest objects so the systems are usualyl too hot i found it nessacary to fly around at a few parsecs per second watching parallax shifting to see the fianter nearby stars gets you more redyelloworange dwarves that way if this game had oculus rift support and evesc gameplay all my dreams might come true and cool get halo 5 today for the love of whatever deities you have please through money at the dev so they can keep updating this and you scott please please please please please please please please please please play this again space engine have temporal aspect for example you can sit on the pole and explore never setting sun during polar day i am so excited to check this out its educational and inspirational and artistic i wish i had a projector id put this on my ceiling every night i go to bed wish i could read the website to purchase this lol anyone know how to translate cyrillic they should render the rovers on mars so if i were to find an alien planet with life is there a chance id see the night lights i have had space engine for awhile and this the one feature short of actual modeled societies on the surface ive wanted forever the aurora borelis on the dark side of the earth was a nice touch and here we see the wild scott manley in his natural haibtat space i see a lot of potential here for hours and hours of ksp fun and exploring if it can be modded into ksp of course it would be really great thing if someone could persuade this guy and squad to work together im blind now what part is based off of data are the stars based off of stars that we can observe europe is my favourite continent because i live there and have never travelled outside europe the dev should work for squad near the start with those red supergiants do they really have a surface like that or what idk if he mentions it in the video but i believe this game is free go to their website for a dl do a lot more videos about this and tell me about the science behind what we are seeingscott love this style of videos well we dont exactly know how long it takes to evolve life we have a single sample being our own planet with a seemingly infinite universe thats a pretty small sample of how long life takes to form so i see space engines been updated recently with a crap ton of bug fixes this makes me very happy procedurally generated universe like what infinity quest for earth should have been if it was developped and was a contemplatory space simulator kinda reminds me of elite dangerous about the procedurally generated universe with scientific data included wonder how we could compare both stuff we need a mod that combines this with ksp i have a gtx 970 and this game is amazing at very high settings time for debugging now it crashed many times on me and made a real bsod that made my computer reboot 2230 scott i think the term icegiant refers to gas giants that are made of gases other than hydrogen and helium such as neptune and uranus im not sure but i remember reading about that somewhere 353 i think you can see the small galaxy almost directly below the galactic center just a little smudge also this is just amazing i have been having fun and admiring the space with this game for a long time and its a really beautiful fact that the developer isnt charging for this i will definately support also space engine has full orbital mechanics i dont know if its mentioned in the video im not done watching which is also amazing great work this could also be a great base for a game continue doing a great job with this developer well thats epic lol i flew into a galaxy that had 4 trillion stars my whole screen was covered in stars and the game crashed it was pretty awesome 2708 is when i noticed the water world and i started screaming at my screen look left look left scott p what is the end goal with this thing a game in that universe random question what effect the suns tidal forces have on the earth and the moon i know that the two will get tidally locked to each other in a specified amount of time the moon is locked already but what happens next the em system is still rotating faster than it orbits around the sun so i suppose the sun would keep slowing down the systems rotation converting its energy into heat the moon will ironically get closer and closer if i imagine correctly will it end up in the roche radius and get torn apart in fact shouldnt that happen to every planet system with moons in the sol my theory might be entirely off so i would like a professional explanation also thank you for replying to questions that combined with the fact that you make videos like this one makes you an amazing source of knowledge this is space engine 1 or 2 got a challenge for you scott find a black hole and try take a plane andor a space ship and fly throught it p ps you forgot to show os the plane and spaceship part of the gamesimulator program p theyhe need to collaborate with squad d manley shift f3 you can even sort by number of planets with life is it a lawrence is it a bieber no it is a selina but not selina gomez ofcourse lol shouldnt mars have panspermic life i mean even the cleanest of instruments still houses a whole lot of microbes these space engine playtroughs are really fun you should do more 325 thats actually not a picture of another galaxy its an artists rendering of the milky way made by a member of the spaceengine community based on real data 350 the closest galaxies are there at least some of them sag deg in particular is what youre probably looking for theyre not visible in that view because theyre too dim to be readily noticeable 425 hubble classifications for galaxies denote bars by a capital b small letters a b and c denote how tightly wound the arms are so sbc denotes a barred spiral with loosely wound arms sb denotes a nonbarred spiral with moderately wound arms though some astronomers suspect that andromeda may also be barred thus making it sbb in the hubble classification system 1210 use the star browser shiftf3 or gui icon to find worlds with life 1625 higherres textures for solar system planets are available on the website 1748 in that case it was the system that was selected instead of the physical s does it have asteroidscomets already especially in our own solar system like p67 does the boxed version have big friendly letters on it saying dont panic you found a triple system 1207 oddly enough this was a rather enjoyable video i wonder whether youve visited alpha carinae in one of your space engine episodes im curious if theres an easter egg there my crappy pc cant handle the greatness of these graphics and celestia is too realistic to have what im talking about horsehead nebula at 2119 the interface of the program reminds me a lot of stellarium are they connected somehow nice to see a represtation of gods creation space engine is really a marvelous skybox if only someone mounted a space exploration game on top of it well as a biochemist i was certainly surprised to see the developer putting photosynthetic life in the game that it is not the boring green variety it irks me to no end how people assume that plant life has to be green in games especially when plants in our planet are most likely green by accident especially because in a planet like that endogenous plant life would be most likely purple like it was in game on the panspermia issue while im not on that side of the discussion there is a lot of people that dont like to lump accidental life spread between planets say like it could happen between venus earth and mars with supposed ease via micrometeorites and deliberate life spread and they only call panspermia to the first of those and regardless of making that division or not there is always the pseudopanspermia hypothesis that states that while li sweet downloading right now btw guys the first dl link is super slow use the google drive link that one only took me 2 minutes finished while i was typing imagine combining this game with kerbal space program its things like this that make me want to get an oculus rift you are a brilliant nerd young sir please dont ever stop sharing your videos with the world would be cool if the developer put the kerbol system in hidden away as an easter egg somewhere the pink planet at 2600 is lying on its side and revolving at a 90 inclination the pink stuff is life close to the equator cooooool i need this he should have gone to sagittarius a hey scott are there any black holes orquasars did the developer also add some fanservice like a galaxy far far away or kerbol that would be awesome hi guys this is going to be a short but desperate message please download appnana for free just 1 mb earn amazon gift cards and register an account totally free once you logged in go to get nanas tab in the invitation space put this code in h7737344 if you do this you help my family a lot if you have faith in humanity as i have you shuold do this for me only need 2850 volunteers if you think i am a 5yr old dude who need a new xbox you are wrong i have faith in you that last pan from the ocean world surface to space through its atmosphere completely sold me on this damn this is gorgeous this sim is incredible wish most of the spacefiction games were as interesting to explore as this one nice video except i feel like the music was a bit loud p this is eyegasm overload 2621 on the left side of the screen on the top half pokeball cloud d xd also as scott said there are a lot of settings to adjust some of the more notable are the exposure gamma and relative brightness of objects in the game scott has dynamic exposure enabled and culling on less luminous objects which can make the game quite dark and hard to find stars galaxies etc some settings for new players to try lens effects astroniki2b stars motion blur on dynamic exposure off real planet brightness off real star brightness on most realistic less funky looking planets night side lights on exposure 1 magnitude limit 7 stars overbright 7943 landscape lod 1 these give a space telescope style planetarium look to the game with masses of detail some galaxies like lmg are extremely dense with stars though landscape lod 1 is the best for flying in close viewing from low orbit and landing if youve found some amazing location on a planet you can set your setting to lod 2 to have the engine basically spend infinite cpu cycles impro any tschurjumov there how do i say shut up and take my money in russian wish the map in elite was this good ice forms because of pressure i thought water was uncompressible and water expands when it transitions to a solid how can pressure cause it to turn to ice great look at a genuinely brilliant piece of software just existing in the universe real or imagined of se can be quite a moving contemplative experience it makes space tourists of us all and barring some amazing scientific revelation this virtual tourism is as good as well ever get ive spent an hour or two exploring the canyons of dusty ocean planets and sat on beaches watching the sunrise looking back at the milky way magic stuff more of this funny thing is that with direcx 12 youre supposedly going to be able to render those kinds of scenes in real timewich is just going to be amaizing such an amazing program a shame my computer cant run it at its highest graphical settings but still amazing regardless i really hope that guy will add bh accretion disks that would be awesome d dude i almost fell asleep because of the music lol im getting this game to make background screens xd you forget how huge the universe is im not sure if im humbled or scared this thing is amazing to play around with when high a free awesome looking game downloads right away i wonder if kerbin was put somewhere in this if you zoom out far enough can you view the entire universe hey scott great news my new computer is good enough to run this d the universe is a crazy place so crazy ideas shouldnt be viewed as crazy try looking for easter eggs like the worlds and places from battlestar d actually i remember seeing caprica in the game iirc im gonna download this thanks for showing us scott how big that program is 30 gb i was hoping youd make a new video about this update i thought the title said space engineers this game seems good as well space engine is perfect for screen shots the planet detail is amazing for those who want new desktop backgrounds its also great for those who want to explore for fun it can help writers who want to write scifi stories with the protagonist going to different planets and stuff similar they should add this to ksp i so badly want to smack the next person i hear say procedurally generatednothing against you scott just seems to be the current buzz word do you remember of your pcs specifications scott i want yours so bad d scott have you tried out the ckan mod manager yet great video keep them coming this is free outstanding definitely need to support this project its just half an hour of space porn im in and look at it now a masterpiece almost 10 years later and 0990 finally came out wow its been 9 years and even back then it looked incredible pretty much started as a procedurally generated version of celestia damn space engine has come far 2018 and now is the best space sim ive ever played better than universe sandbox 2 engine bullshit visit spaceengine org i only just realised this is episode 96 this series is really long i might watch it from the beginning soon because i really like this series hey bro your videos are really good keep up the good work space engine 0990 is said to be released soon on steam will you continue the getting lost in space engineseries with 0990 rs 8474140571498857528 b a y class brown dwarf orbited by 2 terras none of them have life though im so glad your back keep up the great work magnetars have a very very strong magnetic field that can kill you although the gravity is nothing to shake your fist at also neutron star and by extension magnetars have starquakes literally just called that because creative scientists whats your game called might check it out will check it out today on sadomasochist games man develops walking simulator in space that id totally play not as much science stuff in this one but as per usual my white noise generator is back does it work on htc vive space engine 9 confirmed by nasa when is this coming i have the software but it doesnt support the rif now flying through the universe does it work with rift cv1 somehow the image doesnt render on the rift only on the monitor the headtracking arent working i suggest you put the stereobase to 50 on default 50 is perfect it feel like you stand on the planet at the lowest you can go and also many people dont even know that they have to adjust the stereobase if they want to see 3d so i would put the default stereobase at 50 this is incredible hope it comes to vive yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes all of the yes i want this so much man your lucky my pc cant even run this in more than 3 fps im planning to build one with a 980 ti oh man cant wait i just need to get a job lol does anyone know how to increase load speed for lodlevel of detail i have it set to the second lowest setting and id really like to increase it without getting massive lagspikes does head tracking work if so please tell me how all i get is oculus 3d but no head movementdo i need something nice keep up the good work question how do you get the tracking to work hi what is your setup if you feel sick move to 850 stunning space engine is amazing should be in every school fly into a black hole i dare you your computer is too slow for that game a lot of slow down and choppiness when loading textures upgrade to my acer timeline 1410 with intel core 2 solo processor today for only 300 works great on my dk2 if you are on a smaller laptop or you can put your face very close to the screen and it will merge it will be extremely blurry but still looks cool on a phone you could do the same spent a few hours with dk2 and space engine frist time ever i did not experience nausea with the rift i would recommend this for anyone who has had trouble in the past if i got this i guess id only use it for a few days because id never get out of it and starve to death as you did to install the space engine and i tried the space engine and it did not work right when is dk2 support due to be released i wonder why not the dk2 well i guess i need to buy an oculus rift now this is just amazing holy mother of amazingness works nicely with a google cardboard headset this is intense thank you spaceengine dev cant wait for the new release that was the best twenty minutes ive ever spent with my eyes crossed wheres space engine v10 please make a mac version i beg of you this is incredible but did you implement your own camera frustums instead of sticking with the default oculus sdk settings1800 when near the ship on dk1 it doesnt seem like the 3d is correct im watching the video now also it looks like it desperately needs a cockpitmode for enhanced sense of scale and nausea reduction or at least an option for it preferably with an avatar body source working on unreal engine 4 rift game that is set in space oculus best practices guide nice this is one of my favorite universe simulators and im glad to see oculus support come to it i thought wed see aliens playing with marbles in the end it would be absolutely awesome to map velocity control to positional tracking this would allow you to lean into individual solar systems i think i know how q feels is dk2 supported ii always get scared when i leave the milky way rift space engine is going to the most epic awesome amazing scary and super beautiful experience oh as soon as oculus rift consumer version will be released im totally getting it at least for this i can finally ascend and be 5dimensional being just need a better pc damn in aleatory future version example spaceengine 0982 can add 3d vegetation and if be possible 3d animals the plants in terras and the other type in terras too deserts oceanias titans i knew it was only a matter of time thank you for posting i will happily fund raise and talk to everyone i know about you and this amazing universe simulator new hdr bloom for stars is just awesome this update is the best worst part i went to newtron star and black hole is crash my computer looks like i cant wait to buy oculus rift d can u add quasars white dwarfs neutron stars pulsars and other space phenomenon immersion time oh hell no the game is scary as it is i can cross my eyes and merge the images in my vision for 3d d does this have any significant depth when you view stars that are so far away i mean our eyes are very close together when compared to interstellar distances so it all just looks flat all the time maybe you expand eye distance so you feel bigger if you move really fast trough space when is the new version coming out this looks amazing and four in the night sky omg thats a planet that needs to habit life triple galaxys right next to each other now thats rare rs 84749147166148610 a4 a terra with pink life on it and a moon verry similar to our own only difference is that this moon is larger and more dominant gravitationally and its orbit is more elliptical in your next space engine video go to a procedurally generated planetary nebula rn 0811085299610103 and answer this question do you think procedurally generated planetary nebulas should have procedurally generated white dwarfs the same question can also be asked regarding supernova remnants you should also go the ss 433 the brightest black hole in the game and last but not least rs 847413538118433081440 a ratherinteresting neutron star i loved that game memories this game reminds me of why i loved starflight not to be a dick but if you can do you think you could talk much louder and have more enthusiasm in your voice it sounds like youre bored in every video doesnt matter to me much though i still love your videos especially the end of this one when the suns rise and set and as the gas giant blocks the two suns that was amazing to show that i want to live there how do you search a planet code i use the normal search f3 but this doesnt seem to work as i look at this earth looks like crap imagine that 3 planetsmoons with life i can only image the simlarities or differences between the inhabitants love the series thanks a new video is uploading as i type this autoliked no need to watch first haha i wanna see more of each planet well its pretty much telling you what to do you either need a new graphics card or to update the driver so that its compatible and dont worry i cant run space engine either i just have to stick with watching videos until i get a better computer loud music plays i cant hear you the music is too loud awesome planet though can you imagine if we actually found a planet like that thetripleentendre you should make rpl2 now that 0971 is out and 0972 isnt too far behind because there are different forms of life you can check out from gas giant life to methane based life on titan and exotic life forms unknown to science its cool where do i put these codes i cant hear you becouse of the music now that is an awesome planet what did you say i cant hear you over the music if im not mistaken there is a sort of texture pack that you can download that makes everything realistic and it comes from nasa but its a huge file i think yeah well i have a 7970 ghz edition and now all procedurally generated planets look brilliant but earth still looks low res love the music makes me think of master and commander3 mass effect 4 nasa want her computer back wait what thats the challenge yeah i figured it out my bad my stupid assumptions lol its too bad the series had to end i loved your emotion while you were exploring these planets nooooooooooooooo make more episodes plz i love this series i think its outerra ante world i randomly find you here l the music fits perfectly but you should turn it down next time rs 840311496783422015 2 rs 84031144207031 a41 rs 840311471059952308 a4 mars 2 rs 840311471059939258 one of two awesome life worlds in system rs 840311488479626154 b4 oceania with life 24 cam a3 earth 2 hd 25521 b1 hot oceania with life in system hd 138573 b6 very cool planet life when are you gonna make the second series how did you get the detail to show that good i set everything on my graphics to high and its no where near as good looking planet surface as yours its from master and commander not sure which track though i really enjoyed this series and id happily watch a second season if you ever chose to make one thank you for this what music is this yeah ive always wanted to see a rogue planet that was actually depicted right when going into your next series i think one interesting thing to check out is orphan planets planets that have no parent star perhaps due to being thrown out of orbit and just travel through empty space in eternal night a good location for an observatory thats for sure im not certain if they generate in space engine like if planets are only generated orbiting stars but if they it would be great to land on one as a short part of an episode as ive never seen them accurately depicted i cant watch this on ipad i swear to god that when you did a time lapse of the planet the days passing that it looked like real life amazing i heard the song at 600 on piranha 3d that was beautiful it looked like something out of an asimov book i wonder if terminus and trantor could possibly exist in this sim hey thetripleentendre what computer do you have i have got 4 gb ram but win 7 32 bit see only three of them loving the series but i dont like how the music gets way louder than your voice you should use the space ships that was added in 096 well i think the ships were added in that patch you deserve waaaay more views man great voice great video quality good music choice imo although try to keep the music on the background a little bit but theres a sunset at the end huh dont know what that means then you can see the milky way even during daylight interestingly the planet has the same rotation period and orbital period to me that implies that its tidally locked and has no night or day might explain that weird swirl pattern seen on the sunny side thank you for making a dedicated series to such an awesome engine you deserve way more views glad i found you the games size is 1g now i cant wait until my download is complete th game is muuuuch much much much better now literally no gameplay 910 ign zomg i forgot how much you sound like booster gold can you help me with a null error ifspace engine elite dangeroushad a baby best game ever created could be a good teaching tool for would be scientists or students to explore what we know of the universe thus far a game should be made with this engineseamless transitions from space to planet surfaces seamless travel from star to starseamless travel from galaxy to galaxy and all that procedurally and with breathtaking graphics its just awesome if only a game like shores of hazeron unfortunately discontinued could be matched with this engine imagine the possibilities how did you download it i dont know i looked alot im soo mad currently the largest game in history game has been released by the way you can make an documentary with these just some explanations and hide the gui and youre ready ps you earned an subscriber i just wish the developers would install a deceleration button for the spacecraft and airplane mode that would take the exploration experience to a whole new level at the moment i just tape down the move forward button and interchange between free spacecraft and airplane mode but it does make it hard to reverse engines my god so much potential this is amazing jumping from galaxies to planets and beyond reminds me of spore really intresting and cool demo cant wait for star citizen as another said star citizen guys should hire this guy shame its probably a different engine reminds me of an educational software called celestia v16 looks as if someone tweaked that software for the gaming market not bad actually planetary detail can be very high in the options menu set lod to 1 ripperx left it set at lod 2 which is low detail it has a promising start the space i see needs some work this star warping like that looks a bit cheesy planets terrainatmosphere details need quite a bit more work guess another year or so and its quite epic by then did you check the goals there going to make it an mmorpg with giant space battles and you can colonize planets and build space ships and space stations and terraform planets and destroy cities planets empires but you need to donate money you didnt scratch the surface of this nebulas different types of stars different planets so much potential ripper this engine would kick ass in sotse what do you think that was ur anus d hey ripper can you do an ama maybe sometime on reddit need a game with this skyrim space oddysee wouldnt say it was new ive had it for over 2 years now the people making star citizen should see this wow all i have to say is epic great find ripper ps when are those dayz standalone live streams you were going to do after the holidays i am liking this series checking out various game engines please showcase more little bit more pop in rendering than the last engine but still jaw dropping on scale that planet is an oval waitso i could fly my space ship to my farm house on some random planet sweeet this comment section is full of fossils s kommenten plten es jelp ov focelen how do i find a celestial object whenever i use the search feature to find an r object like an rs it wont show up any celestial body thats created using procedural generation in the game wont show up thanks select the milky way and press ctrlg prepare to shit bricks i love to be on ringed planet with life and with a binary star thetripleentendre so glad spaceengine is free it looks absolutely amazing so wheres the life lol i think you need kinda of a good pc to run this since all the universe is procedurallygenerated i think that you can see the minimun specs in the space engine page is their any system requirements to get space engine i tried to launch it once but it kept failing on me agh i wish my computer was good enough to run this is it a torrent go to spaceengine org google it its going to have a download link on that page then there is no installation you just download it unzip it to a known location go to that location and doubleclick on the space engine application you do know what application mean riiiiight it is but this ancient contraption i have here almost exploded when i tried to go to an exoplanet it just can hardly handle the terrain generation this game is freaking awesome isnt it what if the only life on that planet is microscopic and in a small pool of water also i found a pretty comfortable planet with oceans and blue skies but no life what version is this love the series keep it up awesome do more great suggestion check out the new episode how do you get that detailed surfaces that fast also nice video d be cool if you sat on each planet you visited and just fast forwarded through a full star cycle and showed what living on each planet for a year would be like did anyone imagine my voice like it really is from my posts nah on the web everyone sounds the same for some reason your installation tutorial sucks you just zip around like a fool on speed its impossible to follow do us a favor by not doing another one hmmm lol its forbiten you god damn idiot and the link doesnt work when i launch its says error loading texture generator please if you have a solution pls help me pls when i try and download it it says 404 not found i can tell you after opened space engine it give a error and if i press close or ok it opens and closes the program theres no work progress and public beta test 0974 how do i fix will this work at mac the space engine works fine on win 10 but always crashes at win 7 on start up do you know whys that is there any fix hi i am unable to install the spaceengine 0972 i am facing difficulty in the download process as in the setup file while the setup file is downloading at around 500600 mb the browserchrome crashes and says chrome has stopped working how do i overcome this please help thanks this helped d never mind i am stupid as f xddd we need a video of how to install mods at space engine there forums are not as good please the 80 of se have no idea of these giant scripts etc when i download the game meh giant big error the error said your cd card is not that high for those graphics then tell me how to fix it and make it work hi do you have any idea re the planetstexsepak installation i am wondering if you have to install all the pac files say for the earth graphics do you need to install the bumppbc16kpak the bumppbc32kpak bumppbc64kpak and the bumppbc128kpak or can you just install say the 128pac i have experimented with them but to me the quality of the earth graphics on the surface are very poor when compared to the graphics of planets outside the solar system your monetized video wont make a lot of money for spaceengineer i dont get it please help me when i go to development status and then press work progress and public beta test 0974 then it takes me to download se 0974 rc2 13 gb you see that rc2 it doesnt change yours in 08 and mine is rc2 this in a problem i cant download it btw ive been working on this a whole day and this is the final resolute what if downloading failed v will this get me a virus thanks so much it worked for me thank you this helped alot have you ever made a video about installing mods for space engine help for the patch 0974 planets and ships are invisible please help great video thanks this is one of the most beautiful and peaceful games ive played its so satisfying exploring space im having trouble getting a few mods installed ie rodrigos terrain mods just wondering if you could lend a little advice thanks again thanks this video helped this fixed 0973 for me not sure why so many people find it difficult to install and update but thanks for making this video for them the bad thing about this is that it is impossible at a humans normal lifespan to see all the planets are these all actual objects in the application this is not really a game i think btw i wonder how they could tell if planets actually have life it is a desert planet a bug planet 4800 wish my house was that cold scott manley can u watch cute cats can you get this for imac and is it free are you from the same place as razzbowski this game is great especially if u r interested inspace like i am scott why do you use the kelvin system instead of celsius if you live in scotland this project need help who can help whit money do it its look beter than star citizen it has already collected 30000 and he needs 50000 more to convert the project to the game this will be the best game of the year httpenspaceengineorg brown dwarfs the australia of space seriously i cant explore solar systems without orbits activated that way you can actually see what the system looks like as a whole not just look at individual planets one at a time iif you wana great space engine experience open up the interstellar soundtrack on youtube in the background i landed on some planet with insane textures and i was like oh whats this time button okjaw literally drops such a lovely game especially if you love astronomy and anything to do with space thanks for showing me this game i appreciate it loads d scott one of the stars you were clicking on had a planet with life 2502 and you didnt click on it the only way this game could get better is if they managed to generate intelligent life and animals i saw the description i can understand and read and speak some russian what you should do as i have done this before is turn on max brightness and zoom out as far as you can you will then see that the games universe is shaped like a cube with its length being 13000000000 light years approx pretty awesome as you can zoom out a tiny bit more and see just a small cube that is that big i found a neutron star in this game but sadly when i got close to the neutron star my laptop crashed so then all planets must have a sun and at 4932 wtf i think the milky ways black hole is caled saggitarious a but i might be wrong and at 1233 so bright umm the biggest stars are red supergiants or hypergiants guys forget all simulators who doesnt have a black holes se or slace engine at 096 version has got supermassive black holes just select galaxy spiral and press f1 and find this hole using map this is a great video and a really nice program one thing missing watching your solar systems in fast forward makes for some really cinematic views time controls are in the bottom left of the screen want me to code that big number well here it is 129798398239873 pause at 033 that looks beautiful to me and oddly familiar also that most massive star is r136a1 which is in the r136 star cluster which i think is in the tarantula nebula at around 838 im freaking out because youre not clicking on the planet with the double rings wtf man oh be a fine girl kiss me 5030 omg a planet with life 023 wow is that spiral completely procedural or was it alien interference i wish there was an oculus rift compatible version of this 3338 that warm selena moon would only be about 25 degrees celsius so temperature wise it would be pretty habitable just imagine being in a desert are there any other lifebearing planets other than earth and can you interact with that life when i learn something new and more detailed from scott that i learned in astronomy class or in my own studies i first wonder if theyre actually different forms of the same information then if i was taught incorrectly and lastly but almost never if scott is incorrect because come on its scott manley when he was looking for a black hole who else screamed control 9 try to be like a human in that last planet and lets see what it looks like 5029 1 with life facepalm after what seems like an eternity we have a new update to space engine which adds new effects like aurorae cometary halos evaporating planets and oblate objects so i set out to find something interesting in this vast universe then i realise i cant remember the names of anything beyond our solar system that g type star in the beginning is just 600000000 years old so these planets there are probably still protoplanets that might also explain why they are so close together at 412 it looks like the sun is blowing up it would be awesome if kerbal space program was with this render your curves for my pleasure was fasinated downloaded it installed it run it graphics driver crashed and pulled down everything else with it much damns and pissed off feelings took me hours and much hastle to get back where i was not blaming the software much though as im runing on a 2010 thinkpad t500 i just discovered this software and i am totally in love with it this game played with the occulus rift must be amazing are there black holes or neutron stars here also do these celestial bodies move this game is so boring no offenseif you put procedurally generated solar system into ksp though it would be so much better o haha when i try to download it i get an estimated time of 12 days it wont let me download space engine it says too many users have viewed or downloaded this file recently help one my favorite star systems in space engine is alcyone you should chech it out scott nice video scott you guys should check out my short movie from space engine there has been a lot of effort and time put into it enjoy interstellar journey kerbal space program this game best experience ever the dark side scott click l to increase time and k to decrease to watch the aurora or watch planets orbit rotate this is one the coolest things i did this year i could do this for hours fly through galaxies or over planets and suns its so addicting 5029 12 planets 1 with life hey scott how do you get your hud like that this is an awesome exploringuniverse game im getting this right now the guy who made this deserves more fame your cool howis a game so universally ha big able to run onmere desktop computers anyway seriouslyi would love to know the mechanics of it this game is just epic add ships multiplayer dogfighting and this would be an awesome ship game also the star he was talking about is called r136a1 it may help if you search ngc 2070 than tarantula nebula that mite be the problem i dont like to download this much at alli actually like it but no because the installation is a monster huge file scott lets fly towards this nebula flies toward lmc i cant access the website do you know was it taken down is there anywhere i can download the latest version thanks does anyone know if you can see the atomic makeup of all these things in the game id love to see a breakdown with rough weights andor percentages of each element for all the planets stars and other bodies you come across even for the nebulas i would find that very interesting also are there any mods i feel like theres so much untapped potential here just out of curiosity what is your job is this on a mac our black hole is sagittarius a not really i make a bit of money to buy games and hardware but most of my income still comes from my day job is scott a professional youtuber search r136a1 the most massive star known also you can double tap g to go to the object in super fast mode actually as you use it and downloads textures it can get over 10gb mine is 968gb yes it is just dont think about it 30 sec to download infinite time to explore read the website you downloaded it from derp science on a side note campkillcommentary does funnyinteresting videos on his youtube channel addressing scientific concepts while playing cod in his commentary 10 is reality real he talks about the holographic universe hypothesis that suggests we are all living in a simulation like space engine i hate that you cant post web addresses in comment replies dont forget that the universe is also full of a lot of empty space the positions of objects are basically 3 numbers that represent x y and z so 0x 0y 0z will be the center of the universe and our star might sit at 101x 250y 399z while alpha centauri might sit at 220x 490y 900z the program isnt spending a lot of time thinking about those points in space where nothing is obviously im simplifying a bit but thats the basic gist of it actually the program crashes relatively frequently for me and for many other users because of lack of ram memory to store all the data i adore your scottish accent scott d not 129798398239873 things 129798398239872 things to explore if hed has 100 mb internet it actually would be possible maybe not 30 but 6090 yeah i need some help with space engine im trying to go fullscreen but ctrlenter isnt working and i cant find a fix on google i would appreciate it if someone could help me space engine waste time like a professional 32gb of ram helps i didnt download the torrent for this i downloaded it from the 1st download link i have no idea what to do now after i do the winzip shit 146 watch how fcking amazing that looks continue watching from that point i actually dont understand the infinity of the universeoh well i probably never will anyways and to memorize a star the computer only needs 3 numbers x y and z coordinates if you add movement you have another 2 numbers speed and direction so its not that hard to understand and downloaded in 30 seconds you should give your internet connection to nasalol even a kid wont believe that the snow on the planet with the green oceans could be made of metal b it snows metal at venus poles id already been told but thank you for telling me another point of understanding it d 129798398239874 things to explore more than a google yes black holes radiate their mass away over time god day scott ive managed to find the milky ways supermassive black hole dont tell me why but its name in space engine is rsc 84041059000 s just so you know well the computer itself doesnt memorize anything on but graphics in space engine its ran on many different scripts telling the computer what objects are where on a xyz grid everytime the program is launched the computer reads these scripts for example our earth is at 000 in the universethe only thing thats hard on the computer are the graphics you gotta have a beefy system for the program the program becomes less and less laggy the more you use it memorizes graphics in cache everything you see is fractally generated by algorithms not statically created it isnt anything new still the fact that theres so much stuff going on is amazing computers have come a looong way and in the near future10 years stuff like this will be childs play procedural generation look up how it works your computer must be amazing because i have a much above average computer and mine takes about 45 minuets to download crap ive downloaded it to check the center of the milky way but it seems that it crashes every time im actually near the center strange black hole near the center should be sagittarius a hey does anybody know how many real astronomical objects are cataloged in space engine i havent seen any official statement on that a whole lot of objects i try to look up arent there at all its not random though its procedurally generated by a seed everybody gets the same objects in the same places thats why we can all share the id numbers and see what each other finds it randomly calculates things based on possibilities of what would be around a star so what one person has another might not you sound like captain pike when you say lets see hey scott if you want to find a black hole you can travel to the center of the milky way i remember watching somebody else looking for one and it looked like there was a super dense area of stars near the center of the galaxy so you can maybe try looking there if you want looked from year 5800 to 12000 and still nothing showed up as orbiting that star that close can you find it youre propably at a different time in space engine and you obviously dont know what an ice giant is look it up on wikipedia also the cluster isnt half shaved off like in the video just went to that star from the end of this video those 2 really close planets are not in the simulation for me nearest planet to the star is a hot ice giant seriously hot ice which is 109au from the star rsc 840413130043 so what happened to those two superclose planets i havent done the maths but i think its comparable to the propability that you win the lottery 2 times in a row or something like that so its not saved anywhere the numbers generated are is a consequence of logic and mathematics if you want to speculate where they come from my buest guess is that they are inherent to the universe much like platonic ideas or mathematics itself mathematics is like a window into an infinite parallel universe just in the case when you need deterministic random numbers you set the seed yourself instead of setting it according to a system timer this will give you large sets or pseudorandom numbers that are determined its like the mandelbrot fractal you can define a point or region of the mandelbrotfractal with very few numbers but the complexity and diversity inside it is in some sense infinite the brilliant thing about it that it is not memorized it takes a pseudorandomnumber generator and intializes it with a certain seed this pseudorandomnumber generator can determinstically generate a very large series of numbers in fact all random numbers in pccomputers are generated that way thee seed for them is initalized by the internal computer time a value that changes many times per millisecond and all the particles within the neutrons and protons if you were to go that fast through a galaxy what would be the chances of hitting a sun i mean the distances spread soo far between stars any ideas and yes i know its impossible to go that fast 2501 it says 1 planet has life and all the neutrons within those atoms and then all the quarks that make up neutrons and protons oo dont try to do anything even remotely crazy how do i stop the game from crashing within a few minutes really after i go far the game crashes what happens if you continue going one way for a long time will you reach an edge this looks just so fuckin badass but what sucks is that my computer runs this very sloooooooowly me personally i would probably spend hours playing this if my computer could handle it this video mass effect galaxy map theme video playing in another tab win haha i meant both wow there are a lot of stars out there and its amazing how we can simulate it on a computer what exactly do you mean by this that it is unrealistic or that it is rediculous as it is in real life in the program the milkyway has 1058 trillion stars which is about 3 times more than the current estimates that said the inclusion or exclusion of objects such as brown dwarfs along with our limited knowledge of our galaxy make this number feasable if not fully acurate but if you meant this is wow there are a lot of stars out there then yes yes there are actually vy canis majoris is no longer thought to be the largest known star its size estimate has been reduced to a mere 1400 times wider than the sun the current star thought to be the largest is nml cygni at 1650 solar radii but since nml cygni doesnt apear to be in the catalog go ahead and visit vy canis majoris there are blackholes and neutron stars but the black holes are all dormant no acretion disk or jets yet and the neutron stars are so far just tiny white stars with a lesser gravitational lens effect but hopefully in a later version more variety in stellar remnants will be added heres a name you could use in space engine scott vy canis majoris the largest known star in the universe its accurate though i recognized it as the lmc before scott that must mean im some sort of astronomy genius that would be an incredible combination wed need ftl drives though pulsars too but they are hard to find there are black hole but ii dont think pulsars the amount of stars is ridiculous no a shit load of stars have planets people behind this theres only one russian dude making this some tips click a star press g to travel press g again to travel really fast press f1 to see map use mouse scroll to zoom out or in shiftf3 to search stars around you ctrlf4 change graphics options most important is the plant lod change it to 1 to get prettier planets if you have a great computer you could try 2 press v to simulate the human eye with automatic exposure change press shiftf3 use the search stars of the class x are black holes they are in many places not just in the middle of galaxies you can set the time but is just changes where the planets are on their orbits you cant go back in time in away that would change galaxies or make stars go into earlier phases of their life didnt hear it anywhere just a selfthought out theory p if you dont have this get it now i got it and it is one of the greatest programs i have ever seen no where did you hear that i also have a slight theory relative to black holes if human technologies ever reached the point of time travel wouldnt such a thing cause a black hole cant you set the time though like go back in time for foward also yes you can go to the black hole at the center of the galaxy but its extremely hard to pinpoint so wouldnt they eventually consume too much matter around themselves rendering them incapable of reaching any more matter to continue their life for much longer and imploding themselves the brain calls to us what the hell that was funny looking where is the patchplz cauz my internet is slow it takes 1 hour to download this with torrent by marathon i mean this whole episode and so a 45 minute download commences time for a scott manley marathon i wish i could download this to bad my computer is horrible after watching this ive thought a little and one thought brought to think blackholes may have a life span too is that already a thing using the search function is cheating its just like using an aimbot in a fps game there are pulsars but they are not labeled as such occasionally you can find a neutron star with the rotation time in the seconds oh there are neutron stars and pulsars in the sim and believe me they are spinning at a badass speed scott you should livestream this wait 63 jupitermasses doesnt that make proxima a large brown dwarf this universe sandbox best game ever that half cluster kinda kills the immersion to find the black hole you just have to select the galaxy as a whole lock your camera onto it and then slowly move to the center youll easily max it out i run it at max perfectly with an ati radeon hd 6870 and an amd phenom ii 965be 36ghz scott if you wish to find a planet with life just click on stars that you can see and if theres a planet with life there will be an information what number of planets with life is there in the system if there are any next to the total number of planets in the system are there any space games incorporating this it would make a kick ass game lolit is an idea no yes there are also space brains note to you a black hole is in the middle of the milky way ill let you find it yourself there are blackholes but never heard of pulsars being in it it would be great if you could build holiday resorts on those planets and chill out p are there any pulsars or blackholes in this simulator this is so mindblowing you never really understand the size of the universe until you explore it just got a new subscriber my man press shift if i may ask how do you accelerate in ships i tried using the controls given but it would always stay at a set speed 50km or something speed being capped and loving the new updates to space engine i should go back and check it out this and kerbal space program dope next step integrate this and kerbal space program for crashes with infinitely different and beautiful backgrounds stupid question but how exactly do you move in this game whenever i put the speed up i dont actually go anywhere 912 hot enough to produce black holes you know they burn and whoa lol now picture this amazing space simulator with aliens in itsigh i think we need to clarify the difference between mass and size for some people turn on markers to see asteroid belts turn on the orbits to find planets easier if you want to find an nonspherical object go to eta carinae spelling it is 125 solar masses and quite oblong easily i run se on a much slower card than that and it runs perfectly after all this month i thought space engine cost money shut up and take my money its gpu intensive in the fact that no matter what card you have when its generating planets your card will be at 100 gpu load also you need at least 512mb vram to run this properly 256 if your lucky so most integrated graphics wont cut it meaning most budget computers are out of luck i found one planet thats temperature 14434 k its icons background was white hes talking about planets that we have observed there probably are billions of planets capable of bearing life in this galaxy alone but we havent discovered them yet scott what mouse are you using the sound when you scroll makes me think you just have a normal old one im just asking because im curious neutron stars with their rotation and nice gravity lens effects are nice to look at psr b162026 a is a good example obviously there are other forces keeping things together moelcular bonds tensional forces and all that good stuff but in space the only thing keeping thoes giant spinning balls of gas together is their own gravity so for a star or a gas giant gravity is the most attractive feature else they would spin themselves into oblivion or simply have never existed in the first place its all quite fasinating and if you wanted a better answer google is probably the best place to look the game isnt actually that gpu intensive i mean my setup really isnt that amazing my graphics card is a evga nvidia gtx 650 really not that great but the game runs just fine for me neutron stars have been in se for a long time now actually there are trillions of planets that have life on them not sure where you are getting your numbers from the gpu generates the planets not the cpu i found a planet that had life but orbited the star like our moon one side was completely ice and the other had a huge cloud covering it and it had life it was really weird only happens with dwarf stars space engine is very enthusiastic with the sunstar spots looks like crme brle and a little bit of the anno series i wish kerbal looked this a awesome hey scott my space engine keeps on crashing on the loading screen is there any way to fix this because there were thirty other planets with life 2501 type orange dwarf binary planets 7 1 with life why u no click on that d color of a star depends on the temperature the hotter the star the more energy it wants to emit in form of photons and because of how quantum mechanics work red photons have the lowest energy in visible spectrum and blue photons have the highest energy therefore the more massive a star is the bluer it becomes as it emits more of its energy in form of blue photons with a little minecraft would also be nice i liked the part where you ignored the life bearing stars in the globular cluster i demand for part two did you found some earthsized planets hey scott something i learned when i was trying to find interesting stuff when select a star its system by clicking on it under the number of planets line in the info screen it will say x with life if there are any makes finding life a lot easier than flying around trying to happen across it also yeah as people have said hit f6 scott you may have already heard this in the comments below but f6 brings up a list of preset places to visit including a black hole 310 the first thing i thought was its a derelict reaper i was thinking that too talk about a sandbox game you could truly lose yourself in all red dwarfs should have a smeg rating 3834 your welcome scott manley you made a mistake do you use a small viewing angle fov it displayed in bottom right corner i recommend 60 shiftrmbmouse move updown to change it to find living planets the star will tell you x planets y with life the planet type will be temperature oceania or terra with life if you go in it will have green vegetation colors a planet that is being vaporized it can be seen from almost all of the other planets in the system it looks like a huge comet the rest of the system is somewhat interesting too try rs 840418288590207190 it is a binary star system and it has two life planets it is in a nebula and almost all of the planets have a view of the awesome evaporating planet rs 8404135796536138342 a binary system near the hourglass nebula blanet b4 has life and is tidally locked to star b the twilight zone and night side are permanatley covered in waterice the coolest thing about space engine is that almost everything you find once you get out of earths local area is usually something you discovered and no one else will see unless you bring attention to it the further out you go from earth the less likely it is that anyone else will have discovered what you find of course everything that is real was discovered by astronomers not you or any other player and random stars near real objects are places other people may find as well you should really buy a new computer mr manley you said evaporating planet what is an evaporating planet exactly ive never heard of that plus the creativeness of spore creatures which program as that doesnt really sound like kerbal space program at all thanks for the mothers day reminder the game that spore was supposed to be the first planet is geonosis this game is awesome but it has a couple of problems one is it crashes a lot i have a near top of the line pc and its doing it so not hardware side the other is it sticks to extremely scientific names of stuff in the galaxy as hard as i try it wont go to thinks like coalsack dark cloud or aquilla rift hey i found a black hole at rs 840413539878625008 ba theres a star obiting it that orbits another star sorta its awesome over 9000 things to find very soon i will be observing the lmc in rl d also the black hole is there ive traveled to it all you need to do is press f2 as soon as you click on a star do it before you go there so you can save time by seeing what planets and moons are there in advance if youre looking for something in particular its actually a small file everything is proceduraly generated if you make another video of this programm could you search for the stars from capella i found them in celestia but this programm is not that well textured like your engine i can only imagine how long this took to dowoal i think if every human on earth today with zero birthrate played this game 247 until their dying days and nobody visited the same star as another person we still wouldnt see every single star in this game ahh well developers rather make playstation games that will use 8 gig disks and the only thing they use the space for is to make the game not hold more content but to allow them to leave their files completely uncompressed this is not ksp scott youll want to take a look at rs 84216729958811 2 just make sure you zoom out to see it next to its parent star if you want to find a truly large star look up vy canis majoris 5010 planet with life and you skiped it i have the most spacious boner right now his passion and enthusiasm is really admirable your pic matches the comment fucking perfectly im not quite sure why but at 250 my bathophobia kicked in for no apparent reason and i experienced a mild panic attack wierd scott please do more of these videos exploring space is so much more fun when someone else is doing it at the same time any of them will work there are three there so if one of them stops working you can use the other two the nearest thing to what you saying is called spore spore is great but had the potential to be so much more before the budget cuts it faced go to 5006 and look at planets it says 1 with life d holy crap thats an amazing bit of software you have no idea how long ive been waiting for a game like that scott manley can you visit vy canis majoris the largest sun known to man please d of course its kerbal space program 097 scott thers actualy a way to travel to some very cool places black holes superearths evaporating planets from locations menu to do this just move you coursor to the left edge of the screen and ther will be a buton with a little flag d i would ask in the spaceengine forums the dev himself in there he helped me with my own problem of planets looking like broken glass this game is much more cpu intensive that it claims though look how scotts is getting on its knees of he moves too fast or close to a planet there is in fact a black hole in there scott it just hard to find i got to it by going to the nearest globular cluster and i think the black hole had an specific name its pretty cool looking how it bends light around it if this isnt used to reincarnate elite it would be a travesty beyond mention hi scott your fps seems to be ultra low for your graphics card ingame settings have you made sure youve downloaded the newest graphics i know scifi loves to delve into the whatifs of celestial engineering but has anyone ever done the math as to how much mass would need to be dumped into the largest gas giants to ignite fusion hey scott if you mouse over the right side of the screen you get a little menu of things to see and not see p orbits planet markers etc if you select a galaxy go to ths star cluster in the center then up the time speed and if youre in the center you may see a load of stars orbiting an invisible point but off you get close enough to that point you will see the black hole now combine kerbal space program with space engine throw in some sim city master of orion and we have ourselves the next gen game i would pay dearly to play but its not really burning is it scott well i was planning on studying for my thermodynamics final today but it looks like that aint happening now rsc 84041313235507 also said it had a planet with life you should check those out some time did you notice that as you were flying towards the star at 3728 you could see the stars gravity bending the light around it omg when you clicked on one of the suns in the globular cluster near the end the planets said 16 1 with life the star was rsc 84041313327365 i wonder what it looks like on the surface first thing i did was to fly to a black hole was kinda scary looking yes around 50 planets have been found capable of inhabiting life about 7 not sure if its that exact number are believed to contain life not confirmed its possible he clicked on one you should find the planet that is solid diamond there is acrually a nice roule tobremember obafgkm it goes like this oh be a fine girlguy kiss me thoght i would share but i litterally just stoped the video a cupple of seconds after he mentioned obafgkm so please dont hate if he mentioned it hey guysso i downloaded the gamemy pc is good enough to cover the recomended requirements butafter i launch the game it crashes on planetarium for a reason i dont know so any of you can help mei have windows 7 and i am really not sure at all why it isnt working we dont really know what is in the center we just suppose that it is a black hole downloaded not cool enough for the russian version though thx scott i came here to comment exactly the same thing it would be incredible someone needs to mod something like this into ksp if all the gas giants in our solar system combined would they be anywhere near becoming a star it said when there was a planet with life where the folder says music put your spacey mp3 in their and press f12 d havent even watched the video and i want to shake youre hand just for making the video imagine combining this engine with ksp oo theres a bit complicated ship creator for this game you should go to the canopus solar system see if you can find arrakis or the eve gate lol the fictional desert planet arrakis featured in the dune series of novels by frank herbert is the third planet orbiting canopus in the mmorpg eve online the titular wormhole that led to the galaxy in which the players experience takes place was located in the canopus system could you maybe enable your cursor for these kinds of videos would be a bit easier for me to follow what youre doing cool enough to understand russian p youre a funny man scott what do you even know what you are watching on the scale of atoms or inches or probably meters youre right gravity is very weak however the other much stronger forces dissipate very quickly with distance where gravity has a lot of staying power on astronomical scales gravity utterly dominates the structure of the universe gas overcomes the random momentum of its particles when theres a lot of it essentially even if that lot isnt yet planetshaped what can you pilot a ship outside the solar system with this mod this simulator is fun space ships are a bitch to fly though saw 3 planets with life on in that video are they that boring to look at or did scott just miss them all p youtubecomwatchv0knt7jumjog i thought you should be aware of this 5029 yellow giantbinary 12 planets 1 with life lawl whoa how have i not known about this program this is pretty much the coolest thing ever 5008 the star has a planet with life on it i havent played in awhile but the way i found black holes was zooming out to see the entire galaxy and then speed up time and fly toward the center of the galaxy slow down when you feel you are starting to get in the center with time sped up you should start to see a mass of stars circling around an invisible point of gravity slow down a little more and you will start to see the light bending around the black hole and there you go and a binary yellow giant with life at 5028 i dont know if youre actually looking out for places with life but if you are check the number of planets on the left as you click on stars i love your videos scott i was so excited when you found that wolfrayet star as i had never heard of that before had no idea what they looked like and the name sounded extremely cool but then you didnt end up going to it sadface and a binary orange dwarf with life at 5007 yes i am cool enough to understand russian at 2502 you clicked on an orange dwarf which if you look on the stats on the left apparently has a planet with life we cant even say for sure if there is life on any of the other planets in our solar system never mind the rest of the visible universe im cool enough to understand russian 1035 then u can just turn on auto exposure scott you must use the galactic map its so much better than the f2 menu its like being on the star trek holodeck i hope he means the visible universe its actually not that hard to find planets with life using the search feature shiftf3 you can sort by how many planets with life a star has the most accepted ones maybe if you know mathematics and physics then yes no it isnt the only one with life because that isnt scientifically chemically evolutionary astronomically or mathematically plausible scott have you noticed in the minute 2502 youre searching for the star and then you select a binary orange dwarf named rs 8404155381184440379 and in description says the theres 7 planets 1 with life i like the clouds scott manley 2013 you sir make a fantastic point lets work towards changing that as a race of beings with a duty to learn and understand this is wonderful we need this program in all schools across the globe for children to understand the wonder and beauty of how small everything really is i would not go so far as to say most do im clearly too high for this thank you for the correction sir he would have to check more than just our universe considering most theories these days contain multiple universes theres no way to know that you can assume it if youre going to be a religious bigot but otherwise theres most likely more than 1 planet with life one planet and one moon and out all these countless nebulas dwarfs supernovas blackholes we still only walked on one planet and seen one planet cool story bro i should point out that by missed i meant some of the stars you actually clicked on had life on them specifically ones at 5007 and 5029 it says something like planets 12 1 with life to be lost in space found a saucer shaped white star very elliptical on its equator this game is awesome scott please do more long videos of this i love astronomy and i got so much entertainment out of watching this hey scott if you go to the overview map mode in space engine and span out about to parsecs from earth youll find a couple black holes good luck you missed a couple of planets with life when you were checking the globular cluster toward the end it will say with life next to the planets or satellites when you target a parent at 4545 that nebula poking up from the right was terrifying haha scott could you do a episode recommending your favorite scifi books they should have released the source code warp speeds are way too slow to see those effects do a vid screwing around with the blackholes in space engine kind of unrealistic tho at c speed all you would see is a blob of white and possibly some radiation burn lol sure you must have a deathwish telling nerds me included there isnt alien life this engine is crazy i especially love the effects when you speed up to c speeds someone needs to make a startrek game with this what the fuck is a black whole can you english properly before trying to space kthx oceans of liquid stuff thats why i said theoretically select it and press g to go to it and ctrlg to land on it we dont know the universe is infinite but even if it isnt there is a pretty good chance we are not alone scotty there are black holes modeled into the program its a little difficult to zoom in onto one though look up yv canis major and r136a1 how are you staying on the surface of the planet because of gravity the most attractive force it keeps us all together to find a black hole in se find the central globular cluster of the galaxy or search milky way and go to hit t to maintain a centered screen on the center of the central cluster zoom in and slooow down when you reach it if you pass it while t is enabled the camera will immediately flip around once in the center you will see a bunch of stars orbiting one object keep going in slooowly tada youll notice a bend in spacetime with warped light around the event horizon enjoy scott if you want a black hole with something cool next to it look for wezen b its a black hole binary system with a white luminous supergient that was pretty dumb man we havent found a planet with guaranteed life but weve found planets that can harbor it recently we found mars was once like earth and had microbial life before its atmosphere was stripped away and its core solidified drakes equation also determines the possibility of other life forms in the universe the universe is theoretically infinite so there theoretically has to be life out there were still brand new to space travel though i think think he meant that humans know of are there neutron stars black wholes and supernovas in this angine yet spore in the spacial age scott you can hit ctrl g to go to the center of the object selected ie galaxy globular cluster in real life you cant see black holes but you can estimate their mass by observing other stars orbiting them at high speeds black holes where just a theory for many years after einstein first proposed them scott ive been in a few black holes you need to center the cluster and then fly straight into it and slow down go back and forth in the center and slow down even more the black holes are so horribly small youll easily fly past them without knowing they got a really cool effect bending all light hey scott manley what is your system requirements please reply you are a extremely interesting guy and easy to listen to and i love the scotty accent d thats how our sun will look like too in like 5 million years so you better overcome your phobia by then that is odd i cant imagine anything more fun frankly im surprised you couldnt think of interesting stuff to visit i can think of a few just as i type this probably the first thing i would visit is eta carinae the horsehead nebula just panning around this would feel surreal a quasar the stars of the orion constellation these are my science videos are there pulsar stars in this that would be quite interesting to see i dont like this haha i have a massive phobia of eternity and being lost and alone in darkness and uncertainty p and at 2500 no you just go to an almost matterles sky you checked every planet in the universe to see if it has life or not dang mad props to you for pulling that off and free anyone watched red dwarf then it did p errrrrwow im on this looks quality when you zoomed in on that nebula thinking it wasnt goin to get there then it done then i downloaded now im happy as a pig in shit cheers scott hey scott you should look at starmade its a really good space exploration kspish ship building game how you find black holes how do you find them in real life wit the visual tool you have f9 renders frames in your screenshotscapture folder you have to take them and convert them to video they are rendered without the gui you can shiftf3 then search to get all solar infos of the closest star systems if you want to get to a black hole use goto the milkyway and let it pull you all the way in and you can use the f1m map to find them they show up as little dots they should put carbon planets i want to see diamonds the size of houses lol there are also neutron stars i think scott why dont you do science vids like sixty symbols or minute physics you seem to know more than those guys and out of all these countless nebulas dwarfstars supernovas and black holes our tiny unremarkable yellow sun is the most interesting one of them all because its the only star with a planet with life on it p i enjoy going where scott goes like while watching the video d this is developped as a graphic engine he plans to to a game from this engine black holes are in since 095 neutron stars are on the todo list as spaceengineer said everything being in astronomics will be a feature of space engine just let the time pass by and enjoy watching yourself watching youself watching yourself watchng yourslef on space engine in 50 years d search for infinity you should make more videos of this game scott it looks so awesome 3 there is a black hole at the center of the milky way you can find it in a cluster near the center with a ship building system like kerbal space program and for the smaller ships at least a crew micromanagement similar to ftl im sure i have my own star scott i wonder if they put sagittarius a in the game lol black holes would be rather interesting it would be just too big to control areas like your saying i often stare into your soul but i know i cant climb the stairs to get there because theyre too long 0040 u forgot to drop an mb4 mining machine man imagine this engine used in a star trek game that escalatored quickly did you seriously call the lmc a nebula it stairs into your soul navigating through deep space without autopilot must be an absolute nightmare but an exciting one imagine being stranded just 1k ly from your homeworld figuring out how to find home without an functioning computer or starmaps scott an hour of this thank you so much 17 minutes in gotta get a drink and enjoy the video now if you right click on objects you can hit info and see more detail plus you can rename them and add space cows pause at 2501 is that our solar system scott kooking for magrathea in the nebula where do i sign up i can speak chinese like you too i have a phobia of massive balls robertsspaceindustriesdotcomstarcitizen you know what freelancer is this is amazing ive had the game since it came out sim city industry hell yeah ive never played sim city but i watched a 200 video lets play once and i didnt leave my room for a whole day planetssystems hmm if there was atmospheric flight working orbits rogue planets and stations everywhere guilds and corperations well hell yeah whole wars with ships and stuff i would only play if the titan from freelancer was moved into the game if this game existed i think that star trek might have gotten its warp effects from this if this had not been made years after or maybe its the other way around its free just have some fun this should be renamed to wallpaper generator i wonder if the star he mentioned was vy canis majoris i found your video really interesting thanks for sharing love this space engine videos scott hope to see more in the near future what is the point of this game only exploreit looks really good but if the game is only go to stars and planet in a invisible ship i think it will be boring what company do you think would have the budget for this hmm ever considered doing a livestream with you playing this i cant think of anything better as a tool for teaching the unwashed masses of nonphysicsts thanks for the good stuff goes to show that not everything they teach at glasgow uni is in the coulds a strathclyde student this really make me want to get kerbal space program i believe the game you are asking for fits the description of infinity the quest for earth a fairly amazing project which should definitely be checked out scott press f6 and select the black hole pretty cool my main failure is performing rendezvous maneuvers if there were a space this big you could basically just shoot off into space and probably hit something eventually xd ever herd of star citizen it says it has a persistent universe where the universe grows while people travel out though its not done yet instantly goes to site to download ffree id easily pay a small fee just to dick around looking for a few hours oh my god i zoomed out all the way and it was just tiny specs of universes everywhere this is absolutely amazing but it keeps crashing a lot though universe keeps being bigger than i last expected what would i give for a ship construction editor o scott question if white dwarfs are made of electron degenerate matter and neutron stars are made of neutron degenerate matter does that mean that if you had a neutron star and a white dwarf of the same mass their size would reflect the size ratio of a neutron vs an entire atom respectively i mean does the size difference between a neutron star and a white dwarf reflect the size difference between a neutron and a whole atom in the same vein as my other comments cause why stop now right the milky way does have a black hole modelled in the centre to get to it select it as target and move toward the centre watch the distance figure in the upper left and fumble around to get closer until you see it the dev did say they have truble with preformance before they start puting in more systems at 5007 you missed a star that had a life sustaining planet is it possible that the planet with oceans of custard actually had oceans of chlorine i believe liquid chlorine is a similar yellow sorry this reply was automated to you from my gmail when it was destined to a completely different person youtube sucks thanks i know how black holes work im asking if there are in this video very easy to find black holes press f6 and choose black hole i squint out of habit every time he gets close to a star make more pleasefind a life sustaning planet and pulsarneutron star if you combined space engine with ksp my life would be pwned i tried downloading it but it says my opengl is out of date and i dont have the money to buy a driver updater hey scott im pretty sure that the last star system had a black hole in it and if you want to see the orbit of the planets press o 5007 it had life limit it to milky way turn it into an mmo with corpguild controlled planetssystems maybe a little sim city for industry make the large ships fly like eve and the small ships control like freelancer and i will never leave my room again that would be so awesome everyone would have a different experience because everyone would have different planets there are but they can only be found in the center of globular clusters and when you google it the only thing that shows up is this video also in that rather multifunctional menu under the flag icon are developer bookmarks for cool places systems around a black hole multiple star systems pulsars etc sorry if these are mentioned during the vid i am currently watching it and will feel horrible about posting this if you did check the menu on the left of the screen theres a really useful other view for finding nearby objects seeing orbits etc if you click on a star you can see the number of planets it has at the bottom of the list it will also say how many lifebearing planets it has if it does that game does have spacecraft also in that same menu on the left is it like a lighter where the bottem of the flame is red or yellow and the top is blue find the green giant ho ho ho 4703 oceansoceans of gold p anyone else was thinking man sending a flight here in kerbal would take forever then realizing half way through it was not kerbal you went to armagh observatory wow i live in belfast and i went there before to see a show of constolations wasnt too interesting but its cool to know youve been there i dont have time to watch the entire thing any black holes stars come in all different colors or wavelengths of light but never just one wavelength they come in an array of colors and its not so much the stars fault for not being green but our fault for not being able to see them in green your eyes have cones to see color the cones see in red blue and green light but if a star emits in green light it still emits in other colors and we see this as white or yellowish light because it is a combination of colors and not just one color 0540 i found an exceptional planet like that it basically had 3 sides a bright one a dark one and one in between litteraly this simulator can be extremely beautiful sometimes youre very lucky being able to play this without it crashing all the time scot sometimes you comment about those planets as if you were expecting to stumble upon an alien city and youre disappointed when you dont p is that college you went to in armagh northern ireland this must be what superman does with his free time at the 5008 time stamp you clicked on a system with life and you missed it haha great videos keep them coming i am a nerd i was very happy to see this d this ksp nuff said i wish my poor old computer could run this but alas it cant does anyone have any tips on making this work on a not topoftheline system i was going to mention their rocketry program but wondered who elsed figure it out there isnt really a better word somebody should make one up please more of this i love it scott it is its just a very complicated procedure its not always innacurate seeing as if an object is extremely massive but also extremely small it is probably a black hole and the universe is not made of black holes or is it took me a sec to get that the thing is its a relative term if you had a 10 kg block of styrofoam you could definitely say that its a massive block of styrofoam not because of its volume but because of the fact that its low density makes that a lot of freaking styrofoam far more than you would see on a daytoday basis this is what happens when you try to do objective science with a subjective language stuff clashes confusion arises people get mad you need a mean processor and lots of ram for this type of game what secrets are in the cloud perhaps a dwarf star and its attendant solar system with a native species on the 3rd rock that have overly large heads and green skin it is in a way yahmetoo xd i love crashingbecause im good at it p so scott why are there no green stars am i correct in saying that the size of the earth was calculated by measuring the shadow cast by an upright stick at different times of day mass coronal ejections on the stars 1200 129798398239873 exclusive to scott manley kerbin and is kerbin even in space engine what if universe is procedural generated it is a simulator for astronomers not for fictional stories id love to see this integrated in games haha nope the devs use procedural generation code its recommended to use windows 7but you can try itbut i dont think it works 1415 r136a1 the most massive star known to date also vy canis majoris the largest star known to date my favorite stars second to a neutron star because those are just awesome does this have places like gallifrey and other dr who places in what sentence would you use it then yeah but we would need warp drive technology true although in many cases in astronomy we can figure out the mass but not the size will you ever get a chance to explore all 129798398239873 things for us scott heard of infinite universe it aims to be that kind of game eventually that is what the word means thanks for answering my question scott scott when will you play more spaceengine imagine this engine with ships that you could flycommand and with multiplayer bases and stations around the universe thatd be one hell of an game this combined with ksp hm i hate it when people say massive do describe the size of an object i had to refresh the page a couple times for some reason the video stopped at 946 the first time and the audio kept going it would have lost value comedy value surely you could have put that number in scientific notation its fine for me they seriously need to release some kind of awesome space sim and use this engine for it that would be amazing scott you go test worldalpha an hour 9 mins and how many viewsscott ur magical p nice vid by the way please be talking about specificity and not numbers here 5th i think why that star is shaped like a candy oblong shaped is rotates very fast in approximate 3 to earth 5 days these are very fast rotating stars this shape is called oblate that plan is beautiful nasa and boeing needs to hurry up and create an engine that can travel at 12 light years per secondits possiblethey can do itthey just playing around wasting time for some reason the blue star could be colapsing ive read that dying stars oscillate as they die anyone else get scared by this game i dont know if anyone knows this cuz i havent seen it mentioned but the earth isnt perfectlyspherical either and neither are any planets in the whole of space because of rotation maybe the star is spinning fast and flattening out some blue main sequence stars actually are pulsars disguised as normal starsbut pulsars are bad as disguising really great video 1sub lol i have the same fear i dont know why but flying around in that game just freaks me out lol the blue star at the beginning of the video is much like a red giant i found it was shaped like an egg there is simple scientific explanation for the shape of that star you questioned its all to due with the rotation of the star or more precisely how fast it rotates the faster a star planets or any spherical celestial body spins the more centrifugal force affect it thus the more of an ellipse the body becomes your blue star is rotating very rapidly explaining its strange shape i also get scared shitless when i saw the black hole for the first time i almost got a heart attack i dare you to go to the edge of the universe just fly straight i think i was there and its dark there are unfinished galaxies of weird shapes and they are like a picture or a foil you just fly thru it and there are no stars just gas i dont know i got scared there and i had to quit the game water planets are my most favourite type of planets how could your parents name you like that i think that the first planet with life that you found was a reference to kepler 186f and i have two reasons 1 the planet had an orbital period of 129 days kepler 186f also has an orbital period of 129 days 2 the planet orbited a red dwarf kepler 186f orbits a red dwarf red dwarfs vary very greatly in size and brightness so its easy to imagine a larger than aveage red dwarf with a big habitable zone and one example is struve 2398ab 114 ly away star a m3 classification has an habitable zone that stretches out from 80 days to i think 135 days i dont know if you know but mercury is the closest planet to the sun in our solar system what would you guys like to see added to this game i think more complex weather or life would be amazing not that the game isnt incredible just the way it is in case you did not know main sequence stars are stars that fall under the generic types and luminosities if its not a main sequence star it is usually a neutron or supergiant 105 i think the absence of planets around blue stars is normal in spaceegine i dont know if this is consistent with astronomers know about planets if it is true that planets dont form around blue stars in real life i can think of at least 2 reasons 1 blue stars are larger than the sun a larger star takes up more of the matter available when it forms leaving less matter for forming planets and asteroids 2 blue stars radiate much energy than cooler stars perhaps the blue stars solar wind is so strong that it actually pushes and disperses the matter around it preventing it from coming together and forming large bodies regulus also has an odd shape in its case it is eggshaped eventually this will end up having life similuartors and well end up creating our own universe or something the reason that star is so flat is due to its incredibly rapid rotation what software did you use to record you take space for granted haha you really do apocalypsetoast and continue to be namedapocalypsetoast you say this as if its a badge of honor why not something cool hmmmm i know over lord burnt toast yeah saturns rings are way bigger than that its cuz its rotating very quicklythe star vega is flattened tooand others even more serverythe faster a star or planetor anything rotates the more squished it gets the next gen spore white stars can have an elipsoidal shape caused by a rapid spin of about 200 kmsec in fact you can see several with the naked eye on a summers night altair and vega are two such stars 16 and 25 ly from earth these are spectral calss a and hence white to blue white regulus at 78 ly from earth is also oblong due to spin but it is a bluer class b star these stars have been measured directly to show not only are they flattened at their spin axis but dimmed at their bulging equator due to the centrifical forces effect on their light output vegas spin axis points nearly directly at us so that star appears anomalously luminous than its spectral class predicts that is also why we have been able to see and measure its dust ring in ir because it is presented to us face on whats with all this itll scare me bullshit if a planit has water and clouds it has life becouse the clouds proov that it has an atmisfer 540 billions of years ago when microbial life first emerged on earth our planet would have appeared purple from space back during the archean era some three billion years ago one of the more widespread forms of life were purple bacteriaphotosynthetic microorganisms that inhabited both aquatic and terrestrial environments our world could have been purple if it were not for the green microorganisms to take over and create the plants that we have today gas giants are very common in the universe hydrogen helium and oxygen is one of the most fund elements in the universe i wonder why there are so many gas giants the beginning star looks like altair no not the ac one its and actual star what he said blue stars can make for some interesting screen shots what i mistakenly heard and my brain finished his sentence blue stars can mate for life its shape is called an oblate spheroid where is the life this is some thicksome thickass ringslook at dem bitches xd lolol that star i can explain it some stars like deneb spin so fast that it creates a bulge the life planet he found in this vid should be called the bible planet because it has rivers of blood deserts and mountainous hills so i declare this world jesus planet so planets are so hot that they are pitch black ext youtube planets from hell a giant mentos huh now all we need is a giant space coke bottle no moar space engine hmm no more toast this may be the reason for the elongated star at the beginning one of the three stars of the summer triangle altair is the 12thbrightest star in the sky with a diameter about 16 times that of the sun it rotates once every 65 hours this puts it equatorial spin rate at about 559000 mph which causes distortion of its overall shape this distortion is such that the star becomes wider at the equator and flattened at the poles and estimates have suggested that its equatorial diameter is as much as double its polar diameter lol star at beginning should be named mm lol star at beginning should be named mm im with you man space and other planets always scares me espically sunsets this is great oblate i knew the shape but not the reason thank you very much ahh for the blue main sequence star its oblate basically a few things can cause oblateness but i think the one that is causing this star to look like an mm is the fact that maybe it rotates in say 79 hours and for a star that size thats very fast its like when you spin a hammer the faster you spin the more it wants to fly out same with this star the faster it spins the more its equatorial region bulges out this planet will be toxic for humans green atmosphere will manly consist of chlorine speculations about this planet 1 atmospheric composition 75 gaseous sulphur 24 chorine005 gaseous phosphorus pentoxide 2 phosphorusbased life chlorine breathers liquid hydrogen choride drinkers that is planet namek from dragon ball z for sure the purplishbrown groundcover may be that color because they are undergoing photosynthesis for red light rather than yellow the green atmosphere likewise could be because of reyleigh scattering same thing that makes our sky blue but with a red star instead of a yellow one very interesting stuff i love it space engine wont work on my computer however it says my opengl is outdated and i dont know how to fix that 3632 atm damn i wonder how living animals would look like over there the evolutionary process would be awesome im trying to imagine even an inteligent life like us how would it look like in a planet with such an atmospheric pressure i just noticed that when you click on a star it shows how many planets there are and how many have life on them at the bottom of the information section how do you find the planets with life so quickly you seem to know if a star has a planet with life just by clicking on it personally the way i do it is click on a star press f2 to bring up the planetsmoons menu and check out the planets and their moons to see if they have life looks like you have an easier way i think the coolest one i found was a temperate terra w life that had a moon that also had life pretty amazing to think about ringed planet with life damn pretty epic this is a pretty cool series i noticed that the stars looked few and red as the planets atmosphere was 3632x that of earth maybe try to keep the music on the background when youre talking as i couldnt hear you speak at some parts is it true in a later update they will be adding citys on earthalso is all planets the exact same size as earth other than gas giantslike all planets with life are the same size as earththasts unrealisticand the planets spin is not always exactly the same speed and axisex on uranus or neptune i forget which one but it spins on its side ahhh black rungs looks awesome great minds they think alike i was actually planning on doing that for the next episode nice one of the most interesting planets ive seen ohhhh dat accent love it i realy want this but the website is down do you know if i can still download 097 somewhere thanks you are just like me afraid of space big stars bla bla you know the alien religion of this system will worship two sun gods and a ocean goddess now thats something you dont see everyday so even though there is life in space engine there are no animals where do i search for it considering that ring systems are only stable for a few hundred million years i doubt the planet would be able to sustain life after the impact that created it even if it formed from a moon destroyed by tidal forces the amount of dust it would drop into its atmosphere would definitely kill any life but hey it looks pretty music is to loud can barely hear you talk thetripleentendrehow are you getting these effects are they addons if so wich ones and where can iget them i cant seem to find them your star engine looks more polished than mine c which is the version yes and you must have a great pc to move it properly enjoy i suggest the 096 version becuase 097 has a lot of bugs but you can work on ti with the faqs in the main page of space engine awesome videos man i have just a question whats the name of the two themes you used for the background of this video i really like it this is like universe sandbox on crack how i think anybody would want to go to any of these planets than spain plus it was a joke please be a bit more light hearted your ignorance shines im the game have a planet with live without the earth but in the real world not i think damn you sound so bored i absolutely love this game its both exciting and terrifying to play it awesome minecraft tought me what to do trust me i got this lovely mum mum mum i dont want to go to spain anymore forget the mmmny this is soooooooooo cool hey could you help me out with trying to download this yeah just imagine living on a beautiful earthly haven watching the ocean planet fly across your sky whilst you both orbit eachother in a system with two suns that would be the only dream id ever need yeah woo quote miscellaneous person in background dont forget the fact that those 2 planets have 2 suns d yeah but the most likely one is the one i mentioned too circular for an extraterrestrial capture wat ringsgas giants any planet can have rings hell ours had rings until they clumped into the moon combine this game with haloeve online kerbal space program and have full on space warfare with space travel and mega fleets of star ships battling people around the world rings around planets are just pieces of cosmic dust caught in the planets orbit and it doesnt have to be a gas giant to do this i love the painterly quality of the video ill see if you posted another video similar in which we can understand what you say why did you not remake another video immediately after listening to it are you a person who merely with mediocrity at this point and as little of professionalism it is such a pity that your words are drowned out by the music cello in the background most of this is randomly and procedurally generated sorta like minecraft but in space the stars do but as we dont really know about the planets but its very likely that this is how common planets out there with life are do these plants actually exist or is this program just to mess around with niether of those planets could sustain life beacuse they are gas giants that why they have has rings wich mean there is also no water on that planet they were both pure gas that could nevee sustain life what musical composition is this the fact that you use this music makes the vids so much better id love to be able to see something like this in real life the game is free though p thanks already bought the game so fun this is really beutifull watching this actually filled me with joy thank you my favorite planets so far so its a binary planet system right space war with the two planets i want to live there damnit i wish my computer could run this this series is amazing this system was great two planets with life orbiting each other and having rings you should maybe get a star system from the large magellanic cloud or above the milky way too then youd see a full barred spiral galaxy in the sky which would look amazing wish you could play from inside a ship in vr can you help me to fix the open gl obsolete errori have done everything i can why is there no one file to download when getting this i went to the site and there were 5 links and i tried to follow the instructions but i just didnt get it how do you skip songs our universe is awsome right how do i install itthe directions are confusing mehelp anyone 2 planets whit life war is this based on celestia i really want to know how you make this video just by space engine or someother software while pressing f9 can record it but the quality is not not very goodand the video volume is limited in 4g i would appreciate it if you can tell me how to solve this problem scientific notation like if there is 2x10e21 the e stands 4 exponent the 21 is how much 0s are on it so 2x10e21 2 sextillion whats your specs the game looks very smooth there like 900bilion star in our galaxy it would take 28 year to see every start if you take 1 sec per star and there is billion of galaxy dear siryodah when i go to down load it from the site you link it has like a patch which i find confusing is it ok to download the main program and then the patch afterwards any advice please i would like to have it on my hp which only has got 3gb ram is that ok sill you make a part 3 it is like 3 months ago you made this video ive always wondered are stars really that bumpy or is it just the software what computer hadware do you use so if you upload again i hope to see more of this more of this please d i really like your commentary plus you have kind of a soothing voice lol this is great to use for presentations but it isnt as accurate as im currently in the theory of dark matter and im currently 10 i guess thats not the right time to start but it is amazing and a great way to get articulated with astronomy great job holy shit i never new this even existed i really dont know why the version 0972 wont work properly in my computereach time when i launch it it start to glich in the main menu though that even i tried it in an advanced pc processur i7 memory 8gb graphic card 4gb why do white dwarves have lensing effect dont they have mass approximately equal to a regular star mass or should stars have lensing effect too but we just dont see it because of its brightness you can see a menu of the bodies orbiting a star by selecting it and pressing f2 i can imagine a update where there are multiverses weird literally just before watching this video i was exploring rg00031 what are the odds ok so ol rg31 is a particularly bright galaxy thats not too far away from the milky way like the way i found it was i saw a particularly bright red dot of in the distance and when i clicked it i was surprised that its the 31st randomly generated galaxy what are the odds and decided to go check it out im really curios how you happened to find it i was surprised when i got to it since the extremely bright galaxies are usually etype galaxies which look like a boring blob of light but no this galaxy had a cool shape im not sure why its so bright though upon examining it when zooming out of it it looks normal enough then suddenly turns into a big bright white circle and only when flying out a lot further it turns red pretty weird im not sure why it would act like that or if its even realistic or maybe the galaxy was put in there that way as a sort of 3056 wow it seems to have a lot of iron in its soil causing rust like mars due to the oxygen created by the life wow dude siryodah you should make a series of this i would love to watch you explore 2545 dude its in the name its an oceanania its an ocean world only water siryodah 1733 i assume there are so many volcanoes on this moon do to the tidal forces between it and the parent wow siryodah i have a feeling you dont know about the 3d animated pretty water because you never go to it 1058 well you can find a system like this that could have a titan with life theoretically the amount of fun you had while playing this is amazing not hating i love this stuff also i have so many questions about this game how far can you explore can you create different situations are there things like black holes and worm holes how much memory does it require to run is it for mac this game looks absolutely fascinating awesome video if you go to the center of the galaxy you will find systems with over 20 stars not just orbiting the super massive black hole but in clusters around it im wondering if you can show an irr galaxy next time i have a decent computer 36ghz quad core amd 12gb ram but my video card isnt the best its a geforce gt 610 1gb vram it times out my gpu every time i try to fly into an irr yet they are my favorite galaxy i cant explore them and it kills me all i can do is fly around the outside at a distance and marvel at it very relaxing game thanks for your gameplay how do you get around im totally out of control and am doing something wrong how did you get rid of the hud you found a blackhole on your first choice of solar system you know how rare that is i would kill to find a regular blackhole in a solar system hey siryodah im brazilian and i lovee your videos i think thats you have few subscribers because your content is very good dont stop of up your videos for youtube pressing the g key twice will automatically take you to a system planet or star after selecting it just a heads up if you just do videos of space engine ill watch every one just videos about cool looking planets and star systems and talking about possible life on different planets 2250 han solo hyperjumped there the voice is great most people i know myself included have the exact same feeling when being too close to a black hole for some reason its creepy even in a simulation i love the game and this video please do more the calm in your voice matches the feeling of space engine perfectly very good tutorial im downloading the new version right now thanks lets get roight into the news im going to check out this game thanks e you werent actually in the neutron star you were standing on it but because of the gravitational lensing it looked like you were inside it how do you get that much graphics on planets i got the updated version and still dont have that much graphics on mountains and water at 1700 thats how it looks according to astrophysics can you just search for a black hole that some planets really near to it i subcribed who else has space engine the reason the planet had one big permanent storm and one part frozen over is because the planet is tidally locked h2s hydrogen sulfide yeah youre right thats not just regular water with so2 also in there youll probably get sulfuric acid not good to go skinny dipping in that system at 7 28ish had 7 stars it said septuple you kept moving too fast too much velocity you should have slowed down your speed like 5x or more gotten closer to that really bright one there with slow speed i caught 3 stars and probably two of those would have resolved further into 2 more each just a really really tightly packed system use right click drag scroll and g to make navigation easier learn a bit of the controls try using f1 and f2 it makes life a lot easier im still diggin this engine so much 1223 the oceans on that planet was from a collision durring a heavy bombardment that happend into this planet and the rings might of formed when two moons collided ive been a fan and user of space engine since 2012 great video i like your enthusiasm subbed and liked 1243 this is the beginning of a continent that will probably be bigger then asia cool right that intro is long and cringy the storm on the tidally locked planet is due to the fact that sun is always directly above the same spot thus there is more heat and air rises swiftly creating a supertornado also v will turn off and on exposure so you dont get blinded staring at stars gotta hit f2 mate to see the stars and stuff in systems please please learn some navigation tools i cant play that gamehow about a super computer he have 4 graphics do space engine will work great video geek can you answer me why you take so long to post videos its because i like your channel and your videos animals dont generate on planets with life the only difference between planets with and without life are that certain parts of lifebearing planets will be colored as if they were covered in flora so is this part of space engineers i havent had time to play it lately oops not space engineers lol yeah mate nice music nice everything cool vid space is fucking massive oo people how say were alone are idiots they need to imagin how big the space is gosh you are the most underrated channel i have ever seen you make very quality videos dude if you just kept making videos like that and stuff i can guarantee that you wont regret you have such a big potential please stop making such perfect tracks they are to good for a human being on earth nohate keepitup great thanks this is really awesome project ps 1655 that was actually a galaxy all those things wear galacses hey skid why did you remove me off steam the music itself fitting that is weird but in 0974 it will be different and that might have an accretion disk which version is that space engine is the best space exploration game i have come across yet right now it is free it has been greenlit by steam so it will be there soon in the meantime you can get it at httpenspaceengineorg in this episode i enter into a black hole i also edit a found planet to change the name you simply right click the planet choose info then edit and rename it to change the description of the found object you need to go to your space engine folder on your hard drive go to the locale folder and then open the engdb file with notepad at the bottom of the file you will see all your found objects that you have renamed each one has a line of code before the next planet starts to add a description just add descr blah blah after the date field and just before the for that planet the next time you open the game you will be able to read your description here is the location to one of the planets in the video rs 84091353810982812190 a437 oui space engine hiwhat is the name soundtrack man this video needs urgently to be remade in 1080p she is not clueless she is a idiot the fuck wrong with you boy lol before the video started i saw the comment about the vocals ruining it and i thought damn sucks that this is gonna have bad music then i heard ott start and realized that dude is just totally clueless i quite enjoy this music i found it refreshing love middle eastern music god damn the vocals absolutely ruin that track for me or did they change it how do you get the stars to look like that please help i really like the way they look awesome music choice ott is great i love you both we need more people like you if i know anything before i die it is this in schools i love to travel across the universe and im glad to know that main developer is russian space engineer awesome video what are you running this on i have a 1gb radeon 6630m with a core i5 2410m 23 ghz and i get like 3 fps lol whats the name of this star system freak2121gtaf hmm could it be i just have a bad memory i cant say for sure but i think you may be right hardtsonfire that would only happen if you changed settings in one of its cfg files pebblegarden we really agree there space engine is completely amazing i have lost countless hours in it already only having known it for about a month no actually it doesnt seem it remembers details on a generated planet fictionel or not it does remember the conditions though ie warm terra with life atmosphere and so on i discovered this because im focusing on a particular planet non fictional and it had changed from grasslands no oceans to oceans pebblegarden remember that planet will likely not look anything like in your video when he goes there its procedurally generated so every time is different i am making a space exploration youtube series and just bumbed into this problem carl sagan would have been proud rip what kind of hardware are you running this on when i run this program i get some much lagg btw how can you get to the surface on planets like 155 where i can find planet showed at 155 me too i find a random planet with life in space enginecan anyone tell me why they put planets with life in this game when they are not sure if there is life in other stars weve only found five percent of the stars in the observable universe more please go down in the atmosphere dumass butbutthe laws of inertiayou would keep up with the ship going hyper speed more rodina no mans sky is actually a lot better now its impressive how far space engineers has come since this was published but its still in beta this made me reinstall starbound 2718 thats what she said i thank you for this great information i needed this whyd i get asmr from the beginning of this video to me starbound is basically 2d no mans sky holds 2nd place in my heart all three of these games look insane time to throw money at my screen make the starbound series who cares if you spend 3 episodes designing a living room for your spaceship i need this series in my life plz heres a tip for starbound you can hold shift and minebuild with one block at a time you should play pulsar lost colony its in beta and can be a bit boring if you dont know what your doing but with enough friends its brilliant after watching this vid i bought rodina and holy shit its amazing spoiler alert the ending was so confusing why does the player have to make robobabies have you tried space engine imagine this in vr play starbound in a series the best intro ever when you realise you have all of the alternatives and no mans sky if you want space accountants go play eve online how about star citizen subnautica dan play me im good like space engineers dan space engineers is the best space game subnautica please dan enable spiders no subnauticadan play me oh forget it what about star citizen sees starbound footage gets dat nostalgias i need to go put another hundred hours into that i didnt think ild be doing that today but i shall i was never hyped for nms i though it was just another space exploration game and we have enough of those already and half of them arent even finished spore is the reason i got into gaming please christ dan do a completes series of terraria space engineers was made before no mans sky yet you didnt play empyrion it makes me so happy that you love starbound i have about 1k hours in ityeah basically this made me cry tears of joy all of it try the elite series its like no mans sky but better star bound comleat plz play empyrion dan did you know space engineers has a workshop aaaand star trek mods i just got what that noise in the beginning wastook me almost a year space engine holy shit right when he mentioned the music from interstellar i was whistling that exact song dont worry spiders are the giant kind you can hear far away and only appear on one planet there is now multi storey building in rodina people shall not see me for many a year from now lets hope one of these games are on consoles for us poor losers without computers also i would love to see starbound on consoles i mean terrarria is on console and thats the only game i can compare that too jetpack fuel at 42 dont panic ship imma comin rodina is my shit my friend who preordered this calls it 5 gigs of misery do more starbound that intro for starbound sounded wonderful kinda like doing the rapid wrestler rundown just fyi space engineers has been out for two years now knock knock whos there moon i know a great alternative for no mans sky theres this game called reality with an area named outside your house you can access a minigame called walking dan has a lot to learn about terraria came for laughs stayed for rodina elite dangerous is not just about space truckin and you can land on planets too space engineers is amazing the evochron games are pretty good too a stone grinding clever lmfao people saying that nerd is just trying to stick to a popular opinion on nms if everybody wears clothes thats the popular opinion right oh look at you wearing clothes agreeing to a popular opinion rodina is insane and size is huge the problem is theirs just nothing on the planets so i just google what the spiders in space engineers looked like and boy did you dodge a bullet look up space engineers sabiroids o those noises at the start were from ratchet and clank up your arsenal not no mans sky hey everybodyremember when i said that there should be planets and giant spiders in the gameand a shit ton of people called me a dumbass look whos laughing now bitches i just played the demo for rodina and it was fucking amazing take my money elliptic games as soon as i can be bothered to get some more money on my steam account the last part makes me laugh xd who would ever go into extreme super cruise speed and go into the airlock xd oh my god i remember his old space engineer armageddon play through on my ipod and sitting in my old room in my old house eating cookie dough chocolate ice cream out of the tin am i insane yes yes i am so space engineers is in beta with a sad game breaking bugships sink into the terrainbig shipseven if you lightly tap the terrain if its heavy armorthey sink rodina is awesome comment space engineers poor sith lord simulator now i have a few good ideas to improve no mans sky i just dont have the power to put them on 2835 whats im gonna try my best to spell this moorin in space 2539 whats he talking about 1408 the what people 545 us foreign policy i just wanted to say that i dont know if it changed but rodinas ending was weirdly incredible i felt like they knew what they wanted to do and did it and did it well hey now did you know youre an all star and also get your game on xd i would point out the many many things wrong with that explanation on patreon but i have only 6 days til christmas and thats nowhere near enough time to do that oh shit i just realised what the intro meant it was that no mans sky is scraping the bottom of the barrel now this series i wont do a complete series on because it would be 60 billion episodes long coughplanet coastercough this seems like the worst time to exit my shipannnd now i live in space nerd u should try subnautica but go into it blind in rodina how did he move the camera around the ship i never knew you could do that if you wanna play a game that is like no mans sky just good play pulsar lost colony no love for empyrion oh well please do nerd3 completes rodina it looks like so much fun dan can we please have a rodina playthrough for like 15 episodes after planet coaster d starbound is great because of the absurd amounts of content amazing mod and roleplay community and amazing pixel art with smooth animation the mods are incredible as in you can use most mod content in servers without mods very smooth i doubt anyone made it down here but starbound is best played with frackinuniverse mod oh i have speor space engineers should be the next play through osiris new dawn4 alternative now he plays space engineers and starbound dies of happiness now we need nerd3 completes starboundspace engineers edit also sabroids spiders only spawn on the alien planet nobody got the smashmouth reference 1058 moon who there is nothing to do in rodina i love this game so much one of only a few games ive ever actually enjoyed i actually own all three of these games i like space no starmade no star citizen id guess if u got out of the space ship while in hyperdrive you would keep going with the ship since you have its speed at the same time your body would probably become a sort of a paste cuz of the speed d ummi was playing rodina and i found a cute robot i hit f on him and it let me name him he had red eyes and my fav color is red so i called him little kevin he followed me onto my ship and he started scanning everything then i rotated the ship the got out of the chair he was on the holo deck and he was dizzy his eye were spinning like crazy he is just the cutest robot ever oh i got it grinding playing no mans sky well that was clever did he hint a starbound completes series please please please do starbound i love that intro xd empyrion galactic survival next starbound alternatives terraria minecraft mario can you do a playthrough of starbound no precursors fail thanks dan now i own starbound just a suggestion but i think you should try a game called empyrion galactic survival its pretty much space engineers but with more survival elements and rather scary creatures and the best part is its only 15 quid when you think about it that ending is terrifying but dan you forgot galactic hitman why play no mans sky when you can play normans sky pulsar lost colony no fuck you what no eve what a game man stank boond this gives me memories of three free games friday more starbound please youre one funny fucker and i like that youre the alan partridge of space exploration d i think no mans sky look odd marriage between faster than light and spore havent played nms yet that just based videos what i have watched so far man indie games suck this year sweet can we stop making indie games now shots have indeed been fired 2604 hes gone to plaid no mans sky pisses me off so much it is just a copy of rodina and sins of a solar empire except in sins of a solar empire you can actually fight space battles unlike no mans sky they didnt lie in their release star citizen why not that this seems like the worst time in the world to get out of this thing gets out daniel hardcastle everyone i have not watched a video from nerd3 in years what happened to his voice it sounds like he gained 50 pounds or got punched in the throat you missed empyrion i got space engineers for christmas never really played it got too confused now i realize this is a really cool game stay in full sream and wait some time i swear when i came back and even the timer of the video had change from orangeor closeto blueor close do a challenge series on space engineers again it was so good i expected to see ksp on here no mans sky is just minecraft in space if you enjoy it good for you but to me its just boring can you play space engineers now they got the optics right on rodina martian sunsets are indeed blue little known fact its not no man s sky its lady s sky oh btw space engineers updates for free every thursday holy shit no mans sky costs 60 wth how the game is soooo shit these are better and made by a smaller team that is supposed to be the other way around to be honest the planets look freaking ugly love all of them love all of these games but my backup laptop cant handle them for some reason destination sol it is it was described as daggerfall in space not morrowind cruising speed is too slow well have to go straight to limnal speed dan thank you i was waiting for something to come from you mentioning that 1 there are more games with massive planets and such and 2 better games with massive planets d whoops i jumped out of my ship at hyperdrive nad now i will never see it again yep sounds like rodina you should play endless sky its a free to playopen source game about trading items transporting people and fighting and taking over ships dan should make a video going heuung anyway so we can all whine about the hype more abzu now thats the real no mans sky alternative yes recommend space engineers a game hardly anyone plays anymore is no fun in singleplayer which cant be cured thanks to the dead multiplayer and has some of the clunkiest combat ive ever seen oh and tiny inventories and do basically nothing but mining and spend forever just to build one ship kinda like no mans sky and yes starbound because ripping off a bad game like terraria and adding space to it makes it good right the only good game is freaking rodina cant wait for star citizen 30 if only i wasnt so dumb maybe i would learn how to play space engineers and have fun with it cause its such a quality game and its so interesting to watch other people play it the 5000 words on no mans sky was a great read thanks for writing that up and yes nms is a pos starbound looks like a better version of terrarria i have rodina witch one should i get next put on the light speed mod on space engineers jesus the music in rodina in fucking amazing 900 basically youre making a space train with no brakes what a great idea i like the look of no mans sky but i like space engineers better i think i honestly think just about all of the games on here are good as well just from watching a video or two sadly i cant scrape together enough cash to get any of these gamesno mans sky much less a pc that could run them im in love with elite dangerous rn god damn amazing that older indie games can be better than nms truly this is one of games that will end up in many negative top 10 lists in starbound at the gender thing when you select the robot species the male jender shows a plug and for the girl where you plug the plug xdd yea i know my bocavulary is not the most extensive one xd when he said planet test i thought he was going to crash the space ship into the planet and if you want a game thats intellectually challenging you should try kerbal space program d i love starbound and stardew valley such great games the only game here i didnt have was starbound and you convinced me to buy it i know its just a sandboxsimulation game but i think universe sandbox is better than no mans sky i would have recommended interstellar rift you should really try it cool but what about console people i wish dan did a castle doctrine playthrough nerd completes starbound confirmed hooorayy went to sky was man in sky misleading game title 010 thumbs up just for riding your spaceshipwith a gun xd id want to see a starbound complete series and i think a lot of other people would too 1100 living the dream in space if sword coast legends had a dungeoncastlelevel creator like rodina does for its ship design it would be such a better game hey i dont know about everyone else but i would enjoy a gameplay of starbound will space engineers run well on a lenovo yoga pro 2 i know its not a gaming laptop but that game looks amazing you should do space engine not space engineers god damnit people theres google look it up you idiots wanna zip around in our own universe looking at everything that current science knows exists then play this its free nerd3 daily routine wake up open the door have a poo close the door hope nobody goes in there for a few minutes listen to tunes turn the cube off go to your locker taking some s get dressed watch the news admire the view cue listen to speech profit wow space engieneers was getting downright awesome during the long time i forgot about it bought space engineers now dont play it cause found skyforge will play it in the future though i would watch a nerdcubed starbound series 3 i love starbound meant to by earthbound but i love my mistake 1650 that nerd reference has been approved good call nerdy very topical title you shouldnt be able to hear the gunshots due to the facum of spaceman isaac newton just face palmed all of this videogame i actually want to get rodina no mans sky is a great game its you thats not the type of player for it rodina is definitely big i just wish it was a bit prettier to look at it also irks me that the outside of the ship remains the same regardless of interior makeup this would leave me to feel like i was missing out by not using the maximum possible space for my various ship interior needs no mans sky should win the troll of the year award still waiting to be rick rolled at the center of the galaxy 545 dan turned into the american government started off like an asmr video xd lets stop making fringe games and combine these 13 games minecraft space engineers space engine no mans sky dual universe boundless galactic junk league star citizen infinity battlescape rodinaelite dangerous planet nomadsand beamng drive these shits willnever satisfy and they will never deliver what they promise while they are doing different games but should be the different sections of the same world dan you slold me on all 3 day of the tentacle we want nerdcubed permadeath rodina right now he forgot zerahypt d well instead or as alternativ to space engineers you can play empyrion its nearly like it but focus is more on survival and multiplayerand the planets are way better did somebody one of these games should be the next completes series no well i did just now dan please i would love any of these 3 as a complete series that or yk tiny tower love you dan 3 3 3 jesus rip headphone users by the time u read this you will have noticed this gent is very loud compared to other videos btw at the starbound part who else played it back on release date then saw this vid and said oh shit this game has a story now what is all this lol love that song reference at the beginning there hey now get your game on forgot which song its in the movie shrek all other music is ingame music it makes me want less of it i read the page and your right the only obstacles are time and sentinels and they are dead easy to beat where is starmade im actually playing morrowind right now lol those are all my favorite games he should play scp containment breach empyrion galactic survival its the best game in this gamma elite dangerous is a good alternative on the pc xbone i would love a lets playcompletes of any of these games yes you never complete them but i am fine with that heh not to be that prick but i thought it was meant to be daggerfall in space saints row 2a island to play in just cause 3a country to play in rodinaa solar system to play in the del boy of space hahaha rodina has a pretty great exploration feel starbound is a really amazing game play it with youre friends and exploreing an unknown amount of planets infinite if you love starbound i respect that game is beatiful sadly me cannot play it sad face i really enjoy the racial interactions with the investigate tool my plant lady likes sleeping on the plant themed bed in a plant themed house which makes sense and now i have a reason to do so hey wheres space engine why dont you play space engine its bigger then rodina and there isnt skybox how did you get starbound to run so well i might or might not have a thousand hours on starbound no mans sky ign review 60 just take that in well they didnt live up to the hype did they if youre gonna say a space game is for accountants maybe stick than title on eve i mean the x series is a bit fast for accountants also not convinced by the morrowind in space description morrowind was a much deeper game with a lot of focus on characters looks like that game has very few npcs love that grindstone noise at the start of the video another great shout is star citizen looking really cool coming up to its 30 release it was shown off at gamescom and looks a barrel of fun do more starbound i like it a lot you should review empyrion galactic survival its like se but more adventure dude that stoney intro started to make me experience asmr cx why the cock isnt endless sky in this video i guess you could say theyre all stellar games ill get out now sadly space engineers was to hard for me to get intoi want to like the game buti just dontim not sure what it is i dont like about it maybe its how long it takes to do everything in survival quick question how long have you played no mans sky for some reason space engineers is very difficult to run for me i want to actually play it but i just cant run it however i can run gta online idk it just got too much hype from too little words dan needs more subscribers and views i highly agree with this theres also empyrion which is mostly a copy of space engineers but with planet exploration and fighting being part of it from the beginning instead of shoehorned in halfway through its development is rodina ever going to be multiplayer nerd completes starbound woohoo starbound i love that game so much space engineers is great too and ive heard a lot of good things about rodina but never played it but starbound is an amazing game and everyone should try it what is the no mans sky we received is not the one they intended for release since the one that was demoed just two months ago is completely different and has more features maybe there was a disc confusion and they sent out the wrong one for production this could explain why things arent as we expected these games are 18 quintillion times better than what no mans sky came out to be oh i forgot about rodina thanks to you i can finally get that game dan people come here for your gameplay and commentarynot ur goddam extended reviews play tricky towers and ultratron space engineer completes w spiders dan the final frontier rodina i find just unplayable without a controller as there doesnt seem to be any autocentre like there is with a controller so when flying the ship with the mouse you have to find the tiny area in the centre that stops your ship from turning i would love it so much if he actually did a starbound play through starbound getting more publicity i love that game so much lol theres a grinding sound oh didnt know the video started just playing some no mans sky in the background dying xd the title kind of mad me angry do you have a cold or are you an elephant that can speak haha here purely for dans review of starbound p hope he likes i love starbound so much for 15 it is a totally amazing game space engineer is way better than no mans sky im kinda upset i wasted my money on nms than on pace engineer but i could always sell it dan just cause 3s new dlc is out make a video this is rodina ive spoken about it many times before twice dan only twice also moar no mans sky is more disappointing than my son i climbed one of the mountains on that planet in rodina it took about 45 minutes but the view and the height were so satisfying i bet they changed the periodic table to make that sky that color in space engineer too soon xd can you do more space engineers has dan done a series on space engineers if not it would be a great series this feels like a good old 2012 nerd cubed video morrowind in space me likey 3 gave you a share on my twtter mate haha as usual another brilliant video im doing a roleplay of no mans sky as captain jim i want to play space engineers with my brother again and i want to do one on star bound with my bro as now i have a new mic ps creators tip move your mic away from your keyboard lol star control 3 and that other game were you control and uprage ships in a massive multiplayer setting he would be the perfect narrator i want to be an accountant in space o honestly if i had paid for the game myself id be a bit pissed but i play someone elses copy so its ok to fuck around in for a little while but simply not worth the money so far ive seen all of these just with a different name on every planet thus far the same plants same animals rocks even the temperature and storms have been exactly the same on every type of snow planet or hot planet so far theres nothing randomised about it other than the weird spawning in of things incl floating trees rocks and even loot floating in other floating loot stuck usually in a tree not to mention the small selection of non customisable ships that look exactly the same everywhere the repetitiveness of the gameplay will very quickly drive you into insanity the only random thing is ships appearing it will never be the one you want until you wait too long get a shitter one to find the one you want suddenly spawns just afterward you should have played empyrion galactic survival its terribly good so far ive wasted dozens of hours playing it building bases ships mining hunting flying fighting and ive havent even gotten off the starting world yet dan dont worry the final boss of no mans sky really brings the whole game together 13 hour lets play of rodina id watch it youtube says this video is no mans sky fucking genious i thought i was going to watch a space truck simulator 4 playthrough seems odd to play rodina instead of no mans sky no mans sky is dull and boring but its a finished game where rodina is not my problem with starbound is that the story is just too generic and the quests are dumbthey set up this amazing universe with tons of cool stuff then they made the story find the magic macguffins to save the universe with the quests scan a bunch of things 5 times they wasted a ton of potential with this i hope starbound comes to consoles love terraria so much and starbound looks awesome what does he mean by morrowind in space note to self dont drink soda while watching nerd cubed reads description game no mans sky if you want a game like what nms was hyped up by people to be try subnautica the third game looks amazing rodina i think it would be cool if u did a complete serieskeep up the good work though and yah im did something i think the reason i like no mans sky is because i didnt follow the hype at all i just saw some gamplay on release day and thought it looked cool and bought it i find it quite enjoyable starbounds developers are awful people please dont support them spore was mentioned as a good game it was the biggest disappointment in gaming history until no mans sky came along no man sky isnt like space engineers at all if star bound is an alternative to no mans sky then pong is an alternative to tennis its not even the same perspective it would be like missing diablo play skyrim its the same thing u should make another space engineers seriess i want dan to do more rodina i would gladly go out and pay for rodina if it worked on linux sadly it doesnt not even with wine correct me if im wrong but you can buy all these games except elite for the price of no mans sky or less sad to see they all suck guess theres no good space games out there why do you call them alternatives whiten they came a lot before no mans sky did rodina has even less content than nms what about empyrion galatic survival its like space engineers but easier to learn and less buggy and yes i am the gman and i will make you my new halflife 3 bitch triggers gonna rewatch spore series now alternatives you mean games thatre infinitely better than no mans sky especially considering how much of a fucking disappointment it was and the whole multiplayer thing being a lie i think rodina is the closest to getting at what no mans sky didnt achieve but i hope they add a few different environments so youre not always visiting paletteswapped versions of arrakis dear god almost got taken out by a bush the twin towers can relate cant hello games be sued for all the shit they lied about happy to see space engineers on this list it is more than a worthy alternative the developers are active community members and are transparent about most development updates and fixes also occur on a weekly basis showing that they are committed to finishing the product for the very appropriate price it is definitely worth a look youll spend far more time in se than you ever will in nms he put his character as a female again wtf nerd cubed i was wondering how did people think no mans sky would be a city builder do a space engineers premadeath series or just any type of space engineers series i wish nms wouldve been like starbound mixed with space engineers it wouldve been perfect dan should really do a video on space engine wish i could play space engineers though looks amazing i like no mans sky a lot that said dan had some very valid points in the article he wrote utter piss flaps officialnerdcubed add vive support to this game yes amazing idea from danwe need that please upload another video on space engineers me no likey new channel art since i am a xbox user could anybody point me towards alternatives on xbox ive played elite and ill agree with dan its a boring delivery boy game i still enjoy it at times wow space engineers looks kinda cool additionally starmade has pretty good quality for what it is i really can not stand playing space engineers since they added the speed limit c please play starbound 3 cruse drive in rodina is like 3kms combat speed is about 300ms docking speed is about 0ms sorry if someone mentioned this but empyrion is actually pretty amazing imagine no mans sky except it admits to being in alpha and you can build your own ships and land vehicles 2 classes of ships with one capital class which is like a mother ship also has seamless planet to space flight excellent exploration as well fully destructible everything base building etc also if you like actual exploration and dont need to be flying in space look at subnautica so amazing both these titles ok back to throwing my life away in no mans sky i wish space engineers andor rodina supported maclinux ive backed planet nomad and outer wilds so im looking forward to those which both look amazing pulsar lost colony please that moment when you realize no mans sky is a really bad game and it really is really bad game starmade probably not completes star bound do it do more videos like this sir return to form theres also a large number of eliteinspired space sims i would play space engineers if it were better optimized the opening joke was amazing d space engineers for life watching the starbound part at 2x speed is hilarious also tip for building in that game holding shift makes you place down or break 1 block at a time also that last game looks like it could have multiplayer at some point for me in personal i like space engineers and spore much more than no mans sky space engineers looks pretty cool no mans sky more like no mans buy why have i done this to myself what about rebel galaxy evochron anyone i highly suggest playing the pirates of the carribean game from akella 2003 with the new horizons mod its obviously not space but you can sail in 3d around the carribean and engage in giant sea battles spore is still the best one well ksp has quite a lot of gigantic planets point is only nasa can go to them elite dangerous will always be my favorite space simulator you didnt mention out there the 2d mobile game in which no mans sky got their game mechanics from you should check it out maybe do a video on it fuckin trivago again plez make a play through of all three games rodina looks awesome im really excited to see where it goes possibly the no mans sky we all wouldve wanted space engis all 3 of these games are set in space none of them are like nms tho congratulations youve convinced an old terraria hand like me to play starbound not an easy task space engineers is way to go i perfer starbound its basicly the same thing but not broken without the devs lying about everything and you dont require a great computer to play itit actuly has charecters story missions etc imagine rodina cross ftl but with multiplayer the future people the song goes hey now your a keemstar why do i find this so funny i think that no mans sky got overhyped knock knock whos there moooon xd whats about infinity battlescape it looks very promising is dan a smash mouth fan can someone explain to me why there seems to be a view that rodina is more interesting than no mans sky i mean i know nms was a disappointment but even if you take all the graphics away it seems there is still less to do in rodina elite is the best space game at the moment i freaking love that game finally other people who play starbound for a second i thought it was a three free games friday do a starbound completes space engineers any space game its good and we havent explored whats so good about it were just looking in the box not outside the box so its up to you to play whatever you want but theres something about no mans skys megalith dan please play rimworld its a beautiful mashup of prison architectspace survivaldwarf fortress but not confusinghappiness and i think youd really like it xd xd xd i love the fact that you commented on the spiders thing d anywho the spiders in se are the worst spiders theyre bigger than you and they love to eat your fucking face wheres empyrion galactic survival definitely a top contender please do more space engineers and rodina space impossible you probably have not heard of this game before how would you guys like rodinagame 3 in vr do some more prison architect please dan can you do a complete series on the elder scrolls iv oblivion no mans sky is pretty frozen land i like this game a lot tbh the funny thing is i was excited for on mans sky and was very disappointed when it can out yet all ready have all these games more of spa ace engineering hyperdrive initiated i think ill jump out me ship now i live in space i like your channel dan but i completely disagree with you on no man sky in my opinion the sound track is amazing one of my favorite of all time planets never feel the same idk what you are talking about i remember what the trees look like the trees are different sizes everything on every planet looks different elite dangerous just earned him all the brownie points i think its time dan talked about space engine he said hes aware of it but hasnt done a video 98 was just released ive actually played starbound before it came out people are acting like nms is revolutionary lol space engine is 1400 better and its free if only the permadeath series was still alive all three of these would be great for that well starbound would be pretty fast what no evochron mercenary i miss three free games rodina is in my opinion one of the greatest space games ever made i love it so much i think that heat signature is only not on this list because it technically isnt out yet no mention of star made that makes me sad because open the air lock and jump outside is a good idea hahaha remember ages ago when dan played a space a creepy rock that change when you looked away and a moon that teleports what was that called space engineers this game is just beautiful if you can run it on full then you have a great game however the game looks kinda shitty no really on mediumlow textures can be often glitchy and physics meh but gameplay can be amazing not to mention the multiplayer cmon say hello procrastinators play more space engineers rodina is czech for family so when i looked it up on images i got pictures of happy czech families and family guy hey nerdcubed play no man sky please read your little bit on patreon before watching this and had a real laugh youre adorable when youre angry and vulgar in rodina the ai doesnt crowd around the thingy with the intention of picking them up but actually sees where you are on the map and speeds toward any signs nearby to them so they can attack you when you close in on them if you guys like gaming channels could you check out mine thank you the joke about no mans sky at the start just killed me 614 i suppose when youre trying not to die the fact that you just passed up on an opportunity for an antiamerican joke doesnt click i just want an open universe xwing vs tie fighter game with possibly multiplayer and vr support is that too much to ask 3514 i thought he was gonna say aaaaand its gone jesus christ in his review of no mans sky on patreon dan tore the game apart fucking hell dan rodina has come such a long way its insane ive always been sold on it without ever actually buying it but it actually looks like something i need to pick up now dan please do a starbound completes series dan made the starship enterprise in his window design anyone else think he should do that vote for the next completes series like he used to i just found an easter egg on just cause 3 about this channel its in city with the pogo its near the bridge it says n3 anyone else actually played all 3 of these thanks dan you ruined one of my most anticipated games for me i really appreciate it sarcasticcommentissarcastic heeeey in x3 i was only an accountant for a bit but then i became the admiral of a mighty armada and annihilated all the filthy xenos implaying star bound right now xd three gud money games thursday no mans sky attempting to do what minecraft did in 2009 liked straight away with the fucking all star by smashmouth lyrics you should get the better had milky way skybox mod for rodina rodina is the best alternative to nms but i like nms governor mccrory want you to believe that north carolina is making a comeback gof 2 galaxy of fire 2 is also a alternative for cell phones and tablets that roster rundownesque starbound bit was pure genius can someone please tell me what keycaps hes using on his keyboard the sound of them is getting me wet please dan do a playthrough of starbound 1642 worlds sharpest knife p nerdcubed completes starbound what about elite shouldnt you have stayed with it since you are going the same speed as the ship and there is no friction or drag to slow you down am i really the only one that fucking adores no mans sky it has issues but its so much fun and is an actually playable space sim that works on my ps4 since i dont own a pc good enough to run the frankly disapointing elite dangerousyes i know its on ps4 soon but its not now and the none existent trash that is star citizen no mans sky with a few updates features added and a bit of work could be amazing maybe the second one will get it super right look at watch dogs 2 that looks likeits took what it did wrong as a new ip and actually tried to fix it yes there are things not in the game that might of been promisedstill not sure refused to watch anything on the game before release might be why im so into it but what is there is bloody impressive for 15 people a team of artists and the backing of sony rodina morrowind in space who do i give all my attention and money to i hope in rodina they add in factions with there own flagships frigates fighters personality home planets space stations oh and make your own faction robots lasers land battles an wait dont take me away i gotta ramble more nnnnnooooooooooo im just going to assume none of the games here are on consoles can you play aerofly fs 2 why play games that offes some aspects of no mans sky when you can get all aspects of no mans sky withno mans sky personally rodina is better than nms because who cares about graphics i want my own ship i can walk ini want to see for miles on the planet i want to be free and not stop for fuel every five minutes there is mod support for rodina on the nexus if you read the patchnotes you can have your own robots too i like to smoosh it down daniel hardcastle 2016 whats the name of that piece of music with the french horn that played after he fought empyrion is awesome too no empyrion that game is literally no mans sky but good well we know what to spam on every video from now on ever starbound completes or we riot edit stupid yes cringe yes needed yes i think nerdcubed should review every game on steam really want to play all of these but they arent on xbox and my computers too shit to run them oh i get it its the sound of grinding thats actually quite funny enable spiders no thank you sir nerd challanges space engineers building a tardis id love that because you could fly it through space it would fit easily does anyone realize that dans in space now and he might not be able to make anymore videos unless he somehow gets internet in space or i dont know gets the ship back rip dan rodina has much more potentials and should be supported by sony instead of no man sky waitso this is like 3 not free games not friday dan play pulsar lost colony i know its a multiplayer game but it is extremely fun and i challenge you to play with the derpy ai 1835 that looked like rick sanchez crossed with a snorlax i havent been able to play space engineers yet because it keeps freezing and unfreezing every 5 seconds star citizens should have been on this list i saw the thumbnail and thought three free games friday saturday addition was back xd btw guys any one whos whats space engineers its ataully on the humble bundle page right now along with shulter 2 rust and things like that so go grab that as its only 5 in starbound i beamed down into a prison 1950 is it just me who does want him to do a complete series of starbound can you do a lets play series of prison architect i know that is kind of an old video but because you enjoyed it so much and most enjoy watching please do it again no empyrion galactic survival that is great game xd that blog post was funny af to all of you who did not get the joke at the beginning he was grinding guys humble bundle is selling space engineers dirt cheap get you hand on it please do a completes of space engineers what game should i get next space engineers or saints row 3 you forgot the best one empyrion starmade is a really good one too check it out nerdcubed completes space engineers again also space engine thank you but seriously next vid should be the new jc3 sea pack or the sequel to grow home grow up 3 free games friday please bring it back dan its an atmosphere not an air pocket id watch ya play a completes of starbound the whole way awesome play more of these games you fool empyrion is another rather fun alternative what about rodina no mans sky is better then all of these games because no mans sky doesnt have lag and its more fun im on windows 10 and space engeneers wont work it loads the game after the menu loads and then crashes help i dont think theyve added inertia in rodina yet grinding stuff in the intro nice move shouldve done space engine too will you play grow up on this channel please game 2 please am i the only one that smiled when i heard rodina nms is freaking awesome talking about space engineers you havent played it since 2014 besides this video soooo i dont get why rodina is so amazing to him i mean i get that its a huge game and all that but whats the purpose of a big planet when theres 5 things you can do on it that review thing you wrote is so spot on maybe ill give it a glance again if they add base building but as of now this game is just mmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeehhhhowthefuckdidtheyfuckingscanmedownandmakemefuckingstop i was going 12 million kilometers per f u c k i n g second how the fuck is that even and im dead my gear is 14 minutes of pulse driving out there and i will be scanned down and stopped by hostile ships at least 5 times before i get there what i hear when people compare certain games minecraft terraria minecraft in 2d starbound terraria in space no mans sky starbound in 3d therefore no mans sky is minecraft in space you can install galacticraft and explore space for less than 60 wrong argument is the worst kind of argument grav reborn is a nice alternative too such a cop out for doing this we wanted a full review why your channel is great jumping off the space train to showcase some great games you should have added ftl for space combat please play more starbound if u did a complete series on it u could actually finish it there is a ending and quest and stuff so please try it i read your thoughts there are two main goals in no mans sky one is to reach the centre of the galaxy which you already know however you can start up another mission where you follow the atlas to the unknown anomalys in the game it sets various waypoints to different locations which you need to warp too i havent gone to the last one yet because i havent played it that much however you have suggested some pretty good alternatives tisc tisc dan found quite a few typos in that review but i do completely agree with you the games only real selling point is that its big but its big and all the same nomans sky beats all this ganes idk about the pc port for nms but it works really fucking well on ps4 id like him to make another spore series the spiders in space engineers put me off until i promised to never select the option and never go to that planet rip me play no mans sky and record it then upload it dan have you ever tried starmade like a mix between minecraft and space engineers i know its really hard to get working but rodina multiplayer star citizen is the best space game in my opinion nerd i think you should stop doing completes series after completes series and so on i like it when you do different games dan keeps saying it sounds like i made wrote or designed this a lot dan are you hinting to something these games actually look pretty crap so far im still enjoying no mans sky but yea i can definitely see the issues buggy crashes even on ps4 severe lack of content draw distance horrible horrible horrible combat etc etc it would be interesting to see what additions they will add to the game although for the price tag it should have been a completed game already or at the very least have a lot more content then what it offers now as every single planet you go to is more or less the same mine some shit sell your shit every 5 minutes cause your inventory is full every time find the buildingsmonuments talk to the aliens who always stand in the same spotsbuildings find the 10 different animals then off to the next planet to do the same thing i got it mainly for the plans of it having the playstation vr support and until then ill just put on a podcast and mindlessly explore for a bit you can get the current version of rodina for just 2 dollars on the developers website if you want all the future updates and a steam key you just have to add 13 dollars to your pledge later what about ftl fun fact for you with the money from no mans fucking game you can actually buy all three of these games for less thing that i h8 with no mans sky its single player which makes it alot more boring if it was multiplayer and the universe was smaller it would feel like ark where there were crews and wars 2604 so the only speed faster than light is banana speed right you should make a series called anything but where you play alternatives to bad games dan please play grow up its sort of a sequel to grow home no mans sky shouldve been a near infinite version of rodina if you like no mans skys shops then go try starmade its like nms but minecrafty and you can do stuff like not die of boredom immediately liked because of the title im astonished that he didnt mention rebel galaxy its just like no mans lie only it actually works and has way better assassins creed 4 ship like combat it just works what about starmade its pretty much modded minecraft in space dan why the fuck did i get a call of duty ad rodina you call that a planet its just a terrain without any added component if you like it ok but dont expect many people like it rodina is literally no mans sky on a smaller budget why would you spend 4050 pounds on nms my hmv near me sold the game for 50 you should play space engine not engeneers it is a game whaere you have 10 billion ways to explore and it renders the entire universe with planets stars nebule and even black holes its insanly huge and fucking cool it is also free an entire universe is free its the best thing ever this is making me miss three free games friday do more starbound even minecraft with some mods is better than no mans sky and runs better do starbound playthrough d this would be awesome ive been hoping you do another rodina video you cannot actually say that rodina is a proper alternative to no mans sky it is dumbed down no mans sky except with waaaay less content every planet is the same but with a different color and very slightly different landscapes all of the planets are completely barren and have no features making them boring plus there are only 7 the lore is there but there is lore in no mans sky too that is paced way better the combat is just as bad as the combat in nms the artstyle is worse the only thing better is the flying and that is mostly due to the pov starbound is a completely different type of game compared to no mans sky i absolutely love starbound a lot more than no mans sky but it doesnt do the same stuff no mans sky does the space exploration combat story soundtrack etc is there but it playsfeels the opposite of what no mans sky is space engineers isnt even comparable it is a building game its goals are completely different it is building fo delboy in space sign me up what about muh starmade you should also have featured space engine in this video it may not really be a game but its still awesome please do a series on starbound 3 i havent seen the badness of no mans sky yet im not bored of it and i think its loads of fun am i doing it wrong play grown up literally the only issues with no mans sky was the marketing and the price no mans sky open world thousands of creatures quintillions of planets 3 alien races 3 everyones talking about se and rodina and im just here quietly cheering for starbound i love it when games tell a story they dont intend to another problem with one mans lie it tells exactly one story get to the centre of the galaxy you see things that dont matter you mine things that dont matter you die to things that dont matter you do the exact same thing with zero variation over again thats it or explore universe free by using space engine i have to admit my experience with starbound has been iffy played it in midlate alpha with friends and loved it and then came back midbeta and didnt enjoy it so much since they removed some of my favorite features asteroid fields hunger temperature etc but then i tried it out after the 10 update and im absolutely loving it maybe its the addition of the steam workshop making modding easier but im having a wonderful time exploring the galaxy and running away from purple gasoline ghosts as a fuzzy raptor dude dan not sure if you will like the game but i think you have heard of overwatch the game witch alot of people love if you want you probably wont like it play it xd space engine is the best for exploring periodif youre computer can run it but if youre looking at no mans sky than you should ve able to run it anyways oh and its completely free can you do a series or just more videos on rodina please its really cool hm dan i thought you would like it nerdcubed rodina roadtrip for 5 million subs space engineers permadeath part 2 pls i watched that series like 3 times the best series u got dan you should to more vids like this really funny and well done problem with nms is they thought hey lets do a verion of minecraft but lets do it in space yeh no ones done that before and lets give them no other goals id love to see a completes series on starbound in this topic i would seriously reccomend space engine not engineers its still in development so it doesnt have any actaul game play but if you want a 11 scale universe to fly around and explore then sure i adore starbound even though they made some bad changes in 10 id be so down with a building focused starbound series id love that no mans game im ok whit it if you say that nms is a good game in your opinion imo its boring and the game devs took a too big of a bite to chew space engineers is the og starbound only has 2 gender options triggered so in a nutshell nerd cube is upset that a space mining games main goal is to mine well okay im out he should play more rodinayou agree hey you forgot to mention empyrion cool game oh hey i own all of these games i might have a problem btw for those who are interested in space engineers it is available on humble bundle for less than 6 dollars in rodina andor no mans sky are the planets all just hunks of rock or do some have biomes and life to them at least he mentioned spore that made my day i have 1700 hours in space engineers get it everyone get it nerdcubed completes no mans sky like if you agreeeeeeeee from nathan howell 3freegamesfriday if space engineer was also on consoles it would probably be just as big as no mans sky lol nerd3 sounded american when he said we all know i dont care what its called im going to bomb it anyways hey what about star citizen thats a waaay better game then no mans sky and its not even out yet oh my god the last time i saw starbound it was at the infancy of its development i really want to get it now space engineers is only good when playing on worlds that already has everything built for you otherwise playing on a world from an escape pod is borderline untenable and good luck building a base or ship that looks good if youre not a lego obsessed nutcase because youll get tired of it very quickly this seems like the worsr possible time to get out of my shiaaaand now i live in space yesterday i just watched his videos of space engineers i think you should check out empyrion galactic survival pretty much no mans sky but 10x better for a fraction of the price dan heres a piece of advise you can use or not use i dont really mind if one of your problems with nms happens to be that there isnt fuck all for a story then instead of playing with getting to the center of the galaxyuniversewhatever we are calling it as your main focus and everything else is just a chore to help achieve that then just flip your idea of what the end game goal is for yourself instead play it from a point of view where the center is the secondary quest and the main thing to do is just explore and learn as much about the aliens races of the game now maybe i just get too involved in my games when i play but nms is pretty easy if you try to roleplay it a bit and create your own story as you go for yourself let me know how it goes if you attempt to play again but from this angle v makes joke about sherlock jumping off the building nerd completes rodina please who else thinks dan should play outer wilds again even if hes already seen most of what it is now not enough big channels have played it it deserves so much more attention enable spiders no no no no nerdcubed 2016 anyone else want a nerd cubed completes starbound do a completes on any and all of these games the rodina music sounds like the prince of egypt music which only makes it more appealing lol im surprised starmade wasnt on this list shouldve been an accountant damn space engineers got a lot more features since i last played it 100 agreed on everything in your post this is why people pirate shit to test if the presentation before you buy is real why wasnt limit theory mentioned its basically no mans sky except with no planetary landings and functional gameplay mechanics still unreleased but the developer just one guy is transparent enough that it wont be actively misleading play mer space engineers woah i had no idea starbound had that new opening but and whatnot the last time i played was when it had been available for a month or so i might have to give it another go i kinda want that starbound sieries i just wish theyd change the character movement in space engineers to feel less clunky and bouncy also sounds like dan has a similar keyboard to mine never noticed that before each key press makes a sound akin to a hydraulic piston smashing a metal plate at 50mph honestly i dont know what to think about no mans sky ive seen people saying the game is good and others saying that its bad it seems like its getting the same treatment destiny got when it launched two years ago i think ill try it out for myself on the ps4 and create my own conclusions outer wilds tho hopefully itll be finished in the next year or so dan please do a new series on space engineers or just more videos i expected dan to take a look at each games fov option and take a long sigh so happy thought hed never mention space engineers again well you know ive been playing it non stop and enjoying the game probs cause i got a ps4 and not the shitty pc port the thing about starbound is its awesome and theres a magnificent story to it and asra nox more like arse nox holy shit asra nox is such a dick fuck asra nox asra nox can go die in a fire i own all these games and no mans sky and can officially say they are great substitutes though you didnt need to hear it from me still need more ftl if no mans sky is repetitive how tf isnt rodina i would love a rodina completes it would be amazing remember outer wilds that too is a good alternative nerd3 completes starbound my only issue with rodina is the external ship models ship looks so cool on inside literal potato outside starbound completes please wish no mans sky had half the shit they said was gonna be in it he should do a series with space engineers you should play rod no mans sky is a fantastic game for those that possess the brain capacity to find enjoyment in their own imagination please do another space engineers series anybody who reads this spam this message no mans sky is better than any of these games its also much prettier 617 i was expecting a 911 joke now i want a starbound complete series dang space engineers has a hell of a lot of content for a 20 game its improved quite a bit and so has starbound and now you tell me about morrowind in space o honestly if no mans sky was a builder it would be better and also if sony didnt shit marketing on it go damn console players ally ruining things what about kerbal space program one day well have a game where you can fly a ship to different planets in solar systems in real time or cheat to speed up rodinaspace engineersstarbound space engines needs its own series again i feel like no mans sky has the potential to be absolutely amazing but its not but one day maybe it will be 740 everyone lets donate 10 dollars each to make a fcking movie out of this with dan itself as the protagonist two out of three of your recommendations are pc only what do you do if you dont have a pc to be honest ill play star made over no man sky any day of the week cheaper too you forgot freelancer it is an old and beautiful game space engineers another game that i almost bought before i realized my graphics card is inadaquate except i bought it and only later that it refused to let me play sigh too late for a refund on the off chance you play starbound again hold shift to build with only one block question will rodina work on my windows 10 laptop play grow up im terrified to even launch space engineers after they added planets im pretty sure my computer will literally catch fire play grow up its a shame really no mans sky actually had a thing going for and that was the feeling that you yourself are an unknown alien visiting and discovering new planets and intelligent life i like the idea that you dont know what they are saying and you have to figure out what they want from you sadly that feature is shallow at best if dan ever opens a po box im sending him a box of live pregnant spiders i remember the old space engineer vids damn i just watched one of his videos after a big break from him and wheres the hellooo procrastinatorss i think a big part of what no mans sky is about has to do with the fact that its a console game playstation 4 specifically while it is on pc it was never pitched as such so for that certain type of person who has a playstation 4 or even an xbox one what alternatives are available but it doesnt look like you really think things through even with that 95 of you that i like i feel that the ugly head of the 5 rears itself too often and we get to see the abhorrent underbelly of the cuddly beast what im about to say will probably tick you off because we all know which way you swing your proeu jeremy corbyn loving socialist whip of oppression if you know what i mean well ironically as far as i can tell your video reminds me of a conservative party conference or at least the way your brain would filter the information from a conservative party conference you know what im talking about the ones where they only talk about solutions to problems of the rich and influe you should have tried starmade its 10 on steam but the dev made the demo the full game so prospective buyers know exactly what theyre buying it really deserves more attention i think if they mixed nms planets and exploration aspect with space engineers minus frame rate crashes and all nms bullshit you would have a perfect perfect game i would like to see dan play starbound and just build space engineers shows a lot of potential holy shit starbound changed like i know it had story but not like graduation day thats awesome terraria starbound can you do another space engineers series please your fov in space engineers is so high it makes the game look weird you forgot kerbal space program yeah theres only like 7 planets with moons but the journey simply getting to the mun andor minmus has more value and challenge than going to the center of the galaxy in no man sky play space engine i actually enjoy nms a lot it has it issues but i really like it ah no mans sky the long awaited space era update for spore morrowind in space stop my penis can only get so erect do a nerd3 completes starbound with multiplayer no kerbal space program why i would reckon it is the space exploration game i would love to watch him play starbound building and all for rodina you didnt show off the vanguard ruins the fps combat the fires the robot babies the asteroids or the spacewalking and spacewalking with a fire extinguisher starbound is incedibly polished hahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahah obviously havnt seen the state of multiplayer then love that no mans sky intro ah space engineers also known as spengies would be a great game if it didnt run like shit i for one would not mind a starbound series or one of any of these three games really how does he manage to quote smashmouth without throwing up at least a little that moment when these games play and feel better than no mans sky 618 nearly taken out by a bush what are you a twin tower knock knock who is there x x who x gonna give it to ya why is star citizen not on here smash mouth dan really xd i would definitely watch the complete series for this if you do it jokes on you dan i have all these games and no mans sky and i love all of them cant break me dan you gotta help me brit to brit do i get starbound or rodina both look awesome and i would very much appreciate it if youd help me decide as you know the ins and outs of both ok im just gonna say this but no mans sky is what it was always advertised as yeah it may have been exaggerated but so is everything thats being sold when was the last time a game trailer showed the game footage xd i liked the game because i didnt hype about it and i didnt turn it into something it wasnt xp just saying savetheoranges the air pocket around planets popularly callet atmosphere star citizen any one its coming honest one day dan why in the fuck didnt you follow your ship at the end to show the scale of how fast it fucking is 3 space games thursday i would love to see a starbound lets play please do another space engineers play through with spiders enabled and x3 because space needs accountants too do a starbound series please that would be fucking amazing because it does have an end that would work last time i played starboard i killed all the bosses and all of the missions i need to go back to it now damn it i was gonna watch game of thrones did you seriously try to suggest that spore was good spore was actually a lot like no mans sky in that it promised a lot it didnt deliver on and was overhyped as hell although unlike no mans sky will wright actually had a history of making good games actually it would be rather fun to watch you play starbound yay he mentioned elite dangerous and then you realise that you dont need any of these because no mans sky is a good game starbound but no empyrion at least elite was mentioned im still waiting on a youtuber i watch who does like nms why is it backw shit dan you should really do a complete series on space engineers no one tell him he may have forgotten shhhhhh i read your opinions on no mans sky and appreciate your opinions and thoughts i actually agree with you on many of your topics thats it just wanted to write this in case people blindly dislike the video because they would gladly sell their organs and virginity just to get a copy of the game omg dans review on nms is amazing i was laughing my ass off for 10 mins thank you dan for this video and for your no mans sky thoughts over at pateron a note about starbound theres a mod called frackin universe which adds essentially an entire expansion to the game theres also frackin races and music and what about ksp i have all three games already 3 i already had 1 and 2 i just went and purchased 3 in starbound press shift to place one block at a time clinks bottles together fanboys come out to playay nearly got taken out by a bush you must be roleplaying as the world trade center no mans sky is feminist propaganda i came to this channel because of spore haha although he played it for a couple of minutesi bet dan played each game for a couple hours i feel like elite has the same level of immersion not including the ships as rodina so you suggest 3 games that are basically full games of different parts of no mans sky why dont you play them all in one no mans sky this is the most like his old videos in a while if only there was a free space game with an engine that allows you to explore the universe yes just yesterday i rewatched the permadeath series dan can we have a new space engineers permadeath with the new planets and all it could be cool i like it when nerdcubed plays rodina firstly because i really enjoy his videos and secondly whenever he does my channel views explode p do a complete on star bound aagh daaan hold shift to place one block at a time in starbound seriously that really irritates me play unturned stellaris no mans sky style with randomly generated events planets and races but in a vast rts dan has spoken the truth i was quite disappointed some things that i was disappointed about no cities like its a massive fucking universe even though the sentinels may have something to do with i want a planet thats like fucking coruscant all i find is tiny ass bases you cant fly into the sun free roaming bullshit i should be able to fly my ship into anything and destroy it at my will chases through canyons and arches and mountains should pose a risk doesnt feel like space theres no ring planets gas giants asteroids fucking everywhere planets are literally miles apart instead of millions of miles apart nothing seems to orbit anything the sky is always colored space ship variety is awful only difference is aesthetics and inventory slots literally 3 types of space stations literally 10 biomes with small variations from planet to planet only effective way to reach the center is to cheat other then that you would probably have to play for 50hours space engineersthings its not a fighting game its a building game 2 the more thrusters you put on the back doesnt speed it up it just increases the acceleration there is a max speed of 100 3 multiplayer is a laggy pile of crap if you dont have a good server and internet and a computer the size of a country in starbound you can press shift and click when placing a building material to place one individual block just a small tip for yall hope it helps space engineers is like 10x better then no mans sky because you get to build your own stuff and can actually play with other players plus mods just because no mans sky was overhyped and probably not worth 60 dollars its still a good game elite all the way i literally wrote a review today on steam aboutspace engineers saying its a great alternative for no mans sky dan pls i like no mans sky but not enough to defend it dans article was pretty spot on thoughits an okay game but these games do look better sorry but spore is nothing like no mans sky ive played spore and im playing no mans sky i like both games but tho one is about getting your race up to the to and the other is only about exploring sure there is a spacepart in spore where you just fly arount and explore planets but this games arent some kind of the same do another playthrough of space engineers that would be awsome no mans sky deserves hell 2 words repetitive mining before i watch the video i know that all these games will be pc games so im stuck with no mans sky i love this video one of your best this year in my opinion you never fail to impress nerd theres a mod so that the candy floss come to life looks like a horse highly recommend you play space engine its not a game for say but more a simulation go search it up no mans sky is overpriced yes has bugs yes not everyone will like it if you like it then play no ones forcing you if you dont like it play these other space games if you want to me i like nms because i like to explore take my time and do things its not all shooty blasty kill kill kill some games are just different from others not everyone will like every game i like nms finally someone spoke the forbidden truth about nms watching this just makes me depressed because i think no mans sky is impressive not great but good id give it a 710 cant you try the best game ever that tacks place after ww2 its called mafia 2 who else would love to see a nerd completes of starbound im a bit surprised that dan didnt mention star citizen here seems like a rather good alternative to nms you forgot moonbase alpha xd the closest alternative to nms here is rodina and while it has tons of potential it has a fraction of the content of nms or any other game here for the other games the closest relation is that they have space while im sure they are all great games i would hesitate to call them alternatives no mans sky maybe if you were extremely mislead on what nms actually is but otherwise theyre just not the same thing no mans sky costs 60 and all three of these games combined costs 55 no explanation needed i really like this kind of videos was the same as his rollercoaster video good job keep on doing them youre an og if you remember dans permadeath on space engineers i was waiting for someone to compare it to space engineers would anyone recomend getting into eve online its on sale atm but just wondering would anyone recomend oh boy why did you have to add no mans sky in the title dan on the flip side nms is my favorite game of the past decade to each their own are you actually going to play starbound i love it pls tell me if you reach the outpost i think no mans sky is a great game and is a game changer for games but it could be better then it is i personaly think u are focusing only on the nagitives of the game you can press t on any place of a planet to place a marker and see the distance to there to put that into context and how you can use that i was looking at a hill from my ship that looked to be only a few meters i front of me but when i put a marker on it it was 20 fucking kilometers away what about space engine id honestly be down for just watching dan build towers call it starbound tower defense edition put a star on it s cute or something starbound has the best soundtrack of any game that i have played it goes really well with exploring new star systems and planets and i believe that its much much better than terraria i hope that starbound comes out of its coma it has so much potential hey whats the objective of these games space engineers is in a humble bundle at the moment for 5 space engine is better than all of these combined except it has no gameplay i really dont see why everyone dosent like no mans sky its a really fun game btw all three of these games cost less than no mans sky on steam even at full price yay nerdcubed completes star bound please why would you take someone elses opinion on something go get it yourself and form your own opinion for starbound hold a block that u can build with press shift and rightleft click and u can place one block and not 4 what happened to your viewscreen room in rodina i love no mans sky personally but those 3 games look good too starbound especially love terraria hope starbound comes to ps4 the problem with nms is that the community over hyped the game gave it massive expectations when the devs were clear the game was always meant to be mindless exploration which is fun if youre into that sort of thing peope over hyped the game into star citizens little brother when all it ever was meant to be was exploration no mans sky is shit as all the aliens bases are just little shacks where are all the big cities and stuff i love no mans sky am i alone so many alternatives such quality much wow i want a completes of starbound space engineers is in the current humble bundle youre welcome weirdly a game often mentioned as an alternative is subnautica its one planet and under water but its a very explory game handbuild world and therefore infinitely better the kind of thing id wich nms would be better at and the flying in subnautica feels a lot better then the not close enough to surface flying in nms the ships in nms look btw like straight out of space engineer it took me way too long to get the grinding joke at the start xd i would love a let play on starbound the fact that i got bored of no mans sky in about an hour and thirty minutes while i still havent gotten bored of space engineers ive been playing since what 2013 goes to show just how little content no mans sky has not to mention just how overhyped it was honestly it just feels so good to rub it in everyones faces its a bad habit of mine i have space engineers and spore i love them d space engineers fantastic if you want a building game a suspicious comparison to anything thats not a building game like no mans sky has the fatal flaw that its a good game that every single youtuber is terrible at and successfully makes it look incredibly unpleasant to play which probably effects its popularity as most people will look up gameplay of a game they arent sure about if you can work up the bravery to try it regardless of how bad youtubers make it look you might like it starbound a game that removed 90 of perfectly and fully functional content the literal day before its full release im serious thats what they did starbound has even less planet diversity in everything than nms thanks to that decision nms has a more flushed out planetary hazard system than starbound too which wasnt true before final release holy shit what did they do to this game dont buy it the intro is flashy but the gameplay is hollow somehow impossibly the b had no idea starbound was outta beta i gotta update my game i really hope it comes to console i would definitely buy it again where the fuck is spore 617 oh god ive nearly been taken out by a bush just like the twin towers eh i have waited years for dan to do another rodina videoaaaaaahhh more space engineers an fw with planets please sub to my channel for infinite luck its actually kinda funny people actually say that nms is supposed to be relaxing and not full of action while games like starbound pull off relaxing experiences better for less money flashbacks to three free games friday please do another space engineers permadeath please the developers have set themselves a 9010 rule 90 percent of all the planets will not be habitable and wont have any life on them of the 10 percent that do 90 percent of that life will be primitive and boring the tiny fraction of garden worlds with more evolved life forms on them will thus be almost as rare in the game universe as they ought to be in the real one this scarcity is part of the delicate balance that hello games is trying to strike between its idealistic commitment to the science of scifi and the inherent need to keep players entertained 2000 words dan you really dont like this game do you i write less than that in a fucking essay on shakespeare i must be the one person on this planet that thinks no mans sky isnt that bad the only way that no mans sky would be worth it is if it was like 10 i might buy it for that but 60 fucking dollars fuck no dan should complete star bound i nearly got taken out by a bush america 2008 starbound good one thats the game that got out of beta 2013 wasnt it oh wait starts singing smash mouth what is this game grumps you should do a full playthings on starbound i do love how we have variety and options these days do a lets play on starbound please id love to see a lets play series of rodina dan is it just me or is dans fov in space engineers really high and yet there all shit so thats what being shrekted feels like did dan just smash mouth us on space engineers i built a ship and ended up crashing it on another planet and spent hours trying to get my stuff back it was fantastic rodina multiplayer please play more rodina and space engineers please please please id like to see more comparison videos like this d could you do starbound please space engineers is awful elite dangerous is awful x3 is arse wtf are you id love to see you play starbound even if its just a oneshot type of thing oh come on dan you cant suggest rodina over no mans sky rodina is basically a tiny nms please play more of game 1 please play more of game 1 while i like these games i cant help but notice how you go no mans sky is bad heres three games that do a small portion of what it does each instead also theyre all not finished yet and run like dog balls and uh probably will never be completely finished cause they seem to keep moving the bar also i read your thing and basically your issues with nms fits space engineers to a tee except space engineers has a thinner layer of veneer around the constant mining so i dunno maybe bias maybe you built the game up too much in your mind a lot of people did that i cant honestly say that is not to say no mans sky doesnt have issues god knows it could use some more depth but then theyre adding that depth in updates just like these other games t pls some red faction guerrilla no mans pc can handle it dont forget ftl you can add the endless space mod for longer gameplay and it is devilishly hard you also have rebel galaxy a both a good game and a demonstration of what no mans sky should be priced at unfortunately i cant run any of the games you mentioned i agree that no mans sky isnt perfect but the main problem is again that it was hyped too fucking much and everyone expected it to be more than it is but i still love it to bits since i can remember i wanted a game where you can explore the galaxy but without any interruptions or menus to visit planets and stuff like in mass effect ive always wished for a game where you can get in your ship and fly off into the sky untill you are in space and then land on another planet when mass effect was announced i was extremely excited to finally get that just to find out it has a boring menu to travel through space so i dropped it after a few hours but this game finally lets me so yeah i really enjoy it im not saying its better than the 3 in this video and it would really help if it had more diversity and content but im still hoping to get that via updates but so far its still my favourite cause it lets me do what i wished for such a long time which no other game lets me experien i would love to see a playthrough of starbound tbh dan is always entertaining when he plays these weird buildy games i want to get starbound and rodina but can only get one of them wich one do you think i should get starbound is one of my favorite games who else got that beginning joke yes we want a completes of starbound i just want to see dan fucking rip apart no mans sky because of the thumbnail i tought its gonna be a 3 games friday to hell with you i thought it was meant to be daggerfall in space not morrowind omfg nice nerdcubed to put space engineers fitst on the list just thanks shouldve also looked into space engine same procedural generation thing except planets actually look uniqueinteresting game looks gorgeous has spaceships with realistic flight and orbital physics its also simulates a much bigger universe than nms for every star system in nsm space engine has an entire galaxy and perhaps best of all its fucking free i fucking love how dan put that grinding sound at the beginning thats genius 617 dont worry the worlds interpretation of america was damaged by a bush too please do 3 recommendations by nerd3 very clever vid dan yes but why would i play these games at 60fps when i could play no mans sky at 10fps more space engineers please i guess im the only one happy with no mans sky hey wait some of these isnt on ps4 tho yay another bashing of nms just because someone expected more than exploration game with very basic crafting if you dont like it shut up and play something else i did my research found out what the game is about bought it and i am enjoying it also do a console edition of this video if you wanna do it right you twat flaw in the post you made also im not reading any further as it hurts to read in minecraft the most basic fuel for your character is food that you can get anywhere in nms the most basic fuel for your character is thamium9 or plutonium that you can get anywhere however there are harder to get fuels in nms just like in minecraft kind of you can get diamond which is like that also can i point out that you shouldnt give a good opinion about this game or any game if you havent completed it yet either way this just shows i can get mad at one if not my 1 favourite youtuber for attacking a game i like and didnt achieve peoples expectations but i still love it also i dont see why the point you tried to make would apply for every video game because if thats what you think then i hope you dont classify yourself as a gamergame developer stupid swede here what does morrowinding space mean nms game isnt bad its great in fact until you see all the problems i definitely had watchdogs since i heard about it though please do a space engineers completes have you played rebel galaxy yet one of the best spacecombat games ive ever played play a horror game play star citizen what about pulsar the lost colony pretty good coop game that is basically being a crew member of ftl there is also outer wilds both dan and joel played the game and it was a relaxing and terrifying experience at the same time i will point out that no mans sky is still different from these games it looks a lot cooler has different mechanics and is a lot more interesting im gonna have to disagree with you dan no mans sky is awesome it really is im enjoying it so much i love rodina as well though i think that no mans sky is actually very good one does not simply exit his ship while travelling at relativistic speed dan jokes on you i own all 4 of these games and i really like all of them its octopuses not octopi all 3 games are better than no mans sky in my oppinion didnt quite capture the full essence of starbound but it was pretty funny anyway xd i think my ideal game would be the building and customization of space engineers on the galactic scale of no mans sky plus a playerbased economy very similar to eve online i should be able to build my own custom spaceships from scratch while having a mining operation on one of many planets transport it to space stations you build from scratch and sell it and trade it to competing factions all while defending your system from other players and ai this is what no mans sky should have been and i hope that it will be the direction space engineers goes one day in its current state no mans sky is a very vapid buggy as all hell deceitful exploration game that could have been all that this couldve been the greatest space exploration game ever made but it fell soooooo short when nms released i actually thought about these games i didnt know abut starbound and that looks amazing but i did know about the other two i had however forgotten rodinas name and i wasnt aware of the planets of space engineers i saw the thumbnail and thought it was three free games friday what about star citizen in starbound if you press and hold shift while mining or building you can build one square at a time nerd dont you know by now literally all everyone wants to watch is you building random shit and wasting time i would so watch a starbound completes series liking no mans sky is going to be the death of me through this video and i thought dan had better opinions than the majority of the internet wish me luck would love to see a starbound playthroygu 1058 ah yes a nice wooden chimney nothing will go wrong there you should get the grand exploration mod andor aerodynamics mod for space engineers i think all the points dan brought up are excellent and smart but i think the main reason its popular is because there really isnt a good or any to my knowledge space sim for console all he listed i think are pc exclusive and better besides maybe starbound to me space engeners is the best to me as someone who loves starbound and backed it on kick starter way back when im really happy to see it on this list and that dan likes it fantastic vid as always missiles are incredibly rare no they arent dan like every plus has missiles at it i dont fight too often so ive collected like 300 dont be mad i still have to watch saints row 1945 yes i absolutely wouldnt mind seeing a play series of this after saints row just like i loved fallout but dear god please dont make another think like wwe dear god no rebel galaxy is pretty good too planets are in star citizens next update wait space engineers have planets now start redownloading the game im glad to see more appreciation for rodina the developer is really cool actually isnt there a jump drive in this game please please please do a video on grow up the sequel to grow home what about the elite games im incredibly curiousin rodina how do they actually make the game is such a way that allows it to enable the gradual rendering of an entire planet without just fucking up completely or without using up like a terabyte of space you need to play grow up is the before of grow home oh my god the only youtuber who noticed the flag cape i respect you play grow up sequel to grow home finished it its amazing read the article and it raised some incredibly valid points im glad i decided to wait for reviews before purchasing because at the moment with all the bugs false promises and multitude of other issues nms does not seem 60 worthy so thanks nerscubed i appreciate your 2 cents and these awesome alternatives sees title yay he finally did a video on spaceengine sees thumbnail oh fuck you do a new video on all of these i love nms and it pains me that one of my favorite youtubers doesnt like it but everyone is entitled to their opinion you should go back to doing a series on space engineers maybe after you finish saints row 2 dont see how these are better what about pulser lost collany space engineers has gameplay but it doesnt fucking run for shit on most peoples rigs buyer beware youre in for a scare dan can you please give space engineers a little mini series again hey nerd3 what do you think of the new grow up the sequel of grow hoem come on just play spaceengine you fool i would watch a star bound play through anyone else space engineers again woohoo dan you should revisit that game i agree nms is a bit shallow like there wont be many players in a year but at least it tried to do something different and ambitious in the intro were you returning the slab id love to watch him play starbound the game is so great and he could do a sort of fallout 4 thing where he has one main base with a teleporter and that is the place that he builds up i also want to see his reaction to the avali mod where you get to play as basically space raptors i demand a nerdcubed completes starbound do another series on space engineer please it was good so basically anything but no mans sky the only thing stopping me from playing rodina is that every planet is barren whereas nms has life and trees and lakes etc rodina is just an empty planet with some ai enemies flying around it a completes on rodina would be amazing bring back three free games friday erm nerd how about elite dangerous damn i really hoped dan went up to one of the crashed ships in rodina shits biiiiiig plus the dev wants to give them procedurally generated interiors eventually daaaamn wait no mans sky is popular when it popped up it got immediate shit reviews priced 60 euros why would anyone buy that lmao no mans sky is exactly what i thought it would be so i can only assume people read into things that werent there in the promos they assumed something that was never the case the problem with suggesting 3 games that make up elements of no mans sky even if you can get all 3 for less than nms youd still need to play all 3 games simultaneously to get the same experience plus by doing this you can say these games do certain things better than nms but none of them do all the things nms does elite dangerous space truckin eve online bored bored bored eyestrain space engineers my ship its destroyed il end you starbound space mercs rodina wheres my ship starmade oh the ais bugged up again spore why cant i leave my ship spore galactic adventures i change my mind let me back in the ship grow home oh fuck i fell again reassembly stop ramming into me you assho oh im dead again space engineers really have you seen the multiplayer on that game space engineers is actually empty actually grindy actually pointless and actually unfinished and starbound ticks every bullshit survivalbox and buries its interesting content under that avalanche of enemyspam constanthunger bullshit empyrion is also another fun no mans sky alternative base building ship building and pve with multiple planets to visit please do a short complete of starbound and rodina like you did with fallout you can just design something and show us if you dont want to play forever you know ill be waiting officialnerdcubed if you made another series for space engineers i would watch the whole thing a lot has changed aside from planets like oxygen planets ai enemies exploding robot dogs spiders by the way spiders only spawn on the alien planets so nuke it from orbit grinding noise so i was just playing no mans sky me oh shits going down after so many years thank you so much for letting us watch you play space engineers again although i thoroughly enjoy no mans sky these are all great games and i still look forward to playing them as well i think dan has overlooked some things about no mans sky that are genuinely good if not great ive been looking forward to this video for a while d this really opened my eyes to what games could be im usually such a nerdcubed fan that i always follow his opinion and always agree with him but there are some rare times where i disagree i disagree with him on no mans sky im quite enjoying my time with it i do feel like it should be way less money 40 at best 60 is too much one of the rare times i disagree with dan but i dont mind video was still entertaining p well i looked up what tentai was never agian i repeat never agian i like the smash mouth song at the start i would love a star bound lets play even just a few parts because not many people do it you missed starmade p another great game but maybe not fitting into this particular list pulsar think 3d ftl with coop adore space engineers 3 although take note it uses newtonian physics so every force you put out ie a backward facing thruster must be countered with a forward facing thruster and so on so that your ship actually functions p its a wee tad unstable but its glorious with the extended exploration mod d you should do a completes series on starbound i mean if we watched you fumbling about with bushes on cities sklines i think we can deal with you messing with towers and stuff on starbound i find the game in small doses and then wait for a while to play it again ahem starbound completes series all the building all the designing i have a need please dan please do a completes on starbound if only i had the money and rig for all three space engneers is the best game to ever be made you should do more starbound the only good thing dan said about nms is the music okay rodina s made by one guy and has nowhere near the budget yet has better music i would also recommend a game called endless sky its free game and its not the most advanced but im sure some people here would enjoy it this is the closest thing to three free games friday weve had in a long time except its not friday and the games arent free but there are three of them i wonder if he would like from the depths dan if you do a playthrough of starbound shift is a good button for building not gonna say more also i would love that playthrough please do it the colony stuff is good i wanna see what you can do please did he say hit n run tactics after saints row you should complete star bound starbound completes yes just watching this makes me want to go play rodina i love that game so much wait a minute why havent you played more space engineers after the mini series its brilliant after you have finished completing saints row 2 can you do completes series in space engenders its like 3 free games friday but not free space engineers is on humble bundle for like 4 plus other games umm yeah but its a space pickaxe i realy like your review of nms no mans sky was a bit of a dissapointment but it is still quite fun at least for a little while biggest issue with no mans sky no combat despite the focus on guns being used for combat too the tiny sentinel battles dont count because theyre so easy and non threatening i read your notes in petreon and also extra credit talked about the same thing this week this made me think mining in nms is a bad idea for progression as the fantasy of the game is to explore not to mine so they should had rewarded the game for exploration so i tried to think about a mechanic the reward exploration in space and then i remembered spore as much this game was a mixed bag the space stage was fun imo and they did the progression in this stage really well the more you travel the more ftl driver you will unlock letting you to travel further the more you fight the more weapons you unlock as so on i think nms should had to tried this progression system reward the player for taking part of the goal and fantasy not just send him into a feedback loop he was grinding at the start xd starmade is a good one it actually runs candy flossthats a thing is a rimworld video coming id love to see dan do a full playthrough of sb at some point do starbound completes please bring back the space engineers series mass effect in comparison to no mans sky is as big as a puddle but has the depth of the ocean fuck yes i love all of the games on this list i am outraged this is ridiculous didnt even mention ftl faster than light i would love to see a completes of rodena idc about multiplayer i love no mans sky its a good game go back to doing some sort of build thing again it could be mine craft terraria star bound or anything i just think that would be a really cool alternative if you ever wanted to take a break from your complete series i have all four games mentioned not including spore everything is better then no mans sky he has to do another spider challenge limbo with space engineers or other games with spiders in it dear dan is it dan im hard of hearing i wish to ask you if you could caption your videos their is plenty of options you can pay like 50 cents usd or something per minute or you can let your fans do it for free i hope to reach you with this it will get you more subs and it will improve accessibility and will help many people like me please respond im a really big fan it would be a blessing if you responded there was an update that was released for nms that fixed the pc performance issues space engineers had such promise at one point the devs inability to let a ship go faster then 100kmh or whatever the unit is and the near non functioning player beacons that make it impossible to see coop players makes the big maps nearly unplayable i love rodina im going to get it eventually why has dan never played space engine thats about as no man sky as you can get make a series on all if them on space engineers i would of enabled spiders because i like scaring the shit out of my selfand cause im evil but do they have 18 quintillion planets i now need a starbound completes series didnt now i needed it until now to be honest starbound just looks like a copy of terraria is anyone else getting indiana jones vibes from the rodina music 2430 that could easily be the main cover for this game rodina is an extraordinary game grow up dan grow up sometimes youre so childish every time someone talks about no mans sky to me i always mentioned rodina this should called equally good games whats your opinion on rimworld did you play it already who cares im going to bomb it anyways can you do a series on space engineers 2015 i distinctly remember you being good at voxelbased building at one point empyrion is a good nms alternative as well that ending nerd3you should play space engineits the biggest and most beutiful space game i know dan will you ever do a starbound lets play love how you named x3 spend hours playing the game great with additional scripts i love no mans skybut i love dan ripping the shit out of it even more 3 holy shit dan you can rap guys did dan just play some grinding noise at the beginning of the video and said that was him playing nms that was so savage i can hardly believe it happened star citizen or riot why has dan stopped calling us procrastinators i have officially stopped exploring planets in no mans sky all ive been doing is stopping at 1 planet making warp cells the leaving can you play more rodina who else spent 40 on no mans sky only to find out that its shit and that they couldnt refund it because they didnt know how the steam refund policy worked i wish there was a toggle spiders option in real life play some space engineers or spore how exactly is rodina amazing compared to nms all the planets are incredibly boring even if they are huge theres absolutely nothing on them and i do like the story of rodina but the planets themselves are just boring the ship designer is awesome but youre basing the game on aesthetics then nms really does take that as there are planets that do look absolutely beautiful the fucking grinding hears the stomping the ground starts to shake can you hear that no mans sky fanboys complaining whispers run hehehe random video idea what is better gta 5 vs jc3 i think your problem is your expectations you were expecting what they promised i purposely avoided all news and everything for the game and i think its great it isnt perfect or any good on pc but on ps4 its great if you stay in one solar system for a long time and dont jump from one to the next that is the opposite of what the game wants but its what the game is also im not saying its right to lie about whats in your game just that not listening to what they say makes over hyped games better who else turned their head at 1230 to read it this was recorded a long time ago huh i remember him talking about this episode on the last episode of the podcast no star citizen either way these are all good games hay nerd you shud do a full play of starbound outer wilds kind of i fucking adore starbound lol that grind at the beginning lol starbound is amazing im watching this as i play and enjoy no mans sky got up from space engineers to see this thought it was cool going back to space engineers you should check out space engine you forgot starmade i came here to see dan play rodina again i wish there was a good dogfighting space game elite was good for awhile but then they changed the ai to just gang up on you in fights and you just get fucked because the allied ai doesnt help you can we have a rodina series plz i wish dan would play more starbound does rodina randomly generate every time you play you should make a rodina series you know if you want please please please do a complete series of star bound that would be wonderful moon who moon moon oh so thats where the giant alien spiders come from if only you could turn them off in ftl please do a complete for starbound dan is really narrow minded nms does have really big planets i really like him but he can be rather cunty and silly sometimes please do a completes series of starbound nerd i like you channel but i you missed the point no mans sky it was was a game of survival and exploring like in real life youre not playing god or anything spore was playing god i never in a million years thought i would say this but we now have a game that is worse than aliens colonial marines and its no mans sky hello nms fanboys i am a pc gam i mean a fellow nms fanboy my favorite platform is stea i mean the playstation store am i doing it right eh starbound is polished but id rather have the last beta version than 10 does anyone remember nerd hates yeah me neither 1451 feels like im a watching him name the entire wwe roster tenticai you know exactly what that it ftl faster than light this reminds me of three free games friday this reminds me of three free games friday nerdcubed plays starbound nerdcubed completes starbound more starbound please anything anyone wait physics dosent comply with the ending as steping out of a space craft at that speed would mean you slow down the same speed you stepped out of a ship gees its not difficult im 13 and i know this play grow up it is the sequel to grow home he forgot about rebel galaxy i wouldnt mind a starbound complete series starbound completes sign me in i would watch the shit out of you playing starbound so basically starbound starts in japan dan you should try or maybe recomend from the depths which is almost like space engineers but in the sea dan you need to do a new permadeath of space engineers pwease must be to hotcoldwettoxic out for them dan pls the twin towers were taken out by a bush i actually own all four of these games what about outer wilds maybe check out empryion as well yes no mans sky is overpriced and overhyped no these games are no alternatives respect your opinion though love all three of these games no mans sky look alright for casual gamers i think i could get something good out of it after i was bored to death by rodina i figured dan would love nms i am genuinely surprised he didnt like it i imagine when you take damage on the last game rodina its like a stargate ship getting shot once the crew go flying around the ship and screens blow up and sparks n shit even though they get shot one time with shields active what about ksp you gonna play grow up starbound yes yes yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssss no space engine its funny because its grinding hah funny as always what about star citizen dan will love that my reaction to dans nms post i think nms just got a new asshole i personally feel that from what ive been hearing about the problems of nms i think the game has a lot of potential to add plenty of things that make the game better not a great game just a better game still a lot of the stuff that can be added from here on out should have already been fucking added and was hinted at or downright promised before the game came out wasnt expecting that 23 people havent watched the full video for fuck sake i literally bought space engineers 20 minutes ago couple minutes later went to youtube and saw a nerdcubed video with space engineers in the thumbnail hear him say hey there are planets now and a bunch of new shit im happy now i wish i waited for dans opinion before i wasted money on no mans sky i allready own all of these games including the three at the start what the fuck dan i love space games i was hoping you would find me some new ones fuck you jk love you outer wilds should be in this for the exploration aspect god damn dan smashmouth is live i have all three of these and universe sandbox both of them and i want no mans sky i think i have a space addiction starbound is terraria in space re space engineers good job turning off the spiders they turn up on alien planets i had starbound years before this video back when it wasnt even fully released and when nms came out i thought of starbound being a poor mans nms i would add kerbal space program to this list this video haha absolutely brilliant is nobody bringing up the fact that no mans sky has no fucking stars there is no sun what the fuck no mans boys are gonna come and get this video and send dan death threats calling it now oh goddamnit as the picture pans by slowly i notice the exhaust lines of the ship shooting straight up go over the red ship either the red ship is huge or that other ship is tiny this fucking bothers me ugh you were wrong about the planets being randomly generated in starbound all of them are the same for every player you just spawn on a different one each playthrough so you can share points of interest with other players along with leaving stuff at certain coordinates switching characters and going to those coordinates and picking up that equipment you left there dan play more toribash or roller coaster tycoon 3 now i actually like nms a lot in fact but i can still see the negatives in this game and they are quite ugly i guess i could make up an excuse with oh they are gonna fix bugs and add new stuff later onbut im not gonna do that since i would probably just get people countering me anyway i am gonna say however that none of the games you showed us is exactly like nmswhich is kind of what i wish for only betterrodina was pretty close though p hey i remember when dan played a space that had only 6 plants it was a bit werid and old does anybody remember it do you think you could do another series of space engineers plz if you want to play no mans sky for free here are the steps 1 buy it 2 play for 1520min 3 disconnect your pc from the internet the device with the game installed 4 request a refund from another device not the one with the game installed 5 congrats as long as that pc the one with the game isnt connected to the internet you can play it as much as you want this will work with any game on steam that does not require an internet connection delboy of space is the best description of elite dangerous i have ever heard xd nerd is probably now gonna create a show called bill nye the tentecai dan should make a rodina completes my name is kye i was so confused yes yes a thousand times yes subnautica is also a great option its literally no mans sky underwater you land on an alien ocean full of marine alien life unlike no man sky things are condensed and there is actually specific things to explore that appear in every world thats generated omg this is amazing rebel galaxy is good and free this month on ps dan you should do a series on rodina or space engineers you were wrong about the planets being randomly generated in starbound all of them are the same for every player you just spawn on a different one each playthrough so you can share points of interest with other players along with leaving stuff at certain coordinates switching characters and going to those coordinates and picking up that equipment you left there i would put subnautica on that list even though its underwater and not in space id like to recommend planet explorers as an alternate to no mans sky and elite dangerous is one of the most boring and pointless games ive ever played doing anything in that game feels like a really obtuse way of changing the numbers on a spreadsheet because thats all that is actually happening and the game makes it so painfully obvious elite dangerous earned its moniker of a mile wide and an inch deep for good reason playthrough space engineers again space engineers doesnt look fun star bound looks like terraria in space i dont like terraria and rodina doesnt look complete while no mans sky looks like the good parts of all these games combined you can get space engineers at humble bundle survive bundle for 5 what about starmade aw i thought this video would be about games actually similar to nms but with actual content shame the hero we need please do more space engineers so this is technically 3 paid games thursday get it cause its a grind i got all these games and i love them for what they are i wish rodina came out for console sorry xbox peasant here but i can still complain as well as anyone else can i love starbound its one of my favourite games lol at dan always having to have a negative opinion on popular things just to seem cool can you play space engineers more dan check out dual universe the thing about no mans sky is its such a boring game you cant comet to it rebel galaxy is better too space engineers is pretty much no mans sky before no mans sky and its what made me love space so much more you should do a series on space engineers rodina is the game i always think about when people talk about no man sky its a baffling game and im happy you made a video on it edit im talking about his nerd plays on this game not this video but but space engine ultimate alternative to no mans sky minecraft does a black farmer cow milk come out chocolate milk no mans sky one mans lie wtf why is the stuff purple now i thought it was red i have to agree in my option no mans sky is minecraft in space i was gonna make a joke but then i remembered this joke is shit no love for starmade its definitely a no mans sky alternative hell it could even be considered a star citizen alternative in the future nerd 3 finally played space engineers again about time anyone else see the thumbnail and for a moment think he was bringing three free games friday back i was so excited for no mans sky im glad i didnt buy it dell boy of space what its when he talked about elite guys i dont think dan likes no mans sky just a hunch please play a full lets play of star bound yes love this grow up is amazing but im missing some shit i need 1 teleporter 1 challenge and 7 crystals help plz hello random person have a nice day next completes should be space engineers im so glad he played space engineers it has so much potential but dan no mans sky offers you endless exploration mindless mining and dull powering up systems for the simple price tag of 60 how can you not like it you fucking hater sees video in subbox reads title oh boy shits about to hit the fan oh boy i just wish my computer could handle space engineers guess its saving up for a better graphics card for me that beggining confused the shit outta me can recommend space engineers more building focused rather than exploration though its on humble bundle really cheap now too three space games thursday lol newseries awe come on 44 seconds late productivity hello hope you have a wonderful day stranger 27seconds i

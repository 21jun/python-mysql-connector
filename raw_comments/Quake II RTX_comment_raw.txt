rtx is not real they just remastered quake 2 lol d 619 wtf is this lol its totally different weapon at 16 minutes when you are talking about the screenspace relfections in q2 xp screen space reflections will render everything above the water plane the reason why the reflection at the bottom is missing is because they have used the fresnel effect which is accurate to real life but missing on the rtx version with fresnel the amount of reflection you see depends angle of the plane relative to the viewer is that rain or 5700xt tears omg memories from the good old times i miss the 90s nice to see quake without texture warping in 1997 no one called 3d graphics accelerators gpus that term only came about with the first geforce the geforce 256 which was the first card to do transformation and pervertex lighting in hardwareeffectively for the first time putting the whole graphics pipeline in hardware also games had dynamic lighting even before the days of hardware acceleration well described thank you q2rtx feels like q2 when it was released but still only feels like q2 when it released insanely in depth review i couldnt win original quake 2 on pc without a cheat code back in 96 ahh love them days carmageddon 1 and 2 with rtx winamp i really whips the llamas ass so can 2060 rtx run this at full settings at 1080p at least i am talking about at least 6080 fps i didnt even know there is a quake 2 version with stencil shaddows and parallax occlusion mapping that on its own is awesome too rt version is on another level of course with new shaders global ilumination real reflections etc klingon honour guard rtx when and once again quake2 has become the benchmark tool for pc just like back in 1997 so this is really impressive technically but it is such a mood killer the strogg bases went from grimy cyberpunk factories to beige egyptian temples straight out of serious sam the rusty guns now shine like polished chrome levels even on the darkest settings shown off are way brighter than they used to beexcept at 1945 where it looks as good as id hope the entire game would look it is like a more extreme version of doom 3 bfg edition which replaced mood and pitch black shadows for a smoother more welllit experience which in that case killed the entire horror part of the game quake 4 rtx highly under rated game in my opinion while i do appreciate the real time lighting and effects of the rtx version and i do think ray tracing is awesome in general in this particular example quake ii xp looks absolutely amazing in my opinion if you could combine it with the rtx version it would take things to a whole other level software rendered quake 2 is far superior the aesthetics just speaks for themselves the smooth rendered textures were a tech achievement of the time but not really better looking open gl quake 2 is a fucking blurfest just like the every n64 game while the original psone games do look aesthetically good at this day try to play silent hill one via emulation with smooth textures and then with the original rendering the latter just looks so fucking better this was what convinced me to get a rtx gpu playing through this game again with this level of remastered graphics was not only nostalgic but also jawdropping as the graphics are literally like nothing i have ever seen before i really hope nvidia remasters some more classics like this unreal needs a rt remaster i love the breakdowns with alex i could watch these for an hour i honestly think raytracing is way overrated its only marginally better looking than well done faking in normal raster images sure ill take it in my games when we get to the point where the performance hit is only on the scale of something like smaa 2x but it seems backwards to me to buy a top tier gpu to play games at 1080p at the present moment especially for those of us who bought a 1080ti for ultra sharp resolution i wouldnt care as much if nvidia didnt try to overhype rtx in order to justify the piss poor pricing of the new cards that being said it did give me a retronostalgic feeling when i had to turn this down to 640x480 for smooth 60 fps gameplay its like i was playing on a 3dfx voodoo with better lighting lol yahtzees review of quake 2 john carmack then went on the construct quake 2 out of stale weetabix and cardboard its super dull lol who still uses winamp xd when i was a kid i got my voodoo 3 in 1999 and loved playing quake 2 i was 11 at the time and wasnt able to beat it but i was still skipping levels to try them out i actually kinda liked them pixelated crushed software rendered look a little compared to the blurred multitexrured look i also took the quake 2 disk away from my dad and listened to the soundtrack and rocked out i will wait for ampere 7nm before i hop on rtx i thumbs up for winamp i am still using winamp 295 best music player ever made spoiler alert its shit 30fps btw man so glad i paid 1200 to play a game thats over 20 years old totally worth it please help my 1070 has a new port on the end after playing this game for about 5 minutes not as good as remastered black mesa half life and soon to be released zen looks great but rtx is way to bright by default 208 those who have played pc games for years often and rightfully so have scoffed at the idea of paying for a remaster like you really would on console as buying a new gpu is basically remastering all your games for you just an amazingly stupid statement i feel like quake 1 wouldve been a better choice for this theres a lot more deliberate use of lighting to create atmosphere and the game can hit up to friggin 1000 fps on my laptop from 2009 with fps limit removing source ports so itd probably run even better waaaaaah as a kid i used to go to this internet caf after school almost everyday to play this game started out as a free kill and ended up being titled a cheater good times i wonder if thresh still has that car he won in practice though its so marginal you will not notice rt in any game the net effect is usually wow its darker in this part of the scene its a needed step for more realistic graphics but it requires so much processing power one wonders if the budget is better allocated elsewhere artists might love the idea of not having to invest as much time into lighting but most customers arent having any of it this generation this version makes the game world look wrong in colour where are the original sky colours its too lit in the atmosphere game looks like shit compared to doom remake 4 lights on nvidia launch a new series of raytracing cards which cost 1000 for the flagship title and df run a story on how to play a 1997 game with raytracing turned on kinda symbolic of the death of pc gaming thanks to nvidia and muppet channels like df xd i wanna see a raytraced morrowind nwn and even wizardry 8 why didnt they use the engine for rage 2 i mean the id engineit still feels like an id game but one thing for sure i totally enjoyed that game rage 2 was ott what makes it such a heavy title to run it doesnt look all that great to me looking in the computer screens and seeing your reflection is great the very low poly meshes are pretty hilarious though i have an nvidia 1050 ti it needs nvidia geforce rtx 2060 or higher to run i can happily live without this remake because i have the original quake on n64 too just another marketing gimmick to promote the graphics card unreal tournament rtx pleaseto bring that game back i like the new realistic lighting but to me it doesnt fit with the nonrealisticeverything else that is in the game xp kinda has that comic book sort of feel to it that i think looks best for quake 2 still rtx is a great achievement can we just add ray tracing to every game for science it looks like a shit and soulless facelift that spits in the art direction hate seeing ray tracing marketed as making these techbasicoutdated games look new and improved honestly just an insult to the technology more than anything keep it for boasting games with the fidelity to make proper use of it such as what was shown with metro exodus the virality of quake 2 with ray tracing and the stance of it being better in every video about it is embarrassing quake 1 had the true industrial rock soundtrack never forget i want to play this game with rtx anyone know what setting i should go for the lighting as close as the original in terms of atmosphere i honestly dont see what the big deal is we need halo ce edition ray traced next it only makes sense i dont get the point rtx dont change that this game is just an old old simple dungeon shooter lmao shit graphic next most differences i would not have seen without the hintsespecially between quake 2 xp and quake 2 rtx and yes i understand rtx and that it is the holy goal of graphics i would like more to see a full outside area with rtx i can just not compare a dark dungeon with the reality because of missing dungeon experience that isnot a ranger qii proto is a bitterman i can hear computer fans going off just by watching this dont get it it looks just like quake 2 from all those years ago quakes saga deserves and awesome update just like doom with doom 2016 the 1997 game now looks like the 2007 game yes it is worth it to buy the ray tracing those xp textures are kinda eh i dont think there was ever flex support those looked like they were still prebaked sims on billboards i think they changed because they deviated from the original look too much i have an rtx 2080 and i do not get the appeal the of ray tracing in every game play i trade fps for fancy lighting which at times offers no obvious benefit maybe in 5 years well have a card that can do this type lighting at 144hz but for now why would i turn on a feature that makes my 800 card feel underpowered bioshock 1 rtx would be dope it ran smoothly enough on my pentium ii just not in 4k actually competitive quake1 players preferred 320x200 soft instead of glquake until some proper video cards came and btw nobody used the word gpu back then xd should of done quake live rtx 1219 gotta say i quite like the rasterized version when a designers artistic talents are called upon the resulting aesthetics can be far more original and might even lend the environments greater dimension despite their relative lack of authenticity i suppose ultimate its all down to personal taste and the nature of the content lmaounreal tournament already had it i can remember back in 1986 when the atari st and commodore amiga would take 12 hours to render one frame of an accurate raytraced scene man how far we have come i played quake 2 on software mode for over 15 years even when i had perfectly capable pc to run even quake 2 xp quake ii xp is much better than rtx bullshit i got a solid 15fps in this with sli 1070s quake2s original had a wonderfully dark and brooding atmosphere the rtx version is overbright and washed out its an impressive technology but using q2 as a demo was a bad idea in my opinion you cant just take an old game swap the engine and generate some pbr materials from old diffuse textures it wont look good video game artist is a job for a reason i bet people would be more interested if they just made a short playable tech demo who needs cyberpunk 2077 or doom eternal when you can have quake 2 rtx its been a very long time since i looked at a game and said that looks very realistic id love to see half life 2 get this kind of treatment awesome analysis only if you have a 2080ti you get 60 fps in 1080p a card of 1000 euros no thanks nice ad but fuck no im not buying rtx card winamp for the win i archived the last good download of winamp years ago and still use it to this day as my primary music player i really just have one thing that i wish you could improve please dont swithc sides for the versions back and forth i suggest putting the old game always on the left and the new one always on the right sometimes it switches for no reason and it is a bit confusing aside from that great content of course why the fuck they change railgun and bfg models nonsense this looks worse than the graphics mod and engine berserker by a russian developer the raytracing does hardly anything to make the game in general look better berserker looks great on older cards and doesnt even need an rtx raytracing alone makes the game hardly look better by much a little sad all the quake2rtx videos just show the original campaign the quake 2 mod scene was way more impressive and inspiring than the core game was id love to see some raytraced footage of dday normandy and airquake 2 both of which had a lot of outdoor areas which i think could benefit from the global illumination and atmosphere settings i think the omaha beach landing and viervillesurmer maps in dday could be especially interesting to see so why cant they do new games that come out rtx why is it most still dont have it i still fail to see the point of putting ray tracing in games this old the whole point was to take graphics to the next level we already have realistic textures etc the only thing missing was pretty much just lighting ray tracing in the few modern aaa games that support it looks amazing and thats the direction that more games need to take whats the point of taking a game from 1997 and giving it a slightly better graphical feel and modern lighting engine if it still looks shit other than marketing of course now the whole game is made of mirrors although the lighting and reflections are superior in quake ii rtx i think quake ii xp looks better in general the thing i miss in the new skyboxes is the strogg installations in the background ie looming big gun as you get closer to it with new ones you get the impression that you are in the middle of the desert which is located in strogganifstan looks gorgeous though just an amd gamer passing by oh no its either too bright or pitch black looks like they need to model the human iris next to increase and decrease aperture with lighting level 30fps on a 2080ti with only one bounce lighting we are not there yet then too bright completely loses the athstetic of the game it feels like i just stepped into the game during the daytime when it was originally night xd wait quake 2 in software on ryzen hmm i kinda wonder how bad not having 3dnow affects q2 software on ryzen vs elder cpu with 3dnow original q2 while low tech it looks moodier better fuck overpriced video cards play original quake 2 with quality mods quake 2 xp is x10 better than this ray tracing is nothing but a very unoptimized and mediocre eye candy yesterday game more like decade old game this game is old enough drive vote smoke and drink it probably has a 401k too i really wish the source code for thief the dark project and thief ii the metal age was opensource so i could make a thief iii rtx mod those games still hold up graphically and still have some of the very best gameplay of any game gameplay which is highly focused on using light and shadows to progress i would do horrible things to get my hands on thief i or thief ii rtx mods d i hope bethesda authorizes nvidia and id software to work on and release doom 3 rtx now i know that probably wont happen but doom 3s core design was focused on hardware perpixel lighting so it would be the perfect classic pc fps game to receive the rtx remaster treatment keep up the great work digital foundry what are the overlay tools used for the cpu numbers and the fps charts i bought my rtx about a year ago and kinda felt dumb till now i hope the take more old games and rtx the hell outa em i personally and in my own opinion think its neat and feels nice on my eyes thank you game people keep doin cool stuff like this plz rtx on skyrim sex mods when i mean it has to be a thing wow millions of dollars spent to make a game which is exactly as fun to play as the original honestly playing with software filtering is the way to go for q1 q2 1900 rtx and xp are the wrong way around yeah great job explaining in depth detail what rtx does to quake 2 and also playing quake 2 without music is not the same i hitted the like button inmediately after you said that and played your sonic mayhem music from winamp like the old days i hope they fix that music problem in the future btw halflife killed quake ii btw halflife in 3dfx glide was super and there is also black mesa nice i really want to see doom 3 rtx yep it give a brand new look to the game i played a shit ton of quake 2 in the 90s as soon as i start the game it exits to the desktop bla bla bla even with the rtx mod it still looks the same if not worse than some other cool indie graphic mods that were already released years ago in rtx the textures look so overly sharp and dont really fit the game they look out of place and completely destroy the original quake 2 ambience this is just marketing for rtx just to justify the change and make people who own a 1080 to upgrade buy this new crap its totally useless maybe in some months it could be worth it but for now the difference is just not enough in my country we call these moves smoke sellers when a 22 yo game is run by a 1200 gpu and still looks like shit and is called incredible gtfohwtbs wow crap tastic dont get the fuss it looks as horrible as it did in 97 just with some marginal better lighting so you have to buy a 400 minimum rtx vid card to play this properly does this work on non rtx cards like the 1080 ti the textures in these kinds of games always move like blobs when in movement love the technical breakdown and comparison fantastic work i for one would love to see an rtx version of the original unreal music not handled at all everything is said i want far cry intincts predator ported from 360 to pc with rtx lighting the water in that game is so good the map editor would make it an rtx legend also best multiplayer in far cry universe these are reasons i dont own rtx yet soo nine inch nails original cd soundtrack vkpt looks much better compared to rtx i know rtx is more accurate but thats not the end all be all i feel rage 2 took the strogg aesthetic and used it for the main enemy race awesome video great technical breakdown i have to say though that the original lighting looks better i mean it all technically looks better with rtx the atmosphere is changed its too bright the lighting was controlled to look how it does 1340 is probably how it should look me thinks out of curiosity ill try this on my 1070 although i see not to expect much haha how can i activate the console in steam version the tilde key does not work who want to play this peace of shit in 2019 i remember in the very early days of graphics cards people would comment it was stupid and nonsense having to buy a piece of hardware just to render graphics ray tracing is absolutely punishing very interested to see what the xbox team cooked up with amd and even how software methods are gonna go the vega 56 epic demo ps5 etc thanks for adding visual cues to help see the effects you talk about during the video makes it so much easier to follow the explanation of whats on screen sorry i just have a rx 470 cant afford any gtx or rtx in my country im really underwhelmed by that whole rtx raytracing tech meh all those rt reflection and effects arent really noticeable in fast paced games anyway one thing that made me feel like i was having a new gaming experience was when i saw the reflection of a strogg behind me and turning around to shoot it before it shot me before the only alert that i would have would be a sound or being shot in the back i think i just figured out why the original quake 2 environments look better in the old engine first the textures in the rtx environment are too soft clean and dull if they were to crank up the contrast ion all the diffuse maps for both luminosity and saturation levels it would better mimic the old look in the new engine the other thing is that realistic lighting isnt always soft raytracing is great for soft light but old engines cant do that so your brain has an easier time feeling the grungier more harshly lit environment better soft shadows look better but sharp shadows feel better if that makes any sense i dont want to diminish the importance of this leap in technology im merely comparing the two games as presented and making some artsy observations my gtx1080 can only manage 3fps on medium settings amd look at our new navi video cards me yeah but can it run quake 2 i would like to try to get it in software look but with the raytracing effects on top like a hybrid mode iv tryed changing the texture rendering and nothing i could see happen and i did try to remove the texture pack but then the game complain and wont launch anyone figure out a way to get music working yet played this religiously orange smoothie mod lithium hooks and rails 1v1 edge i played till about april 2001 good times and good clans mnemonic nvidias quake 2 rtx demo has matte floors compared to the previous rt demo where the floors had some specularity and looked better system shock 2 rtx would be awesome i liked the look of the software rendered version the best sry completely stupid getting 64fps with low of 60 at 4k all maxed not sure why youd need to run at 1080 with a 2080ti if your cpu is up to it please say youre going to look at the last wave of backwards compatible games for xbox one the majority of people played it in softwere back then it wasnt until tnt and voodoo 2 that the graphic accelerators became mainstream an year later and the performance was ok given the resolutions were not that high 640x480 800x600 at most and it was by no means terribly slow you always sound like youre coming onto me mmm i feel that quake 2 loses some details in the blood when you blow up the enemies but well i think that few could enjoy a total remastering of the game with an extreme range team id games always had the best soundtracks 2111 am i the only one that likes the left version waaay better then the right one apart from the music ofcourse distant tomorrow tho from 1000 fps its locked to 72 fps in rtx 2080 ti this using real real time raytracing not the gimmicks we have in other games that have a really low amount of rays and just use it in either shadows lightning or reflections quake uses the 3 are there any quake 3 rtx demos looks cool in some areas but too flat in others perhaps its because we have been spoiled missguided by the ssao look but i definitely prefer the dark vanilla look i hear an echo in the voice over the overly shiny weapons in q2 rtx bother me quake 2 xp looks better than rtx ive always hated quake ii for some reason and i cant quite pick out why super hope somebody does this for the original quake though another wonderful video from alex id like to share another amazing feature of quake2 rtx water refraction when you dive into the water everything in the air appears higher than it actually is and you can observe the total internal reflection i bet no other game before has done these while quake 2 rtx do has another issue besides alex mentioned ghosting which i believe is cause by temporal denoising algorithm quake 1997 with rtx looks better than new games on ps4 people without rtx cards i see no difference here pff it just looks like open gl ray tracing is a fad and isnt worth it people with rtx cards laughing so over hyped and overrated i want half life rtx imagine thief the dark project with rtx played through the shareware today used 70 scaling at 1440p everything else maxed and got over 100 fps easy looked very nice even with the 70 scaling but i wish 2080 ti was a bit more powerful to get smooth framerates with maxed settings it is a joke to purchase a rtx 2080 ti to play an old game at 1080p xd rtx sucks 2258 disaster performance worst than crysis 1 even crysis 1 has much better graphics this is look nothing with with highest settings rtx on not worth it id rather play quake 2 with remastered graphics mod a much better performance and graphics its just ray tracing better in rtx version thats i dont care because the performance and you need a modern gpu in the end we all are alex the new graphics look awesome but i cant resist those pixels i wanna see your take on the new halo trailer it looks realtime i saw some imperfections like shadow flickering quake 2 rtx looks nice but i can not sacrifice my fps for lighting most controversial comment on the video quake 1 saturn looked better than quake 2 pc circa 1997 and it looks better than quake 2 rtx better use of colored lighting more varied visuals and better lighting come at me alex i have rtx 2080 msi gaming x trio made an 60 oc on core and i get consistent 60fps at highest raytracing options and shit at 1080p so i think you could play at higher internal resolution for better visuals i found that denosier makes the game look a little blurry not as sharp as it should be but when i push internal res to 150 i get nice and clear picture at 1080p panel its impressive as hell from a technical standpoint to the naked eye though i dare say its quite quite unimpressive save for specific instances like glasswater reflections on my gtx 1060 i played it like 20 years ago at highest settings 640x480 resolution and 30fps i wonder why they dont mix rtx with quake 2 xp promoting winamp while keeping vlc media player as a default app to open music 1540 ranger character blasphemy d im hoping someday theyll give the n64 version of quake 2 the same treatment i played this on ps1 back in the day obviously wasnt as good as the pc version but 14 year old me didnt give 2 fucks but this looks insane unfortunately only have a 970 so ill have to wait to play it with this lighting hopefully theyll implement this on the first quake too which i did play on pc other classics like rise of the triad and hexen would be great to see also although i dont think that hexen was real 3d i cant wait for a doom 3 ray traced remake rtx on 100 fps rtx off 1000 fps because its a cap ill wait for rtx2 that wont cost 1200 to run q2 below 144hz this looks crap ray tracing makes it look worse half life rtx cant wait for halflife 1 rtx sonic mayhems q2 ost is most gorgeous and epic game music ever made looks washed out 50 of q2 atmosphere is lighting at this point can we officially say nvidia has failed with the 20 series what next fallout 2 rtx honestly i think i agree with alex it does look better without texture filtering it is a very nice tech demo but it honestly looks worse with ray tracing on system shock with rtx it will be a bad ass as a long time quake fan this gave my boner a boner shame i cant afford the 1000 card to make it happen for me oh well mod community please update the monster textures its killing me gl looking better than software yes i was just thinking that the blind needed more representation in youtubecreators id loved the music in this game id love to see what rtx does with deus ex revision what do they want to say with that video this game looks superugly in 2019 all this light improvements dont make it look better maybe i just dont get it nvidia needs more rt power in there next cards more power why do people think things look amazing just because they are new this looks like crap i actually like the xp version the most to be honest i feel like rtx is kind of a really hardware intensive gimmick like hairworks or ubersampling its going to be a long time before people can use rtx for a reasonable value the minecraft mod blew my mind this meh looks flat boring and just unappealing compared to even the opengl quake most of the time how do you resist the urge to respond to comments that dont get it i want incubation quake 3 arena and red faction with this oo i would love to see a quake 1 rtx ive always been a console gamer i collect old vgs the best ways ive found to play q2 on console is the 360 version bundled in q4 and the ps version in a dreamcast via bleemcast not as good as the pc new engines but good to know theres 2080 rtx for 450 where i live i saw it can do sli is it enough to play in 4k 60fps with normal games is the sli really good i understand the benefit of rt but i prefer the old dark one not out of nostalgia never played quake but rt version look like a neon colored mustang note even in windowed mode it scales with sli game demos you mean pirated games thats all we have these days its great to see that after all these years 22 actually people talking again about q2 got a i5 9400f and rtx 2060 gaming pc now bought quake 2 downloaded rtx and get 4060fps at 1440p with high gi and caustics with resolution scale at 70 looks lovely on my 200hz native 50hz 4k tv rather good showing he means shit actually imagine a vr demo featuring a fully path traced house of mirrors with accurate reflections no df im not buying an rtx card call me crazy but vkpt looks better artistically software mode looks richer i dont blame alex for preferring to play old games without texture filtering cool i hope they make a tech whereny all games includeing dos 2d games ones can have ray tracing nice graphics shame about the frame rate 2530 honestly this is roughly the framerate at which i played through quake 2 in software mode on my 133mhz desktop in 1997 22 years later i can do it with nicer lighting holy shit 24 min video on a 20 year old game this is so cool nvidia taking an hardware agnostic software slap rtx api calls to make it proprietary no thanks give me some something that is an open standard but the thing is it its on a 20 year old game why not something newer like doom 3 halflife 2 splinter cell thanks for showcasing how cool this tech is seems like everyone loves to bash this stuff just because its bleeding edge tech but ive been having a lot of fun with it this technology is not for q2 make mod for q2 with geometry which will utilise this technology those three windows that q2 has are not good enough for ray tracing or better yet forget about ray tracing just make some good q2 mod that is such loos of time and effort to show oh look how cool q2 looks with raytracing anywa you have some other game too so how old are you because you are running out of time to raytracing them all last time i played this msn zone was still around wait so i have to buy a 500 video card to play a 22 year old game at 1080p at 60 or less fps so its still rtx on fps off it looks nice but the lack of high polycount on the environment make it look old let see how rtx runs on a more modern engine say crysis using ray trace 5fps on a 1500 machine with a 500 video card too bad crytech didnt make a raytracing version of crysis waiting for project scarlet video something ive been thinking about a lot of scenes in q2 rtx can have upwards of 30 shadowcasting lightsources effecting a scene at a time while having a minimal effect on the framerate scenetoscene on the other hand using modern realtime shadow mapping to light the same scenes would incur a significant performance hit per shadowcasting light since generating a shadow map essentially means rerendering the scene a light occupies from another perspective this wouldnt mean anything for q2 since the scenes arent very complex and could be rendered a thousand times over per second on modern hardware but for newer games i think this could mean that using dxrpath tracing could quickly not only be an option that produces higher fidelity lighting but also a more performant one in a hardware generation or two so with my gtx 1080 i could possibly achieve roughly 40 fps at 720p still i dont think there are enough titles released to make rtx worth it yet it still is a very small handful of games that support ray tracing i might as well wait until next year or so the reflections are greatly overexaggerated in many areas plus the original game was not meant to be pitchblack when in the sewers add rtx support to gtx 1050 good analysis but i dont see any noticeable improvements in rtx under the hood im sure theyre there but my eyes say meh wow aint a pc gamer but great stuff would be nice to see and play this game again on the xbox one x maybe this is the place to ask google aint giving any results is there any ps3xbox360 game that made use of subsurface scattering or is it even possible on those machines i was watching the ps3 kara tech demo mahn does it look plastic in todays standard his put on american accent is so damn cringe inducing yes and after 22 years you figure that we respectfully would have gotten some sort of remastered quake 2 with updated polygons and textures then you put the rate race on there then ill be impressed so this was the big thing for rtx the whole ray tracing thing and only thing they can get it to run on is a 20 year old game what a bitter disappointment i guess if you like fpss now all someone needs to do is take any of the ultima classics and add rtx into them then i will upgrade my useless gtx 1080ti d with some decent iteration of an rtx card artisticly speaking quake 2 look perfect and the best at gl3dfx render but the light tracing tech is exciting as hell before you play be sure no set maximum pre rendered frames to 1 in nvida control panal for quake and disable steam overlay it will get rid of the juddering effect people are impressed but how funny is it that nvidias rtx tech needs to fall back to such old ass games in order to actually be properly implemented where the tech can make enough of a difference that its actually noticeable though im not complaining too much as i wasnt foolish enough to pay the early adopter fee ill just watch youtube vids and wait for real time ray and path tracing to reach the point at which its not a gimmicky nvidia gameworks sideshow what the f i was just watching quake ii df retro review when i noticed that this video has been uploaded just a few hours ago and this tech demo proved me wrong realtime ray tracing isnt just a gimmickthe lighting is just astonishing my 1080ti is crying she begs me not to try she doesnt want to become a 720p card its an insult to her existance oh poor thing id like to see the sims 3 or 4 with rtx not impressed was expecting more time to dust off my original quake 2 cd i never thought quake 2 could look this amazing goddamn i love this game so much good video well done alex i like the deeper dive on some new tech looks like nvidia publicitybuy a rtx ehh not really that incredible looks like something that would be accomplished with just standard lighting techniques on modern games with all sorts of light sources and reflections rtx is awesome here not so much terrible gamethanks for sharing video its all a bit gaudy can it run crysis is dead long live can it run quake ii rtx first unreal would be a great candidate for ray traced lights 2508 probably likely i feel the next gen of rtx through 7nm will double the rtx cores perfect dark with raytracing the raytracing is so good and the game is sooooo bad why didnt they do quake 1 or doom id always rather play quake 1 over quake ii is there any wayany plans to use this mod with the first game the technology in still astounding nonetheless while i still prefer the original release from an artistic and aesthetic standpoint its really funny seeing a 22 year old game become a hardware pusher once more all atmosphere is lost utterly useless tech demo next they need to release an rtx version for the original riddick game why not duke nukem of all these latest modern games it takes a 22 year old behemoth to keep my rtx 2070 at 99 usage all the time nailed that intro ogg music support may be on the way httpsgithubcomnvidiaq2rtxissues4issuecomment500053142 amazing game the campaign is excelent i hopefully in the future support the original ost nothing i havent seen in other games these guys are so far up nvidia ass hey df are you proud to be sponsored by the logitech g935 headset thanks ive been waiting for your review on q2rtx im experiencing this on my gtx 1080 720p low gi at 30 to 40 fps the cheap way but so inspiring anyway bisous it looks pretty shit man thankfully consoles will be getting ray tracing at least the tech has a chance to be optimised now cant wait for amd to make free tracing almost everyone rt cores are waste of money quake rtx hold my beer nothing beats quake ii on the n64 especially with ultrahdmi the music is amazing only works with rtx cards 2145 im not alone in this world alex also still uses winamp the orange color palette 1333 fits so well i mean the original rtx setting is ok but quake ii is set in the stroggos planet a planet similar to mars raytracing will make games look better because it streamlines the artistic process faking and baking what can be tweaked in real time with rtx here eats up manhours that could be spent creating better assets and environments 0042 you forgot nine inch nails bro gta savciii fully rtx now looks like a wonky unity game the pause button is a great feature it renders the scene tech no art fart art direction and aesthetic sacrificed at the altar of ray tracing i feel like an oldie but a lot of these modern rendering techniques and systems really do nothing for me im not impressed at all since it always seems to homogenize everything and takes away some of the craftsmanship from the artists plus i really dont think the cost performance and monetary is worth it for the results ive seen from other rtx games honestly if quake 2 tanks the fps of a 2080 ti how in sweet hell is the xbox scarlet and the ps5 gonna do ray tracing lol digital foundry the 2kliksphillip of rtx this is the video i wanted good job that other one you guys released the other day was absolute garbage i dunno i think you deserve your own channel youre clearly leagues above the other two clowns in the quality of the content you make i feel like a reality check is needed here i was fortunate enough to win an rtx 2080 in a raffle at work and it replaced my dependable vega 64 so ive been experiencing the wonderful world of ray tracing for the past 4 months including the quake 2 demo are we really getting excited about rudimentary ray tracing being added to a twenty two year old game alex i appreciate and respect your enthusiasm and technical knowledge but dfs fawning over the extraordinarily unremarkable ray tracing weve received on an equally extraordinary expensive generation of gpus is becoming mildly nauseating folks the reality is that anyone that shelled out the cash for an rtx card based on the promise of it just works ray tracing got ripped off if i had dropped 800 on an rtx 2080 instead of winning one for free i would feel like the biggest asshole on the planet could we all please stop being astounded by visual elements that are barely noticeable in real gameplay nvidia ow neat but nothing will ever beat seeing quake 2 on a 3dfx voodoo 2 card while playing online multiplayer for the first time ever quake 2 was shit why does this feel like a sales pitch im fairly confident i would much rather play and enjoy vanilla quake ii rather than quake ii with lighting i wont ever appreciate 10fps on a 1070 thats it not much of a differenceprefer the original didnt quake 2 have a demo recorder you could record gameplay and play it back in engine later or was this bf2 onwards playing this on a gtx1080 i am playing it at 800 x600 with gi at medium and get around 50fps but it can drop down to 30fps in some situations on the one hand the low resolution doesnt look good but the lighting and reflections are amazing even though i am playing it on such a low res it does feel kind of amazing to be able to play a game fully raytraced so the only time ray tracing can work really well with current gen rtx cards with good fps is when its on a 22 year old game got it im curious to see if a 22 year old game can run more than 1080p 60 fps with ray tracing something like 1440p 100 fps would be nice quake 2 xp still the best remaster rtx looks like serious sam hd making quake 2 appear to be in ancient egypt instead of an alien world and q2xp runs on any gpu with shader model 3 edit just a joke in times where sonymicrosoft wants us to embrace 4k resolution nvidia wants us to go back in to the future where the target resolution was 720p coming from someone who still target and plays happily in 1080p can the berserker quake 2 mod and rygels texture pack be run with this does it even make sense playing this with a 2060 at 1440p with 80 resolution scaling averaging about 5060fps global illumination set to low everything else is on looks great if a bit blurry so its definitely playable on smaller scale rtx cards i had to turn gi off on my gtx 1080 but it still looks amazing some aspects of the improved lighting are retained i am getting fps mostly in the 40s at 1440p with a 50 resolution scale under ubuntu linux 1904 with all other settings on awesome video turning global illumination completely off can get you decently playable frame rates on a 1080ti at lower resolutions it greatly affects the look of the game though quake 2 rtx is stuck halfway though in the sense that raytracing is in place but the textures could be much better leaving a washed out visual impression maybe modders will build on top of the current rtx mod to realize its full potential the original looks better though what person that has a 2080ti games on a 1080p monitor though alex whats the likely scalability of this across newer titles as the polygon counts increase whats the expected relationship to gpu load now they will reprocess old games with hdr and make more money i am currently running on a potato with integrated graphics dead motherboard so stuck with laptop i am not even going to attempt this i would probably get 1 frame a minute or worse if it even ran at all is it me coz i like the original best i dont remember which game but i played a few games where i just sat in a corner and shot with fireballs to see the lighting it was so fun but this was a normal game not a new raytracing game what iam trying to say is you can get the same effect with devs effort it will not be real time but when playing you will not really see a difference raytracing is a nice technology although not ready atm but i dont see the point of it the difference is really small but comes at a very big performance cost dont forget the raytracing games dont even use raytracing for everything just for specific stuff cause there is not enough power for it thats why i would like if the fanboys could actually stop hyping this bf metro or quake i dont see a difference and i probably wouldnt know it you wouldnt tell me would love to see l4d2 rtx my gtx 1070 in 540p with gi on low 4550fps i played this on 4k highest setting with 1080ti10fps max at 1080p max out15fpx and at 720p max out 25fps i had a feeling the global illumination setting was controlling how many bounces were computed this tech is truly amazing it allows nonartists to make realistic art cant wait to see the fuckton of remasters when path tracing becomes mainstream after playing minecraft with path tracing for awhile its shown me how important realistic lighting shadows and reflections are im super excited for the future software opengl the red piss filter is awful also opengl originally messed up the texturing lowering its detail is there an rtx build with the original textures intact not a fan of those hd textures at all not particularly impressed to be frank the old fashion light maps actually look pretty good and the light bounce that everyone seem to like so much quake 2 actually baked the bounce into the light maps via radiosity but they stop doing that in quake 3 arena because they notice people like the hard edge lighting of quake 1 better lol overall it looks different but not noticeably better at least not noticeably enough to justify the frame rate drop nor the cost of an upgrade while on steam quake 2 doesnt have its music or use a newer engine lol bethesda i hope that everyone will be happy with next generation nvidia graphics cards because this one is far from perfect i wanna see hard reset with rtx and path traced lighting i feel like that game would be really good with it you say were one gpu generation away from this being fully playable to the masses i doubt that this game kills topoftheline modern hardware even though its assets are over 20 years old are lowpoly and lowresolution and feature none of the modern gaming expectations like deformable environments or complex ai or a large open world that also tax the hardware there are games that pick their spots over what ray tracing features to use like bf5 and tomb raider but modern games that can turn them all on and be playable there are none and there wont be for a long while how does it handle volumetrics ive messed around alot with raytracing on things like blender and volumetrics often add minutes to hours of render time hey running this in software reminds me of playing the first quake on a 486dx33 it shouldnt have run but it sort of did if the occasional drop below 1fps can be considered running i would have expected resolution changes to have less of a performance impact given the dedicated raytracing hardware on rtx but i dont know much about that stuff didnt think i would be buying quake 2 in 2019 playing on 2080 what a quality video about quake 2 thanks i got quake 2 running on madrake linux back in the day using loki game ports watching a rocket fly down a corridor and lighting up the walls was the most memorable memories of quake 2 more memorable than getting it to run on linux as i said before berserk mod looks a lot better than this i hate how the weapons look in rtx quake 2 is meh it was going to be its own game but they decided to piggyback off of quakes success if you want to play a real classic masterpiece dl the original and install the darkplaces mod q1 with darkplaces is still phenomenal today runs in stunning 17fps on my 1080 ti of all the games to remaster for pc why quake 2 doom 3 or quake 1 would be more impactful alex is high on giga rays again will upgrade my 1070 once the 2ndgen rtx cards come around whenever that may be unless ofc amd do something better im thinking about getting a copy of quake ii just to see how the rtx things go hopefully the 2070 maxq would fare better than 2060 is this available to buy tbh i think rtx is an utter failure if this cames out on ps5 ill buy it for sure am i the only one who still prefers the original and xp version the most that really whips the llamas ass could you please upload a gameplay video comparing the default q2 rtx settings with the quake2 lightninglike rtx settings as shown in 1545 thanks given this uses ray tracing for direct lighting as well as global illumination its pretty much a worst case scenario for gtx cards maybe intentionally so it would be interesting to see how much performance could be gained back on all gpus by rasterising a direct light pass and saving ray tracing for bounce lighting you missed the rtx2060 its the entry level rtx card very nice dive guys great job on this one i cannot wait till they put rtx in pong and i get 4 fps on my 1070 make sense to spend 1200 to play this beauty so this is why people paid 1000 for a 2080ti on release wow i average about 45fps at 720p with medium raytracing with 2 gtx 1080s in sli nice that it supports multigpu and about 5x faster on a single 2080 ti at the same settings its very pretty and very technically impressive but considering even the most powerful consumer card on the market is having to make concessions to show this off i think itll be another gpu gen or two before its a decent value proposition as far as gaming application goes once its viable to do this 4k 144hz with hdr itll be amazing although the most impressive applications seem to be relatively simple visual styles without much texture noise to bring attention to the lighting for photorealism we might just be creating yet another contour to the uncanny valley as far as world space lighting goes 1727 shouldnt there be some intensity variations visible somewhere and the light fades a little slowly oo 335 yes exactly me too textures seem to have taken a hit in the rtx version or arent playing nice with the the new lighting system the traced lighting looks good but the games structure and textures clearly werent designed with it in mind honestly just artistically the 1997 version looks the best but turning off the sun makes the game suddenly look like an uprezzed version of the 1997 game so i guess the problem was actually that the game was using too many lights for what traced lighting needs to achieve the desired effect im still excited for the tech but it just shows me that tech is no substitute for artistic vision now heres a question the raytracing is awesome but how on earth do you fuck up the weapons and textures so bad i cant wait for the day when devs are bragging how many bounces their game can achieve milkdrop continues to make winamp the best choice in music playing still feel like unreal 1 wouldve been a far more interesting fit for the rtx gi even with the dynamic colored lighting q2 had it still always felt far too stylized with its lights while u1 was always over the board with its lights and reflections it seems like there just arent enough ray tracing cores to make this feasible it should be so that ray tracing didnt lower the framerate because it was calculated by separate cores not affecting the rest of the gpu but as soon as you turn ray tracing on it looks like that part of the gpu is becoming a huge bottleneck the rest of the games graphical elements really spoil the experience though hes dead jim lol love it after ray tracingnext step is simulation realitysrnvidia gonna be the first one to get their next that was a sick intro nvidia is waiting for amd on their gpus ray tracing so nvidia can keep gonna competition and slaughter more amd hopes stillcome on amdits not hard to be fast on ray tracingnvidia is first and will continue go faster and faster until everyone get into simulation reality next why not gtx 1660 time for amds open source solution hopefully with the upcoming navi cards for better performance really kicking the llama there huh built with the help of community efforts and open source work locks it so it only works on rtx gpus removes any mention of vulkan that it runs on plasters nvidia branding on it everywhere seems kinda shameless to me from nvidia edit seems it works on pascal gpus but that has to do with nvidia opened up rtx in the latest patch pretty sure it doesnt work on amd without fan hacks also the previous mod ran much faster but looked noisy seems like the denoiser and all those things are still being run on the pascal gpus crippling performance base on the versionit support only mp3 listmeaningyou need make track list config and load through it set where to find the files this game needs a rtx card even a rtx 2080 ti struggles if u want to go higher than 1080p the nvidia cucumber season cant wait for the next rtx game to come out next year maybe by the time amd has accelerated hardware nvidia will have 6 games instead of 4 games with rtx support at this rate pc can handle it nowwith 1080p and above from n64 is only 240p does no work with gogs quake 2 keep saying theres no quake2exe lol youre so irrelevant you only get one damn product to sponsor you over and over its like n64 quake and quake 2 effectsbad part isback thenits very low resolution i will completely forgo any graphical prowess so the games soundtrack stays intact is this compatible with my xbox 360 copy of quake ii 22 years i remember like it was yesterday glad i can finally play 22 year old game on a 1500 card everything about rtx crap is ridiculous the ground on the original seems made of rusty iron now it doesnt quake rtx looks shallow from all shown i acctually like the cpu accelerated one best all those very defined poligonal shapes gpu accelerated looks blurry sponsored by nvidia would be interested to see unreal 98 with raytracing this needs to be sold in an old school big box seriously if you launch the game with cladjustfov 1 in your steam launch options it fixes that fov issue thats mentioned edit in the latest update the fov issue is resolved but the fov needs to be set to 90 manually in the settings to match the original also cd music playback is enabled if you just drag the music folder from the gog version into the root of the rtx version still one of the best shooters out there meh id rather play bloodfresh supply gave up the formula 1 start to watch this as graphics of any competently made game is way more than just a simple sum of technical stuff how many direct or indirect lights polycount texture resolution i feel that bolting on ray tracing onto any game or at least to a pre2010s game would more or less completely change the atmosphere andor kill the art direction of the said game quake 2 is actually quite a good example of this while it is a technical achievement in itself in my opinion having realtime ray tracing taking care of the lighting is changing the games atmosphere way too much 720p and 60 resolution is over 40fps on a gtx 1070 why not 60 because i forgot to mess around with whisper mode settings again nvidia should make sure those settings remain untouched after driver updates that would be nice anyway it looks epic and runs well if you destroy the resolution and i say its still worth it in my opinion id be ok with 480p resolutions if every game had full realtime raytracing gi and shadows and reflections it really is impressive salty amd fanboys in comment 2140 duuuuude long live winamp my friends think its ridiculous that i still use it cant understand why a new quake game has not been done we need one my oc 2060 runs this at smooooth 43 fps being so in love with ray tracing even when it makes the game look less interesting and disregards the authored atmosphere of the original is strange it just doesnt look like quake 2 any more the lighting is more realistic but its entirely wrong for the game rtx is merely a tool and its employed incorrectly in quake 2 as a tech demo for rtx it serves a tech purpose but not an artistic one i couldnt give a shit what is happening on a technical level is the result is so visually uninteresting only old dead games can benefit from rtx lol the single most expensive consumer gaming card running a 20 year old game at only 60fps at 1080p doesnt bode well for rtx on modern games i feel a new series coming on dffutureretro original all rt is a cool tech but just look how much of q2s atmosphere it takes away omfg all versions of these game look like outdated garbage doom on switch runs circles at a choppy 30fps on all these fucking game displayed here unreal tournament 99 raytracing multi million company intense technology still doesnt look anywhere near good as quake2xp thank you for reading my gru meme would be great to know how to change all these settings lmao did you really break out winamp as a tech demo it looks gorgeous but as a quake ii remaster or retake on it it destroys the art direction completely shit headphones need rtx mod for dead space this looks terrible everything is so soft yet somehow harsh with each pixel visible raytracing is a failure at this point and time and the only reason nvidia pushed it out half baked as it is was because they had nothing else to sell people on to justify the outrageous costs of this generation of gpus the mere fact they backed down and released the gtx 1660 illustrates this point you missed to show off changing the suns angle in real time with the controller an option in the settings that really shows off how the light bounces around the room more than anything shown here 1151 bam there it is very informative video great work first looks awesome good to see rtx getting some love pffffttt doom64 is much better than quake 2 super dooper version anyways fact im not really feeling the artistic choices tbh looks kinda washed out and too grey prefer the xp version look by a long shot why bother with raytracing when you can just fake it for much less cost i really need this for quake 1 i have got 15 fps on my 2080 rtx with all fx on and 25601440 pxls so it is just not in time we need more horsepower the llama still kicks ass it looks amazing but i couldnt bring myself to play through the entire game the game has not aged well if only they had done this with the original quake instead rtx cant replace good atmosphere and despite the technical achievement i think the game just looks worse and less moody with it turned on rip winamp great so we can play 20 years old game with ray tracing did ur english speaking got better cuz u sounds different i was hoping john to do this video 2500 i like your optimism that were 1 gpu generation away we need competition in the gpu space edit after a few days playing with the dialsit now looks damn amazingand has real time ray tracing thanks digital foundry pc gaming needs a new unreal1998 or crysis2007a fantastic singleplayer gamefun gameplay with amazing graphicsthat can really show off hardware accelerated ray tracing this is admittedly pretty coolbut it changes the lighting tone and feel in the wrong directionimo i love quake234and have fond memories of running it at release we need games built from the ground up to take advantage of this truly revolutionary tech in dxrvulkan runs great on my rtx 2080butit tbh it looks better as it did in opengl back in 9798 awesome intro alex ive played half the game in this mode on my rtx 2080 its too dark found myself shooting the blaster nonstop in parts just to see my way around and the lighting didnt look anything special quake 2 is a rubbish showcase for it this is really cool i feel the same sense of wonder looking at the game with these new additions that i did 21 years ago when it came out is it just me or are they constantly mixing up ray tracing with pathtracing great cant wait for fully ray traced tetris and pacman at 720p 24 fps on my 2000 rtx gpu ooh but the crunchiness of the software rendered also looks damn good to me too bad about the framerate great video anyway why is this a thing people care about yeah but youre still just playing quake 2 which isnt actually very good so you need the shinto gate plugin kinda telling that the only game that features all the rt techniques global illumination shadows and reflections is a shooter from the 90s imagine how any modern game would run even on 2080 ti if it had all those effects yamagi is still the best quake 2 sourceport ray tracing implementation looks gorgeous rtx is dead on arrival well done baked in lighting looks objectively better 30 minutes on this shit gta v with the raytracing mod looks amazing only on pc i remember how impressed i was by the colored lighting in this game back in the day playing it on my pentium ii and voodoo 3 machine couldnt even imagine wed get this 20 years later ehh didnt look that amazing ran it at 50 resolutions at 39fps with a 1070 lol i also like to play games without texture filtering meanwhile im here playing games on my potato station 4 at 20 fps i dont get it ok so nvidias latest gpus can ray trace an ancient game and make it look kinda meh is it a feat of engineering whos going to play it its just pointless marketing frankly if they had made it playable on gtx cards it might have been relevant but as it stands just a bad advert for expensive tech i prefer the look of the original manall that beige takes me back what about software rendering on linux mesas software rendering backend should use multiple cores also what about mods like high poly and texture mods come on like this comment alex the game was impressive in the 90s but now it looks terrible even with rtx it run like shit at 4k even with a 2080ti and a i9 9900k at 5ghz you get like a locked 19fps at the highest settings it looks great dont get me wrong but it runs like dogshit nothing special still looks better then fallout 76 good old memories we need a new unreal tournament or unreal game watch on my channell how well is running on pascal gpus half life 3 in ps5vr while this is amazing i hope to see ray tracing mods for other old school fps games that are a bit more modern and still very fun to play like half life 2 for example i still loved the music from the ps1 quake game we need a new quake game for next gen when will rtx cards be reasonably affordable 22 year old game struggling at 1080p ok then yep quake 2 was a good game hey we wanted to get this video out before e3 mania kicks in at the time of writing the video encoders have hit 1080p60 but check back later for higher quality versions including the full 4k version this is remasterold classic made with path tracing true showcase where video game tech comefor me most impresive real time ingame tech i ever saw in 20 minutes speed runner finish this game speedrunner wait what is ray tracing one very small point its uper minor but i feel its deserving of a mention anyways youre comparing quake2 software rendering to quake2 rtxconsidering the advantage you allready had over quake 2 would it not have been more fair to use quake2 ogl mode or even against a client like q2max q2pro or r1q2 r1gl asus strix 2080ti and my game looks like the old school version and nothing like this video im running the newest driver as well is there a setting im missing out on so below is the minimum requirements requires a 64bit processor and operating system os windows 7 64bit processor intel i33220 or amd equivalent memory 8 gb ram graphics nvidia rtx 2060 or higher storage 2 gb available space question is isnt that some biased bottleneck requirements 1997 but can it run crysis i wish i had money to buy an rtx 2080 ti but its so expensive pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeease do quake i i will shut up and give you all the money jan van eyck would be proud of this aesthetic achievement dynamic light effect is magic with this new rtx i can conquer the gaming world rtxon holy shit this looks incredible oh they got the overexcited guy from the rtx reveal to get overexcited about this too im watching at 144p wow i can admit ray tracing tecnologhy is the best for games it looks like if you were into a real game more than games of now i hope raytrcing improves in games they can use more effects into games with raytracing and also the cost of rtx be cheaper good work for that shit i dont need a rtx card lmao id rather play q1 though looks amazing with rtx a tip for nvidia the color of the temperature is yellow try maybe with blue shadows or lightning some of this effects arent implemented into final version bfg in final game looks like crap compared to this real shame and i have a serious problem with ray tracing in this game the game is just too dark half of the time i have to play with textures turned off because i barely see anything if i dont shoot all the time to light my way yuris revenge on rtx please 16k ultrawide 648 screen with hypersunglasses and 4th level gaming chairs my voodoo 3dfx hold my beer v need ray tracing on unreal 1 its like new tech but like now waiting for games to run it in rtx but is it i want the present of raytacing years before rtx otoy realtime pathtracer brigade 3 httpsyoutubefbgm66dcwok amd realtime pathtracer radeon rays httpsyoutube4nsospayxks imagination first pathtraceing gpu powervr wizard httpsyoutubeuxe2sydhftq nvidia is late to the party this game is so awesome it is so fast but with those rays wow can you raytrace your mics also i cant see my weapon in ultrawide monitor please redo battlefield 1942 looks like a realistic minecraft texture pack why cs go no ray tracing one of the oldest multiplayer shooters is used to show best possible graphic so in 2041 rtx cards will be strong enough to play 2019 games wow showcase that they can make glass in game e p i c this was easily one of my most favourite and highest influence in my training in fps games growing up besides duke nukem 3ddoom and wolfenstein this was my go to until it didnt go anymore bring it back with all those wicked mods and let the quest for the almighty frag live on d nice effects someone is remaking unreal 1 the first 3 levels using unreal engine 4 with rtx httpsyoutube0dryzbhjhu great work well this could support i guess nvidia geforce 156 why theres no such effects in release version hmm it looks so good guys its like i wanna eat the graphics its not the real effect of ray tracing coreywiniatawhat would be the amazing purpose what do you smoke ray tracing is weak but the rtx are much weaker how much money wasted do quake 1 now i remember being addicted to this game played into the early hours of the morning feel some late nights comming on with this amazing revamp great memories ray tracing is really going to be the definitive standard for gaming in the future or even now good that they adopted idea first from year 2016 yquake2 then from q2vkpt but i honestly like that they keep doing things why is the release of the graphics worse than in the video going back to 90s again thanks nvidia the sky was meant to be red the atmosphere of the planet reflected different light than the earths that was part of the plot may be it was it that made the stroggos so aggressive so released demo does not look as good no shiny meta surfaces for example what the fuck in 10 years time people might be playing fully ray traced games in 4k vr at 120fps perhaps on their phone streaming it over the internet i envy people of the future this would look exactly the same if it was built in a nonraytraced deferred renderering pipeline and would perform better lol rtxon childhood game with rtx insta buy now that its out what happened to the particle simulation with flow when ur pc is 5 yrs old ands its soo old because you cant afford a new one light and smoke effects are amazing thank you but i am already pretty happy with this glide technology from 1995 giveaway mine dont look that good 2070 dont know why looks washed out help unfortunately the final demo released today does not look like what is seeing here so nvidia lied again well not gonna buy their products ever again oh you guys up to ultra wide it what settings did they use i cant get the same lighting fugging marketing shiece why not a quake 2 remake with new levels lol rtx is the shiet a quaker hides his gun theres literally no difference rt is a total scam rip turing failed technology graphics are better than the game itself quake 2 was meant to be another game and they just put the quake name on it wish we got a proper sequel to the fantasymagic inspired quake 1 if i can see i can figth loads bfg 10000 this game was created to sell graphics cards please make a demo with unreal 98 wow amazing how good a game can look with better textures wait whas that not the point you know with with out compare apple with apple love nvidia everything is super bullshit i would like to see the game shadow man with rtx cant wait to try this out with rtx 2070 i want this on ps 4 im a big quake fun i have all quake games on ps 1 ps 2 i want this quake on my ps 4 this legit makes me want an rtx card can this be done with duke nukem 3d the original looks better imo less realistic but better 101 no player in the mirror so i guess this will be free to all rtx owners congratulations nvidea back this game that was part of my life thank you i wonder if quake gets some game content extensions after this refresh restart i definitely will pay money if they get throught with story and gameplay like wolfenstein and doom with invicible character just play real paintball you wont believe the realistic light rays and reflection even the paint ball hitting you in the neck felt so real and painful thats so beautiful looks good but nobody play late 90s can it run quake 2 2019 can it run quake 2 is it a new remastered version of quake 2 or just quake 2 running with ray tracing rat tracing hdr yawn current rtx cards are a shame you pay a big price for a card and cant use it in actual games i own a rtx 2070 and the card cant handle any titles with rtx on thank you nvdia and you have bad framtimes and not working drivers ok but when is the skyrim rtx coming ill buy this if its sold in a classic pc big box genius marvelous pure natural beauty now i can just buy an rtx system to enjoy virtual nature at 8am morning nvidia hey we have this new technology everyone else what can it do nvidia make 90s games look reasonable lets add rtx to minecraft and some old af game because the performance is dismal and aaa titles refuse to really support it well done nvidia clap why is new quake not why is the old one needed i dont understand only the light because of effects who cares you still cant interact with this environment still cant damage walls still cant put dents in things chip away at some stairs blow off a tile from the ceilings its still nothing more than a boring environment comprised of static imagery whoopdidoo it would be cool to see the old school tomb raider games with the rtx featured turned on when can we purchase the full version take my money no tricks this is actual real talking about virtual game put my phone to max brightness still cant see shit lol doom 64 please fck the beauty return to castle wolfenstein deus ex quake 4 half life fear max payne system shock 2 thief gold please remake all these with rtx thnks 3 but can rtx run on crisis is the better question does it remove the wobbling effect on 3d models bring back the arena q3 champions flat out sucks very cool not that impressed was going to come sooner or later rtx really didnt do that a redesign of quake 2 did that oh my nv quake ii aaahhh or phuuu you are 20 years to late sorry no way man that looks good thats nice still not paying a small fortune for a new gpu certainly not to replay quake ii with nicer lighting etctry a bit harder with your next line of gpus guys maybe give us some actual value for our money guys far cry 1 with rtx please do that d i can imagine woooow this is for all the pricks who bought 1k graphic cards to put there vigilance to sleep no new games yeah rtx wow super amazing lets play it wow 2019 quake 046 this is amazing graphic look at the order 1886 on ps4 from 2015 you pricksthis is the graphic httpsyoutubexljpc5j3i7i i think nicole kidman was rtxd shes not the same anymore definitely more features though pacman with rtx plsadsasda vanilla quake 2 and rtx quake 2 ofcourse giant difference but present games difference is very little do something for diablo 2 ah nividia the snake oil salesmen next up ati remakes unreal 1 using to showcase the new radeon series they use 22 years old games for rtx becouse new ones will not run smooth with it its easy to show new technology on games wich run 240fps 1520 years ago the character is not being reflected on on the mirror not the gun this is the definition of expensive go super mario bros with rtx plz so strogos is now a beautiful sundrenched paradise planet well that completely changes the mood of the game all this time the future was in the past at last patch for quake2 after 20 years at the start the glass looks like ice on the water shut up and take my money any amount of it to get childhood memories back using old tech to show the new ignoring 25 years of innovation for graphics idiots how often do you stick a box on your head and poke holes in it this is why this ray tracing is doa the ground and wall textures look the same i wouldve thought theyd have been improved a little underwhelming but the possibilities are exciting will this work on the original cdrom copy that i have haha awesome its almost 16x the detail imagine et the video game with this technology amazing lol whos the salesman on stage with the programmer gtx1080 could do this easy without activating a fan this is the law of physics applied to gpu performance how can people dislike all this nfs underground i ii with rtx or unreal with rtx d i dont like how insanely bright the sunlight is when he looks outside in that one hall area all you see is pure white ya but can it run crysis waste of resources and time make better games radeon vega 54 best of the best lol how long has this rtx started replacing surface textures and shaders make tetris with this rtx technology can this work on need for speed underground2most wanted and carbon they should do unreal 1 now yeah hurry up with 3000 series on 7nm please oh well at least theres gonna be 1 game you can play at 4k 60fps with rtx on i want to play in this where can i pay quake masterrace 123 wtf someone is pointing their spotlight through that door i cant see shit can we download and play this version of quake 2 i loved that game and it looks amazing with this lighting wheres half life with rtxxxxxxx well looks like dogshit to be honest sure there are better things that show off the rtx capabilities than this sigh just afuckingmazing great old classic with new engines and graphics is just so i have no words to describe better than almost all new crap available now to play if they wanted to do show how greate rtx raytrace is they should use mmo with lots of effects like a raid fight and show before and after that will let us see a real raytrace from all those effects and how fast will it run if it will run beautiful work vice city pls looks fake everybody knows the sun in stroggos isnt that bright when will we get an actual q u a k e game with this graphics q u a k e l i v e r t x motherfuckers a round of applause for green lighting that looks fairly similar to what the sega saturn could do is it only me or this is actually not impressive it looks far from realistic my mouth was wide open from start to finish no one show joe rogan hell faint lol edit hell lose his shit please do this to quake 1 please we are actually lucky as we lived the beginning of videogames with their splendid limits as in 10 years photorealism will be the normso in the future they will look back to ours time as where all beganso we are so lucky in this respect where to download it not impressed but im no expert imagin quake 4 with ray tracing resident evil 4 with rtx pls a leisure suit larry br game called leisure suit larry 69 with ray tracing bethesda ruined it we have glass to reflect everything surrounding it cant see yourself in mirror lolol two words jedi knight that would pump up mods like movie battles to new heights also unreal 2k4 guys seriously edit ok fuck it where can i download this is honestly a huge step in graphics id really compare it to the jump from 2d to 3d models back with the nintendo 64 maybe a little bit of anti aliasing or antistropic filtering on it man this makes me wanna sell my kidney for an 2080ti video about nothing rest that qubish 15 polygoned quake2 alone wana make real good quality test go quake 4 where is much more polys bended surfs and effects and i dont get it this guy first time saw such graphic its prety old fuck rtx nobody needs 650 watts big box with 3 coolers for a fucking reflections nobody playes quake 2 with graphics everybody using picmip fuck rtx 2k bucks videocards this and the minecraft stuff has me pretty sold on rtx but what about quake 1 just imagine unreal gold with this setup the whole singleplayer story would be amazing everything looks good except the fact that imho they should not change color scheme are we there yet too easy comparing raytracing with the old quake engine this would be amazing in thief they do know that quake 2 is meant to be gritty and disturbing right why make it all sunshine and rainbows it be a sunny day on stroggos they should do this with half life 1 can we just add raytracing to all old games half life 2 rtx lol floating gun in 023 has no shadow even tho the light comes straight from above this detail must be updated visualization of the graphics looks better than quake 1 this game is so intense i had lots of fun with my friends playing but i sad that i dont have rtx series graphic card cant believe its a 1997 game someone pls do it for the elder scrolls series rtx is unnecessary stupid look at what crytek did same god damn visual effects with none of this rtx bullshit it cant get any better best remaster ever done 1010 would spend money on quake ii again holy shit could action quake 2 be a thing again aq2 rtx want to redo every game with rtx on this just means well be able to run a game with rtx at 1080p 60 painkiller rtx very cool i would really love to see this done for quake 1 as well that would look amazing the atmosphere is so moody oh may god i want this so bad plz dont modify the soundtrack plz pls do doom and heretic as well please make a new quake series rebooting the strogg story with quake strogg invasion quake strogg homeworld use better engine gameplay make it more immersive realistic like a call of duty game please make the bfg to be like in quake 2 and shoot out beams at enemies etc fire a bit slower so you can enjoy the lighting i prefer before efects like everybody its better to see the enviroment like see one stupid light crosshair is spoiling everything why dont you add some good old laser pointer it will be more realistic and more practical espesially for applying and demonstrating the rtx capabilities thiss not game quake 2 looks cool hope i can try quake 2 i made pizza tonight like i mean from scratch we talkin straight up home made blazin pizza dough from the motha truckin sctatch slapped sweet tomatoe sauce on that girl then some tomatoesthin slices suckah fast graded chedah cheese baby and for finally 16 slices of peparoniii they need a 22 year old game to do 60 fps with rtx on make a blade runner game with that captures the original 1982 vibes with rtx lighting amazing now do it with duke nukem 3d ray tracing on crysis so we can melt peoples computers once again when is this releasing i really want to play it since i dont have any rtx games besides minecraft with path tracing xd using an nvidia rtx 2060 6gb 3 quake ii was amazing when it first came out be nice to see a modern update thats epic just remake old games with modern graphics thats all i need need more rtx porn all this shit could be faked with 0 or almost 0 difference and 10x performance dude last week i was thinking about a project of photoreallistic quake ii and there it is even nvidia doesnt really know what has in his hands this is a milestone in computer graphics where can i get this edition oh my god i want this game how can i get it the amount of time i spent playing qii is insane but i regret nothing also this looks amazing now with unreal gold please am i the only one that thinks this looks like shit very moody maybe for sunday brunch it looks amazing but it doesnt fit the quake 2 grit rhyme at all it now looks like a serious sam game instead this is badass my computern will not be able to run it ever but i can still dream of having even a decent computer can you turn off on rtx glass which reflects everything you mean mirror right glass reflects everything exscept player ray tracing lol i want halflife black mesa remake and halflife 2 cinematic mod with rtx actually requires newer models animations textures for it to be successful actually this does look bad at all but with newer stuff 10 times as better i just heard joe rogan cum his phanny pak what about the new unreal tournament i would love to see rtx added to it the funny thing is is that despite it looking pretty its still not even close to realistic halo 2 remaster please most of this look can be achieved without ray tracing and cost way less hardware resources im still not sold on this ray tracing thing being worth it for games now or in the near future if it can save developers time and labor from programming light maps then that would be a tangible gain but ive seen mods to quake 2 that achieve the same aesthetic without this technology feels too early to make this technology available to the consumer market but hey if they can rope in a few dopes to pay for it more power to them oh no not bethesda someone keep them away from quake before they come up with some sort of cool innovative pay per rocket plan god i loved quake 2 now i want this am i the only one whos not impressed at all whene need for speed underground ii give active rtx ryse with rtx sweet now fix the goddamn quake champions so it can get out of beta and actually be the awesome game this series deserves mu computer could not run quake 2 then turns out it cannot run it now should have done doom 3 atleast then the gun would have a body in the reflections xd so when is this game coming for xbox waiting for adding this feature to halflife 2 the bfg was incredibly underwhelming compared to the original i really hope these demos give rise to practical use of ray tracing in games sooner rather than later id much prefer this lighting in something like id fps games than i would any other graphical element being achieved in more modern games like weve been seeing please tell me were getting off the subject of resolution and framerate for a change so does ray tracing include volumetric shadows ive seen the realtime volumetric lighting in the ue4 subway demobut of course the 1stperson player character has no reflection and therefore i think casts no shadow either old quake visuals fits the original game better oh my god i came 3 times from such rays where to carry money urgently want to give all i have for video card rtx i am willing to even sell your house just to enjoy the rays of rtx in this game oh my god huang yes yes yes yes more more i love it buy your entire stock of cards if we cant use it well with todays games why not one from a couple generations ago nvidia rtxit just works on 22 year old games wonder why they dont use new games played q2 long enough to see that bfg not splashing the player to be suspicious great now how about making a good game too source code for learning i know they wouldnt do it but it would be great if they did an hd release of the first three quakes with these graphics onto consoles how do you even pull that off did the rtx just use its deep learning to upgrade the fuckin engine or something carmack would be proud yes not many will buy it now but this is like the formula 1 todays tech always feels out of reach but it will trickle down and be standard in most devices like the seatbelt which was futuristic when it was introduced cant wait for quake 3 and rtcw rtx showcase i usd to make multiplayer maps to halflife 1 a counter strike 16 back in 2005 rtx is my new waifu is this available as a patch id like to play freecell with this card what a surprise the game looks nicer with modern graphics technology its not ultrawide its just fucking blackbars thats i like the lighting still the best quake 105 oh so thats how glass functions i had no idea 140 wtf lol nerd listen to this shit over and over so now that i buy a pc we are going backwards and more expensive with the graphics cards fuck you nvidia my next card is amd rtx on burning burning lol this looks like shit for quake it completely destroyed the entire games look the main problem they have is that raster looks better than raytracing for games when done right not to mention every time i see rtx lighting it washes everything out while also making dark rooms way too freakin dark im still not convinced raytracing has a place in games can you do this with nonrtx cryengine 5 ray tracing or nonrtx microsoft ray tracing quake 2 looks amazing with rtx that is not the definition of beauty 115 this shit right here i hate it when you enter a cave or a corridor in games then it goes super dark after you move in a little more it gets brighter i always thought maybe it is just my pc but seeing how they allowed this in a demo maybe it is not my pc after all and devs allowed this to happen to be honest redoing old games with raytracing actually sounds pretty good so bethesda owns this technology and still skyrim and fallout look like the underside of my toe nail half life 2 next please wish they did quake 1 instead its the better game in every form damn nvidia is memeing its own product just wow a really big one no wait why is everybody so excited about this and what does he mean by no tricks its real were not faking it graphically its not that amazing and the lighting effects transparencies and bump mapping is nothing we havent seen in other games before that looked just as good and even better with inferior hardware also that bfg looks so underwhelming in this demo rogans going to cum in his camouflaged undies when he sees this why didnt they let joe rogan do the commentary looks great but i really wanted to see q2dm1 the edge is that an actual 97 map or they make a new map strogg bases look warm and inviting now someone please make this a thing i preferred the original q over q2 i wish you would done this with the original they just proved that graphics dont do better games wowthis is really interessting so many old games could profit from rtx more plssss beautiful awesome non competitive flair and bloom that only serves to distract not what quake is about if i understand correctly the normal way of rendering light is baked into the map and the shadows are fake but with ray tracing the light behaves as if it is alive literally they made you pay for a 1000 dollar graphics card for something they could just add to the game simply i think its funny that he took the time to point out that it was real gameplay and not prerendered footage but he never interacted with anything on the map what does it matter if you prerender footage or not if you use it in a controlled space with zero variables and a currently game for 2050 or when hahaha oh its beautiful wait til joe rogan sees this this is stupid we need to wait around 10 year to see a real jump not just some few lines on the processor for little lighting or bright fog just wait a little bit well i probably play it in lowest cus i need those visual for aiming why quake 2 tho this is quite awesomeare you messing around with the soundtrack because it was already perfect back when rail guns were rail guns joe i used to be addicted to quake rogan holy shit thats awesome woah rtx even increases texture resolution quake1 is better btw 1997 people thats insane also id needs to sever ties with bethesda asap i want this instead of quake champions why do i find this impressive to look at but i get no reaction from looking at modern games so when are we going to get to play this my pc froze up and heckin died rt is not hardware i dont get it i always see these effects in older games is this a way to make you justify your 1000 purchase of graphics card lmao if you want super fine details then go fucking watch a movie alright now someone make this in cry engine with their tech and compare em side by side rtx youre exclusivity is up i hope some day they bring it back quake series this game is the first fps shooter with amazing graphics no one even close but they could just do the same thing without ray tracing if they simply redid quake ii what resolution is that 1610 or anamorphic rtx is amazing tech we just need the performance overhead to come down as its too taxing to run under normal conditions how many mods were used for this april fools good one correct me on this but im sure they had to change the textures of the environment so rtx can work properly right for example the glass like this isnt stock quake 2 from the 90s right wow it runs old games fast can we see gta vice city or gta san andreas nice work old time s only feo people know whats quake means wet make everything wet and call it a reflection et on rtx next please i absolutely love old school games with ray tracing old school fps has always been a popular genre even in 2019 with games like dusk something about the blocky geometry mixed with excellent lighting is so appealing to me i know someone is out there right now trying to get this into half life i believe in you make it happen its probably not even possible but i need it after 20 years they mabey show us how good rtx on gta 4 jamie pull up that vid of quake being used to showcase the new nividia gfx quake 2 mega discord community httpsdiscordggjbcszdc im dont see anything exceptional here am i missing something holy mother of fuck fucking gorgeous question i really dont know much about pc but i just purchased a new desktop and i am trying to test it to see if i should keep it or not when i run unigine heaven benchmark on 4k ultra i got fps 573 score 1443min fps 297 max fps 1011 on stock 9900k with 2080ti gpu is oc already from alienware also i run benchmark on farcry new dawn on 4k ultra setting vsync off and i got min fps 53 average fps 64max fps 77 is these are bad results it just works no enemy characters absolutely shit if rather play packman ok i could replay this version like with no problem at all wow it would be interesting to see this in half life as well omg i would love to play quake 2 this way quake 2 is one of the game i grow up with and i remember playing it with the graphics on low on my pentium 2 laptop running windows 98 amazing how this game is used again to promote the most powerful hardware as it did back in the days simply amazing when you play the game from the beginning and i hear the radio talk and the robot saying computer update omg give goosebumps to my hands i have to play this again today please remake this game someone waiting it for switch i guess at least in q2 we can see decent fps with ray tracing in 2019 thats something at least i guess in 5 years well get some more recent games updated like half life 2 maybe how lame that they are using controllers i trust that much as i trust a nascar auto mechanic who drives a prius every rtx card should come with a modded copy of quake 2 that way customers could actually use the rtx features 140 i like how the beauty of this has almost nothing to do with computer science holy shit quake why iam not surprised at all ugly as fuck i like the pretty pictures but its getting in the way of the game seeing quake 2 run in a cyber cafe was one the first things which attracted to pc gaming a year later i got a pc with a massive 32 mb ram seeing quake 2 being used again as a tech demo just brings back so many good memories i want to see half life run this way think about how much better it would look sip quake ii was a good game son why mess around with this when you can mess around with godbot where the fuck is quake 5 someone send this to joe rogan itd better pack the ost i liveagain oh wrong game imagine unreal 1 with this give me a new quake singleplayer game already so when are they releasing that version of quake 2 please do this to quake 1 and 3 quake ii remaster when lemme guessyou have to buy new quake ii edition in order to have rtx option enabled so does this means we need to go back to 20 years old graphics just to have ray tracing at playable fps im not the only one with a boner right pretty cool stuff nvidia still not gonna whip out a grand for it you can suck me raw bfg without enemies boring we need to see a massacre quake is probably my favorite fps series this shit brings tears to my eyes i request the whole series gets this treatment quakespasm and ioquake3 are open source wink wink fucking gaytracing actually makes the game loom like shit you wont catch me buying rtx to render classic games unplayable we are not faking it proof 500 gpu to make a 22 year old game look better comparing 90s tech with 2018 technology gg nvidia this is comicaladds nothing to gameplay that was already great 20 years ago its like changing the paint on a ferrari and acting like oh now its an even more awesome ferrari xd this is the state of gaming right now the more eye candy the more people believe they will get a great game then the actual gameplay is disappointing because of all the resources focused on just visuals honestly the bfg explosion on this is pretty sad too for what the weapon does cant wait for a raytracing minesweeper add ray tracing to jedi outcast i didnt know quake and doom both had bfgs funny how the before looks better than the after wtf i had to check description to realise its a 1997 gamedamn any glass or water 100 mirror its not realistic hdr was still in half life 2 rtx is just marketing shit now i want original doom with ray tracing just another excuse to sell rtx they can do this with any graphic card i would love to see bioshock with ray tracing do quake as well this is so fucking lame it hurts its 2019 why not just remaster the fucking game from scratch at this point rather then upgrading no tricks this is actually real were not faking it if you can achieve the same results with less horse power than why not fake it nobody cares how the graphics are made as long as it looks good and runs well there are many stunning looking games out there that do not use rtx rtx doesnt do anything you couldnt do before by faking it fake it as much as you want is all im saying meanwhile im with a gt 730 its like minecraft with shaders lol i kinda had the inkling back in 97 quake 2 would be making a comeback 22 years later ray tracing is a lie maybe this is what halflife 3 has been waiting for morrowwind or haloor half lifeyes pleasei like quake 2but this looks a bit like quake 2 evolved or one of those modsdone beforemaybe not quite as nicelybut close i really want this on halflife 12 hey nvidia i have idea for another demos for rtx max payne fear doom 3 any of splinter cell halflife fallout3nw4 maybe grand theft auto manhunt dilogy i get it theyve really gone lengths to make this tech happen and it will gain traction sooner or later but nostalgia aside this is pretty mediocre just from the looks thats what we need not quake champions im sure when perfect dark zero came out as a launch title for xbox 360 13 years ago it had lighting and reflections not miles away from this funny that game continued to outdo most games visually even towards the end of that gens life cycle this quake 2 looks pretty though oh man if they could add this rtx thing to descent i and ii those games have a lot of light emitters in those levels but can also get pretty dark when theyre destroyed never mind the chit chat when can we download it mmmmmhhh that sexy microstuttering nvidia this is real footage we are not faking it bioware hold my beer overhypes anthem and launches a very unrealistic version of what they advertised sorry but as cool as it looks im very skeptical to be honest it looks an awful lot like unreal tournament now k imma bring it up why is in marsquakestrogg planet all the sudden normal earthly sunlight its supposed to be red y tho half a year tomb raider battlefield metro and quake reflects everything but the player what is the science in computer science so are they going to actually remake this game or just use it as a demonstration demo just to make more profits hmmmm i smell my childhood 3 now i cant see shit thanks so a 150000 2080ti doing raytracing only works the best on old games how i love my rtx 2060 omg nvidia made a graphic card thats only works perfect with 20 years old games honestly i think it fits more into games that generally dont require lot of power already most games already look absolutely beautiful without this technology and become absolutely unplayable once turned on this bright lighting is taking away dark athmosphere of game wtf bethesda is doing here thats pretty fucking amazing im gonna wait for the next gen cards though because atm the rtx 2000 series dont do well with ray tracing at all i want this done to minesweeper please bethesda id make this happen even with quake 1 quake 3 should be remade like thisits the greatest 1v1 game even till this daywould love to see it jesus bethesda quake team restoring faith in the company diablo team pay attention this is how you hype a crowd under selling the shit out of it and blowing people away with the result where to download i guess all the upvotes must be from console gamers who arent used to amazing graphics why am i not that impressed still looks like something that can be achieved with mods that dont use rtx tbh ok i dont see any difference between this and i guess you call it regular ambient occlusion wow thats some pretty great brown there i wonder how fallout new vegas would look with this so cool maybe 23 gens more for the gpu before it will do new games above 144 fps in 1440p so they did surgery on quake ii its pity rtx is so powerful they had to remove all enemies how many game developers will be using older game engines to utilize ray tracing in the future i hope a lot i love the aesthetics of them shut up and take my money when is quake ii hdr support coming cause that wasnt just a demowas it plz tell me it wasnt just a demo its quite funny though that alot of these things can be easily faked and have similar or better results at less performance costs we need add rtx for remaster all old games not impressed doom 2016 still looks way better it is super nice that it is not faked in any way but that does not matter to the gamer at all is it cheaper to develop this because you can save time by not faking stuff greetings if the glass is really reflecting where is the player model in the reflection this is not quake without the bfg what quake didnt have the bfg doom have dont pretend that you know quake soooo why not a release a remastered version an actual physical game kind of low quality for a 2019 graphic card would not spend a high price of 5001000 euros for such a low quality product wished more from modern cards ok so you rewrote an entire game engine for an older game to run on 700 graphics cardand get what like 45fps at 1080p the scene geometry is so low by 2019 standard i can count the triangles with my fingers i have not yet see anything running smoothly on rtx that is more complex than quake2 how about something like ue3 it will probably choke at 5fps due to complexity of all that geometrylight sourceparticles now if someone was to rewrite the q2 engine and use the latest effectshigh polycount object modelstesticlelationlighting trickery it would look way better than what the rtx we see here do and it can be ran 60fps 1080p on a mid range 200 card it may not be as accurate in terms of lighting but when you factor the speedscene complexity and special effects added it would be a nicer looking game for example look at a screenshot of rtx quake2 and battlefield v which looks nicer and from the comparison of battlefield game with rtx on it doesnt really loo doom 64 waits for them brings tears to my eyes ive never seen the greatest fps in the history of this old planet look this perfect now pls bring back ra2 i promise to sacrifice my first born to the q2 godz quake remastered is coming we need a quake series remaster thatd be cool lol ut2004and rtxand i will never need to play any other games again love seeing everyone bash first gen tech weve gotta take steps towards where we want to go this is just the start of something really exciting for computer graphics just be a little patient christoph schied was the guy who originally implemented raytracing into quake 2 yall could have at least given him a shoutout httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvrq1t93ulag 100 mark reflects everything around it still doesnt show the character model in the mirror just like current techniques brought a tear to this old quake fans eye so are they remaking quake 2 cause id love buy the shit out of that omg the childhood memories ill stick with my voodoo2 sli fallout 3 with rtx lighting holy shit i wanna run th oh its rtx quake 2 is amazing again keep it dark too much glow lightning eyecandy wont make it as good as the old one please the future is now old man not quake without the bfg quake champions nah bro ppl hate that shit yeah but why did you make the bfg purple though i hope one day every gamer gets to have rtx in there rig shakii the wolf rtx is funny how from all games to choose nvidia made a mod for quake 2 the same game with a engine with realtime path tracing made by a single guy the q2vkpt and jensen huang sounding like his company discovered the wheel when nvidias rtx failed so hard that they had to find a game from over two decades ago to demonstrate their technology properly do the railgun i cant be sold on rtx till either quake or crysis takes full advantage of it reflections in glass look cool though i have an evga 2080ti in my alienware area 51 but thus far ive not used the rtx features so im guessing a fair bit of work went into getting quake 2 to be able to use rtx would it be feasible for modders to do the same with older games that dont ever stand a chance of a remasterremake or quake was used simply because of ease of convertingcompared to less documented engines and to show a larger contrast between new and old i remember when i bought my first voodoo 2 12mb 3d graphics accelerator and switched from software rendering to opengl in quake2 that was mindblowing back in 1999 now 20 years later with rtx i can relive the same feeling once again with the same game d fake and photoshopped this needs to be done with halflife 2 source engine the new levels feel so bland haha they look great tho as beautiful as it looks they totally botched the atmosphere of the game like come on stroggos from q2 with bright warm yellow sunlight half the point is that the atmosphere of the planet is halfruined by the stroggs industrial machinery thats why the sky is all red and filled with pollution clouds when you look out into the skybox i know i know the point is to show off rtx and not the game itself but still as an avid quake 2 fan it kinda irks me xd what utter crap nvidias like so we got those cuttingedge new graphics cards that can raytrace in real time uhhh ok what games are there look at this raytracing yeah thats quake 2 look well what about other games does it work well r a y t r a c i n g user left the chat fallout new vegas with rtx its simple not over done and it works unlike the games today they fill every level with too much shit it just works crysis amateurs my pc can run quake 2 is this coming out good lord will this finally fix the terribly pixelated shadows from nonstatic objects like characters tree branches and leaves no well shove it where the sun doesnt shine then freakin noobs it removes the dark atmosphere of quake good presentation but meh 102 reflects everything around it except your fucking character how do they get the metal to reflect light and such i doubt that material was coded to reflect light when it was made in the 90s which means you would either have to change the source code of the game or you would have to go in and manually add light reflection on these surfaces why does it look so weird with black bars i already seen some old games evolving using the ray tracing and path tracing the future is now is this an out of season april fools joke wheres the complete walkthru oh wow look at the lighting now add vr as well so i can live in rtx seems like a waste of resources to raytrace surfaces that can be effectivelyconvincingly faked like metal where the reflection is so abstracted and distorted hopefully the accuracy can be heavily reduced on a perrecipient surface level though it seems unlikely i am not a game designer do that in linux using vulcan then i will be impressed also most of that can be done or faked without rtx resonably well at better frame rates so who cares i mean seriously in a esport title no one fucking cares about rtx its absolutely not relevant getting the framerate up and having a gaming monitor with adaptive syncfreesync or gsync is more relevant now in doom this may be more relevant or any other story driven game but not in a competitive game also with quake its a bit like putting lipstick on a pig my pc cant handle it yet for now this would be great to implement in the free opensource wolfenstein enemy territory multiplayer game etexe wtf is this video i mean why not make this 219 in native quake keeps on delivering cutting edge graphics wow this really looks like 1998 again nothing impressive the big problem is you could just as well fake those effects and it would look just as good with much less powerful hardware required metal and glass reflections time of day etc first few seconds was basically a guy trying to explain whats going on and then some other dude is too excited and interrupts to say keep going ironically achieving the opposite of what he wants glass reflects everything oh except the player looking into the glass is it only me who consider raytracing in games to be useless and expensive feature now so whats the deal they releasing this update coudnt they do this without rtx for better performance since i dont see why use rtx in a game where there is no day night cycle they are trying to sell rtx as a necessity when clearly it is not there are many game engines that can have the same results with lighting effects without rtx they are showcasing quake ii because that game lacked advanced lighting effects almost completely so you can see how huge the difference is modern game engines dont need rtx and they can achieve almost the same results without it i am an nvidia fanboy but it is clear that rtx is taking the same road as the direct x 10 fiasco a few years back add the huge performance cost the lack of games that support it and there you go a marketing trick ready to invade your psychology and make you think that the hardware you bought last year is obsolete cant wait for tetris with rtx on lol yeah its beautiful but thats not just the rtx this is gonna be a great remaster with all the xp content in it hope they make good use of flow as well this is such a under appreciated tech wow this is really impressive but why cant i see my body and the shadow of me im pretty sure someone already wrote a raytracing renderer for quake with everything other than volumetrics wow i fapped to this id be interested to see what a game like system shock 2 would look like with ray tracing tbh id like more the old one idk why o a video that fits my monitor o wait they rescaled it for you standard size plebs they need to mod in the character body for the player somehow and let it be reflected because being a floating set of arms is bad enough they dont also need to be vampiric and have no reflection i would like to see more classic games remastered with ray tracing my dream is getting closer sorry to inform you this is as new as 3d glasses were the 21st century raytracing is new give it up this has been done for a long time at a reduced level for rt calculations or complete scene rendering for eg cgi movie graphics which are done not obviously in rt but that doesnt make the tech new just means overall computing ability has reached the level it can handle it rather see more improvements in the graphics industry for rt fluid and particle mechanics ooooh i put a bump map upon a piece of glass magic smh i thought hl2 had these before how to make quake 2 run like witcher 3 xd selfish reasons i suppose but i would love to see this done in either mass effect 123 102 where the character himself this video proves that high poly doesnt mean shit so long as the lighting is amazing would be more excited if this was quake 1 nvidia more corporate criminals trying togouge society drop your prices you are starting to look absolutely stupid with the new rtx pricing good luck with your share prices morons better luck with all that overstock disgusting damn this is amazing lighting reflections shadows alone can make anything look more realistic i likes the look of quake ii with rtx off better ultrawide uploads in 169 seriously 026 please tell me theyre remaking quake it just works great so the best rtx can do is run a 20yr old game rtx is so realistic that it doesnt show the vampire player model in the reflection lol the lighting is cool but ive seen better artistic style and lighting come out of shit like zandronum or zdoom i like this started as a home brew project then became this there is big empty space in my life its called rtx question is when can we download it now do quake 1 now thats a good remaster half life 2 needs rtx the new goldeneye looks sweet ray trace hl do it for us nvidia 3 too bad it pretty much destroys performance in real games joe rogan has entered the chat just wonder why water and mirrors cant be semi transparent is that because cost will increase too hight it is not worth implementation thats one gooood reason im going to but an rtx videocard good glorious titles will go eternal wtf is this just a tech demo or will they remake the game whencanweplaythis up next ray tracing in minesweep d lol its like running the effects in a current gen game would freeze frame it yeah i am not getting rtx gen one people who were sold on this are suckers just consider what you are paying for thats so beautiful i want this for quake live crysis with ray tracing rtx or not it still looks like crap so when can i get this star citizen has had this tech for a while now rtx brings out the beauty in the pools of blood of your enemies i love it an old dinosaur being resurrected into a beautiful thing since its still a working progress im sure the bfg will have a much much bigger explosion on impact keep it going maybe one day well get to play it too now i wanna see it with crisis 1 its 2019 and you want me to be impressed with 1080p stop wasting my time i loved how the guy pauses after the asshole blatantly interrupts him and he just stands there staring at him for 10 seconds like mate shut the fuck up xd what a fucking tool could be do this with half life 1 or black mesa source the only game you can play on your rtx2080 at max settings without having poor fps neat and all but i would prefer if they make games that played as good as quake did back in the day instead of making games look prettier in the grand scheme of things im alone with this of course did they have to remake all the games textures to support pbr gta san andreas with ray tracing please this really just hammers home that lighting is the key part of making a game look good this is more visually appealing to me than almost all games released in the last few years easily now all we need is pong from atari with ray tracing why promote a shity game and old game coz it cant run new ones in ray tracing trash gpus crysis with rtx i want that because i want my pc to be a puddle of molten metal unreal tournament 2004 rtx with all new multiplayer servers and all the maps im now uncomfortable in my trousers gee thanks you guys 104 hmand the player how about you idiots at nvidia focus on making a card that can run 165 fps on max settings in 1440p and eventually max settings on 4k fuck wasting time on lightning and other bullshit comparing to other games that supports rtx this one is a piece of shit not so impressive amazing how unimpressive rtx is and this is coming from someone who bought a 2080 ti waiting for that quake 3 ray tracing now i want insert game title with ray tracing it would look pristine kills the artstyle i read bethesda and become instantly disapointed yeah it looks nice and all but fuck that 800 price tag for the cards lol now do the same for unreal tournament 99 still waiting for super mario bros with rtx now we get glass that reflects everything doesnt reflect player its like a unity game i finished this game 18 years ago wtf this was great nice graphicstime to buy voodoo 2 this looks like that minecraft shader mod lmao look just as boring faked lighting whats the point of rtx then not being funny or anything but im not going out to buy an rtx 2080 to play quake ii with some shitty lighting omg look at our amazing 2019 technology1111 on a game from 1997 so advanced reflective surfaces are just supposed to look wet i hope our pascal cards can run this at an acceptable framerate really want to try quake with raytracing yuck eye candy gave me cancer as a hardcore player of quake 2 at its time this thing is not good the overdose of shinny stuff and glitter and bs like that is not fitting the theme quake 2 was specially made like that with the color palette and lighting to emphasis the feeling not this nausea inducing special effects it had a dark feeling an atmosphere to feel pressure great going for making such nice ffects but use a different game maybe skyrim last great game of bethesda to showcase beauty it doesnt look leaps and bounds better than the faking it techniques currently being used by developers especially not for the price and performance hit how can it be downloaded next step would be san andreas rtx to end all those enb super ultra unreal photo realistic settings 2020 damn imagine halo 2 and 3 with this tech my mind would be blown now release it pls quake champions is dead add it to skyrim so we can buy it again what is this even about because this looks like shit new game pick out the spoilt rotten trolls in the comments quake iii arena live with raytracing at 157 and 158 you can see on the right hand side that the boxs shadow aint working on the wall rather the reflection is being seen compare it with 156 true raytracing at its best meh and again with the bfg its the same look at 207 vs 208 and 209 admit it this isnt something realistic is it wowall this could be accomplished with standard rasterisation another bullshit reason for rtx these graphics are beautiful truly looks like the future looks even better than crysis you must watch the full keynote he explains how rtx is done by accelerating integer calculations am i crazy or is this really unimpressive like the graphics are literally just better lighting look at the corners on those grates for example it isnt supposed to be cleanly cut like that and the explosion effects they look 2 d like someone edited them into the game ut2004 next please quake 2 hd remake confirmed all this technology and beauty and then come the competitive players and play with flat textures on ultra low just to see the enemies better when your shitty ass 1200 hardware can only ray trace games from 22 years ago nvidia btfo no player reflection in the glass really expensive and awesome wow that amazing me looks pretty cool also me laughing at everyone who paid for rtx card to my understanding you dont need raytracing to bring those visuals to life other than the dynamic reflections a creative and a hardcore development design team could make that with dx 10 based gpu without rtx for sure while rtx new and exiting show us something really exiting nvidia this is such bs raytracing alone does not accomplish everything shown in this video theres a lot more changes that are undisclosed besides global illumination can look as good as raytracing without being as computationally expensive if its baked in with prerendered raytracing rip quake very bad move to let bethesda to ley they dirty hands on it ill use ray tracing but not through nvidia disgusting comapny wow that lava at 025029 is just out of dees werlda wow awesome yay lava shows damuor lava but no seriously i was ray trace fan sinceforever since the beginning never understood why it was never used until now hardware but i did lots of rt renders on my 386dx back in 94 i used povray ahhhhhpovray the memories of creating beautiful 3d renders using only textmmmmmm yall milleniies dont know nothing about that those days yeah it tooks hours upon hours but the see the fully rendered image on my screenaaaahhhhhh but nowwe get it in realfuckingbonertime nice god this aspect ratio is so awful wish i could see anything up or down if only the raytracing system was open source i havent looked myself but i bet its a proprietary nvidia tech if it were open source anybody with any card would be able to take advantage of this and implement it into any game yet these companies keep the technology to themselves and prevent game graphics from getting better wasnt quake the engine the original halflife was developed on so added every graphics feature developed in games in the last 2 decades and assigning credit to rtx only wow next project pacman with rtx 011 the real mind blowing part ocarina of time now halflife might be nice to see also can they do this to the original halflife when i saw bethesdas logo i thought how did the game not crash after like 3 seconds bruh minecraft shades would look sick now that it is known that raytracing isnt dependent on rtx cards i think well see a lot more companies creating with it and it will probably get much more optimal thank goodness the first time the world has seen the true power of rt aaa games look a little better however almost anything more basic can be brought up to a very believable level even at low resolutions and with shitty textures the best way to describe it is think of an old digital photo pixelated maybe blocky however it looks real the lighting and shadows are what make it believable and are still captured and perfectly represented even if large amounts of detail are lost put real light into fake digital scenes and the brain makes it so much more real so were going back 20 years because that where the horsepower of rtx is at great ill pass quake 2 demo for rtx weve progressed and regressed at the same time can you get more than 30 fps so basicaly in order to have rtx on you have to have quake 2 level worth of polygons in order to run in 60 fps 105 shouldnt the player be visible in the mirror huh kinda funny how they pick a game that was known for its deliberately unpretty industrialmilitaryhorror sorts of environments add rtx to red faction why wasnt this uploaded in 329 dumb things like this piss me off i didnt get an ultrawide monitor so i can watch ultrawide videos with a black box around them theres literally no reason why they couldnt of uploaded this in 329 theyre a graphics company for christs sake i fucking want that remaster this change is akin to when i first played quake 2 using open gl instead of the default software rendering even for a demo this is awesome really promising for both current future even past games meanwhile crytek has done raytracing on any graphics card finally a game worth to buy a 1500 card i want rtx on the upcoming doom eternal id make it happen is it downloadable please say yes it is lol 140 befor and afterspeaker you mean no effects vs rtx with faked light it you would hardly see a difference so in every demo they show we see no effects or shitty effects vs rtxto force rtx to look good it s so poor and so sad nvida haters gonna hate but this is just fucking awesome q2 has always been an excellent game and now it looks amazing as well nice but as some others have pointed out its a shame that it took an ancient game to showcase the potential of rtx i miss quake how it was fucking quake champions ruined it all i want to play this quake ii looks just stunning never saw such great quake ii version before even berserkertis is so natural rtx is still overratedi prefere game mechanicsrich story and fullcomplete games on release over graphicsyet these days we only get the graphical part wow when does this game come out this is awesome are we going to see this as a rerelease with these new capabilities for those with rtx cards i want to play it lol joe rogan where you at now i wanna play tetris with rtx on xd the day nvidia would turn games to pure realistic graphics coming soon nvidia pls gta vice city with rtx miami night lights quake 2 is a only way to show rtx profit yeah so desperate to sell this useless tech for now obviously i will play this that in blackmesa wow they have convinced me to buy me it would love this on halflife all of them wtf is that aspect ratio thief with raytracing please is this just a tech demo or do we get to play this and you needed a video card to do this lightning shit seriously this is pure marketing to squeeze money 106 glass wich reflect everything where is character then and blaster really hard coded black bars on ultrawide material this is just not good enough this is what happens when you hardcode black bars httpsiimgurcomswt3espjpg so please dont do that i want halflife 1 with this lighting it would be so awesome joe rogan would bust a nut to this oof that just makes the game look so so good looks really good why the fuck are you putting those excessive black bars this is not a frickin movie half of the damn screen is in black bars rtx on more like fps off haha amirite i now feel so funny and original 024 why is that rotating weapon not producing any shadow on the floor and 100 there is no reflection of a player or at least gun model in that physics based glass material seems like ue4 can do everything shown here and more without rtx faster imagine the original fear game with ray tracing they dont make engines like they used to maybe im old and stupid but i prefer original graphic in quake 2 that looks lit makes it better using the rtx gg for only 234867932 you can own this as well the screen is so wide i cant see anything quake2 quake3 half life source its coming boys minecraft rtx support when can i download exe this alone would be worth rtx card as there are no games yet that use it nope battlefiled does not count cool now do duke nukem 3d i would even consider buying your gpu again enough of the rtx crap and more fps its cool but without the grit it has no character way too sterile this is like playing q2 in software rendering and switching to 3dfx card back in the days basically just refined the 20years old graphics technology then sell it as kidneys price now i wanna play halo 1 with rtx and of course this is not quake without the bfg quake 1 and quake champions dont have the bfg but whatever rtx does look phenomenal and its cool how quake 2 could be modernized that said their comparisons are highly highly misleading theyre are activating way more features than simply rtx they said it themselves volumetric effects brand new physically based materials textures etc and when they turn all that off they fail to activate the modern alternatives to rtx so obviously rtx on looks leaps and bounds superior we need a new quake game dynamic light with outdated textures and bump mapping plus a chaotic attention focus plus the usual groundbreaking revolutionary like language dont know what to think after all it looks better without ray tracing but reflections can be done without ray tracing too why not show the difference between those two options to actually spot differences so you compare graphics from 1996 with ray tracing looks like any other modern game to me plus it can be done way better still looks good obviously but quake 2 was great in they way it was so stfu stupid ray tracing just an argument to make this cards way to expensive quake 2 was the 1st game i have ever played i played it on windows xp im blind now what have you done 059 aha raytracing glas reflection all reflects but not the player we must be vampires d if your actually think about it this is a perfect example of why real time raytracing is useless this was my first video game ever when i was about 5 years old neat they honestly compare the original graphics to now half life 2 on ray tracing where do i download this nvidia you fucktadrs release your rtx demos dont let joe rogan see this havent pretty much all of these lighting effects been things that developers can fake with rasterization just look at battlefront 2 the lighting in that game is insane rendered realtime with rasterization i want the original half life with rtx one of the best ray traced demos cheers lets fucking go you guys rock that is beautiful makes me want find and purchase this a second time and play it brings back memories thanks for sharing sorry but can we stop developing all this rtx bs and just made stuff like realtime voxelbased gi better etc cryengine has all of that stuff built in without needing rtx cards this is like 1000 shader level rtx on well done nvidia an individual programmermodder showed you how its done with your new shiny rtx tech when you were struggling well done i want the halflife games with rtx jensen huang it just works buy mah rtx i want to play half life with this new technology pog now unreal tournament 2003 i know the video is in ultrawide but damn half of my monitor is black bars i really want to see bioshock with rtx just imagine it with that moody lighting and wet surfaces that glass looks weird as fuck i get that this is supposed to be a techdemo but wow some design choices are highly questionable while others look quite good ie those rusty metall textures but hey at least it looks a lot less slimey overall thats the common association i have with overdrawn bump mapping i wannt quake 3 and max payne in raytracing after reading some comments the fact that you could get something looking similar with a traditional shader pipeline isnt the point of this demo the real benefit to raypath tracing is that dozens of hacky fake shader tricks can now be replaced with one single unified physics model based on the true behaviour of light now you get ambient occlusion shadows refraction and any other material effect you can think of included raytracing scales in different ways and opens up a whole lot of new possibilities every things just change like magical moment that awkward moment when the lead programmer interrupts the first speaker and then out of a sudden acts like oh so youre giving the presentation now well go ahead then hush hush to everyone saying i want game x with this does you game x have its sources open all old id titles are open source now which is why people can do different amazing things to them will this run on my tnt2 good job guys now its time to work on the price omg this is awesome quake ii is the best game of my childhood is it possible to play a full version of q2 remaster ray traycing edition someday d where to download this demo id like to try it on my 2080 how about remaster world of warcraft oh yeah old simple but high quality games are perfect to show something like ray tracing in newer games theres so much visual noise that even if you add something like ray tracing you might not even notice 240fps vs 30fps not worth it at this point rtx is a joke at this point cool tech but even a 1200 card cannot hold 60fps in most games actually they changed sun color and in static you can get this sunlight on 2003 hardware see hl2 i dont know if im the only one but this ray tracing stuff doesnt really excite me rtx better than 90s baked lightning 108 reflects everything around it except the player himself lol no nuclear plants were harmed making this video take my money can it be applied to action quake2 whats a load of tosh i was expecting doom quality and got the same quake as before dumped in a new engine not also are the texture s naff but the explosions where the same as in the original im not being sold a old game twice i have the original and its grate but ray tracing is fab but it wont sell me this it still a working progress and in its tic faze metro and tomb raider are better examples of rtx and what it can do old looking stuff still looks old ps i am known once in a while to go back to quake still a grate game thumbs up there tho not buying rtx crap this is cool though yeah ultrawide but not scaled in youtube screen for ultrawide monitors unexpected this game so how can i play it i got quake 2 on steam and so i want the og halflife to have some ray tracing new life for q2 lol next ray tracing for tetris please i want gta vcsaiv and 5 in ray tracing crysis with rtx the thing is this a game from 22 years ago how about modern games with out a performance hit i want to see this implemented in halflife and halflife 2 shouldnt you see character reflection in glass with rtx on not quake without the bfg haaaaaaaaa wrong game dude would love to see doom 3 with rtx still no match to my quake 2 demo check it out here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtjiogi8ckde rtx is so hardware demanding that they had to use an old game to showcase it fuck you bastards rtx is a piece of shit mass effect trilogy with ray tracing tho this actually makes me like nvidia again but unfortunately this is only just a tease of q2 redone this new minecraft shader pack looks good fear would now literally make you crap your pants with raytracing this is a real seller for rtx i saw this years ago an a gtx 1080ti amazing how ray tracing can make an old game look so good worst audience reaction ever rtxon i cant believe how bad does the game look like without rts and yet we found it so good back on those times nice now can we make it so that quake champions is actually decent a lot of the aesthetic of this couldve been artificially created without ray tracing maybe reflections wont be as good but a huge chunk of this can be made without any ray tracing not do the original half life what about cryteks demo raytrace without rxcores almost makes rtx cards worth it eh almost cool demo what about advanced physx and 3d vision how are they at all its incredible how fresh this makes the game look they should totally remake quake 2 like this and sell it when this will be released dont tell me its 1997 i dont believe you wait wait wait still the best game of the quake series one could go even without rtx with these updated materials and textures that last part was awsome these rtx promo videos are so misleading comparing rtx on with 20 year old graphics of course it will look beautiful but it would even look better with current traditional rendering methods at the same level of performance ok and when ca we play it when you buy 500 headset and 100 mouse for 250 pc impressive i thought that ray tracing was just another gimmick is it possible for a ray to get trapped somewhere in a loop and stress the hardware so much to actually burn it would like to play halflife uses the quake 2 engine does this mean doom eternal needs this thats really neat however i wish they did that stuff with the idtech4 instead though namely doom 3 prey and the dark mod nobodys denying raytracings possibilities everyones doubting whether were quite there yet hardware and programming wise to make it only have an acceptable performance loss when enabled i bet this demo went straight from 666fps locked to 60 when enabling this for instance p needed dead space rtx no tricks this is actually real no way i though this was an prerendered cgi sequence something i wouldve said if we were still in 1999 carmack is pleased with the result this mod actually makes me consider a rtx card over a rx or gtx card congratulations to the modder who made it and of course its not quake without a bfg jensen huang seems over bearing and pushylol san andreas rtx remake nvidia should fund the remastering of quake quake2 quake3 with rtx tell id we pay for it you get sales while they get the card sales quake quake2 quake3 all should be remastered with rtx im sure you could get this eye candy using tricks without rtx but it seems like far simpler to add real timelighting to these games its good move by nvidia to try implement rtx in old games it makes sense todays games you cant really tell the difference plus wit so much gpu load its harder to push real light at playable rates i would replay these old games if they were remaster with real time lighting so the cost of rtx is to reduce your game to 1996 levels of polygon count quake 2 lel anothr proof that current rtx gen is crap and need to wait the next physically based material like glass that reflects all things around it except the player huh sounds like good old standard pbr rtx free mats to me quake 3 with rtx would be amazing once nvidia releases the update that allows the gtx graphics card to do basic ray tracing i am going to play this game as an unofficial benchmark this isnt even all rtxs doing look on nvidias website and you can look at the before and after screenshots yourself with a slider the textures have been redone in the ray traced version and just inherently look much cleaner and i think the video was done in a higher resolution you can really tell in the aliasing on textures and in the quake logo on the left in this image httpimagesnvidiacomgeforcecominternationalcomparisonsquakeiirtxnvidiartxraytracingquakeiirtxnvidiartxraytracing005onvsoffhtml theres a lot more than lighting differences being done in this test changing lighting doesnt add definition changing lighting doesnt make a texture have more pixels i own an rtx 2060 and dont even use the tracing because i cant tell that it does anything other than cut my fps by half a lot of what theyre doing in this demo has been done by other games pre2010 and could easily be incorporated into this vulkan port of quake 2 i dont doubt fuck volumetric lighting i hate it lol ultrawide but offers no ultra wide support lol they made quake 2 better than battlefield 5 huangs mistake was that he didnt demonstrate this quake 2 before rtx cards announce if nvidia made doom 2 and heretic with 8k textures and raytracing it will be the main reason of my rtx 2080ti existence and a quake 2 rtx of course this could just as well have been sparse voxel octrees demo from 2009 this is pure magic what rtx doing rtx half life anyone that feeling when my pc wont let me play for a vampire infantry from quake 2 hatemygt640 bfg i think he meant doom cant wait till hl2 gets rtx 108 wouldnt the character show lol woaaah look at what ignoring 20 years of rasterization tech can do so amazing very clear difference to bad for nvidia that some guy 1 year earlier made the same thing and opensourced give a little search and look for yourselves little hint github its not fake were not faking it the fact you have to say that meanspeople cannot tell the difference in motion picture maybe in stillsbut in motionnobody cares nothing special we all seen this before just make work easier for developers but end user pay for it fuck rtx just give us more performance at 4k resolution with hdr textures it would be awesome to see hl1 redone like this the original halo would look amazing also next plz ut2004 max payne 1 2 gta vice city when i enable rtx anything in bfv it halves my fps itll be nic when this software doesnt tank my rig do this to the mass effect trilogy and ill die wtf there is no bfg in quake its a doom weapon getting heavy feels for bladerunner those light shafts slowly moving their way across a room is wonderful nvidia ultrawide uploads the video in 169 with black bars in all fairness despite people taking the piss about them using such an old game as an example it is genuinely a fantastic game to demonstrate just how much of a difference realistic natural lighting can impact the visuals of a game and its probably even more effective and noticeable on an old game with less detailed textures than games of today the reflections on the glass window metal plates on the wall and flashes of light from the guns are very nice and all but most notably the rays of daylight seeping through really do look incredibly authentic it must be a joy to replay quake 2 in this fashion that being said im not excited enough by this to spend mad money on a gpu jesus christ guys how about a game from this decade how do you program each surface like metal glass etc etc ray tracing is insane waiting for someone to do this with serious sam the first encounter you would need about 25 rtx 2080ti s to run a fully ray traced game at 1080p 60fps unreal tournament 2004 rtx please were not fakeing it yeah so what when thers no diffrence thats so cool i wish i had an rtx card what we could have in a world without consoles i think quake champions could benefit from this i never liked quake would have been much better if they had done duke mukem or halflife you can do much better with rasterizing this is not uploaded in true ultrawide xd but tbh this is impressive shit not sarcasm let me guess this is more look what i can do with no download to see for our selfs can you do the same thing for unreal tournament 1999 i would love to replay all the pc classics again like this someone get on it ill even buy them all again quake ii remake when nice ultrawide video in box on ultrawide monitor because you added black bars on top and bottom just nvidia things me after downloaded this you can do it my dearly 1050 i love it that you guys added ray tracing to quake ii it is a pretty old game but this makes it look much newer halflife next maybe now remaster the whole game like this how am i suppose to land dank headshots at 30fps i hope when the halo series comes to pc its got all these new upgrades that looks realistic is it possible to get similar results on gtx i dont need rtx just yet the glass reflects everything but the character black mesa half life 2 it is funny that quake 2 rtx is way better example of rtx than battlefield 5 rtx which was made for rtx you should try to make the bioshock series rtx compatable dead space needs this ufd ftw ray tracing should be used to bring back old games like quake unreal tournament but my worry is theyd come with battle royale mode which is not what fans would want bring it back like this and sticking to the original gameplay and id love to see quake and unreal tournament back in esports competitions 020 id wish the demonstrator paid more attention to the huge moving ramp on the floor to show off some dynamic indirect lighting rtx so demanding only a 20 year old game can use it i will wait for the rtx 5080 ti rtx 3080 will support quake3 but has no sun on the strogg planet wtf quake 2 are you seriously now mario is with rts quake 2 22 years old still melting computersrespect i am wanting for halflife with ray tracing we need this in metroid prime its only the 1st generation imagine what will the 5th will look like in terms of gi precision so happy someone finally did this i love the volumetric lighting and that gun at the end is there somewhere we can download it i would love to try it out for myself 032 two separated small holes in wall at upperleft side of the screen each of them is light source but only one large light spot on the floor rtx my ass can someone just remaster the old classics how simple lighting done right can make an old game look newish claps xd what type of hardware did they use for this demonstration how many gpus these people are selling us lies but can it run crysis holy shit doom 3 with rtx when they really should have started raytracing older games to show the capabilities of raytracing 2003 hl2 demo 2019 oh look floor reflects in metal pathetic quake ii rtx development funded by nvidia hundreds of thousands dollars nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti 1200 realizing you just spent 1200 to play a 22 years old game with fancy lighting priceless to go forwards we must go backwards that randomly came into my mind it doesnt make much sense but it sounds good lol not only ray tracing changing in this compare rtx with hi res textures vs old q2 version nvidia tricking again old games are bettern then modern games and im still waiting for far cry original remake i need the unreal and quake series stat ray tracing remasters are coming now please raytrace baldurs gate we need for updated classic arena deathmatch games sure as battle royale dominates theres lots of us who just cant get into it i need to respawn i need speed rogan gonna love thishes back playing quake4skipped championsi like champions tho its difficult i hate all the bunny hopping but i like the concept please please please nividia make ray tracing something i can force inject into games with the control panel oh man i must buy a rtx card cool but now it looks like some tomb in a desert from indiana jones movie what about a call of duty 1 remaster with rtx slip yep quake is still grate game now update the whole game and release it again or make it a free update now imagine how quake the original will look like rt looks beautiful but you cant deny that you can fake it or going close to it if you put enough effort rtx off is simply taking out ilumination why not doom or doom 2 with rtx the 90s version i wasnt quite excited as he was but i think itd be pretty neat if developers started releasing updates to enable rtx in their older games imagine what halflife rtx would look like and i think it would be possible since goldsrc is built on the id tech engine its looking nice but i dont like it cant explain why when i played this game in 2000ths i would like to see what is outside the window what is above roof what is behind water grids i was full of imagination and after almost 20 years the new discover is just lighting areas at walls and floor ray trace master race son nvidia is life sure it looks great though when you need to use a game from 1994 released 25 years ago to demonstrate a technology then youve lost credibility what other technologies are in the newer version strip them out and only add ray tracing and then objective people can take the video seriously half life 1 rtx so 1 year ago was the first time i played this amazing game except back when it originally released and my pc couldnt even handle the demo guess its time to replay what would happen if a game like life is strange supports raytracing the ray tracing can be add to other old games like unreal tournament 2004 what a masterful way to pay homage to a masterpiece of a game the kids need to know who john carmack is if they dont great stuff nvidia urge to upgrade my 1070 increasing ive always thought lighting is everything even with low res textures like mine craft you can make a game look realistic it just looks like a real room with bad textures painted on the walls but you can have photo realistic textures and crap lighting and the game will look shit shame nvidia hdr is actually inferior to amd how do i know 1080ti vs radeon vii utilizing hdr media both games and video setting the 1080ti to full dynamic range in the settings as well as 10bit and windows hdr on setting the radeon vii to 10 bit color full dynamic range is standard for rgb mode so no need to select any extra bullshit like novideo and windows hdr on comparing both on an hdr600 certified monitor the nvidia had banding issues very mild banding in colors but intense banding with greys fading to black extremely noticeable and yet on the radeon vii no banding not with colors and not with greys fading to black just perfect playback something is fishy with the nvidia drivers has to be i get that my hdr600 certified monitor is not gsync ultimate which is what nvidia claims is required for hdr1000 but that should not matter hdr is not a gsync thing it standardized so there should not be an issue which makes me think one of two i wonder if they will ever bring ray tracing to halo mcc now that its coming to pc why i dont belive that this is not the quake 2 engine but instead exported models in a more modern engine with externaly baked light to simulate the open gl renderer everything so gorgeous until i saw the shitty bethesda logo and got disappointed where is the shadow from the gun on 023 remember this is not fake 120 ray tracing makes this dope i feel like id and nvidia could make one hell of an rtx demo out of doom 3 since that was all about lighting atmosphere and such now do half life now i demand minecraft with ray tracing why does before look better than after if such an old game can look so atmospheric with ray tracing i cant wait to see what it can do to newer games id love to play halflife 2 or dishonored with ray tracing honestly this is where i see rtx make real impact and truly show off what it can do older games getting the rtx revamp treatment would really showcase how beautiful a game can be with real time ray tracing it will also make the technology more accessible as more people would be able to run the games and experience it versus new games that gamers are already struggling to run without using rtx i cant wait to see what other older games will get this new coat of paint would be amazing if say the new halo mcc coming to pc gets this treatment feel like since theyre older games they will see the best benefit breathing intensifies where to download i was hoping to see the railgun in action are demos going to work with this id love to rip some demos for my channel with these graphics amazing this game is to ps4 i have never like any quake series maybe with this graphics i it will have a chance cant wait to get 1000euros gpu to play old games ughh cool love quake2 and will play but they went overboard with all the shiny surfaces kinda dishonest to act like rtx enables pbr rendering but hey at least its not dlss i guess those smoke effects oo first time i see a good implementation of rtx too well done wow didnt know nvidia presented a quake 2 demo publicly if this is just an engine rewrite to support rtx but keep the gameplay codings exactly the same this would support every mod quake ii supported i would really like to see parallax textures and tesselated models with this volumetric fogs would also be dank the new particles in this video are insane 4k 120fps on rtx the game year 1997 ok so to have a game run reasonably well with raytracing you have to use game that is 22 years old anything newer cant afford the performance hit well thats what i call cutting edge technology next theyll probably show rtxenabled version of pong or cleartype rendering for egyptian hieroglyphs why does it seem like nvidia just ran out of rtenabled games so they had to use quake 2 but it still looks cool of course but can it ray trace crysis do the original deus ex next quake ii never looked so beautiful till now 3 halflife needs this 100 where is the fighters reflection 22 years later still looks quite good quake looking better than ever before cant wait please do it for quake 3 these rtx graphics are amazing now do the original halflife now i want crysis with ray tracing i can only dream with a patch for the oficial steam game if that happens you can bet i will buy rtx did you show it to the carmack i hope that quake 1 will receive rtx too second life of quake 2 wow this is not quake without a bfg first quake didnt have a bfg now do it with fortnite i dont know why but the special glass only reflects environment not players done by random people httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbrcafdbme2ylistrdqm7e9g55vzmz8startradio1 10 years ago httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmthdsg2wnho weeeeeeeee this is so delicious now if i could only afford your way to high priced cards if john carmack and michael abrash knew that their engine will still be one of the best 24 years later ok now i want quake 3 with rtx this is not quake without a bfg what cool but let me know when it doesnt cost an arm and a dick and tank system performance create this rtx demo but in star wars knights of the old republic pls is it quake ii with rtx or is it remastered also cant help but imagine quake 1 raytraced it would be even more atmospheric i have seen this before this demo shows the most how raytracing can change asus rtx 2060 here i cum this was done by one guy i think rtx is truly the future of gaming getting an evga 2080ti yesterday i can officially say i was highly impressed metro exodus looked unfuckingreal is this a fucking joke wtf is the fuzz about rtx will soon be obsolete after implementation of raytracing in unreal engine 4 and other engines without requiring an rtx card all these people desperate for a free rtx lol i want one too though jesus this made a graphically outdated game significantly better looking than new games would love to see rtx be added to jedi academy nvidia on impressive this is why i love nvidia innovating not imitating weve come so far to play quake 2 again now do half life that was dope someone gonn turn rtx on fallout 76 there is an open source mod for gothic 1 and gothic 2 that changes directx 7 to directx 11 nvidia lets go all the way and make ray tracing for gothic series damn quake with raytracing dear nvidia double down on this i dont care about new games with rtx form an rtx classics team get devs on board and do quick remakes ill take gta 3 vice city half life deus ex metal gear solid battlefield 1942 mechwarrior 2 freelancer halo just google best games of and pick a year people make a list no light or rtx are you serious no mirror images this is true this will bring me back to when i was a kid seeing the game running at 16fps on my pc quake 2 is being used in a professional demonstration for new graphical technology in the year of our lord 2019 and i love it you will see the improvement in every game they make doom 3 would look insane with rtx imagine all that moody lighting quake champions 203 kinda dont like the before and after thing we dont really need to see the before to see the afters beauty finally i can play quake 2 on my 1100 gpu thank you based nvidia 3 let us fucking download it dont show something we cant use until fucking april no point quake 1 would look stunning heres hoping someone smart and talented is working on that this is absolutely amazing i love quake 2 always have can this be downloaded somehow and played with i really would love to would it be able to support multiplayer modes like ctf and eraserbot how about tetris with rtx is this quake ii rtx remastered i hope it will be available to play this year weirdly the best rtx demo when rtx or dlss in battlefront ii d i would buy a rtx just to play quake 2 rtx for sure 22 years and only u can do is make old quake ii a bit nicer wtf ironically this raytraced quake 2 would run better on a modern pc than quake iv because that game isnt compatible with modern systems serious sam with rtx go 105 which reflects everything around it umm it reflects only the world map around it not objects some other games actually reflects everyting visible is this what it feels like when a dream comes true lost all of the style of the original whitewashing all of the detail from walls and floors when barrels exploded it was like a video sprite played in place of a where a 3 dimensional object used to exist even the window in the original version looked better whats with everything having a glossy plastic look to it as well you have yet to convince me that any of this raytracing is worth it probably the only rtx enabled game that might run alright with a pascal card the before and after shots are so misleading that being said the end result sure is nice too bad that quake 2 is my least favorite quake game gameplay wise its slower and the guns are underwhelming to use this looks good i wish theyd drop the fake sounding enthusiasm just talk like regular people the explosion effects look so good with dxr raytracing i assume it has to do with more accurate lighting between the smoke and fire effects of explosions and cant wait to see destruction in games become more and more beautiful hows it was reworkin open old filesdrop to ue3enjoy wow new bulshiting from bethesda now with mohaa holy this kicks even better than quake championsif quale 3 will get ray tracing tooill buy one of their rtx gpus holy shit jensen is annoying half life 1 rtx pretty please for nvidia rtx card owners if you own a copy of quake ii and have it installed there is already a free mod called q2vkpt available on github that has a more ambitious approach to raytracing than nvidias rtx hybrid raytracingrasterization method q2vkpt renders game scenes completely with pathtracing check it out here httpsgithubcomcschiedq2vkpt wish this game wad available i would play the heck out of it only thing i have deduced from this is only the games from 1997 can run rtx with current hardware quake 2 being used to showcase the most advanced gpu technology 22 years after it was used for the same purpose amazing im so glad theyre doing this id pay good money for a thief 2 update with this now this is raytracing now do unreal 98 a splinter cell game with rtx gi will be a dream more games should use ray traced lighting i was skeptical with metro exodus at first but their rt gi really impressed me however its only gi newer games should use both rt gi and main lighting with rt as well holy freaking smokes the difference is insane amazing how lighting and reflections can make a game released in 1997 look like it was released in 2019 that rocket explosion looks exactly the same as fire and smoke rendered in blender cycles yeah if you really want to sell this do a minecraft demo using rtx shader packs is not fake its real infomercial and magicians how about the original quake i need thay that other dude reminds me of the bf 5 rtx demo with his exaggerated comments like omggggg look at it this is incredible gaming will never be the same wanna see more old games implement raytracing i thought this was a game from 2014ish and then i read the description i dont want lighting and glare to block my ability to see what items are on the ground in a competitive fps game like quake 2 heads up devs nvidia was probably salty that amd got the strada contract from google this is photo realistic rendering i doubt it will come into final product in the end the god rays on rtx looks mesmerising nice how rtx brings life to old games if this doesnt prove to people who are skeptical about raytracing that it is the future then perhaps nothing will it is super amazing complimentsthis very good what next rtx on minesweeper if you think im buying another graphics card because it makes an old game that i played to death years ago look cool then youll have to do better than that do it with hl2 d this is not quake without a bfgclearly this guy hasnt played quake nor doom great effects but the game does look outdated didnt know an alien planet could be so sunny if i read one more comment about rtx sucks its not ready yet im personally coming over to your house and burn your fucking pc get over it it works and if you cant afford it dont want to pay for it fine by mebut cut the crap what about optimize this shit we all know what rt can do now but in the new games this is just put more lags for the low price of 1200 you can have a video card that can make 30 year old games look nice i really want to play this we need more games with this kind of implementation of raytracing can someone please do half life 2 raytracing disappointed cuz my gtx 1060 cant play it that awesome quack remember this game this is amazing i would like to see halflife with rtx where is the reflection of player on the glass kodak moment and then cringeworthy moment at 140 fucking incredible played quake 3 but in worst graphics than these stunning actually looking forward to other rtxremakes too jedi knight anyone quake 2 looks good in ray tracing really shows off what ive been telling people for years good graphics has in majority to do with lightning and realistic reflections definitely help too this was done bye pc gamers months ago why are you just getting too it lights camera quake i wounder how many classic games could get this rtx secound breathe one thing im actually impressed by good job time to save money just to play old games again do mirrors edge i played quake for the first time when i was 8 now seeing this thing i feel old already cmon next half life the lava on the left though well doesnt matter cryengine already mas no rtx ray tracing am i the only person not impressed when i see that rtx something moves in my pants weird that john carmack has said nothing about this youd think hed be very interested in this maybe hes under some legal stuff that prevent him from publicly commenting on anything bethesda related yes this is where ray tracing should be really pushed for now is in the old great classics thank you nvidia for finishing up q2vkpt i hope to see more like this from you guys i wont have the hardware to play q2 rtx for a while but i will thoroughly enjoy it when i do now how about aliens vs predator classic rtx with fixed mouse aim so exciting joe rogan is going to be all over this i kinda wanna play this in its entirety wow thats big deferent of vision quality it actually works oh quakes2 bfg was awesome giant green ball then the beamstring from the ball that drains the players life haha the way it is meant to be played well they did it simply stunning rtx on is the best thing that happened in the pc gaming world recently if it is beauty what is cute this has sold me on rtx when can we buy this quake rtx remaster i am a triggered amd toxic fanboy and i came here to debating wow ive never seen a demo with rtx on impressive wait i havent bought quake champions yet wait it looks even better than d16 this needs to be made into an official release quake 2 remastered right now the rtx factor makes so much difference in games like this those bright inviting lightshafts really underpin the dystopian hellscape that is the strogg homeworld a red desert wasteland are you going to release the source code its a crime against humanity if you dont thats pretty sick please do relase this i am willing to buy whatever gpu card required to play q2 like this again i wonder what rocket jump ninja thinks about this i hope one day deus ex gets this treatment quake ii remastered confirmed spend 10hours of playing on quake since ps1 before ray tracing is coming to gtx awesome by april driver update best rtx demo but using ultrawidescreens for demo is not the best now quake 1 when its quake 2 i hope we can all still run it at 240 fps or higher with rtx on ray tracing is what the future of gaming should have been in the first place this to me is much more impressive than the commercial games with ray tracing released since the 20 series launched just as expected from nvidiareal quality but when we actually got it running on our pcs this has to be a fucking joke getting there nvidia good just add high resolution textures and annyversary version is done rtxify quake 1 please would love to see ray tracing on classic doomheretichexen games i know some mods out there come close but the heretic tc mod diablo 3d would look great with it now do it with halflife 1 redo mario graphics please zork with rtx xd thats what im talkin about nice job do this for quake 3 team arena i would love other old games to get rtx support like for example portal max payne 2 or dishonored how can i get job in nvidia it will definitely be amazing when this kind of thing is possible on modern games nvidia did it back then with hardware tl back then now does it again with raytracing great stuff as always only on nvidia so there is a game i can actually use rtx on my 2060 for i love seeing the world in rtx colored glasses this card is the best card in the universe can it run quake wow amazing that ray tracing and hdr can make a 22 year old game look this good is this going to be released officially i have wanted for ages a graphics upgrade for the old quake games hummmexcuse me this is halflife2 bruhh this is just ripping off from minecraft shaders if a lot of older games can turn out so much prettier i need this in my life right now rtx quake on the best of the best its so crazy to think you can add this new tech to an old game more rtx games exciting ohh great now i want to see heavy metal fakk 2 with rtx rtx is something to experience not only see if i can only afford now an 2080tithat would be dandy why it is so realistic id software nvidia bethesda please also bring doom 3 with ray tracing i remember this game was all about illumination just imagine it running with this tech whoaahhhh the tech looks pretty nice on older games and the smoke effect improves the original explosion immensely but the hype guy is a bit embarrassing to be honest heh a 22 year old game with ray tracing the only game that can be played at 4k 60 fps on max settings with rtx on alas i dont have a rtx card 105 glass reflects everything around it except the player twenty bucks on minecraft being next not necessarily to be showcased here smirk face justthebeginning that was an awesome demo good job on those that worked on it remaking all the graphics in the game cryengine can do raytracing on nonrtx cards they can even do it on amd cards and here i thought it was a modern upcoming game rtx can even make older games look beautiful quake rtx please ok now do ultimate doom as long as addons and external levels paks are supported count me in i would love to revisit the game its expansions and some levels from the idgames archive would it be too much to ask if you start adding ray tracing support for old games like quake iiii and perhaps other titles like half life or unreal id rather enjoy a full ray traced engine with no tricks than a low framerate 2019 game that is half rasterizationhalf ray tracing that still relies on tricks and fake lightning for some parts but but but rtx is just a gimmick s amazing glamorous light hell yes i havent commented in a hot minute but this is something that is truly amazing thanks nvidia in light of software based rtx lighting coming to the 1060 gtx and better cards next month will this work on those also unexpected pun achievement unlocked light do you see what i did there amazing wonder how it runs on my rtx2070 been watching this for so long and its almost here the way the light bounces around walls is amazing so i spent all my life living in rtx off mode this is the reason why i can not see myself in the mirror ahahahah hm kinda want my unreal gold and ut99 remade with raytracing d aaand now i want to play quake 2 again good thing i anticipated this and just keep it installed on all my systems can rtx be enable when running multiple cards nvlink its really awesome for what rtx can do its weird as i understand it this started as an experimental mod and it now seems to be getting official support from both id and nvidia dang im 5 hours late bfg missed one stuff huge teleport ball where is lines all over what slide you up this one did look same what rocket but bigger i would literally fill my hard drive with screenshots amazing cmon make those in 1 3 4 ql qc also the shadows and lights are soo detailed and realistic i am so happy ray tracing is coming to gtx series ive been saying it for the longest if nvidia wants to make people truly excited about rtx then go back and add it into older easier to run titles first i wonder how itll play on my 1080ti when rtx comes to pascal in april sad that this is currently the best game running rtx looks so natural maybe apply this in cad softwares when you turn off rtx then you realize that before was so ugly cool rtx original doom you know you want it p would be really interesting to see rtx in non fps games i wonder how an rts game would look funny how they demo a 20 year old game cant wait for ray traced half life if that doesnt sell people on ray tracing i dont know what will i mean a game from fin 1997 suddenly looks nextgen with nothing but a new lighting model unbelievable stunning so many memories but upgraded rtx should have been released with this not having any games that could use ray trace feature at launch was inexcusable i never knew the quake 2 rocket explosion could look weaker and more pathetic than it already did back in the day quake 2 was the primary reason i spent a lot of money and finally bought a 3d accelerator 3dfx voodoo many others as well ids games were like that and here we are quake 2 doing it again 22ish years later lol although this time i already have an rtx 2080 ti bring on the rays living beloved classic i need rtx in my life the outcome is pretty good in this one the amount of ass kissing going on in this comments section is scary it looks like everyone wants to win a free gpu every rtx demo is amazing especially this one wow those rtx black bands look amazing i gotta make sure i check the channels latest every 4 hours finally quake hey thats pretty good what the fuck is this shit with blackbars do you know how shitty it looks on real ultrawide monitor idiots from nvidia unable to crop and upload video someone send this to roe jogan yes yes yes yes thank you so much cant wait to play quake 2 with rtx on getting myself 2070 in a week really eagor to try this one for myself cant wait to see more implementation of rt in the future keep up the work 3 on a funny note plz write minecraft rtx renderer the rtx just seems to make the game pop out that some amazing stuff they are doing its actually not a surprise that old game seems to make more of raytracing new games already try to simulate ambient physical lighting without raytracing in engines but back in the days it was done with spotlighting and area lighting its like giving you a new lifei love it just to be sure is this the potential of quakes engine or is it based around the quake engine curious to see how games adjust going from a very dark area to a well lit one if it is designed to take a second to create a realistic exposure then competitive players will just turn off rtx as they will then have an advantage of not having their eyes burned out by the gorgeous global lighting wow this completely changes the mood i cant wait to check out the source code for this one quake 2 official ray tracing mod when bring rtx for halo mcc youd think physically based glass at 1 minute would also reflect the player but nope incredible how detailed this gets rtx is amazing the price isnt though absolutely incredible youve got to be kidding me thats just amazing that you can make it look like a whole new game with a whole new flair with just ray tracing well done seriously what kind of sorcery are you doing in your labs to make this happen nvidia loved every single moment ok so where do i download this yeah i like the trailers and demos but in my opinion the builds and other that type of videos are more interesting this was a good video though dont you lose 50 fps from ray tracing imagine witches 3 with rtx i am so freakin glad to see quake like this its what got me into gaming in the first place d this is simply amazing wow now my computer cannot even run this game dont worry amd will save us all fantastic hope ray tracing support will come to more older games like unreal1 halflife 1 and 2 deus ex and so on this is future so dxr with a ton of other effects added can beat an extremely old game using only diffuse textures yippee we finally have the ability to match visuals of early 2000s and only need a whole lot more computational power soon we will be able to even match reflection probes and current baked gi with only a ton more compute hey i want help im between th rtx 2060 and the gtx 1660ti primary i work in premiere pro lightroom photoshop and some after effects gaming occasionally but the work its the more important thanks greetings nvidias game plays always look better than everyone elses damn son that lighting made that 1997 game looks like it was remade in 2017 how long until graphics card can handle this ray tracing in modern games tho wow cant wait for more implementation of this amazing tech now we just need to apply ray tracing to crysis oh wait crytek recently applied rt without rt cores imagine what they could achieve when they use rt cores i think ray tracing is going to be the future because it makes lighting easier for the programmers the total lighting with ray tracing in video games is undoubtedly an incredible enhancer of the visual experience low poly games of 20 years ago become very appealing and worthy games to replay them again and for that reason i hope that quake ii is not the only classic game that can take advantage of ray tracing it would be great to replay all the titles of the end of the 90s and even the original doom itself which i understand uses to a certain extent the ray castingray tracing no giveaways nice work wasnt expecting this the simplicity of the scenes really helps show of what rtx is capable of after watching so many videos now its amazing how we got by without rtx i want to know that are the rtx cards value for money because according to my concern except 2060 everything else doesnt make sense is nvidia trying to kill their own lineup by presenting the 2060 as the best budget rtx card what about their big brothers i love rtx series better than the old gtx graphics card with more performance and ray tracing ability thats awesome im really glad that you put rtx also to the gtx cards 3 3 that looks soo real how to make a old game look great again well you just get jensen on the job altough old this is by far the best demo i am glad that this will actually be released glad nvidia is working on a game like this enable dxr for 900 series plz i wanna play quake 2 at 10 fps like voodoo banshee times joe rogan is quaking in his barbell denim right about now ive got the weirdest boner quake2 sold me cutting edge hardware once again in quake 2 you play as an interplanetary space marine vampire thats why you cannot see your reflection in the glass the perfect excuse to play quake ii for those who didnt and of course for those who did btw is there a video where players see how the lights reflects on their armor and from it into the surroundings or on a mirror this is a ray trace remaster stunning this is like day and night wow this is so cool i wonder if modder will start doing this to other older games omg i loved this game i would love that card okay now do minecraft wow thats a pretty good looking game with that tech i grew up on quake its nice to still see quake in the fps landscape 25 years later glass that reflects everything around it except the player facepalm wow this is incredible quake two is my favorite game with rtx is amazing great job guys nvidia guy here we have ray traced reflections jensen ladies and gentleman its ray traced reflections look at that what a classic looks better than a lot of current games the lighting are in here were just mesmerizing when can we get our hands on quake 2 rtx i dont get it what is even the point of implementing raytracing physically based rendering and high dynamic range algorithms in such an good old game sure it looks kind of terrific but what about recreating the whole game with nowadays technological accomplishments no is this a joke comparing different texture lol god i love ray tracing thats a huge difference wow really amazed by this demo ladies and gentlemen welcome to the future particle effects are great too i want to play it but my pc can not run it even at the lowest settings nvidia is paving the way will you upload the complete video including first part where hes showing the original rendered scene and then it shifts to the rtx version that first showing including the audiences reaction really shows the dramatic shift from original to rtx version for a long long time real time ray tracing gaming has been all talk and no walk thanks to nvidias leadership that invested many years of rd into its rtx tech developers now can bring the great graphics of real time ray traced games to gamers wow how nvidia geforce rtx was probably amazing and how realistic it is it make my mind explode xd wow quake at all its glory with this lightning woah gotta admit ray tracing is pretty sweet it looks like the minecraft seus shaders xd nvidia should provide this to everybody for freemake people hunger for rtxness will nvidia host some quake 2 games any time soon still better than cs ray trace all the games not just new aaa titles wow wait what quake x rtx what a beauty to hear the ceo voice in this video thank you nvidia rtx 2080 ti this game looking so much realistic with rtx really great demo for ray tracing technology makes it look much more apparent definitely one of the best whats his steam id this is so dumb but cool incredible cant have rtx glorymypotatopc rebirthing old games into a new generation maybe now my mom and dad will stop criticizing new age games when we make their generation of games better wow quake two running on 1000 modern graphics card how wonderful this the best demo of what rtx can do so far ray tracing coming to pascal and volta i wanted to see this in quake 4 holy sht that is incredible if i could only afford an rtx card i am stuck with my gtx 900 generation card please upload ultrawide as a real ultrawide video so ultrawideusers like me dont have to see those massive black bars around the glorious ray traced footage 3 this looks so clean the rays of light is also soo cool like wow its an old game interesting if neural nets could perceive old games and rerender them live some guys were doing a great non profit implementation of star trek next gen enterprise with really good graphics but classic engine until right holder asswipes used lawyers to intimidate them and shut them down i think their work could be a great rtx demo combined with some true to life characters and ultimately some basic ai governing their behavior to bring it to life the guns projectile impact effect looks good i want deus ex with rtx quake is just too much for me its weird how ray tracing can make such an old game look so good you guys leaked the quake 2 remastered now its shiny and doesnt have that quake vibe like minecraft shaders and btw planet strogg from quake 2 has red atmosphere this a better rtx demo for now looks pretty cool never played a quake game but now i just might looks bomb the quake 2 bfg is the favorite of all bfgs they should have shown it with enemies so we could have seen the rays from the energy ball going into the enemies what are all these rtx demos all of a sudden that make the difference those light shafts though what was added at last minute first comment damn gg nvidia future of gaming is pretty cool the secret room in the water in my case is just a room with a rocket launcher is it just me or does the original look more appealing my thoughts about the bright sky they steal the atmosphere of the alien planet of the original no music buys 1000 dollar gpu to play quake ii at 1440p awesome wheres the fckig music after watching this what we now need is for game developers to fully integrate all the rtx 20 series features into the latest games and to see what can be added to the older games then all i need is a nice rtx card in a good pc with a capable monitor to bring all these features to my home any and all donations are welcome nudge nudge wink wink you know what i mean squire after 800 i can play quake 2 why not quake 3 arena i am not even remotely fooled by this video its actually boring why doesnt the sun make the shadows dynamic through windows as it sets did the dev leave out the muzzle flash anyone with the sandbox engine can put a few extra lights on a map i am beyond disappointed the only thang rtx is good for is doom 4 rtx is the biggest flop ever a year later i couldnt decently distinguish a smoke and mirrors trace over a real trace id really like to see doom 3 get fully ray traced that would look pretty amazing and the music god there are some stupid morons in the comments that dont understand anything holy crap i seriously think it make some areas extremely dark seems that the maps will require the addition of some light sources since theres no vision enhancement power up in q2 imo it doesnt even look all that much better than what you get with any relatively modern sourceport of quake ii i think its helped more by the updated models and textures than it is by rtx skipped the secret level no super shotgun for you why does the green glow of the shotgun not reflect on the walls lol i just tried it on my gtx 1080 and received a rude awakening why doesnt the player stop shooting with the smg 2 bullets hit the rest go over the enemies head why is vsync enabled and all it needs to run is a 2080 ti am i the only one that finds it weird when the gun shoots theres no muzzle flash hey guys you can download the demo here httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp1089130quakeiirtx i actually had a clan for quake 2 we played ctf the most on mckinley revival it was awesome 5 vs 5 you could setup attacks or defences with attacks and lock down your flag room and keep quad damage on timer and attack one window one front door and another sewer or combos of all three the game was a blast back then i would love a remaster of ctf quake 2 with all new maps best kills was two people sling shoting grapple through the air at the same time and i get a rail shot on the other guy in 4k still 90 fps enjoyed it immensely on a rtx2080 it would not on my pc let me get the big boss would not load that last part of the game still went back to open gl 32 to finish it of great fun the nostalgia of showing off your computer running quake lets hope some things never changes 1999 im going to test my new setup with quake 2 2009 im going to test my new setup with crysis 2019 im going to test my new setup with quake 2 2007 can it run crysis 2009 can it run gta 4 2019 can it run quake 2 i feel like it was always like this its like my mind had filled in the blanks back in 98 my voodoo card is to slow try to buy and expensive voodoo 2 card now 2019 my 1080gtx is ruined by quake 2 my huracan g21 needs a new gpu 2080ti damn it my huracan doesnt support this new card alo asus wait a second you n00by i have the original quake 2 cd with rob zombie soundtrack and all mind you why the hell do i need to buy the game again good shit man im getting a shit hot gaming pc tuesday and i love quake 2 so this should be fantastic i cant wait to try it out it was fun seeing those old levels again in your vid i practically have the game memorized hdoom with raytracing gman your simile game is fucking on point the always crack me up the bfg double barrel shotgun look terrible when you have the demo in the reflection the model is not complete almost like in jurassic park kind of like the whole ray tracing thing but rtx off 1000fps rtx on 55fps with an rtx 2080 ti 1440p fov 110 and gi med im getting right around 60 fps which is perfectly playable i tried going down to 1080p but it gets a little blurry like you were mentioning unreal with rtx would be sweet i might actully buy an rtx car then i7 8700k 16 gb ram gtx 1080 15 fps lmao this is fucking nuts thief the dark project with rtx drool 1 global illumination medium vs high its about your system definitely your computer is doing more work depending on what kind of computer you have and what kind of work its good or bad at doing this setting may make a huge difference 2 from what i understand without the denoise filter youre looking at the actual ray traced image its whats really happening its a tech demo people wanna see stuff like that just like you want to see different types of day 3 i think the fish eye thing is for perfect perspective or whatever its for certain screensaspect ratios i dont know what all the settings are for but those ones all make sense and have purpose particularly for a tech demo im sorry but can you please elaborate you can buy steaks at a gas station over there cylindrical is for folks that have monitor rigs surrounding them well at least 120 degrees and even with all these visual upgrades they still didnt add muzzle flashes ouch its dropping your fps from 1k to under 60 ive got a question why quake 2 quake 1 makes more sense to me i dont really think this type of lighting suits this game well whole things just looks overly lit which takes away the originals charm entirely not a match to original quake iis gritty dim look is this a mod for the game you download how do you get this version of quake 2 the smell of burning graphic cards are nice you mean the 8700k right 8770k doesnt exist the railgun looks ugly as hell they should have kept the original im imagining a remaster of the time splitters trilogy with ray tracing why did they do ray tracing with quake 2 instead of 1 looks great all the old games in their original polycount can have new replayability i like the part where it drops from 1000fps to 50fps just by turning all the bells and whistles on if you are looking for a free fps game you should try cube 2 sauerbraten its a old arena shooter which is definately worth a try when can we expect crysis with raytracing to revive that meme now for american mcgees alice good thing quake ii was the whole reason i made a steam account in the first place the gauss gun looks like liquid dogshit why the fuck would you change perfection you dunce ps rtx on other high quality graphics feel out of place in a game like quake 2 the improved graphics makes this game from a 410 to a 1010 glad they fixed the vertices on weapon animations seeing them without jelly movements looks so good i almost thought this was a remake by id software themselves xp i dont like this rtx effect in quake 2 every color is so strange and that the weapons are shining and reflecting the light is also just odd one thing ive always asked myself since 1997 did idsoft run out of budget the very moment they needed to put a firing sprite on weapons while shooting does it work with the 2 official expansions imagine remastering crysis my pc is burning now flare gun i think i must have missed that one soon google stadia might make all of this standard ans you wont even need to buy a gfx card when his microphone sounded like it was made out of a tin of baked beans hahaha i tried the demo on my gtx1080ti with 8700 and 32gig of ram it ran at 30 fps but it gave me a headache i didnt like it i appreciate the work they have put into it and in a way it looks good but i would rather stick with the original i like 90s games because they look sparse and that is their charm theres also console commands which were really cool to play around like sun color check the commands they are freaking amazing not that i was expecting miracles on a non rtx card but this plays like ass on my 1060 nvidia ray tracing looks much better vs 22 yo rasterization while the 22yo game does not even run smoothly at 4k on our flagship 1200 gpu image the original thief games with this sometimes i dont get modern game design philosophy theyre now using ray tracing to create a more realistic image for modern games but then they go and completely spoil the illusion with enemy life bars combo popups button prompts neon outlines for interactive objects achievement popups etc they advance the technology to the point where it can render practically photorealistic environments and then plaster the screen in so many popups that it looks like a 90s era 2d fighting game does this work with the original quake 2 pc disk cuz i have the same disk ive had since 97 and it still works great id prefer not to have to buy it again wow so low for saying that were filthy casual if we dont own the game in which case who cares cuz a game is a game and theres no players whos casual why isnt there a space junkies review on the channel its a modern take on the unreal tournament quake arena formula quake 1 mental ray cant they replace all the items and monster with quake 1 and keep the maps but can it run crysis with ray tracing quick question which rtx card is this running on the good thing about this is that itll still be here when raytracing becomes mainstream and affordable did they use some quake 2 xp assets for this like the med kits honestly quake 2 xp looks damn good with updated textures normal mapping nvidia should have teamed up with those guys to just add rtx lighting to the quake2xp mod i think the default version is better and the rtx just makes it look like shit system shock 2 with ray tracing imagine that even with shaders the graphics still sucks and need a high end pc to run this btw im a q2 player and theres games with low specs and still has better graphics than this converted a psx graphics to playstation 2 graphics i still listen to the quake 2 soundtrack sonic mayhem baby also quake 2 railgun is still my favorite im not a fan of the q2 rtx it runs fine on my rig but i prefer quake 2 xp mod this wont work on my gtx 970 it says i dont have a ray tracing compatible gpu bunch of bull shit without rt 1000 fps with rt 55 fps hot damn 3 issues 1 i only own the original quake 2 2 even if i get it steam has no windows 98 support 3 even if it were i doubt itd run on my pentium 2 i wish they did this with good games like unreal or halflife lets be honest gman you just wanted an excuse to play quake 2 again thief with rtx drops microphone does this mean gloom will make a come back looking through the comment sectioni see a lot of folks asking for the original unreal games in rtx hell yes trouble is i would be forced to borrow against my house for a total hedt upgrade at a lowlow 2499236 interest rate in order to enjoy it in the first person i may be a total casual buti would rather just enjoy watching the gman kick ass playing those games on yt 10 months after the cards are launched there are 3 games that use this tech in limited form and a remaster of a 22 year old game to show off that fancy 1000 videocard money well spent its a shame no quake 1 ughh raypath tracing has completely destroyed every game in the world for me i got a new graphics card so im finally able to play modern games at 4kmax60 fpsand they just look like crap edit i just realizedblood is always brightly lit in this version is blood lightemissive or what edit2 global illumination affects the number of light bounces its very poorly explained lol hey whyd you take the gg gamergate out of your name fuck yeah bring on the classic fps renaissance this looks amazing why wouldnt they do this with quake 3 arena instead i thought quake 2 was the black sheep of the series its a tech demo i cannot afford rtx hahahah i get a solid 60 frames per second on a 2070 i get 30fps on low 720p on my gtx 1070 ti one of my favourite games of all time even with the new textures though it looks ugly to me nvidia supplied you with gpu oh i get it cocksuker 5060 fps in q2 fuck you and your rtx btw q2rtx looks like shit zero original atmosphere yamagi forever i was unable to make the controls inverted i cant believe they messed that up look cylindrical has a purpose so many times i would wish to select how the game viewport is rendered for example 3x projector setup with a cylindrical screen thats what cylindrical is for pity new games dont offer choice how the screen is rendered instead your always stuck with i believe conical projection and fish eyes distortion on ultra wide screen setups icarus avenger 180 is an example of setup that can benefit immensely from cylindrical projection ssg is too polished software mode to the rescure what about quake 1 so the difference that q2 rtx brings is that all the light in the game is actually bouncing around the levels like real light does in every other game shadows and lights are precalculated and placed so that the illusion of a normal environment is created to maintain the illusion in that environment the devs have to prevent you from being able to do a tonne of cool stuff like knocking holes in dark rooms to let light in or move environmental light sources around too much as that would disconnect the light source from the location where the shadows have been calculated and rendered on the map after youve experienced a bit of q2 rtx other games feel fake the environments just arent alive like q2 just walking from one spot to another with a light source completely changes the walls floors ceilings and objects around you when you enable the daynight cycle or have a battle with enemies its like the entire environment is dynamic and alive so good 747 lmaod my ass off its ridiculous isnt it ok how do i get this version i have the quake 2 game from steam so what do i do the blood spray still looks like bacon bits and the gibs red onions this looks great i loved quake ii and this is bringing back the goodness but with icing and a nicer slicer i love this tfw sovjet era graphics card the game looks worse imo they traded art style for realism in an attempt to flex their garbage tech which tanks performance in any game that wasnt released over a decade ago the cylindrical projection option is for specialized alternative displays to use like if youre trying to project the game in a planetarium or something crazy like that of course it wont look right on a normal monitor think theyd make doom 3 rtx nothing like spending hundreds of dollars on a new graphics just to get crap frames on a 20 year old pc game i appreciate how much breel you get nowadays vs years ago it shows the effort you put into these and limits repetition the stutters are because you have steam osd running thank me later i personally dont see how this is a good way to show off ray tracing at least not with q2 when there are graphicstextures overhaul mods that make it look far better and more polished than this version i understand the concept of rtx is to get similar results of a fully fledged graphics mod with much less effort making it easier for the developers and modders but this is totally the wrong game to show it off with people who dont really care about rtx as such or dont really understand how it works will just go meh seen better looking mods this isnt really convincing me to dish out an extra hundred bucks for what i can get for free rtx is not a magical switch that will make a hugely outdated game still fun though look like something from this generation or even the last because it doesnt it still looks like a 1997 game with just shiny surfaces and some god rays here and there nothing that hasnt already been done with mods before and to a much more polished de i wanna see this on quake 1 why dont the enemies cast shadows what the hell i thought it was always night because i always played it at night pitch black putside area at the end of the game was terrible had to throw a flair every 10 feet to see just slap ray tracing on it and people will eat it up like hot cakes when modern day gaming is lack that they go back to the classics that got it right to give the game some more tasty gloss 1000fps rtx off 55fps rtx on my oh my this sure eats some frames as they claim a few but its worth it from 1000 fps to 5560fps big oof they have an install after you install the game and i cant get it to work its not that great had to laugh at the running crysis as a bench mark comment and now they run quake 2 eeeh i remember the days when you had to turn shadows off to gain a huge improvement in the rest of the actual game you were playing am i the only retarded who loved the cylindrical vision mode 2 grand for a 2080ti i think you mean 1 grand i got mine for a great deal on auction 800 coincidentally im currently playing quake 2 for the first time an old version without the raytracing that would melt my gpu for sure its funny seeing that video is like hey ive just played this map but it looks so different quake ii rtx play the game on full bright with detail textures at 8 fps progress shame on me for not owning it oof not my fault germany hates cool stuff cant even buy it here same counts for the first heretic however was able to buy hexen ii pretty cheap on amazon this kinda reminds me of goldeneye source hmm half life with ray tracing btw check this obscure russian game zone for artificial resources httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp351820zar rtx vs opengl rtx is not a renderer its opengl with rtx extensions or vulkan with rtx would be nice ic we could at least attempt to run it on amd cards but theyre not supported no you dont need rtx cores for ray tracing to work its just much faster i was able to get the game to play at a 3055 fps at 1080p using 1080tis in sli global illumination is a pretty hefty resource not but i can barely tell the difference between high and low godrays have to be on or you dont truly get the proper experience or you live in germany and cant buy the game or download the demo i think i have one of the few rare physical quake iv game cds in german language before they were taken off the shelves lying around quake 1 get a few years a go deleted from the blacklist finally waiting for the other quake games to get from this list of and a few more games ray tracing is a cashgrab nothing more love me or hate me but i personally prefer the look of the original and i know thats just because im a sentimental nostalgic bitch that fps drop from 1000 to 55 o o f im a filthy casual and only have quake 2 on my 360 which i still havent played but this was definitely informative with regards to multiplayer its worth noting that for americans the tastyspleen dm server has been a constant for many many many years and hopping into some deathmatch on there is a joy should come up near the top of the server list meh i dont know the old one had this dirty appearance that made everything toxic and covered in industrial waste this is too clean and shiny theres like thousands of doom 2 rtx videos explaining what has been added the whole youtube is waste of all lifestheres nothing good about it except good tutorials and maybe trailer thats it a question though half life 1 was built on heavily modified quake 2 engine is it possible to enabledevelop raytracing into half life 1 i would defo play hl1 again if it had raytracingshit i would even go and buy 2080 to do that this seems pretty cool hl2 rtx black mesa rtx would be amazing remember 97 when q2 was a benchmarking software whelp here we are again im not a flithy casual i only got my own pc last year its funny you talk about people bashing the game for it being too dark then proceed to talk about how much customisation there is to brighten it up kinda like how you hated on sigil while using gzdoom on default settings which also has light options i prefer the old orange but deffo prettier were living in the good timeline yikes these tesco value framerates d my controller is stiff am i the only one that thinks that stuff like the glossy super shotgun looks like someone smeared tons of vaseline on it nobody needed that flare gun og quake players use the pistol as a light source or see in the darkness like vampires anyways i am not getting a new gpu for this i will wait for for pciexpress 60 in 2021 before updating my rig my vr and everything runs well without ray tracing and looks great so no rush here once ray tracing is developed and utilizable by non rtx cores but simply the gpu itself then i would care meh also when slicrossfire would have done a great job for this not allowed for extra processing power because you need to by the newest best card sip yup quake was a good game also that complaint about weapon swap time can be fixed by switching to quake 3 arena challenge pro mode arena some of these areas look worse at least with their atmosphere too bright its still kind of impressive i guess do not worry on 1060 6gig i had to run the game at 720p and 5060 resolution scale to get about 5060fps performance in rtx mode the resolution is about the same as some people had to enjoy the game in originally but with dat lighting and it does look good be resolution whatever so saying 1080p 60 is bad is well it is but here i am at even worse rtx is still new and it definitely came out a little bit earlier than it should funny enough this is based on one guys path tracing experiment which was definitely very grainy or very slow but interestingly enough had generally better performance especially on old cards though there was not that much of remastering attempts or cool options in that build just quake 2 and path traced lighting rtx is pretty cool and all that but i dont understand why every graphic overhaul of old games makes every metallic surface shiny as fuck man just like back in 1997 how only beast pcs could only run quake 2 and now its quake 2 rtx hang on did i see 1000 fps in vanilla quake 2 is 1000 fps in any game even possible i just imagine multiplayer for this game to be just some guys throbbing there big expansive cocks around 2008 can your rig run crysis 2019 can your rig run quake 2 part of me is smiling at what a game like serious sam first encounter would look like with this ray tracing technology exciting times oh fuck off instead of making the current tech more accessible or more efficient theyre going to introduce this shit just so someone can gawk at some lightbeams rtx is a meme and if you bought it and youre not an eceleb you got memed hard well that got my dick hard 1000 fps to 54 fps great job nvidia if you were duped and were gouged by buying one of the 20xx turkeys this crap is just a kick in the teeth they dont want old sht from 20 yrs ago imagine crysis with ray traycing i dont own quake 2 because id have more fun poking my eyes out than playing a shooter any shooter its probably the shittiest game genre along with sports games this is a interesting program that makes quake 2 to look great but not everyone can afford an nvidia rtx video card so my recommendation for someone who wants to play quake 2 with hd graphics is quake 2 xp mod or quake 2 berserker mod both of them are free and it is only required quake 2 gog version with all the expansions to be able to play and also you can play with the soundtrack on in this 2 mods but not both at the same time it wont work at all and also you dont need an rtx video card to play the game with quake2xp mod or berserker mod any decent nvidia or ati radeon card with 2 gb vram will do this q2rtx uses 95 of q2xp and 5 of q2 path tracing that nvidia reworked so i will stick with q2xp which have the soundtrack and runs like a dream on my old 970 quake 2 not having muzzle flash on the guns is something that still bothers me greatly to this day look at this cool new doom mod i think youll love it httpsyoutubeipyq0jfgvji plz make a review give quake 1 the doom16 treatment please it deserves it now where my ray tracing for my copy of quake 2 on the 360 quake 96 uses magical coding for any lighting quake 2 rtxget 4 fps unless you set it to gl but still better off modding q2 original for music cuz it still doesnt have fucking music winquake most aesthetic but quakespasm seems best for original with music now im wondering what the hell john carmack is up to meanwhile in gtx 1060ti land i drop frames in doom 2016 on highnot max feels bad why do these companies such so much at keeping music in old games like this its such a large part of quake ii im surprised its missing in this rtx experiment at least the gog release includes the music for all quake ii expansions and original game out of the box 800 at what resolution though i would really like to see the original half life with this lol denoizing off is supposed to show you how the tech is working it is the original output of the path tracer that gets through a denoizer later to make the final image that is also the reason why the final image is blurry its based entirely from the denoized source image theres not new information added by denoizer so it has to approximate the missing pixels nvidia should take crysis 1 and give it ray traced global illumination who needs a demo when you own the original retail copy on disc although my disc is unreadable now they are only suppose to last 10 years before the disc degrades and mine has not a single scratch or smudge on the disc it looks flawless but no computer can read it anymore except for the music tracks looks nice but i still prefer the original we wouldnt even know that the weapons are firing if we werent seeing the strogg die and the ammo count go down pay attention to your gun animation or lack thereof theyre missing muzzle flashes i just hope for ray traycing on next console generation first time ive heard quake 2 and immersion mentioned together flexing ill show you flexing httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplcb7c6gbgx3zimgotgzflam7lrksvqkad flexes i cant wait to rock out with sonic mayhem again amazing tech gj nvidia but i prefer the original game render p its a glorified tech demo and not for the hardware but a very specific piece of technology they still use laughable animations for the weapon feedbacks the best part about this is maybe that it resurrects some q2 playerbase dont count on it though gman people are now running quake ii rtx as the new can it run crysis minecraft with ptgi hold my beer quad machine in the background i fucking love that ost better looking then old quake ii like this comment if your the uploader and want to agree leave a heart i hope quake 1 gets the same treatment a testament to how good quake ii really was and still is dood rtfm everything you arent sure about is explained in their manual advanced settings manual haha except those games you mentioned its only using raytracing for 1 or 2 aspects of lighting but not for all the lighting over 200 ping classic australia come on man we all know the human eye cant tell the difference of anything past 30 frames per second do you need to buy it from steam or can you use the original cd not that i ever see it happening but half life rtx im guessing your favourite weapon is the rocket launcher because you always have so little ammo for it quake 2 was the first video game i played and had so ha im sure as the years progress therell be a newer version of rtx and itll be less of bloat on the computers at that point tastyspleennet has always had players active for years httptastyspleennetquakeserverslistcgi they should have added ray tracing back in 1997 looks like the jiggle physics on the big guns are no more the triple g man think he has played every fps ever made but hell no his life wont be complete until he reviews the varginha incident a brazilian shooter from the 90s based on a local legend if you dont have 1k to blow on a card that runs rtx smoothly you can always download the q2xp mod looks way better imo i guess therell be a crysis rtx at some point now hahaha your 60vs144fps comparison was great this is actually the reason why i still use a 60hz screen because i dont wanna go higher and feel like 60fps isnt smooth because right now its perfect and i dont wanna shed out tons of money for hardware that can run all games at 144fps also many games dont support it definitely gonna stay with 60fpshz for more years i have some friends who upgraded to 144hz too and often they say that 60fps feels kind of meh and unenjoyable at times i dont wanna even start feeling like that xd since right now i am more than fine with 60fps probably because my brain doesnt know 144hz oh boy i recently play a lot on the switch and some games are 30fps and boy this is already a pain in the ass to enjoy i gotta build a new rig in the next months and wanted to snag a 2070 right now i have a 1070ti id love to see this done to dai katana now that its fixed as good as it looks i cant get over how it completely neutralizes the games original atmosphere it doesnt feel right without the handplaced static shadowmaps fuck some one has to do this with return to castle wolfenstein is there a quake ii rtx version for the nintendo 64 this was just an excuse to play quake 2 and not worry about other games like killzone shadow fall or cod i never thought that i would have to say damn i need better computer parts to play quake 2 time to reinstall quake 2and mods tried this myself on a 2070 at 2070mhz but played native 3440x1440p and 40fps hurt cool tech but kinda shows how very far we are from fully taking advantage of it honestly i had more hopes for dlss 2x i preordered the rtx2080 because the 70 was sold out and im impressed with it playing doom2016 with a gtx1070 at max settings 4k gave me 45fps while the rtx gave me 93fps tops at double the price of the 1070 from when i bought it was worth it to me the 1070 was 450 when i bought it looks like a tech demo built from a game that is easy to work with also maybe a set up for a new game doom pulled it off i recorded a video using my 1080 ti it was a terrible idea rip in peace pascal the rtx version of the railgun looks better imo we did guies we achieved real time ray tracing now it may not matter to many people but it mattered to me back in 2003 when the idea was experimented on quake 3 and you wanted realtime precision lighting reflections and shadows fyi ray tracing is a lighting algorithm for a graphical engine thats used to render cgi films it was never intended to be in real time just calculate real lighting and reflections but now we have the technology to make it real time its impressive this is my favorite quake love to leave gore and bodies behind lol oh god what the fuck did they do to the railgun its gross i am looking forward to the tech improving and prices eventually coming down something like quake ii rtx is enough to get me on board but not at current levels of performance and price damn that new double barrel shotgun model looks like shit raise your hand if you played this on mplayer in the 90s b4 quake 3 released bruh im glad you included the quake soundtrack on this video i still play it in my cars sound system full blast on my way to work in the mornings i know this is an unpopular opinion but i way preferred quake 2 to the first game hey gggman your thoughts on what other fps should get rtx treatment its got nvidias taint on it even with quake2 that taint aint worth it im not paying that snake oil company anything for anything they ever could possibly make screw nvidia ill just stick w berserkerquake2 that isnt a resource stealer 507 1000 fps 50 fps or 15 fps on my gtx 1060 quake 2 rtx is good and all but i just want a duke nukem 3d remaster and with other old games having remasters its even more painful omg my favorite quake game remade instant downl rip my computer 2014potato it just wast good enough battlefield 5s ray tracing tech was used for screen space reflections low res not lighting unless it was introduced in a patch recently but that was the only original implementation of ray tracing tech in bfv only metro out of the 3 games that came with rtx features uses ray tracing for illumination i think a lot of people think that old graphics are what made old games so good and so make retro style games with old graphics but those games feel empty this rtx version of quake 2 proves that it isnt old graphics that make a game good its so much else ray traceeverything like seriously id have no problem with that id be interested to see someone fiddle with the settings to get this as close to the original as possible all of the footage ive seen despoil the atmosphere of the original not happy about that this looks great it makes me crave a remake of unreal with the same treatment this was my first youtube video absolutely no fucking idea what im doing as you can tell you should take a look at blood fresh supply its a total modernization of blood giving true 3d modeling better textures lighting etc and improving the controls and overall performance of the game rt on all classic games thats what we need quake ii rtx joe rogan has joined the podcast so this definitely wouldnt function on a gtx 770 right lmfao ugh man i need to upgrade please review katana zero i would really like to see your opinions on it remember when people used crysis to test their new graphics cards yeah well people are running quick ii what an odd time to be alive so it seems so it seems lol im a poor fucker cant do this they didnt add muzzle flashes 1000 fps 54 fps the only thing that actually piqued my interest was the comparisons here and then noticing eye glow literally i was like holy shit their eyes can glow i remember testing my new graphics cards on og quakequake 2 pshh rtx looks great and all but personally i think it ruins the whole 90s feel of the game like the zdoom dynamic lighting or the 20th anv world tour for duke 3d i just stick with original lighting for both games ill check out the mod but i mean i probably wont play it a lot but my opinion aside great video as usual triple g so you ruin the original mood and thats it intresting but i rather use quake 2 xp with the weapon remodel and monster skin pack i can see a quake 2 hd remaster now in ids mind oh wait theyre not like bethesda no muzzle flash is really freaking me out please fix sips yeah quake ii rtx was a good remaster 8700k i upgraded to that from a 4770k so i say 8770k all the time incorrectly too quake 2 was already a tech demo with no depth it just looks shiny now hooray wouldve liked to see the same treatment on deus ex or system shock 2 is this your full time job nowdays hey gg what about a hd mod for quake 2 ray traced minecraft is where its at thief could greatly benefit from this way of lighting the good news is that nvidia has an upcoming line of super versions of rtx 2000 series cards so prices for regular cards will go down and performance will go up for the highest end someone please give brutal doom these graphics how are you getting that frame rate rtx 2080 with ray tracing off 1000 fps on 30 fps so in 5 years when i will upgrade my gaming laptop the 1st game i will play is quake 2 ray tracing huh what are you talking about rtx vs opengl rtx isnt a graphics framework is it i suspect it uses opengl 748 when are we going to see crysis with ray tracing thatd be the ultimate gpu melting test shouldve remastered quake 1 drek i recognized most of these maps i played quake ii when it originally came out and bought it again on gog a two years ago i still had to patch one of the expansion packs to get save to work damn that sexy meh we have seen more impresive quake2 hd mods without the need of a new card loved quake 1 but quake 2 was just garbage this is a classic example of modern day tech making something already great even better what a wild world we all live in good way to maintain good old games for future generations the graphics look kind of cheesy in my opinion gmanlives i want to play quake ii rtx mutliplayer quake ii rtx servers shwacked i wonder if this kind of tech would only further enhance the lighting in doom 3 really the only reason they allow you to turn off the denoiser is to show off how amazing their denoiser is getting such a clear image with such few samples is really impressive i hardly recognize most of the areas amazing how different it looks i dont like the new blood i liked that pulp fiction reference eh i prefer the original quake ii over this since it just looks like a shiny piece of polygons well i dont need all of that cause i like games not because of graphics but because of gameplay im still playing retro 8 bit games from nes on virtualnes emulator and having fun so do you think i care about all this rtx thing for me who was growing up playing video games back in 2007 2008 on low settings with 30 25 fps any game without rtx would look like with rtx cause i got used to graphics from ps1 style someone could say that im just degrading well dude you dont even try to live in my asshole so stfu but yeah i will press that like button just to support gman despite the fact that he has enough support without my ass well thank u for playing but no music part is killing mei mean i loved to listen to this in my car thats why my origanal cd dont work anymore and game came before steam so good luck geting it work now id still rather have my 1080ti over any 2080 i will get ray tracing card when 7nm is a thing next year the game looks good but not worth the price heck the 2080ti is only 30 faster than the 1080ti and costs nearly double ray tracing can suck a fat one till you can play it at 1440p 120 fps game looks worse and less atmospheric in every single one of those examples boo the hd textures kill the color pallet as always weirdly you dont need a rtx card to see this stuff it will work on a 10 series card i want rtx for quake 1 its path tracing nice report i think i like the best the fact that in one second you can change the feeling of the appearance of a level just by changing the position of the sun it allows to the developer to have a formidable time saving tool i wonder if there is a way to get unreal 2 and goldsrc games to be rtx imagine halflife and postal 2 in hd i play this on 640x480 with 90 fps just like in the good old days sip jokes aside it runs great on 720p with my gtx 1080 idk man q2 is shit compared to q1 q2 doesnt even have airstrafe et the video game but with ray tracing this amazing new technology can run quake 2 at 55fps sucks that you have to go from 1000fps to 56fps cant wait until this tech is better performing totally not buying an rtx card until i have to but this does look sweet raytracing doom when they should remaster half life 1 with this software rendering on quake 2 is the future they had to go back and replace around 3000 textures game is built off of the quake2xp engine and uses most of their assets in addition to the rtx renderer best benefit to this was definitely the updated weapon models 2 years ago we didnt even have any that remotely stood out unreal gold and unreal tournament should the rtx treatment next the good ol quake 2 now we are talking i watch your channel for the retro shit quake 2 huh so what i can run this on my multimedia laptop with integrated graphics card cool doesnt look pretty or realistic and the art direction of the original game is totaly lost btw neither bf5 or metro utilise rtx properly same odd looking reflections and the surfaces cowered by oil cant even tell if they used that physically based lighting either almost no difference shilling for nvidia now huh still cant beat my first time with a voodoo p sooo this is the only game rtxs can run above 60 d and ive got quake 2 on a disc how casual is that fucking hell you can tell a massive difference its time for quake touch rtx i wonder if it will fry my phone i have quake 2 on gog fuck u you know whats bothering me the shiny reflections arent right they just arent it bothers me so much they dont consider the fresnel effect which makes them look fake especially when you look at them as a somewhat of a 3dmodellingrendering artist so they removed the red sky and made it look generic quake ii why not quake imagine those dark castles and hellish mazes with raytracing or even half life and halo nice a review of this that doesnt feature absolutely atrocious gameplay yeah greatyou talk about it like its nothing you need a 600 graphic card to have all this enabled and running 60 fps i remember seeing a video somewhere on here a little while ago during the rtx testing it looked very solid though i didnt understand anything until i looked into the comments xd it looks a little better though the focus is a bit blurred as you mentioned so its hard for someone like me who already has bad vision to look at the screen thinking theyre gonna have to shell out a few hundred for an eye doctor visit ill be honest as much as i love the look and feel of the new world visuals and how realistic it is with this feature i find myself appreciating the older textures during the beforeafter demonstration especially the skybox the desolate reds and blacks still add to the vibe that stroggos gives of course this is just a quake fan appreciating a quake game so i guess its all just a side note lol honestly i think it looks like garbage the lighting may be good quality sure but overall it looks like a shitty fanmade unity version of quake ii seeing the new weapon models why was the railgun completely changed up next to the extremely polygonal level design and enemies makes it look like the classic level secrets in doom 2016 i really want to see quake 1 with this sort of visual update tldr is just a tech demo in no way this objectively enhances the game so if youre no graphics snob then dont even bother ray tracing is the future but is still somewhat early and it still looks too dated for my tastes nowadays loved it back when it came out though i swear im not a casual i just only own quake ii on the playstation ive always preferred dynamic lights and shadow effects over high res textures and the like as this video demonstrates even with relatively minor enhancements in terms of texture resolution the effects of proper lighting shine through even something as simple as a projectile lighting the area around it like in unreal or tribes iirc can create an atmosphere all its own hell even ancient shooters like doom benefit from global and point lights in the source ports without a single shadow or reflection in sight although they did pretty well with the sector lighting of the time both expansions ground zero and the reckoning dont work in rtx version one wont start the game and another has broken entities and scripts which makes it unplayable shame they were very fun expansions back in the days rtx the thing you turn on when making pretty screenshotsandturn off when you actually want to play the game denoising off shows you the real image the engine generates using all your hardware resources yes thats right denoising on turns on the tensor cores accelerated neural networks based algorithm that guesses what that image should look like without all the noise the imperfections of that guess cause the blurriness youre experiencing but the acceleration makes it possible to play this in realtime its a trade off but its not going to change much even a decade from now whats going to change is the amount of global illumination light bounces it maybe is difficult for you to notice them in quake 2 but its exactly how film cgi became so damn convincing at least with the architecture and vehicles which is why imo raytraced gi will become the main feature of the next gen consoles for those without an rtx gpu you can still get a damn good looking quake 2 experience in the form of quake2xp it has some shortcomings compared to raytracing such as the reflections are screenspace and get culled if you dont have them in view but it still looks really good any plans for doing this on the build engine imagine duke 3d in this engine it would be like 2000 duke forever look how they replaced the old 3d explosions with new flat sprites lol quake ii rtx is decidedly unimpressive the old opengl version was more impressive and a bigger change from the base game they should have used highres textures or something at the very least they needed to implement better bumpmapping or something umsoeas shader makes minecraft look photorealistic this still looks like a game rt is a great for remastering there will be allot older games that can benefit from this tech i wanna see those rtx reflections in mirrors edge catalyst i mean at a certain point in the game levels are made of glass only imagine ray tracing on crysis 1 this is really neat since half life 2 was an amd sponsored title i wonder if valve will have an upgraded version of hl2 when amd comes out with their ray tracing this version brings multiplayer support so does the og quake 2 and coop was added in 12 maybe one day ill have a computer powerful enough to run quake 2 question can you make the red sky emit red light because in every video i see orange blue and green my problem with rtx is how overly reflective and shiny it is its not realistic and it looks terrible look at the weapon 228 like seriously why is it so shiny did he rub it in lube or what sonny jim i expect you to be critical next game weirdly enough i think the original game looks better or at least more atmospheric bethesda should remake quake 2 they could do so much with all these half mech cyborg martian creatures the designs will look insane with how far graphic design have come quake 4 was a disappointment in my opinion bethesda needs to do the quake title some justice by creating from scratch game and use a new engine to show how far the gaming industry has come this rtx is enough inspiration for a mettle game like quake to be given another go its just got that game style you cant give up even though you keep loosing quake 4 felt to linear and hand fed the level to you blood 2 rtx when dont even try it unless u have a rtx 2070 or above makes the non rtx cards look so crap like a gtx 1080ti gives 720p low settings at 30fps crack sip yup quake raytracing is a good remaster that fps count in the comparisons 1000fps down to 60ish fps dang wait a minute what did they do to my railgun they made it look like some kinda laser gun from star trek or something ohhh my poor baby high global illumination settings increase light bounce from 1 to 2 and it can make a big differenc in certain dark areas these areas will be more lit and not totally dark denoising in rtx is just to show how much details are lost thanks to filtering what happened to the upcoming turok 3 review no offence the lighting looks amazing but in my opinion it ruins the tone of the game i think its outright black magic that we even have hardware capable of realtime raytracing at 60fps at all i mean this is straight up futuretech were talking about here it wasnt even supposed to be a thing for another few years so on that front people complaining about the performance are kind of underestimating just how much of an achievement it is life is complete twenty years later weve finally managed to get quake 2 looking like unreal did back in the day a graphics update for quake 2 that still doesnt add muzzle flash to the shotguns and machine guns thats super lame the reason this is so amazing is that its essentially 100 path traced and virtually no rasterization everything is rendered via real time dynamic lighting f this shiti want to see a thief dark project rtx remix looks nice but the outside natural light changes it for the worse imo i never imagined stroggos to be so bright and sunny my second fav shooter after fear glad to see it recieve some love that game is always forgotten for some reason despiste being excelent whats the best way to play quake 1 on modern systems shwacked a conversation in 2019 my rig has an amazing setup its like a miniature god yeah but can it run quake 2 but dont you need to have the rtx card so my 1080 wont run it so question where would someone download the full game unless nvadia is only gonna do the first few maps also a simple day and night cycle can really make the feel of a map different or even change the look of a map in battlefield 4 there is a night time version of a single map amd it may not seem a whole lot the night time really changes the feel holy crap this looks amazing and people said rtx was only a gimmik and wouldnt take off they were wrong yet another great innovation by nvidia but 1000 down to 60 fps is concerning still cant wait to try this game on my 2080ti d going back to 60fps back in my day we were happy to get double digit fps at all advantage of cylindrical camera is that you get less stretching at high fov than with flat regular camera are there more camera options like spherical or barrel distortion some corridors have oddly dark ceilings as if the nearby lights have global illumination disabled the light created by the railgun beam is a bit disappointing you can clearly see its multiple spherical point lights created along the beam the right option would be a cylindrical area light along the beam the shiny material on the weapons looks very odd the reflections looks way too bright compared to the indirect light in the room great video as always really enjoyed watchinglistening to this its only when they announced that rtx was coming to an older title like this that it really grabbed my attention as said id love to see this implemented on more older titles eg quake 1 unreal etc hey gman will you pls review turok evolution for the original xbox or even the gamecube since they are the better versions of the game or could you try again to make it run on your computer it only needs more an better blood splashes i dunno when you show the comparisons between the original and new version i think the original looks better almost every time more contrast and deliberate lighting quake ii can you imagine if ray tracing can be used with unreal 1998 hopefully valve wake up and do something like this for halflife 12 they could have slapped the ray tracing in far cry 3 or crysis since it has shitty lighting to showcase so you paid 1000 to get raytracing on a 22 year old game nice will more old game have this tho that is the question what card did you have before nvidias donation for someone whos coming from a low end card 1050ti would it be better to upgrade to 10701080 or go directly to rtx is the cost of rtx cards justified at the moment imagine duke 3d polymer with ray tracing i own quake 2 but i dont own an rtx graphics card for this wow this looks like garbage i mean come on who cares ray tracing isnt going to be mainstream anytime soon and i really dont like you shilling any of this crap nvidia is desperate to sell these cards yet theres no real value for ray tracing at the moment its going to be directx10 all over again with one game available crysis 1 and with ray tracing you get a whole whopping zero games if you were stupid enough to waste money on a first gen ray tracing video card kys the original game just looks plain better in a couple of those comparisons specifically the 1st and 3rd ones this speaks to how amazing the original texture and lighting design really was and you cant really replace that with an automated lighting system no matter how advanced id go so far as to say some of the new texture design looks objectively shit and amateurish like they couldnt be bothered to match the quality of the original design and just had to crap something out that had modern materials the engine could work with the art on the door to the final room of the first level is a good example with its expertly drawn organic tubing replaced by some random noise some of that is impressive but carmack put a lot of time and effort into figuring out how to achieve a passable knock off of those effects ever since quake 1 for a very good reason precision in lighting isnt as necessary as fluidity of motion and the believable of a less intensive solution figuring out a shortcut is way more important than brute forcing it id have been a lot more impressed if nvidia or anyone else had managed to do something similar with quake 4 or quake wars im not sold on this being a worthwhile thing especially right now because quake 2 is a very simple and i think poor example of this fully real time raytracing isnt quite here yet a hybrid of the rasterizing and raytracing might work but this smells like ati truform great tech but just a bit too early and a similar gigantic framerate hit in quake 2 i kinda want to know what quake one would look like with ray tracing now or half life yea nah im running amd and i never liked how nvidia ruin everything and this what is the point making this so the few people how change card like socks can play i dont see it and i dont care i had the reverse opinion this game proved to me that rt is not ready yet and nvidia is making gamers pay for its development in advance quake2 with less that 60 fps were it will hit a 1000fps if you turn that off rt will happen but its not ready for prime time yet if only i wasnt the financial equivalent of a 13th century peasent it looks weird makes the strogg planet look too sunny im having nvidia physix deja vu it looked cool back then but later on it got forgotten same can happen to ray tracing so dont get overhyped for no reason now we need crysis rtx d i just want to say that what remains of edith finch is amazing now we just need one for unreal its like real life with papercraft building denoise is only there to show you what the raw ray tracing results look like the blur normalization is done after its only in there for render geeks as far as i understand this game is completly rendered in rtx so rays are shot from light sources and bounce into your camer eyes the denoising is meant to give you the final picture wo it it shows how many rays are used when changing settings rather deactivate the denoising so you see the rtx ray difference i dont own an rtx i am fine with my 1070ti amp extreme and will always own my 970 if i ever buy a crt from sony for old games or to see the endless glow xd retroconsolegaming so what old 3d game would you like to have the rtx treatment cheers q2rtx reminds me of a dank source mod wishing my pc didnt have 7 year parts the denoising setting is so you can see what the raw output of the raytracing looks like because of the relatively low sample count before its ai denoised its not meant to be played that way the cylindrical projection is presumably so you can record 360 degree videos i wanna see this implemented in unreal so my take is i wont be running this on my old 20 college laptop image is blurry because there are not enough rays per pixel to form a full image hence the spotty image without denoiser and denoiser is essentially a temporal algorithm to accumulate those ray samples over time to give you a full image cylindrical perspective is a benefit of raytracing as such projection is not really possible with classic rasterization and it allows you to have 360 degree fov without any issues global illumination setting defines numbers of bounces each light ray does before it terminates beyond low it adds secondary reflections on shiny surfaces like metal from 1000fps to 54 tho kinda like looking through the window of michelin star restaurant damn the food looks tasty but im fucked if i can afford to eat there man when you talked about settings i thought you were gonna mention totalbiscuit rip i kinda like the original graphics better it had a weird charm to it well f me dead now i wanna see unreal with path tracing that game better used lighting even back in the day they should have done this with painkiller this really needs quake 2 xp textures ill wait until the rtx 30xx or 40xx series until upgrading from my 1080 this doesnt seem worth it yet best soundtrack in an fps if you somehow dont own quake 2 yeah welcome to germany really wish they kept the old railgun design though the quake 2 railgun looks so bad ass with its exposed insides thick metal shell and the big ass wire coming out of it i dont like the reflective barrels but im sure its an option to turn it off oh quake 2 theres an id shooter ive always wanted to see re made from the ground up hopefully this sells well showing id that the invasion of strogos deserves a modern retelling fucking ray tracing and they couldnt be bothered to include muzzle flash on the minigun xd screams in filthy casual german cuz not being able to own quake2 got a 1070 gtx i7 7700k and 64gb of ram and get like 6 fps ray tracing must be some pretty powerful tech i just hope we dont have too many games using it in the near future im not ready to upgrade my gpu just yet cause its only 2 years old quake 2 rtx will net nvidia thousands of pounds and dollarsthe tech is too expensive in its current statebut its a carrot to dangle in front of hungry gamers with too much money to burn itll be in all games eventuallyjust be patientno need to break the bank for something thatll be everywhere within a few years edit just think of all the replayability this will provide every game from our childhoods will be remastered itll be comparable to the move from vhs to dvd well be rebuying everything again ping less than 200 look at this lpb thats impressive and all but can it play doom cant wait to see civvie11s fans call you out for ignoring all the inconsistencies of this remaster compared to original i consider quake ii rtx a big advertisement for 20xx gpus and not even a good one at that everything this remake does can be achieved with conventional source ports and mods and they arguably even look better than the raytraced version q2rtx looks blurry and only runs comparatively well on rtx 2060 and above you know raytracing isnt relevant yet when amd says they dont care about adding rtx support to navi gpus i prefer quake 1 tho can it run quake 2 rtx i think all the changes ruins the atmosphere of the game just look at those cool red skyboxes it looks sinister this just makes it look like a overdone unity game in comparison its neat but they could have done a better job of using their lighting engine in the context of the original artstyle or they could have just picked another game entirely halflife 1 is next maybe too bad they got the worst quake to remake you can call me a filthy casual all youd like gman but unlike gothic horror scifi was never my scene and not having trent reznorpowered soundtrack meant quake 2 and so on never had any luster for me i really hope they do just about the same for quake 1 thatd be the shiet edit i did say scifi isnt my thing but doom is because well its fucking doom sadly i cant disagree more the water was drawn and had a unique look same in quake 1 and doom the lighting is only pretty but it removes more of the color and shape going from all those small shadow details to now making entire walls blank and bright with nothing on them its like a unity asset pack without any lighting its all just bland 105 look at that theres no fucking shadows or details on the ground or upper floor its just empty and ugly the volumetric beams are the only good thing other then that they ruined the game the guns are also ruined the super shotgun was a super shotgun it took up half the screen with giant barrels with that loud sound and massive particle effects with huge impact now it looks like the starting shotgun in quake 1 and wtf did they do to the railgun the particles arent as big anymore and they lack the omph you got then hitting enemies in a cloud of blood and guts the entire thing feels like 2d hand drawn backgrounds to open 3d as far as q2 remasters go berserker quake 2 is highly recommended it looks fucking horrible half life rtx would be awesome imagine the gluon gun lighting up the room when fired i hope old school fps graphics briefly become the norm so that rtx is more smoothly implemented 1000fps 60fps its pretty good but its a shame they didnt remade it in full when they had a chance quake ii remake would be incredible i would like to see what rtx would do for doom 3quake 4 enabling rtx will cost you jus 1000fps no big deal they should have chosen doom 3 instead this wont fix that quake ii is pretty mediocre compared to the two games it sits between 1000 fps to 55 fps id really prefer original quake with rtx it was interesting gothic architechture and all quake 2 was boring is a petrol station where someone would go to revulcanize their tires kinda weird when the gun shoot it kinda like it shooting air in certain guns am i the only one who thinks this looks ugly they should have added muzzle flashing to the guns so that they would also illuminate that framerate drop tho eh rtx is still too early most people turn shadows and lighting down and crank everything else i admit it looks good but it should have been first brought out on a titan or something something to warrant the huge price make it clear it is only for rich whales who can throw money away i fucking own quake 2 on cd jesus that fov why no muzzle flash someone should implement rtx into the original doom what a pointless ass video lmao when you went from 1000 fps to 55 what if you own an og disk based copy and steam doesnt support it how much of a filthy casual am i then are you sure your brightness levels were ok with opengl it can be a problem with old quake engine games and 64 bit os shame on me for not owning quake 2 bro the game is still indexed in this amazing progressive country that is germany wellcome to a new era of but can it run insert game with rtx ok the thief trilogy with ray tracing just imagine the pure fucking beauty that could be pulled off especially in deadly shadows with morias mansion with the lightning and tinted windows and the real steampunk heavy levels with the raw electricity and such it would probably take some pure black magic to make it work on the dark engine though btw i just now realize is doom and quake in the same universe this is just silly why quake 2 doesnt make much sense to use this game to showoff brand new tech rtx is a flop said it once said it a million times quake 2 without the music is only half a game thanks steam actually the demo has a lot more enemies in the first level if you play it on hard or nightmare how is that casual though i would have liked it if they kept the red skies but this is still awesome i wonder how the makron fight looks i love quake 2 and this mod is nice but some of textures are just too shiny and didnt the chain gun give off bursts of light when it fired in the original you think they would muzzle flash everybody else look at how rtx changes the lighting water and particle effects me wait it looks like they fixed the wobbliness caused by a lack of skeletal animation im still mad that they didnt remaster quake 1 or 3 instead this is an absolute bean of a move i like some of the visuals though the overuse of mirrorchromesurfaces makes everything look too techdemoesque for my taste now can we please have this but for quake 1 unreal 1998 would probably look dope af theres currently a mod for crysis that adds ray tracing runs a little shit and there are some glitches that need to be fixed but it looks cool anyways wow this is kinda ugly x3 i used to own the whole quake trilogy i have no idea where that disc disappeared to and now buying that on disc is just expensive sucks it fucking sucks having denoising toggle matters more for people that know how cg works when rendering static image a number of rays is shoot to the object the more rays is shoot per pixel less noise it produce but takes much longer to compute and since rtx does all of that in realtime its done by low amount of rayssamples and then filtered out for smoother image for now i expect in the future for this tech to develop the point where denoising will be either minimal or even disabled completely the image will be so sharp that you could cut yourself with it quake 25 rtx when funny that nvidia themselves are confirming with this demo that taking moores law into account rtx like this wont be a achievable until ca 2030 i need a mod that improves q2 itself thoughno for real i just fail to enjoy this game so many times time for half life rtx so im guessing that my rtx 2060 card will have a bigger problem running this version of quake ii since you said that you had performance issues on your 2070 card right i used to have quak 2 but didnt like it as much as the first i believe ray tracing and data oriented programming will be the equalizers between aaa studios and indies because they give us incredible visuals and performance by default without the need of hiring an army of engineers and then indies will win with creativity and better engagement of the community also i dont know if the rtx port includes a server browser but if it doesnt you can try q2serverscom unless they changed something to make it only playable using the steam network it should be compatible what an odd time to be alive indeed well tracing every single ray of light and calculating what it does along the way from the source to the pov in realtime is supposed to be a resource hog back in the 90s the days of 486 cpus and no video cards worth to mention i watched 3d studio render a single frame line by line for hours how far weve come only 25 years later quake 2 not availible in germany only q1 and quake champions now russian can be happy because they always go for the lightning effects in games yeah can your pc run quake ii rtx my potato cant omg doom with rey tracing bethesda better not mess it up by ignoring steam i swear to god lol its hilarious that this is whats finally convinced me to upgrade my 18 yo laptop quake2xp is not as impressive as this but it give quake2 a nice fresh look and you dont have to sell your mom to run it nice video btw no muzzle flashes yet i wish they did this to sound too its existing technology its just not very popular its also quite resourceintensive nvidia is trying too hard with this one i mean rtx has been a bit of a flop this gen i hope they keep working on it though jez though quake 2 youre are not sure if it justifies buying an rtx um well no it does most certainly not not hating but quake 2 taking a expensive card to make it look pretty is straight out of 97 i really liked the blood red sky on quake 2 uh i had better fps in q2 when it launched atmos in open gl are way better imo good review but i think you missed the point of denoiser i should remind you that the man behind this fork of quake 2 are making this for the purpose of showcasing the possibilities of raytracing not as a production game so the denoiser setting here are for developers thats interested in the technology not casual player it shows the big difference between the noisy and denoised frame and the performance impact hope this clear things up quake 2 has always and will forever be my favorite game of all time am i the only one around here that didnt like quake 2 at all the games which used the engine itself were much better just you wait for crysis with full ray tracing support that will make the can it run crysis statement true again severance blades of darkness please review this game im surprised people dont know about it i tried the quake ii rtx on my 1070 60fps 1080 sounds pretty nice after what i went through 70 render scale of 720p with low gi and i was getting frames in the mid40s denoising is the game essentially choosing the what rays would be most effective to cast since there is only a limited amount of rays to go around for a pixel to take turning this off makes the game just throw the latest ray available with no calculations to find out weather its necessary you should take a look at quake2xp i think it gives this new rtx version a run for its money filthy casual you mean like someone who complains that sigil is too hard is anyone elses brain bothered by the lack of muzzle flashes looks fantastic but that performance drop is huge mods like berserkerquake 2 dont look as good but are still huge upgrades at less cost ive heard that the 1080ti which i have can only do about 30fps at 720p yuck great vid though denoise off is so you can see the raw path tracing data before the renderer smooths it out its just there to see the tech behind the tech demo wolfenstein youngblood also have ray tracing funny thing is when quake 2 first came out i was blown away by the lighting bought a 2080ti in order to play games maxed out at 3440x1440100hz installed quake2 rtx and saw 25fps phuk this tech too early for mainstream i would take 60fps over raytracing any day of the week now i guess we will be asking the question cool pc man but can it run quake 2 rtx this should be called ode to nvidia gimpworks fuckery the noise thing is for debugging or those curious to see the tech that noise is the actual current raytracing even years ago prerendering raytracing was so heavy they came up with a cheat rendering and or calculating just half or soeven less of the pixels it should but in a pattern that can be unoticeable under the right conditions in the case of rtx it is very noticeable the raw raytracing but theres a algorithmfilter that reads everything raytracing the noisy parts and smooth the gaps denoising its somewhat similar to some tech used to upscale games to 4k on consoles chekerboard rendering if im not mistaken in the real world every ray of light bounces of other surfaces countless times on a computer that would mean every pixel that is lighted every single one would mean a invisible ray hiting geometry bouncingreflecting on others various times each ray updated 60 or more times per second so it updates to every change in real time its too much not man i would love seeing something like unreal with this treatment that game did have some really great environments imagine thief 2 with raytracing never was a fan of quake 2 i was disappointed that they dropped the medieval lovecraftian themes and replaced them with generic space crap i mean quake ii was a better tech demo than an actual game when it came out so its only fitting interesting and sweet project still they might use the time and resources for new quake for the love of god bring unreal tournament rtx anyone reflect that the fps drops from 1000fps to 57fps during the comparison s really shows how infant this technology is i still have the org box and game on disc d i dont know i dont really see the appeal of rtx idk the super realistic reflections just clash hard with any sort of real artstyle whats next doom 3 rtx too bad it doesnt support software ray tracing on my gtx 1070ti looks really cool though denoising is more technical look behind the curtains its how it is rendered pathtracing then the denoiser works its magic real question is classic doom with rtx when its so cool about being pc master race i can spend thousands on graphics card to play 20 year old game with better textures and effects new reason to play quake 2 for 389 time oh wait im pretty sure denoising is what makes the game look soft even on 100 res scale also there have been games with real time ray tracing for quite a whileeven before the rtx cards came out its just most people didnt know about real time ray tracing games or didnt have the hardware for it doesnt matter how they change it quake 2 was always a great game id just know how to do it with some minor exceptions you really need an rtx card to get the full performance out of an rtx game yes they made it so that normal card owners can check out ray tracing right now but its a dog to run just like you experienced edit since they are essentially emulating the capabilities of a true rtx card no you dont need to buy a 2080 ti to run it i think their rtx 2060 will run something like this game just fine and that costs much less than a high end gtx card just wanted to point that out edit it looks like an rtx 2060 runs about 350 to 400 bucks it looks fucking good but it sort lost that industrial dark feel of the original glquake 60fps on powermac g3 now make sin with ray tracing developers i dont know man despite all of that raytracing features game looks somehow boring or maybe im just too used to old lowres textures and baked lighting i never played q2 i thought the lack of muzzle flashes is some kind of recording error now i just found out your guns dont have muzzle flashes so why these visual updates do the smoke and blood particles look like shitty ms paint spray can tool looks pretty cool in the outdoor areas otherwise i dont see the difference looks shit lets face it kids gaming and e3 is over shill kys fag god damn that sound track as epic now as it was 22 years ago imagine how amazing games like halflife turok and halo would look with ray tracing weve got to find gman a reasonable price 2080ti everyone get on ebay now would love to see the orginal doom games with ray tracing xd dont shame me for not having quake 2 i cant buy it in germany ill stick with my 1080 ti not sure if its the video capture but the gamma looks off and the anisotropic filtering looks disabled i just never enjoyed quake 2 the weapons feel like they are firing a dandy fops handkerchiefs at brick walls ray tracing in real time yet no shadows on the enemies theres barely even shadows at all honestly it barely surpasses classic 2000s era lighting its cool but to me quake 2 xp looks a bit more varied and deep and that frame rate is unacceptable the day cycle thing sounds awesome though gman did you play mdk if not you should and make a video on it d did the mod creators say if they are going to work on making the original thief into ray tracing i remember seeing this on the news before being launched back in 97 and how they were saying violence in video games blah blah fuckin great game gonna boot this back up on my rtx2080 also this is a great canditate for a reboot like how the new doom ended up fucking amazing look how they massacred my boy for me personally rtx is not worth it yet im not sold on this tech in this first iteration of it theres stuff to be optimized surely i might go for a 2nd gen or something when this becomes a mainstream thing but not now thats just me though this is just a 10 minute video of gman flexing on us this is really cool sucks you need a rtx card though im stuck with a gtx 960 4gb im spraying hot sticky white cum all over the screen in sheer excitement and youre probably wondering what the bfg looks like well ill show ya gets a doom eternal ad i want to download it i really want but it is a shame it is not possible to download it in germany greetings from germany man this really brings back good memories the one thing that always bugged me about quake 2 though was the weapons really didnt have a good feel to them they all sounded somewhat subdued if that makes any sense maybe the bfg and the plasma gun were ok but the rest didnt really have any oomph to them will the gman agree with me i know he often mentions the feel of weapons in games what do you think sonny jim edit ill just come out and say it they sounded wimpy p shit im early uh quake was great looking at the time now this this is crazy oh so its a aaa minecraft shader hell yeah all this rtx made this look like a lego game d 046 is the muzzle of the hyperblaster really supposed to be shiny like that though i cant really remember to be honest but i think it was a more mutedmat finish rather than the what almost looks like chrome on the rtx modded version i still love the whole rtx q2 mod though i cant wait to try it out someday real men play it with rtx on low and turn it down to 640x480 for 60fps and the true quake 2 experience on a 1060gtx and an i7 960 of course smooth as silk 60fpsnoice i have an alienware area 51 with a core i9 extreme and a rtx 2080ti 32gb ddr4 frankly i like having the 2080ti but ray tracing simply hasnt given me a reason to have it the reason i love it however is because it can run 100 of the games on the market in 4k ultra on my 34 curved monitor well beyond 100fps my problem with quake 2 rtx is the ambient lighting is too bright being darker toned gave the game a survival horror feel now its a goddamn light show its more than 20 years later and this game is blocky as fuck still they could have smoothed out the characters quake 2 still had the best multiplayer deathmatch ever welp imma go and play the heck out of this how you doing gmanlives when announcedggman definitely going to review this now look like its dream come true haha yay first comment love your reviews gmanlives theyre honest and gives me a hint of what and what not to buy keep up with the reviews mate they are very helpful thank you 1996 senator palpatine to quake 1 we will watch your career with great interest review cold winter please ya promised me mate how many voodoo cards do i need in sli to play this it is actually interesting to go back to 1997 because it is like we are taking a few steps back just to only leap forward to see over the years the kind of games that can come out to where it will eventually be the norm it reminds me of the tech demos from nvidia at the time even now it is still interesting to look at but what would i know i love n6490s graphics altogether quake 4doom ray tracing how much did nvidia pay you its also amazing for people who do 3d modeling the render time is so much faster in blender with rtx enabled that i literally couldnt believe it when i first tried it most people prefer nvidia over amd because of the efficiency at least the buyers that have to pay their own bills monthly i sold pc parts and systems and made configurations for normal people and companies for 4 years and its the one reason that came up the most but isnt this amd card powerhungry sadly nvidia still only has proprietary drivers honestly who gives a shit its a miniscule effect that disproportionately hampers performance at this point in development this tech is just gimmicky garbage used to make your parents spend even more money on expensive hardware for no good reason this whole video is just a pathetic attempt to manipulate you into buying a new gpu you dont need half of it is spent taking about buying a new gtx anyway dont fall for this crap but thats screen space reflections i loove the idea of spending effort on lighting instead of textures this is an enabler this game run in the directx 12 i was thinking these graphics cards would most benefit people doing largescale renders on blender or similar things because they could probably save days of rendering compared to other graphics cards of the same price im not completely sure though there is a minecraft shader called seus wich you can download for free you can run it on mid tier graphics cards on 1x lighting and while yes you can notice the pixels in the shadows showing you that the rays are actually pretty big but you can only see it if you look for it on the positive side i can run it on my rx580 at 50fps ray tracing on an amd rx580 at 50fps while playing hypixel skywars in a couple of years this will look like a caveman discovers fire thats a load of bullshitsstop talking nonsence about things you dont understant 2kliksphilipyou look like fkin imbecil then i think nividia just made these the 2000 series cards just to get rtx to be the name of raytracing since amd and microsoft who is getting their dxr capable hardware in consoles the future developers should adopt dxr and forget nvidias rtx and everyone that dosent know any better will call it rtx instead of dxr but i dunno computer updated nvidia shill gotta shill somehow rtx the technology that is cool but not worth 1000 raw noise free film grain effect surprised they didnt cash in on that too will be great in vr where all imperfections of current lighting systems are more obvious also will make larger bodies of water look more realistic as of now the still water reflections are so bad its jarring by the water edges ray trace duke nukem rubbish thats fake rt or incomplete at least people dont understand how fucked up current light effects are they are so fake and shit rtx is a glimpse into the future of proper realistic rendering will their ever be real time radiosity i tried it on my 1070 good god did it chug but it was beautiful excellent video tired to hear that rt is useless from idiots playing a 22 year old game at 22 fps yes this is clearly the future the performace got better i have an rtx 2060 and i got about 100fps in quake 2 rtx on max settings good choice and decisionmaking process yeah im waiting but what you did i did same thing with 1080ti happened on a good deal one night when it was like 550 with a 5 year warranty so i jumped i came from an amd 290x so it is a huge jump building a rtx pc now is such a waist of money if u own a 10 series card with recent cpu 1800 euro pc for this no thanks with this i mean quake and bad implementation on to few games with lots of tinkering to get it to work proper with bad fps no thanks having seen a few raytracing videos it seems safe to say you arent missing much if you dont own an rtx card no doubt this will change in the coming years 036 is it just me or is raw noise better than denoised denoise just makes everything blank and removes the dark foreboding shadows and the entire feel its like removing the shadow and rugged lines in van gogh paintings and making it sharp and smooth like modern flash animations it just loose character it looks more like a default scene in a game engine before you add the lighting and shading effects and everything is illuminated shocked getting 50fps on 2080 ti what am i missing my iq just dropped 10 points listening to this woffle this looks weird compared to the original dont like it to me ray tracing just feels like a gigantic performance and wallet hit just to its like real life you should check control it is a really cool game that shows how ray tracing in gpu can be put to some really good use not just for reflections but also ambient oclusions shadows and global ilumination yes it has plenty of shiny surfaces but really it fits into the scenes and is not used all the time it just feels right and shows what things can be done with raypath tracing i agree that criticizing performance is stupid real time ray tracing in game opens doors to new kinds of games and visual fidelity and potentially also makes developing games a bit easier by using less tricks when you say current games look good with rasterization and all the tricks you forgot that developers probably did hit various limitations and needed to change their initial ideas to make it work have good performance or look good with currently available techniques and that always require work and deviations from original ideas i personally dont like baked shadows or shadow mappin i tried this demo on a gtx 1060 i only got 10 fps soon enough we will have tetris with ray tracing that is about the same perfomance i got on my 2080 gtx does the ti add much more when you realize he predicted super editions of rtx cards to ruin amd launching exactly even to the name 1130 oooo i like the raw noise image looks like weaksignal coax into a crt tv better hardware no better software ever heard of photon mapping i guess nvidia hasnt this looks unreal thanks that was a fun and informative video i wanna see skullgirls with raytracing lol u need an nvidia 2xxx series card lol what from gtx 1060 6gb with the driver 425 or newer u can play with rtx on i play this game with rtx on with my 1060 6gb with 30fps okay but its cool d i dont want to be annoying on an old video but what skiing game was that rx 5700 xt shows up i dont really see much differences not also pathtracing raytracing is different of pathtracing using different methods of render and consumming more ressources than pathtracing ha minecraft is indeed getting ray tracing now honestly quite excited i understand how revolutionary this technology is but i dont get why amd staying behind on raytracing is bad the technology isnt quite there yet it does cost performance and not a lot of games have implemented it just yet so amd just doesnt care for the time being not saying they arent trying to rival nvidia with their own raytracing technology as we speak but its nothing urgent in my opinion matter of fact we should be happy amd will keep low prices but honestly right now this just doesnt seem like a big deal the average consumer wont go buy an expensive graphics card for the sake of new imperfect and limited hardware that isnt even necessary if amd sells a graphics card without raytrcing for 400 and nvidia has one with ratracing for 600 most people will pretty much flock to amd im not a fan of any company this is something i just have to point out for the sake of it i myself as a consumer wouldnt go get a graphics card with rtx not yet at least so glad nonrtx cards were made able to play this demo i thought it was pretty cool on my 1060at 480p at 30 fps d welcome to crysis 1 with raytracing will be launched after nasa can actually load it i tried amd in the past its trash intel and nvidia is the way to go both hardware quality and performance raytracing is the future of video game graphics however most people dont see any real difference because game engines have gotten so good at faking it and thus nvidias big unveil as a bit of a flop except for devs and other people who understand whats going on uhm is this a bit of a joke i thought the left window was better at first and its non ray tracing this seems very subjective 255 just like how many shinygreasy surfaces there are in dark souls this video really makes me appreciate rtx future generations will take it for granted philip people are already taking it for granted at 927 it looks like never ending white chocolate or hazel nut wafer or any really good chocolate wafer shouldve waited for rtx 2080 super for 23 of the price with 78of the performance does higher resolution higher resolution lightmap ray tracing would an upscaled lightmap be practical like 720p ray tracing with 4k mesh rendering ray tracing is the next big thing wich gets us closer to photorealistic games and i cant wait good video i would like to see whats next on the graphics card agenda imagine a horror game like silent hill with ray tracing it wouldnt need future hardware if its mostly dark imagine the lighting when exploring dark environments with a flashlight hardware is slowing down my dudes moores law is dead according to nvidias ceo the next big leap will be optimisation the only other chance seems to be a breakthrough in computing since the transistors of cpusgpus will be limited in their density on a chip by the laws of physics quantum tunnelling im still running my amd r9 290 from 2013 because when the 2070 came out i bought one for 550 about a week after release and it had so many issues after getting it installed new gpu is always a process i began having what my friends coined as rtx moments where all of my usb devices would cut out for about 30 seconds every 2 minutes or so my psu is a 650w and my motherboard ram ssd etc are all pretty new and did not have this issue with my old card when playing csgo or any other game id just end up standing still mid match having an rtx moment because of this shit 3 days in the card started artifacting like crazy and a week later it died completely apparently other people had similar issues with the early 2080ti models and other 2000 series cards this is why amd is getting my money for the next upgrade i get and probably the one after it as well until i feel like trying novideo because thats literally what it was a few days into my experience again excuse me but whats the difference between rtx and nonrtx reflections ok i get it but it looks so fake and you pay 1000 for it yeah nah technology my ass cool but looks better without it 145 sounds like hes saying bastard in a calm voice ray tracing will be shoved in our throats because too many people are ignorant of how games actually work prepare for the frame rate dark ages ray tracing is gonna kick the piss outta most horror games because of course im gonna be scared from a shadow coming from behind me 500 what snowboarding game is that and is it for pc its not a snowboard but you guys know what i mean thanks in advance omg you played devastation i spent thousands of hours on that i used to make maps for it and mods ive even got one of the pre release builds on my external hard drive comes with half made weapons like mortars nvidia releases rtx with no market of games even using the technologyand at stupidly high prices amd releases rtx much later when games and many programs are using it at half price amd is weak no amd is smart who the fuck needs rtx to play minecraft and quake 2 its nice new technology but no one has a use for it at the moment stealth in games in the future are going to be so cool think how cool it would be to have ray tracing in the original halflife half life 1 with raytracing is this a thing if not why just doesnt seem worth the computational power to me lol the rtx version looks so much worse ray tracing for mohaa hopefully tf2 will be revived with ray tracing most probably not but hey we can dream if nvidia har showed quake 2 when they anounced rtx people would have gone crazy instead they were look at those shadowslook at that natural lighting and people weremehh 258 like when bloom was introduced and every game looked like you were tripping on acid thief 3 for example it would be interesting if you could mod the torches light to be natural white light i personally think the best thing raytracing has brought about is true global illumination it allows for true shadow colors and light carrying colors as it bounces its the most subtle but the most impressive effect sadly its not as gimmicky as reflections so its hard to show off im curious about what this will do for 3d rendering applications just imagine doing a blender scene and not having to wait 20 hours for the damn thing to render i remember playing this in 640 with a huge lag amazing video i originally got 2080 because i was upgrading to from 2500k to ryzen 2700x and wanted nice gpu to accompany it that card died in 4 days so i got my money back added few more bucks and got 2080ti instead why not go all the way and now with cyberpunk vampire bloodlines doom wolfenstein control watchdogs 3 and other games all getting rtx support i am damn glad i got it in the meantime i can play games in 1440 and 4k at nice framerates the raw noise with youtube h264 compression is awful when you move its quite astonishing what can be done with it i need 50100 itterations to have a useable render and that can take 1530 minutes per frame rtx can do it in 160 basically raytracing is the future for gaming it will enable larger and more dynamic levels those who deny it are just wrong fuck this vdeos with commentarys they need to make the original deus ex with ray tracing the game looks 15 years newer with rtx shading raytracing is the biggest leap in visual fidelity since real time shadows actually we do not know if the hardware for rtxray tracing is dedicated nvidia only showed diagrams that there are extra units for ai acceleration but nothing specific for rtx on so one theory is that turing shaders are used and thats why the huge performance impact meh let me know when quake 1 gets it that lovecraftian universe is still boner food ptsd from my sophomore game mod class so much c at least modding the source code for quake 2s actually fairly easy 4k is to movies as rtx is to games looks like indie games would benefit greatly from this technology a game that would be amazing with rtx is doom 3 that game was very tech demoy but it had a lot of gameplay with lighting spending hundreds of dollars on an modernday overpriced overrated graphics card to play a 20 year old game with some added blingi cant be the only one who sees that something is seriously wrong here ray tracing in gaming is future im a 3d graphics dude for some tv programs and ill tell you that ray tracing in animation is a task for many high end computers heck my dual gtx 1070 machine can render a 1080p ray traced tv logo transition at like 12fps 05fps in 4k when nvidia announced the rtx cards my reaction was no freakin way id be surprised if games with an rtx 2080ti get more than 10 fps in 1080p with a game like battlefield 5 i was wrong and i am impressed as hell many of my gamer friends dont exactly understand ray tracing and think its the dumbest thing ever and that nvidia invented it 98 of the people watching this cant run this with rtx on cool cool what would really excite me tho is quake 3 redone with ray tracing and freeze tag getting popular again i think they should make a ray trace card as in it has no graphics cores just rt cores the whole dye is just one massive raytrace computing powerhouse that you can slap in next to your regular graphics card in sli would mean you can get games to run better raytraced as well as get none raytraced games to run at the same time previously everyone buys 80 they launch 80 ti rip now everyones gotten used to it leaks nvidia 2080 ti super you aint getting your moneys worth well my cpu is a 1st gen ruining at 40 fps in high setting the raw noise sections maxed out the bandwidth and absolutely killed my cpu nice i cant wait for ray tracing on ps1 and n64 emulators i still feel like its a steep price tacked onto entry for a glorified hardware beta test and the lauded minecraft showcase mentioned in this video is software driven add reshade graphics enhancer to further enhance the sharpness and lightingcontrast etc the denoising part is likely done with machine learning so when are you merging with df i think you could have made a mistake i think the next gen 7nm cards will better value for money and i hope you dont get too screwed over by super before that possibly this week i think you paid a premium for a trial product holy shit reflections in water thats something we never see in games before ok its official ray tracing can make anything look good amazing how ray tracing can make even the lowest poly game look great the game that needs raytracing is fear mirrors edge with ray tracing would be incredible still low fps since 1998 best video about this raytracing thing yet quake 2 rtx with simple textures looks amazing strange they didnt just launch it like that so people could more clearly see exactly what raytracing is even doing all the other videos on this subject didnt do this and so they show rtx mode as pretty underwhelming like why bother so thank you for clearing this up i can totally see that raytracing will be a dream partner with cel shade games quake is a better game with or with out a rtx boi philip your channels are amazing especially your game journey thanks to that i started making games and it inspired to make games and receive bad reviews now i have a early early access of a game i made on clickteam and put on gamejolt thank you for your inspiring channel and content thanks goes to arthur appel in 1968 who created the first ray tracing algorithm used for rendering that was 51 years ago it took nvidia 26 years after being founded to implement their version so it took over a half a century to be widely available on consumer hardware in 2019 just a neat little bit of information to know guys im retarded or something explain to me in 1 or 2 sentences why ray tracing is evolutionary compared to old methods of lighting im still waiting for skyrim philip in the reality no one will do rtx more than fancy pants at least yet because of hardware base rtx cards is overpriced and no one will do full rtx game for that small amount of players it will be commercial disaster today most costeffective graphics card is rx570580 sure nvidia is famous for their tech demos that they patent and then never implement and if they do implement it they make it proprietary and impossible for anyone else to use a lot of tech has been developed and forgotten by nvidia meanwhile amd makes their technology available for everyone to use nvidia is anti consumer and anti competition and if amd didnt exist nvidia would just sit on their fat ass charging as much money as they want with no advancement its the same for intel thats why im not a fanboy unreal already had real time reflections in 98 i do raytracing professionally and im a comp sci and i was actually quite disappointed with quake rtx light goes through a corner or objects dont cast shadows and it seems the textures when illuminated become completely washed out all combining to making the overall look very washed out it actually looks a lot better without textures so they must have done something very wrong which is a shame because i think the card and raytracing are capable of vastly better and more realism satisfying image quality do you know what the texture wash out effect is the next gen graphics wars are finally over now knowing we cant get more realism than this i expect even more people to start preferring stylized and unique artstyles over realism everyone will get bored of such realism just give it sometime imo the noticeable difference is so small that i would trade maybe 5fps for it but not more even in side by side comparisons the normal reflections dont look bad and i doubt most people would even notice raytracing if theyre just playing the game and not looking for reflections if they can make it fully run on the raytracing cores and have 0 decrease in fps then it would be really nice rtx is useless just great they took for comparison the usual quake 2 and quake 2 with new textures just brilliant no quake with already replaced textures without rtx and with rtx would compare do not mislead people you cannot fathom the magnitude of our raytracing yeah can i run this on my voodoo 5 5500 gpu 246310 basically what i was thinking for the entire time i knew what raytracing is the thing is we are humans not evolution nothing can be good enough for us we continuously strive for better you suddenly appeared in my feed and now im in love with your channel yay i remember when i was a kid that color depth and smooth scrolling were huge deals then when i was a teenager i briefly worked for ea for work experience for nonbrits we is like a 2 week mandatory internship and got to see some tech demos that were never publicly released the one i remember the most is the first time i ever saw a 3d particle system which was used for a few different things including a bonfire at the time i was also into povray and other raytracing programs and expected wed be getting realtime raytracing within a decade instead we got higher resolution displays better framerates and a whole lot of tricks to make raycasting engines look nicer which is fine preferable even but those higher resolutions and framerates moved the goalposts for realtime raytracing which is why we still dont quite have it yet i want to see original thief in this i want speed over rtx on my 1660ti i have to nuke resolution scale all the way to 50 to make it run ok but im kind of impressed it runs at all 2kliksphilip porting quake games to raytracing has been a pet project of intel for a long time their 2009 quake wars ray traced was the first game ever to have realistic view from under the water at whats above the surface rather than having it artificially blurreddistorted i recommend the wikipedia article about it thats what i read when i first learned about ray tracing a few years ago it was a fascinating read back then and it still is why did they change the rail gun model i loved the original one i remember there was a time when physx i believe or was it something else had a dedicated card to do its thing and i wonder if the same could be done with ray tracing instead of buying a full on gpu you just get an addon to whatever card you have and now you have ray tracing i went from 999 fps to 54 fps with 2060 lol coming up next in techs we shouldnt yet pipeline profitable fusion when is there rx 570 price and performance competitor coming out hey i have a ryzen 3 2200g with radeon vega 8 graphics son i just downloaded this game on steam but i cant play cause its says that vulkan couldnt initialize help pleaseee i believe detailed 3d models and lighting are the most important elements to add realism the later even more and since raytracing is simpler to apply to old games it will become a efficient method of reviving them i think it would be better if amd would give nvidia some proper competition then we wouldnt have completly horrorfying prices on graficcards with features that are look like they are going to be practicly useless for the next 5 years and when raytracing will become usefull all those cards are probably to underpowered to run it as a full feature also if amd would be up to speed with nvidia we would have atleast some proper other high end options then nvidia cards i unironically want ray tracing in minecraft quake 2 looks a lot better with ray tracing then bfv lmao nice video more interesting than i had expected i have a rtx 2080 and tried quake 2 rtx today and i dont really agree with you in my opinion minecrafts ray tracing is more impressive it runs better it looks almost as good path traced globai illumination path traced reflection normal map and pbr support pt reflections seems to be of higher resolution in minecraft it runs on javaopengl which is way slower than the windows store directx minecraft and dont even benefit from rtxs rt optimized architecture in a much more dynamic world framerate is much smoother and runs decently on 3440x1440 with a gtx 1080ti rtx 2080 and yet its still in developpment so i cant help but being disappointed by the quake 2s rtx which is simply unplayable on native res with my 3440x1440 monitor even on low with a rtx 2080 i just think something is seriously messed up and that it could actually perform better than that this stuff blows my mind i cant wait for the hardware that can run this to be the standard and norm it will make game modding even more incredible and insane and give older games a fresh new way to play and enjoy ill consider updating my hardware right as soon as games that require high end gear are good again as games does it have the coop mode because steam is not telling me call me when a full quake 2 remake comes out i dont care about anything else wheres the green smoke effect that the quake 2 rtx promised for bfg what about the explosive clouds created by the rocket launcher where to download the rtx patch ray tracing might not be a big impact for triple a titles but as brandon laatsch from stress level zero saids its a much bigger help for indie game developers that want to create wonderful looking games using less resources than triple a developers still this could be a thing for some 510 years but now this is just a technical demo no one with a sound mind would buy overpriced 2080ti to play quake i mean it looks interesting but if you want to see lighting in action go play warframe in 144fps in 4k with 1080ti not this crappopolis seems like it would be awesome for some kind of survival horror game with monsters attracted to lights extinguishing covering up light sources to hide etc you know you dont need a 20 series card right 1080ti sli ist also enoth for 1080p theyll add raytracing to crysis in a few years and everyone will be asking but can it run crysis games like qube alan wake or portal 2 would look great with ray tracing 2016 can only render still ray traced images slowly over many hours and videos much longer 2019 can ray trace 60 images a second at full hd resolution to make games look absolutely amazing the people but raytracing is useless we already do good lighting i really think you were right and they released rtx early all the things about early rtx cards failing and initial problems makes me think it was a relatively last minute decision to capitalize on their lead they wont fall into the same pitfall intel did because of this nice to see a market that isnt stagnating is amd really just not supporting it just because or is there actually a bigger reason edit oh haha what a celebration monopoly time id like to see black mesa with raytracing it let me run the demo on my 1080ti i only got about 23 the framerate you showed getting with the 2080ti i noticed in the options support for multigpu though and while im slightly reluctant i will probably dust off my second 1080ti and see what happens buy me an rtx 2080 ti k thx the problem is that nvidia didnt give us a choice all the 20s series cards have this extra hardware to do raytracing and we have to pay that premium if we want these cards but the technology is still at the wow demo stage and not really usable for gaming unfortunately theres no competition in the highend so nvidia could pull this off consumers would be less angry if there were more reasonably priced highend nvidia cards without the raytracing premium imagine spending 1200 on a 2080ti and getting 22fps in quake 2 at 4k rtx was rushed dont make excuses if you run it at fairly low settings you can get this to run at 60fps on a gtx 1060 010 the stabbonk strog no longer can be called mr grinsnsmiles shoutout to anyone who gets that reference imagine playing fear with its amazing lighting with raytracing a piece of shit company oh yea nvidiat god damn wankers duke nukem had reflections since 1996 bring on the 4080ti after playing q2 rtx on a 2080ti and experiencing a path traced environment its a big difference cant wait for hardware thats up to the task for modern games hmm the first raytracing video nvidia released several months ago was really impressive but the version they actually made public is not so impressive why nvidia or amd should release rtx only cards that work alongside existing gpus how have you got a full body mine is just an arm with a gun attached whats the name of the font you use amds nextgen on scarlett set to support hardwareaccel raytracing now we just need another thief game 345 no shame this universe has some pretty good graphics when you buy rtx 2080 ti for quake demo can you try cs16 in rtx clshowfps 1 which game is the skiing around 433 from you can use a 1070 ti with all rtx settings on max what are you talking about it may be running at 640x480 but it is doing it at 55fps lol sadly enough the game looks worse than its original 90s counterpart adding raytracing just for the sake of it doesnt work the whole style and design should take that into account only if thief like game used raytracing bro do this for league of legends holly shit it will blow up run first thieft game with rtx did you follow your scheme of buying from amd and nvidia alternately seems like we are reaching the end of graphical evolution ray tracing aka throw a few hundred extra dollars on new graphics cards todays games are extremely good at faking lighting in the eyes of a regular gamer they maybe are to anyone else that knows what the physically correct lighting should look like its an unrealistic garbage unfortunately the gamers dont know any better which is why quake 2 rtx is such an important step for nvidia it will help people develop their sense of whats right and whats wrong and when that is developed theres no going back to fake lighting because its going to feel flat boring and just wrong doesnt matter the complexity of the game ive said it before and i said it again phillip has the voice of someone who indulges in the redolence of their own flatulence and you can hear their perpetual smirk in their voice half life 3 now with ray tracing im imagining new games forcing you to set on a light source or people telling me get that lightbulb out of your ass faggot we need to see them in online games lol anyone tried this with a 2060 does it run well 2007 does it run crysis 2019 does it run minecraft with ray tracing 15k euro for a rear view mirror you where ripped offuseless feature and will fade away over timeeverything is amd consolesif these do not support it devs wont use it it looks nice and all but when you start actually playing the game you wont give a shit about graphics ive been a quake fan forever and quake ii has always been a shitty game im more excited for pathtracings applications for sound rendering honestly imagine the old thief engine being updated with rtx that would have been awesome its valiable option if you have 1000 card i play q2 on voodooo 2 sli developers now how to fake some effects and they look great and thery are optimized in future develpers will not need to fake some effects but requere 1000 card and games will look somehow better on high hardware but on low end it will be ugly ray tracing is feature but its not near revolution like bump mapping its stil bad raytracing its stil bad raytracing its stil bad raytracing its stil bad raytracing i suggest you join the digital foundry team and then you can change your intro to the proper one d 138 in case yorue wondering why the baddies arent shooting at me it is because i have disabled ai no you didnt you just entered the notarget command that makes the enemies not register you as something to shoot at also this whole rtx q2 thing looks really weird everything is very bright and washed out looking all these fancy effects are like putting lipstick on a pig because none of these assets are intended to be viewed in high definition i love all the tesselation added to the textures i greatly prefer remasters like this than what we usually get called a remaster good speculation towards the end i agree with it even if i didnt agree it would still be good minecraft with ray tracing will be such a feast for eyes now imagine if nvidia made non proprietary drivers that actually worked i think i prefer q2vkpts implementation better the textures seem slightly less flat with a nice layer of ao and reflectivity on top of that for not much of a performance drop the extra glass reflections are sweet tho you dont need a 2xxx series card its playable on a 1080 ti albeit with the resolution scale set all the way to the left god damn the future is lit i think ima upgrade my pc in 2020 yeah because i want excessive occlusion and blur for better graphics sorry to say but ray tracing is not path tracing ray tracing is much faster and cheaper to do than path tracing im effectively invisible to them enemy runs towards and shoots him with an accuracy you only see in a russian cs player lol i think the game id be most excited for ray tracing would be portal just imagine being able to shine lights through the portal gates to the other side it would be so awesome im curious how thief gold thief 2 and thief deadly shadows will be with ray tracing can someone pls tell me the skiing game at 430 ish time rtx has got me so excited for the future of games i cant wait until all graphics are done via ray tracing i cant wait for the ultimate vr raytraced experienced no rasterization no screen door effect perfect hand tracking omnidirectional treadmills and full body haptics its going to be the best i cant wait if doom eternal uses rtx i dont think ill graduate collage on time finally you have a graphics card which can handle 4k in every scenario yeeaaaah stealth games would become even harder imagine ai reacting to you walking in front of a light and reacting to your moving shadow d so all they updated was just a bunch of visuals no actual enhancements changes or balancing done to the game play because in my view gameplay good controls 80 graphics audio 20 dont care if it looks like cod so reeeeeeal or if it looks like halflife 1 if the game play is solid a i see comments about halflife being raytraced and someone already did such a thing for hl2 called halflife 2 update which is also on steam it doesnt just update some visuals but actually does fix some bugs and more ray tracing is a very nice effect but i feel like it isnt necessarily its the holy grail of real time rendering i hope well get ray traced half life the minecraft demo has that very bright lit hill that reminds mer of summer brightness would be intresting in competative games to do a concept of your vision adjusting to light levels so if you fight indoors and go out you may be over come by the brigtness and vice versa that could have very intresting strategic implications maybe if its a class based hero shooter like over watch diffrent chracter could adjust diffrently to light like if your a robot maybe it makes no diffrence would love to see more done with vision in general in games now for competative games path tracing is not right though since it screws up the frame rate if your under 100 then your at a disadvantage and you need the screen for it too okay but its a 20something year old game that i have already played to death including a full run in vr back in 2013 while taking the first step might be important i think i would take those faster 1000 series cards over this right now and quite honestly nvidia way overstepped the boundaries of whats acceptable pricing on home gpus it should be a crime to release a gpu over 600 and yes amd also violates this come on quake 1 is better i want to experience lovecraftian horror with splendid real time shadows id buy an rtx card to play serious sam with ray tracing dont me have you tried the reshade rt to be super honest the raytracing hype train is making me skeptic of it seems to me a lot power requirements for a relatively small improvement pc has been going this way for a while now you have to get a 2060 to run the game at ultra and it still looks too similar to the low graphics the only difference being that you get more frames used to be that the difference between settings would be huge now not so much would much rather see graphics going towards economy of power i played this game with ray tracing active it really doesnt look that good does it look better es but good no just play modern games if you want good ray traced games i tried it yesterday and performances on my 2070 arent that bad for such an unripe technology as i get around 65 fps but as im used to a 144hz monitor my eyes was like burning and even tho it was a good experience i had to put my res in 720p to get reasonable 110120 fps and actually enjoy the reflections i only tried the demo but i think ill get the full game i have a 2080ti as well and for me player reflections dont even work at all in the demo much disappoint im waiting my rtx 2080 paid 304 no thanks still not convinced about the ray tracing hype for anyone interested in how raytracing works rtx is great but for your average gamer just a 1080 will suffice the craze for the best possible specs confuses me as many people are willing to throw all their money away to build a super computer only to not even attempt using it to its full potential whats that ww2 game at 245 cod ww2 you dont need a 2000 series to run rtx my 1080ti on 1440p 50 scaling got 3050fps on low rtx settings though so not great i remember flexinga bout my computer being able to run quake back then i was 4 now i flex my computer being able to run quake yep nothing changed at all youtube completely stopped showing me your videos in my subbox for like three months i forgot you existed and yet i was actively watching 2clicks and clickphilip and then just nothing damn you youtube now i have som catching up to do phillip try and run fallout 76 with reshade and marty mcflys pathtraced global illumination rtx is such a failure as a brand when in almost a year only 3 games have got support for it and now the biggest news is when and old game like this got support for it at no thanks to nvidia btw its made by a clever fan his work just got hired now and theyve locked it out of other gpus and made a big deal of it just to put the performance a bit more into perspective i recently serviced an atari atw800 from 1987 which was partially demoed with raytracing using 4 cpus performance scales pretty much linearly rendering a single still image with 4 basic geometric shapes still requires 10 minutes at 512x512 at 256 colors which was considered incredibly fast at the time i have a video of it on my channel in case anyone is interested ill be holding a presentation about that machine soon and im extremely pleased that i will be able to claim realtime raytracing is real now folks its interesting from the technological standpoint but the overall visual effect is pretty underwhelming why ray trace quake 2 ray trace doom 3 or at least bring back unreal tournament 2004 imagine how fast these could render blender scenes aside from the visual effect youre cutting a lot of development time by having emergent lighting rather than having to get 8 different baked and real time effects working in conjunction now imagine ray tracing plugins for emulators d gopher photoes o i agree with the logic here on nvidias decisions and rtx was developed because of weak amd gpus right now it seems nvidia is firmly at least a year ahead of their competition if not several years ahead while i have a 1080ti and dont see a value in buying a 2080 or 2080ti i have a hard time thinking that ill be buying an amd card next will probably be a 2180ti or whatever they call their next flagship and this is while im currently building an amd cpu pc omg my childhood came to life again this looks amazing love what they did with this classic i wish more games from that era got remade with all the modern graphics just remixing masterpieces into new level of epic this is the most enjoyable ray tracing showcase i have seen so far it looks visually fun to just shoot and see what the light will do or the flares too on other games like battlefield 5 im like oh thats cool me looks at my intel pentium 4gb ram 8 year old laptop my laptop no would like to see tech for quake 1 okay but have you played quake on dmt i got 50 fps max 1440p with a rtx 2080 they game is from 1997 how can my 2000 pc not run it smoothly i was hyped for cod mw because of the ray tracing but now i dont even think i will be able to get 10 fps lol since ampere seems to be coming next year i think im gonna wait for the 7nm wow 346 looks so realistic it will be dog slow not anymore since apparently crytek found a way to do that without rtx at least i hope they arent lying it is amazing playing with rtx 2070 i have 4k ips monitorlove 4k anad it still looks hood at 1080p 60fps i got around 3035 fps with gtx 1080 ti 1440p 50 resolution scaling it is demanding but i feel like the 20 series is just a first generation with limited culpability hopefully 30 series will make it worthwhile i am running this at 720p 60 resolution on a gtx 1070 rtx not required gtx 1080 ti pumps out 8 fps on default settings in tech demo at 2560x1440 i need to upgrade my gpu this proves that the tech involved in media is improving for sure i dont see them creating hardware for itmaking techdemos that is because you most likely got some benefits from nvidia what about cryteks techdemo running on a vega 56 which costs around 250 wait theres ray tracing in real life i gotta try this thing out real quick ps5 and xbox 2 or whatever our consoles run games with rtx while they still manage to preserve a smooth and fluid 30 fps game looks crap and the raytracing looks crap btw amd is actually roasting intel atm 700 are u joking you say its something which is not completely ready now we shouldnt be able to use it blabla then why sell it in the first place they could easily do the research inhouse and release it when its really ready but nvidia actually forces the end user put a non ready technology in a gpu double the price there you go crysis rtx you have no idea seriously confused on the whole amdnvidia thing there are good mirrors in max payne 2 tho simple texture with raytracing lights looks so fantastic and satisfying wow different part of the graphicscard i have wild idea how about different cards for tray tracing all together i think there was separate physx cards or like there is separate sound cards and so on for people with cards like vega 5664r7 gtx 10701070ti10801080ti this would make lots of sense cause its not like these cards lack regular horsepower its just that they dont have the rtx elements and also provide upgrades to people with actual rtx enabled cards cause from what i gather the rtx elements atm are kinda weak well their 12nm is actually 16 hey thats the shadow from the underside of my foot seems legit i couldnt agree more on raytracing being way more impressive on simpler games like minecraft i never really noticed a difference in modern looking titles such as bf5 because the graphics and lighting are impressive on their own the fact that minecraft has the ability to have textures and lighting so realistic is much more jaw dropping than any modern title for me atm rtx wasnt the first rt cardamd had one for a while before nvidia jedi knight 2 or even 3 with raytracing would be fucking amazing it seems people dont get that rtx is actually insane as a technology in real time but you dont understand these cards were released on the consumer market when you pay such an efty price in this market you expect the product to work flawlessly and 20 fps at 4k isnt something people like you explained it with such a poor argument i feel like the big benefit from ray tracing cards is that when most people own them and they are a lot better game developers can focus more on the game instead of having to spend a lot of time faking the lighting to look good this would definitely help speed up game development time will still looking great it might be cool to see this in doom 3 since it has much less ambient lighting i love how magical ray tracing sounds to normies like you its adorable quake 3 arena ray tracing please kinda confused by what you meant when you were talking about 2 shadows being cast from the same object could you elaborate i still dont get why they constantly talk about ray tracing even nvidia used this expression to spread the hype when instead it is mainly path tracing ray tracing could be considered to be a subset of the path tracing though ray tracing alone doesnt get you much realism because it only accounts for effects of direct light rays while path tracing also includes illumination through indirect light light bouncing off surfaces and contributing to indirect illumination the latter contributes much more to the realism of a scene than the former imo minecraft ray tracing true ray tracing is available and at a reasonable fps of over 60 if minecraft ray traced runs at 60fps then quake can certainly run ray tracing with good graphics at a good fps of course it does require an rtx 2080ti to run at a good fps but still we are at a place in time that people thought was impossible fyi this wont work on a gtx 970 you need a rtx 2070 for this when you realize that this is your first vid of 2kliks i remember when i first found out about ray tracing and started doing it i would make sense irl and test them against my ray tracer 344 reminded me of doing this fun times also on a side note spot on at 640 in all honesty its super crazy and if your complaining about 4k then your missing the whole point about whats happening somewhat strangely its made me appreciate it more in real life as well i went through a similar phase when i played a game with heavy normal mapping and phong shading for the first time i ahte how you talk to us like we are 3 year odlds nobody is missing the point ray tracing is a gimmick video games are slowly dying as a popular pass time and are becoming a luxury which no one can afford due to these types of gimmicks since 2016 games have done nothing impressive and as a result sales are poor and people are turning toward indie titles thats it we live in a simulation we have to support this how is it going to improve if we dont its defiantly an exiting time thats amazing not technology but how people believe in almost anything ray tracing is here amazing work from nvidia unbelievable drop your fps from 600 to 15 and you can play amazing games released 20 years ago and even when the brain says that performance sucks and technology is only needed in mincraft people are still afraid to let the truth in its a scam rtx looks so much worse do you think that raypath tracing could make game design easier reducing time to build assets and levels honestly i wouldnt mind a few super shiny games it will become the look of the new era futuristic in a sort of prematurely retro way then 30 years later people will look back on the super shiny games nostalgically where the fuck is odgrub im not sold nor fond of how raytracing is forced and shoved around like there is clear reasons why only ray tracing has issues like weve dealt with illusions for so long and it was fine the drop in performance is it that warranted and what the hell is that nvidia advertisement right there excuse me but no thats not convincing thats the reverse imagine what could be done if they could use the rest of the compute cores of the cards to do lower priority traces as well the nvidia version looks like shit this shows just how useful machine learning is for games as without it this wouldnt exist so soon well the one reason why denoising in raypathtracing is so effective is because its only denoising a monochrome image which is way easier than 16mio colors i mean i wouldt say they are uncompetitive httpsgpuuserbenchmarkcomcomparenvidiagtx1080vsamdrxvega643603vs3933 its more that amd has a bad rep with gamers not from digital foundry lmao if only i could see nier automatas towers insides raytraced ooo this video ended at 700 right you can easily see how little the smoothing algorithm has to work with so little that it is not possible for it to work right and i prefer playing with the noise fun fact the minecraft path tracing shader does not infact use the rtx cores in rtx cards and it works on 10xx series too the reason it doesnt work on amd cards is because of driver issues and the shader creator testing it on nvidia cards 432 is it still battlefield v i want euro truck simulator 2 with ray taricng damn i remember when red faction has the best glass effect the glass effect and breaking glass effect used to be part of reviews back in the day when amd releases a deal with apple on the new mac pro delivering a new dual graphics chip to reach massive speeds and nvidia releases an improved quake 2 oh boy the tables have turned 10 years too early in ten years the hardware will be good enough but for now it should have stayed a proof of concept in nvidias lab and never ship you talk about this being the real deal and not faking it but the truth is that the rtx 2080ti is unable to display your path traced frame properly it has to fake it by computing a ridiculously small amount of rays and then interpolate whats in between pixels and sure enough it cant even do the really small amount of marches necessary in one frame this aint the real time path tracing we were promised by nvidia and it would be a stretch to call it real time path tracing at all should you buy a rtx card well would you have recommended buying the fujifilm fujix dsx in the late 80s 400 kpixel all digital sure digital photography was the future but at the time youd be better off buying film people who think its too early for this tech would say the exact same thing when the arbitrary point in time for it comes about as you said most people dont understand what they are seeing im always sad of seeing the amazing work of sonic ether minecraft shaders what has done on his very own for a java game and seeing the struggle that nvidia as a whole company is dealing with 2kliksphilip is nvidia shill confirmed unsubbed 6850k 44ghz 10802080mhz it ran 7fps 2k and the sound was looping badly immense lagging when fired the gun rtx off about 400fps or something crazy like that you could probally sell your rtx 2080ti for a lot more if you fid want the amd card faking lighting takes a lot of human resources and time with raytracing all you need a is a good material developers will spend less time figuring out cheap tricks and more time developing i hope youre still working on odgrub vs ebony warrior been waiting for 2 months now you should try turning global illumination down to low or medium i believe it only adds additional bounces beyond the first so unless you have extremely bright lights in a very dark area its not that huge of a difference visually and really increases perf i have a 2080 and can play at above 1080p at around 80fps in linux also slight correction this game doesnt use dxr at all its in vulkan dxr is just microsofts api they didnt invent the tech and you dont need their api to use the rt cores if i shouldnt expect the price to go down nvidia shouldnt expect me to buy it may i ask why everyone is currently hyping a technology wich at this very point in time isnt viable in any kind way or form stop making propaganda for nvidia and ati this is the kind of content that legitimizes overpriced silicon technology in 2019 cards like the high end gtx series should already be priced waaaaay lower taking into consideration how any other kind of electronic components capability and development process has gotten exponentially cheaper and easier with every passed year with this kind of oh my gosh i got hard by this content we can expect any kind of raytracing technology even if it still uses silicon microchips that are as good as on the miniaturization limits since 2015 to be overpriced yet again useless but cool stuff like this is just wrong if it aint viable kinda remembers me of the everythingnuclearpowered hype in the 50s and 60s too bad that most of us here havent lived through that kind of experience i bet that way more peo whats the skiing game may seen like amd is in trouble but they are not chasing the same part of the market as nvidia nvidia is targeting the pc market a lot more while the emphasis for amd is on consoles and the data centre imagin quake 4 with ray racing as far as im aware nvidia didnt create this it was started long before rtx came out but then moved to support rtx when it came out it will porbbaly support amds rt solution aswell 14 fps on gtx 1080 ti game on 240 how does source do reflections not ssr not models under the floor and has good performance off of 1080p at 30 fps is all i need sure give me more if possible but i rather have raytracing or the resources being used for demanding games like minecraft is with the right kind of mods and on high chunk distance i feel that criticising performance shows that you dont understand what it is that you are seeing exactly i was glad to do my part and show my support for the new tech im happy with my rtx 2080 ray tracing in minecraft is over the top philip you might want to try ravenfield it is battlefield 1942 but with different graphics amd is focusing on defeating intel i think aside from rx 570 and 580 most amd cards are unattractive excuse me what the fuck i get 3035 fps with a 1080ti at 720p enough to let me experience ray tracing philip you can path trace any old game with reshade now you can even path trace emulated games you dont even need an rtx card but this thing puts all the priority on gpu processing while barely using the cpu so the result is that rtx is the only way this thing is even manageable resolution and global illumination are the big framerate killers but with some scaling and tweaks even my 1070 can at least run this thing at a mostlyplayable framerate i got about 30 fps on 1080p with titan x pascal sli with global illumination on low its playable but not smooth it would be cool if microsoft released a version of halo 1 with all the original graphics but with raytracing seems like it would be a good way of promoting a future console or the upcoming pc release of the mcc raytracing is actually a lot more efficient than rasterisation in scenes with complex geometry and heavy light sources rtx in some circumstances is already showing better fps performance than traditional rasterisation so many games support ray tracing 13 minutes of philip attempts to convince himself that it was the right decision to buy 2080 ti alright alright joking d i think that nvidia knew what they are doing they cooporated with epic games and in the newest uneral engine you can just enable ray tracing so from now on all games made in ue4 can have it this is major selling point in my opinion its kind of a shame that without the noise filter it buggers the bit rate as with minor changes it would serve as a far more authentic vhs aesthetic for a horror indie title with limited graphics than anything that has been released commercially so far reminds me of watching stuff on analogue tv broadcasts back when you had to manually calibrate each channel using the remote fanboyism is strong with this one some of your points are wrong httpsyoutubeq9t49kffo24 whats the fun of playing games when they are just going to look the same as real life maybe when we reach that well start working backwards woah i have entered the final dimension goodbye mortals i think the real question here is why does my minecraft still only run at 60fps you know what game would benefit wonders from raytracing unreal well since ray tracing can be done on amd gpus i dont see why to waste money on the nvidia rtx gpus why are the colors so washed out in comparison to vanilla or q2vkpt and quake2xp is not that bad compared to rt versions thx amd was nice to see you suck so much dick i got myself real time raytracing with mine 2080ti bastard i have gone another route i want something like the 980ti i have max performance but the 2080ti doesnt give enough to justify the price so i will upgrade to a 2060 and when the 80ti card is actually strong like the 980ti was to the 900 series i will upgrade to that oh and also because my 980ti caught fire and i dont have money i wont lie ray tracing looks pretty cool but i still prefer the way quake 2 looks originally philip 40fps on quake ii rtx on 2080ti i wouldnt say amd is in trouble far from it youre missing the point here hmm i can see we watched the same videos am i the only one that is bothered with all of those reflections seriously most of the things are waaaay too shiny is it me or does the original look more detailed rtx on f76 05 fps some corrections 1 the real life is very reflective youve got so used to matte surfaces in games that it seems overdone because you didnt see it in motion much 2 games were built with the notion that as the lighting is poor the textures need to draw attention to create realism so yes simpler surfaces may appear and its good we will see the full cinematic arsenal utilized in game design amd last year give us a year or two and get 8k raytracing us nvidia is better i mean who is saying they are better the game that actually needs ray traced reflection is resident evil 2 the ssr in that game is horrible but they designed the game in such a way that it looks bland without that ssr so rt reflection could help hopefully capcom considers adding rt reflection in that game and maybe rt global illumination if possible quake 4 raytracing just think how cool that game will look 716 gamers are just stingy assholes thats all i feel its more beneficial with render engines that render movies than using it for games thanks for sharingman ubisoft adding support for it in rainbow six siege would be game changing but would the rtx series be able handle it weve gotten so good at faking it and working around the limitations that people dont really appreciate or understand what they are looking at we have some amazing physically based materials capabilities and putting those into actual real time raytraced scenes will give so much more visual fidelity to our games than people obsessed with more and more screen and texture resolution realize well made 2k pbr materials high poly and tesselated geometry 1080p or 1440p rendering resolution and boatloads of rays could produce some extreme visual fidelity that doesnt need to be faked and just looks correct in all situations because it is correct i mean arent amd cards pretty good at brute forcing raytracing all things considering not wanting ray tracing is stupid but i think not adopting it is even worse fuck now philip has a better pc than me if there was a game that used reflections and maybe moving through mirrors like a portal as a mechanic that would be really cool for this tech splinter cell chaos theory with ray tracing omg you dont need a 20 series card unless you are trying to play it 1080p or higher you can play it 720 on a 1080 i know its low res but still its fucking path tracing its a big deal this is good and all but it completely killed the atmosphere and made it look like some random battleground with great lighting and not like quake at all it should be used in realistic games and rarely used in something like windwaker unless its used properly but even then id prefer prebaked lighting as it helps with the effect and presentation its meant to convey notice how quake and minecraft look incredibly similar to each other its a slight concern of mine that devs could be over relient on this tech and a lot of games might look sickening with the blurryness idk i feel like this would only be good with shadows prebaked lighting will always look better than dynamic when it comes to numerous games like uncharted and botw since they have their own style they want to target its kinda hard to look unique when the lighting is so incredibly realistic so basically i love your videos the mere sight of this port already set my potato pc on fire it became a baked potato why not sell dedicaded rtx cards just like physx on 411 there is mentioned a game named devastation surprised that someone still remembers this game philip if you are reading this hope you will make a video about this game someday it was pretty good those days but didnt become popular 924 dont be fooled by the process name game believe it or not tsmcs 12nm process has a slightly lower transistor density than their 16nm the purpose of 12nm is its cheaper yields more reliably and clocks slightly higher very important when you are pushing out chips that are 5070 bigger than your previous generation now minecraft ray tracing in my opinion quake 2 is a game that shouldnt have clean light detail with extra colour it should be all dark and comfortless thats what makes quake so interesting and enjoyable so from what ive read implementing ray tracing in a game is super fast and way faster than implementing ssao or similar so well see it in more games they need to do the same for halflife if quake ray tracing is here half life could be next 645 no were thinking a 1000 pound graphics card is unacceptable period so we have to go back to 20 years old graphics to play fully raytraced game at a decent framerate i just got my 2060 from msi and i love the fact that there are more and more rtx games thats why i got a rtx 2080 from gtx 10701060 i had sold the cards got a 2080 the rtx in metro was very decent as well in bf5 and i even try this game quake 2 rtx and the change is there who says they can see it they are blind amd fanboys most of the time so i dont care about them i buy what is best is my money i do what i want with them its still overpriced but there have been nice shader mods for minecraft for so long they look great even without raytracing ive tried this demo and honetly i was impressed how well it ran on my 2070 70 fps on 1080p is hella impressive for a game entirely pathtraced and while the denoiser is extremely impressive aswell i feel it kinda makes the game look unsharp like nothing has that sharp of an edge which is werid considering how low poly everything is yes that was exactly my point it was the perfect opportunity for nvidia to introduce rtx nvidia being so far in the lead with amd mia in the high end they could afford to take a hit while introducing ray tracing really that bad i havent had framedrops under 60fps with my 2060 on 1080p but i turned global illumination to medium would love to see raytracing in mirrors edge actually you might not even need that much horsepower for ray tracing if you take cryteks neon noir tech demo into account they managed to render it at 4k 30fps real time btw using an amd rx vega 56 its not playable like quake 2s rtx demo but considering they brought us the pc melter thats crysis theres good reason to trust them making it work in real time is one thing but optimizing it enough to run on older architectures without the need for dedicated tensor cores is even more important imo though theres also the fact amds cards tend to be pretty compute proficient which ray tracing depends on only time will tell if amd will actually go through the effort to implement the api pathways for ray tracing stuff i really hope they will otherwise theyd screw the pooch on this i dont expect much but itd be a good comparison between pascal turing and the various gcn generations i agree on ray tracing becoming a very big thing in the future though fa seeing the potential already used makes the 20 series more reasonable 1997 can it run quake 2 2007 can it run crysis 2019 can it run quake 2 give me half life 2 with ray tracing now metro exodus looks amazing with ray tracing the lighting looks very realistic in certain scenes water puddles are pretty amazing in ray tracing its so cool pc players and their weird graphic fetish over actually playing games is pretty much a meme at this point i may be wrong here but im pretty sure that the entire frame isnt being constructed from the denoised ray traced output i think theres a conventional renderer which has overlayed so to speak the ray traced lighting edit from the website it seems that im wrong nice thats even more impressive what game is it around 300 i need to know whats the game he plays with the skiing and stuff a while ago i ran a pathtraced version of quake 2 not sure what version not rtx related it was neither of the above mentioned it was super noisy but i got playable framerates2030fps i think on a low resolution640 or 800 or something it was really cool and this was on a gtx 760 tbh i prefer the noisy version because it feels a lot more moody even though it is uglier in the future we will see more samples so less noisein that version you could set those properties which will be cool i wonder how amd cards are going to perform i think it wont be that dissapointing remember that amd was first wtih async compute anyways we will see have a nice day finally someone who understands what this means who else dont give a shit about ray tracing my pc crashed when you said fallout 76 lol halflife rtx when i might be wrong but i believe amd were working on adding raytracing support before rtxs announcement and release but im not certain on that point am i the only one who like the video before watching lol can you do a video about the dynamic super resolution feature nvidea added and compare the fake 4k on 1080p it can make to real 4k on a real 4k screen would be interesting theres a way to see these noise comparations on the raw file these compressions from youtube kills them looking at a twenty something year old game with no textures and its gorgeous this shows really clearly how important good lighting is why would a game have noise i never played anithing with noise with your new rtx card the skyrim video can be rendered in smoother frame rates gaben probably waiting for tech like this to make hl3 equally huge jump in visuals with hl1 to hl2 very nice and well put together video but you still shouldnt defend nvidias pricing scheme they wont get away with this much longer i know you address this at the middle of the video but still it comes across as justifying the cost of early adoption and focusing too much on the tech which you clearly stated has been available and in development by teams at nvidia intel amd m the prices at any segment are so absurd and it never happened in almost any other generation besides gtx 8800 ultra days there is no point defending that if we want true competition and technological advancement ummmm have you seen watter in frostbite engine or cryengine ps source is trash finally someone else that sees the amazing use of ray tracing and this coming way too early for us this is a huge improvement in graphics and i love what nvidia is doing graphics wise its quite amazing id take steady 1440p144hrz gaming over raytracing any day of the week raytracing needs a few years to get good enough to justify 1000 protip play on render scale 50 global illumination on low to get 60fps atleast it works for 1660ti honestly i think philip would make a nice addition to the digital foundrys team his view about games and technology is unique and interesting i could listen to him for literal days anyway i hope they notice your talent and your passion keep up the good work man the 2080ti is a diamond sword with sharpness iv and looting iii the radeon 7 is a diamond sword with sharpness v and fire aspect ray tracing is great it was already great decades ago and it probably will be great in a decade when it becomes finally usable with then available hardware for me personally this older games do not really benefit much from ray tracing mostly cause they have their charm from having their consistent look textures shader level of details shadows etc matches to create a good experience having one stand out to much would just ruin the overall experience it is definitely something for the future to make nearly realistic looking games even better but for this we talk about hardware that is probably 10 years away given the baby steps we currently see in each refresh launch per year now i wonder if we can get ray traced hl2 running an old 1080ti here and it does run smooth at 50 res scale minecraft raytracing runs at 40 fps on a 1060 which is absolutely insane bro minecraft with ray tracing scares me what game is at 435 rtx still sux i would rather play battlefield 5 with rtx off than quake 2 with rtx on from 924 to 1003 my cpu was capping out trying to play this video in 4k that grain was not a good mix with the high resolution i like that the lighting will be used more like in movies for mood fix get 4 2080 tis and play vr with ray tracing you know whats more crazy to me that rtx 2060 can run this in 1080p in 50 fps or in 720p in 70 almost all of these effects can be pulled off convincingly without any raycasting using standard opengl shaders obviously rtx can do some cool stuff but this sort of seems like a fake demo that overemphasizes the use and power of raycasting i would much prefer to see a tech demo showcasing things that are effectively impossible without rtx i wont be surprised if halflife gets a ray tracing option take your time for the skyrim episode make it perfect so everyone will be happy ray tracing is always worth it but a 1200 gpu is still not worth it 527 i dont care about fallout 76 its a bad game just release it i mean its going to be atleast 23y before 7nm so wait i saw this game the day this vid was made i didnt think it was released yesterday and just ignored it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkgxqiw8uwns have you seen this imagine doom 3 with raytracing its weird that only now when nvidia pushed ray tracingpath tracing we see modders coming up with shaders except maybe enb but i dont think its indirect lighting is path traced using the tech and doesnt need any dedicated hardware plus it runs pretty well yeah rtx quake in 2019 is ok but have you tried stalker from 2007 mb need to configurate some settings stalkash ruyoutuber will help you but can it run crysis ray tracing we write the year 2022 everything is chromed and wet fuuutuuure amd radeon vii is a thing and is capable of ray tracing i just hope that hardware will be good enough in the future to make rtx worth it in all games so we can have gta vi with rtx jesus you could sell these cards to someone with this did nvidia try approaching you to become their salesman or something im getting excited about getting an rtx now to be completely honest i dont understand why people are so excited about graphics nowday i mean theres a lot of great game that dont require a great graphics to make it fun look at road to canada minecraft and cc general those game dont need a huge amount of graphics to make it fun yeah sure great graphic can enchance the experience but i dont see the reason to have a great graphic in every game now days 1080ti gang where you at i think amd really should just leave the high end users to twist in the wind under nvidia tyranny god knows they deserve it as many were yesteryears 550ti 770 and 970 buyers amd should just concentrate on bigger margin midrange cards consoles and the like finally someone who realises how increadible it is to have realtime ray tracing i want fear with raytracing i feel kinda stupid not being able to see the difference to current technology lmao thought it looked like shit nope needed to put to 4k with raytracing simpler architecture looks very good i think a lot of architecture in video games is overly complex to hide th bad lighting which makes it look unrealistic i feel like ray tracing is gonna be like the bloom effect where its gonna be used heavily and exaggerated at first then the intensity of it will reduced in the long run im so far good with a gtx 1060 at 1080p but i have the money ready for an rtx 2070 i just hope it doesnt turn like physx did with only a few games ever supporting and sometimes doesnt even worth the performance hit mmmh 1255 thats me when im waiting for new 2kliks content 349 im glad someone else has started doing stuff like that ever since i started playing around with prebaked lighting in unity ive found myself a bit obsessed playing around with torches irl dad just wants to play quake 2 in the walls with his triple monitors 144 that is the first time i ever heard philip insult something this and minecraft are the two best examples so far and rtx clearly works and will work well in future with more performance great video bud this and minecraft are the two best examples so far and rtx clearly works and will work well in future with more performance great video bud where gone the ebony warrior car games have typically been used to show off lightingreflection improvements in the past it surprises me that there hasnt been anything like that yet implementing it into a racing game make a lot more sense than a shooter as well its not that realtime raytracting isnt impressive because it most certainly is its the facelift games have needed for several generations and i personally cant wait until its feasible to fully replace rasterization with ray tracing afterall were only looking at the very first generation of raytracing cards and ampere is already well in the works its that if you want the traditional performance of a flagship gpu you have to pay for technology you arent using its the main selling point of nvidias flagship lineup its even in the name not only that its the feature nvidias using to justify the huge premium you need to pay over pascal cards if i only cared about high refresh gaming or 4k i would be forced to pay for rt and tensor cores which would be doing literally nothing when i went to fire up an intensive game its completely besides the point but the old style quake was much more pleasurable to watch than the raytracing one the raytracing made it look like any happy area whereas the old version was very intimidating these kind of things probably need a lot of adjustment in raytracing world to get the atmosphere right there it is been a minute my nigga amd will add ray tracing features when itll be viable for now its just fancy effect for a quite hefty price however its definitely good that nvidia gives an opportunity for game developers to get a hang of it before it could become a standard feature takes me back 15 years ago when we had videosdemos of quake 3 in ray tracing nice to see we dont need a cluster of computers anymore to make it run though i cant wait to see what devs can do with cryengines real time ray tracing me i might get ray tracing if it comes to the original unreal or halflife 3kliksphilpthe best game for ray tracing is minecraft me im interested i completely disagree with ur theory nvidia released unfinished gimmick tech so that people like you would not purchase the truck load of unused 1080ti mining cards that have flooded the market dont believe me wait 5 years i couldnt help but imagine someone walking in on him while hes fidgeting with the monitor and looking at the ceiling cant wait for raytracing to just be included in the box without it being a premium nice obligatory lense flares on the thumbails the aliens who simulated our universe found it best to make light a wave and a particle and a constant yeah i dont regret my 1080 ti and i still think it was the best value x80 ti yet not going to replace it until like 7nm or alike check out the raytracing reshade its pretty cool i recently got a 1440p monitor now i can enjoy philip in even more quality with more pixels when are preorders for dd2 i got a 2080ti because my 980ti was aging i didnt buy it for rtx but it has been really fun to experience only downside is you need a 2000 series to run it false they specifically made it available for older generations like the 1000 series will it run as well of course not but you can absolutely run it and see how raytracing works edit and further in the video you actually say the older hw works thats what i get for commenting before watching it all it works on a gtx 1060 as well thanks for beta testing phil ill buy the amd version for half the price when it comes out my 2070 was only running this with like 4060 fps and really choppy looking on 1080144hz if anyone was wodnering what a lesser rtx was like intelligent entertaining and informative as ever thankyou for these little gimmicks 20xx cards are so not worth it to me i honestly turn these kinds of gimmicks off every game fps to me is king tried to play it with a radeon 580 you need a raytraycing compatible card im surprised they wont even allow me to melt my gpu surely nvidia wants me to buy a 2000 series ah well ill just go back to q2xp you do not need a 200 series card only to run it well i hope amd gets around to adding hardware acceleration for raytracing to their cards soon and yet no one has ever made a video about what is happening when we trace the math or tech behind it i honestly thought it was a df video when i clicked it was positively surprised 4k vr raytracing fps games coming this fall i wanted to hear someone about quake not your rant about nvida vs amd wtf was that shitshow thank you philip way too few people appreciate what nvidia has achieved and what realtime raytracing means i want doom 2016 with rtx because here the ray tracing seems more quality maybe reduce the grain also blurred the ray tracing httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvx19siltr0qu amd sold a 100 million chips in ps4s and another 50 on xbox ones im tired of people acting like amd is an underdog and unable to invest in competing just because thier pc gpu marketshare is smaller so whats the difference between water reflections such as in hl2 and the reflections on that computer screen in this philip can talk about a bottle of water for several hours and id like it excellent video as always philip clearly demonstrated and explained why we should look at the concept of nvidia ray tracing tech as an interesting early step forward in graphics rendering technology instead of a step backwards and a limited gimmick i think at least in the case of rtx people should stop asking why about the technology and instead ask why not this tech will lead to something commonplace in the rapidly coming future and its fascinating to witness the first step in that direction when is csgo getting raytracing the original is still better looking the new ray tracing bullshit looks bland boring all just one long stretched out gradient shade of grey so dumb retards ofcourse dont care they want to show off their poor blingbling gtx 2k are like the gold rolex for snobs who arent that rich at all having tried the quake rtx demo on my 1060 6gb ive realized that this rtx marketing is bullshit i dont see the point in looking at fancy reflections in water puddles in an action game ssr screenspace reflections are way better imo the fact that you can have really nice reflections and still have 110 fps is a tradeoff id take a game that blew me away with ssr is insurgency sandstorm it manages to run at 100 fps with on max settings including ssr id rather wait till theres no downside to the tech or if amd releases something more compelling i should mention that i ran quake rtx on a lower resolution so id have 30 fps even in fhd it doesnt catch my eye gtx 1070 about 10 fps stable 20 fps with a 1080ti lets go everyone talks about raytraced light but no one talks about raytraced sound just imagine how good it would be having sound bounce off walls convincingly and finally with real time delay and reverb this a great example how youd be great at making more diverse content outside of csgo your commentary and editing is always so good in few years we will be able to plugin in the matrix deus ex ray tracing when i have to disagree with you on the competition part rtx was created by competition but its not by amds dedicated gpus integrated graphics are at the point where they are an acceptable experience in most games and that will only improve in the coming years we are soon going to be at the point where like with sound cards before only the most enthusiastic enthusiasts will require a dedicated gpu at least we would be unless some kind of new revolutionary feature were introduced that does require a dedicated graphics card this is rtx rtx isnt really competing against any other comparable product its a plan to keep dedicated gpus and by extension nvidia relevant for the near future another thing that confused me is that you said nvidia would have released something else if vega was any good thats not the kind of timeline these things run on the decision to include rt cores on the 2000 series was made long before nvidia knew anything about vega high lev awesome video with correct information quake 2 first maybe half life 1 next o if you watch the noisy parts at 240p it looks photorealistic 1997 need a powerful pc run quake 2 2016 need a powerful pc to run deus ex mankind divided 2019 need a powerful pc to run quake 2 nice video and yes ray tracing in real time is really cool but the performance impact is so bad that i dont think itll be worth it until the rtx 30xx or rtx 40xx for games that is ray tracing isnt realistic it makes everything into a mirror dont have a flashlight just use a huge 4k monitor problem solved 349 y tho thanks really good video oof not even 60fps on 1440p on a 2080ti thats a big yikes might as well make a separate card that does only ray tracing like we had the video3d cards you can still use ray tracing without a rtx card 20 series 1080 ti and really powerful pascal cards should be able to run this just fine have you seen cryteks noir tech demo of raytraced reflections philip it can actually run on pascal and vegaera hardware its a bit hackier than nvidias fullblooded implementation but shows you have been able to do raytracing with reasonable framerates for a while now i like how ray tracing has the most noticeable effect on older games and simple games like minecraft and not games with more complex graphics criticizing a 1200 gpu for only being smoothe at 1080p in a 22 year old game with its main feature enabled is dumb oh okay the way all of the light subtly mixed at 615 was nut nvidia releasing the rtx line was great for the whole industry it gave a push to all developers and artist to find ways to implement rt the two projects i am more surprised by are the mincreaft ptgi by sonyc ether some people have been doing pbr textures for it and it looks photo realistic check this two videos 1 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxoek2uf0dw 2httpsyoutubekzgdnqvskva and the thing that amazed me was screen space ray tracing i didnt even know it existed you can check it been injected in many games with costume reshade made by a nvidia devoloper named pascal glitcher examples gta v httpsyoutubeikktu2kkcwo fallout 4 httpsyoutubeyprtymie728 wow httpsyoutubehjspxhmephc but the most amazing thing for me will be ai denoise in viewport and final for 3d renders in programs like blender corona vray etc blender has already some projects going on 1 httpsyoutube6eci4vx3o 2 httpsyoutubeht6nblv7wq one does not simply disarm a tripwire 1310 i can hit 60fps 1440p 110 fps 1080p and about 30fps 4k running on a 2080ti 2010mhz looks great i dug out the original quake2 cd to try this doom 3 with ray tracing i share phillips enthusiasm for doing weird things with light sources irl i also experienced that when i first started to appreciate good graphics that i also started to just notice how realistic real life is especially when i first found out about ray tracing everytime i see ambient occlusion reflections or very complex lighting in real life it just makes me appreciate how beautiful real life can be it made me really start to take a lot more pictures edit sorry if the writing of my sentences sounds a bit weird i was really tired when writing this its kinda fake the rtx one obviously has different textures space engine uses ray marching for nebulae in the newest version 0990 cool perspective 2kliksphilip remember post video about your rtx card when it dies suddenly how long it worked coff read nvidia forum the teasers are real me want skyrim btw have you played the bruma mod its and amazing piece of artwork i remember john carmack doing a keynote talk about light rendering at quakecon years ago and how ray tracing was the dream weird to think weve come this far in such a short space of time what is the skiing game at 435 i thought there would be a multiplayer scene 60 players online though i would say rtx is dying technology the bottleneck with adding raytracing may be outside of the gpu think api implementations not using the cpu or system memory well enough or the os getting in its own way elsewhere vulkan helped but it did not magically fix everything goddammit im so mad they banned it in germany anyone know how to get it vpn doesnt seem to work would this constitute a new crysis but youre missing the point no klik youre missing the point you have money to shit around on a computer because its your job the entire rtx line is bullshit it cant do raytracing reliably and yet its sold for such a bs price nvidia rushed the shit out of it only for quake 2 to be the only properly traced game and even thats somewhat limited yeah you paid 1000 dollars to play a game older than csgos general audience but this is a hobbyists card its for extreme enthusiasts then what the fuck is the point of rtx 2060 and 50 i would understand if rtx were to be a 5k card like a titan or something with the rest of the line being conventional but its not the entire line is rtx bs and nvidias 1660 doesnt do shit nvidia could have waited a bit until rt for one more gen and done conventional 1100s and 1200s or something but they jumped the gun and all we have to show for it is a 22 year old game being played what is the point of where is ogdrub vs the ebony warrior wow i like this skyrim gameplay its a cool tech but nvidia just scams people only few games have this tech and they misleaded everyone on release you only focused on top cards and you skipped most important thing in market mid range amd seems to focus on it and they are succesful gpus are getting cheaper and more powerful where nvidia just sells 15 versions of modified 1080s 7mn cards are already out radeon vii santasatnas 2 better have ray tracing your 4k fps is what i get when running this on a gtx 1080 in 720p holy damn you played devastation so rare to find someone else who played it great birthday gift thanks phillip who needs an rtx card when we can render a 320x240 raytraced scene of untextured spheres in 20 hours on a commodore 64 i cant get this in germany you should definetely check out gift by cryo they made good work on using light in gameplay i feel like a separate gtx 20series would be better since rtx is in so few games i dont feel justified in spending the premium on the raytracing that i wont use where is ebony is it only me or bf1 just simply looks better then bf5 i think the gothic series would be beautiful with raytracing 3 you almost got him should have used the ambassador i will buy a new gpu when my 1080 ti cannot play new games a 4k and i will definately buy the best card in the market man i love witchard phillips from digital foundry such detailed explanation of the inner workings of the game 012 note the steam version allowed running on my 1080ti after updating to the very latest drivers before that it refused to run with no rtx capable gpu found unsurprisingly its slow 20 fps at half resolution but still fun to tinker with i both pity and envy the youngest generation theyll find it harder to appreciate stuff like this but will also likely be around way longer than us and see even more crazy shit i dont get why are you so rough on amd and yes games with raytracing and tech demoes are really excessive and often unrealisticcuz of not adjusted light sources and overbright and other issues with it to pretend it looks better by being flashy thing is that it doesnt it just is accurate as for the very last graphics jump that is noticeaable that we will ever have well its good but nothing we havent seen in some form already it was used in cgi and animated movies for decades next video on ray marching i especially like sphere tracing being a bro whos used blender for a few years and using cycles its mind blowing seeing what these cards are doing and how well it renders these games making me mcnerd out amd is not in trouble theyre now the clear industry leader in cpu technology against a company multiple times their size now that they are a node ahead of intel and nvidia their gpu division is entirely focused on compute cards for datacenters igpus for apusembedded systems and low to midrange desktop cards the things that actually make them money these are far bigger markets than the relatively niche highend desktop segment which they do not care about genuinely thought this was a digital foundry video shit is it possible to buy a new nvidia without all the rtx part i can hear the video codec scream plsssss use denoising i did not figure odgrub for the jumping over traps guy id think he would just cleave the trap in halves half life 2 rtx will be the one to watch if it exists minecraft raytracing shader actually seems to be running much smoother than quake 2 rtxor at least q2vkpt ha 4 to 6 fps on a gtx 1060 6gb a hellalolalolot of fps we cant have it it was nothing more than a marketing campaign for nvidia 345 same i started doing that too wait for next gen when rtx gets good p agreed with pretty much everything you said i recently built a proper gaming pc after being stuck with a weak laptop for years and i went with an rtx 2060 not because i wanted the fancy rtx hardware but because i wanted something around gtx 1080 performance and this card was close enough to that while being considerably cheaper because prices around here are stupid and the used market might as well not even exist but while i wouldnt consider the dxr features to be worthwhile for the average gamer at this point i appreciate the fact that someone took the first step hell the interest in real time raytracing has been at an all time high these past months with the minecraft mods the new reshade global illumination thing digital foundry did a video with it recently too the dxr acceleration in unreal and unity and cryteks demo what i want to add is that since raytracing is supposedly a much easier way for developers to do lighting compared to traditional methods combine i want ray tracing to skyrim imagine that detailed arrow from the guard knee rt does eat traditional resources it eats memory bandwidth 80fps at 1080p on a 2080ti with a low poly game like quake 2 drops to sub60fps at 1440p smh my opinion nvidia released rt because they cant get gpu performance much higher as you said the 2080ti is only 30 faster than the 1080ti thats a very small jump nvidia needed something to get people to buy their new cards and they bet on rt unfortunately for them the even higher price and the lack of benefit in most games made it a nonstarter so the 1600 series came out so as to not let amd have complete domination of the lower end no guarantee rt speed will improve either memory bandwidth and access latency remains a sticking point and might ultimately limit how far you can push rt new ram is still a long ways away we just got gddr6 and manufacturers are still having trouble producing them given the number of rtx card failures due to memory ps people with pascal cards can sort of run it i got 37fp over 75 of gamers play at 1080p or less chances are that they all use 60 hz monitors so heres the thing getting over 60 fps shouldnt be a problem for those users even if they use crap monitors this trend isnt likely to change anytime soon so how can you improve the image for a user who keeps on using the same old monitor ray tracing it objectively improves what youre looking at the screen regardless of what screen youre using thats a huge bummer for me considering that ive got qhd and 144 hz but what can you do a 20 year old game and rtx is this meh u know that its gonna be at least 10 years before this can be done on newer games and not be shit like it is right now rtx buyers are the same people that stands in line for an iphone x the more money you got the less you seem to value it and sice you happily pay 11k for novideo thats what you get to pay the next time and the next after that this is literally like teselation nvidia was first forced it on developers and when amd added it they increased the hw for it by 10 times put the effect to max and amd fell in the benchmark graphs 1231 wait destruction darius 2 is done so long as i get good priceperformance i couldnt care less about the ray tracing gimmick maybe at some point when it no longer hogs 70 of your potential fps and doesnt cost a fortune ill consider it i prefer the q2vkpt version raytracing should be added to microsoft word imagine a splinter cell with raycasting we need a super hot style game with raytracting basically no texture ive seen a ton of these videos 244 i completely agree im neutral on the use of ray tracing in video games at least at the moment i feel like using it for reflections is kind of a waste since as you stated screen space reflections and cube maps already do a fairly decent job not to mention instances where youll see something in a reflection that isnt already visible on your screen are incredibly rare i think where ray tracing truly shines pun intended is with global illumination lighting and shadows can make or break the visuals of a game and ray traced global illumination is absolutely incredible i cant wait for this tech to evolve into something that doesnt turn every game into a slide show i feel like once we get to the point where full rtx can be enabled in games global illumination and reflections the devs will have gotten it all out of their system and there will be more visual balance opposed to the everything being overdone lovely video as usual i can already see myself in my 40s playing minecraft on the playstation 6 pro in 8k with raytracing whats that skiing game 1015 fps on my 1070ti at 1080p duke nukem 3d raytraced oh boy i when i saw the thumbnail i thought this is a digital foundry vid what a pleasant surprise it was to hear philip im surprised that raytracing is mostly demonstrated with reflections and not so much with bumping the lamp as in literally moving the light source like in roger rabbit and toy story amd is weak and nvidia is overpriced bunch of lies fallout 76s flat interior lighting isnt really a result of the engine theyre just using a shitty imagespace modifier in interiors a laser tag game with mirrors around the map would be a cool rtx demo it was pretty flawed for nvidia to try use stellar prebaked lighting and reflections as a comparison to get people excited about ray tracing like in battlefield v its demos like this that really get me excited for this technology aaa games are always going to look great and now smaller projects will look great too i got 60 fps with a gtx 1070 on 640x480 ah the sound of bfg brings back memories a game series id love to see with ray tracing is thief the ones from eidos and looking glass studios philip buys an overpriced card and then proceeds to justify his purchase with a 13minute video while using a 1997 game with ray tracing as the example of the technology being now essential for gaming moving forward even though the relative performanceimage quality ratio is atrocious at best this video almost comes off as buyers remorse especially at the end where philip admits that paying through the nose to enjoy silky smooth 1080p gaming on a 22 year old title with a 1000 video card was perhaps a big gamble what happened to the 4k is awesome even on mediumlow settings because it is a massive leap forward in overall image quality mentality maybe this tech luch was a strategic move this might have been a way of showing the consumers that they are a company driven also by passion not only by bussines youve bought 2080ti i have 660 fight me did he just drop the news that destruction darius 2 is finished hype why does the official rtx job look worse than the unofficial one youre not the only one comparing lighting in games to lighting in real life its an interesting phenomenon how about pascal gilchers ray tracing shader for reshade you should make a video about this 432 damn now i want a battlefield skiing simulator gothic 2 gold edition 2kliksphilip cool video about ray tracing ogrumb ii am i a joke to you the only man who uses raytracing to stare at asses how did old game do shadow casting and reflections without raytracing beamng has proper shadows and reflections as did gtaiv with the shadows love this sorta stuff the second the rtx cards were in the news i thought of you i feel like crediting sonicether rather than the video you saw about his work minecraft path tracing would have been more suitable bethesda e3 2019 introducing skyrim ray traced edition why are people using quake for demonstrating ray tracing is it just because its an old enough 3d engine for it to work smoothly because it really destroys the bespoke environment design of the levels all for a few shinies that are soon forgotten the left side looks way better in that first comparison shot id love to see it in a more realistic game thatll really prove its usefulness i think i want raytraced sound before ratraced lighting tbh still amazing that it exists tho we need odgrub the second video what if nvidia made a card that only handled rtx then you could power the rest of the game on another gpu amd launched their rdna architecture at computex if they price them right it could have a compelling competitor on its hands next up raytraced skyrim well now i want to see a game like superhot with raytracing this and minecraft convinced me about how good ray tracing can look philip youre the only person on youtube who can make me interested in a video about raytracing this isnt obglobber 3 imagine one day when instead of rasterising games will be 100 pathtraced its gonna be fucking nuts everybody dies takes a minute to stop by and look at the relfections on the ground wheb did you treat yourself with a 2080ti amazing how this adds nothing yesss a new video good video see you next year is destruction darius 2 coming with realtime ray tracing thicc 340 good to know im not the only one who did that i dont feel crazy now imagine using an amd card lol cool im hoping for halflife 1 with ray tracing itl just be like halflife source again but without the bugs gta ivs shadow density was pretty good when you block a light source i still find it silly that the game to demonstrate a cutting edge graphical feature is a game from 1998 i love that playable tech demos are making a comeback the last one i remember was nvidia flex buys a 1000 gpu plays a 5 game from 1997 early first my dudes minecraft ray tracing though have you ever considered being a homosexual i love you so much philip yay top 5 whos here before 100 views oh yeah i heard about that joe rogan needs to hear about this cool now its need g o d tier ai who needs minecraft hey im early odgrub vs the ebony warrior wasnt a troll was it soguys from 1000 fps to 40 fps rtx 20801440p 40fps on a 1997 game imagine the next gen console using raytracing gosh i want to see that disaster future it s begins 1000 fps pc master race theyre cheating by adding new textures to the rtx version to make it seem like ray tracing is somehow making the environments look better than it would straight up ray tracing would only affect the lighting but the rtx on version is also swapping in higher resolution textures and even particle effects sure the lighting and shadows look better but rtx alone isnt going to make a game look that much better but why do the textures change hahahhahaa funny video they gave better textures where rtx is for this they did nothing with effects where there is no rtx and where it is done everything in new technology if there is no rtx to do effects with dx11 it would be practically the same unless you have a rtx2080ti rtx is useless and brings fps in rtx games like battlefield or metro exodus enjoy a whopping 3050fps range averaging at around 42 and thats not bringing in 4k to the picture add 4k and enjoy yourself a awesome 25 fps with rtx on lol you can technically get those graphics with opengl source game dev student who tf want to play with 40 fps so you have the 2080 peasant enjoy your 40 fps lul pacman with rtx when id like to play mechwarrior 3 remastered with rtx ahead of his time yes but absolutely unnecessary all that visual effects in this game could be precocked and get the same result cool tech demo but not the way to go just yet 1000 fps off vs 43 fps onwtfnvidia jokes or bad engine rtx off 1000fps rtx on 40fps the rtx fuckin video 1000 fps to 40 fps wow amazing why its has on my recommendation i think we need at least 2 gen to make rtx 60fps in modern games its like from 2080 to 1030 we need to be patient nvidia working in a brand new project to allow us poor gamers enjoy this new technology in our humble rtx cards its based in a separate rt dedicated card for pci express we need to buy and its a similar solution with the legendary physx cards just be peishnt so basically you cant see shit with rtx on off is better lol ray tracing is bs nvidia a month ago look minecraft with ray tracing nvidia today look a 22 year old game with ray tracing nvidia in the future hey look its pong with ray tracing 1000fps wtf only difference in rtx light with gun bullet 960 fps rtx trash explains why they put it on a game as old as the hills dont think ill bother just yet as i understand it the huge performance difference is there because the tech demo is rendering in 100 rt while the original game uses only classical lighting some new games like battlefield v can use a combination of both classical lighting and ray tracing to get a few of the benefits of rt technology without suffering a huge performance hit but it need not be said that those games do not use the technology to its fullest potential which is still pretty impractical if not impossible at this time this tech demo actually does that which is pretty fascinating 1000 fps win this is the most striking example of how raytracing will affect games that ive seen it seems like nvidia has been trying to sell their tech to the public over this past year but this is the first time ive really been taken aback by any of the footage april fools is way over why is nvidia still joking running a 2070 rtx doesnt look all that great 1080p and i cant figure out why driving me nuts just looks more washed out omfg nvidia really nothing to see here that couldnt be done on 50 ebay gfx card that necro on quake ii hurts tho oh and i think theres a command to toggle between some light effects where u can see light coming in rooms from the openings in the walls which makes it look pretty amazing the ouside areas were dark so i suppose u forgot to check that peace dunno in what client its running on but with q2pro theres rmaxfps which u can set above 1000fps those 1000fps u r getting in opengl are capped 1000 fps vs 40 what the fuck low graphics vs ultra graphics rtx not really rtx on vs off this performance hit tho imagine something like gta 4 with ray tracing there is no flashes from shoots by controlled character in rtx render lol most of modern shooters 2000y not generate flash while shooting but old games do it all also many of old games have a working mirrors but latter 99 has not how did they play exactly the same both times legit just looks like a retexture with some lighting changes and mesh changes why split the screen in 2 when you can plance 2 screens side by side im playing quake ii on my nintendo 64 and it looked better then that lol looks cheaper on rtx have the people commenting on this actually play the game its way different when youre playing compared to watching a youtube video i had been playing quake 2 since before rtx then tried the path tracing mod this version is way better and really adds to the atmosphere of the game i think the old way looks better shooting the gun in rtx mode doesnt even make light and makes it look more cheap the darkness of corridors is lost as well each side shows a different half of the game screen which actually makes it much harder to directly compare too whoever made this did a bad job and this will probably hurt nvidia more then help that rivals games created today and pushes your rtx hardware for a billion dollars to the limit brilliant advertising of nvidia something stinks my gtx1080 with out rtx over 1000fps with between 10 high and 27fps low when someone dosent have a money for rtx it fucking sucks the white bold line in middle is quite distracting hard to look at the two screens simultaneously when theyre completely seperated from each other by that line or maybe im wrong either way something about this format makes it hard to digest other free mods look way better than this and they also work with every gpu please stop with this garbage and start manufacturing amd gpus too surprised these arent synced i guess quake 2 doesnt have a clavidemo function to dump the video at an exact framerate not a fair comparison when youre also using hd textures amd proved you dont need a special gpu to get the desired effects rtx is a waste of god damn money people just look for things to complain about if you dont like it then go to evgacom and look for the job opportunities link join thier team and show them what they are doing wrong good luck keep up the great work evga looks great evga keep up the great work and i will keep pinching my pennies so i can upgrade one day not impressive of a video at all gotta showcase it better than that thats not worth talking about sorr y great video showing the difference thanks i cant tell if this is just a meme or not fps difference you can learn more about quake ii rtx and check out new rtx on rtx off screenshot comparisons in httpswwwnvidiacomenusgeforcenewsquakeiirtxjune6releasedate rtx is not real they literally just remastered quake and only enabled it for rtx cards d weapon and maps are reskinned and looks different its way more than just enhanced shaders and particles i think quake ii is the first game where the rtx technology truly shines hope other games in future implement rtx as quake il and minecraft has done and i am really excited for quake with rtx on wow the first time i played game i was 11 years old in 2001now it come with rtx and i cant play it this looks like a game id play with my cousins the original quake 2 is still betterbut you got to experience it on crt they dont fucking get it is it just me or does it still look like an old pixel pos only with shadows and better lighting i know that for showing how lights works we need some lights but this all is way to bright cmon funny 500 polygons models receiving a massive shader treatment even good graphics i prefer the old one again why are we updating a 22 year old game that almost no one plays and if they do its for a few hours and said thats cool and never touched it again please spend more time on making better games and not updating games that 7 people playhonesty wtf are you thinking no other rtx demo has made me want to upgrade more than this this is so trash holy shit nvidia cmon now go and rtx minecraft facepalm the smoke in the titles were made with my gpu running this game i was looking at a list of nvidias website about which games are supporting rtx and saw quake 2 on there i thought i might have needed glasses looks very interesting so i tried this in my 1500 usd pc and i was runing at 2 fps any new singleplayer campaign in developments so what we did is turn up the brightness and made everything glossy eeeehhhh the lower quality textured dont mesh well with updated lighting imo why do people say that u need a beastly pc to play quake 2 if this rtx version needs one like wtf dis is cool apparently rtx can also change textures i doubt the changes you see are only due to ray trace water quality is higher texture quality is highershadow quality is higher etc but hey you gotta push that rtx somehow right in the original the sky is red the lighting is more demonic and hellish the mood is darker in the original they are gonna have to figure that out with ray tracing just looks like a sunny day now instead of adding rtx you could have improve the textures the game still looks ugly with lowres textures no matter how much effects you add lets make limbo with rtx wow way to destroy original artistic vision totally killed the atmosphere with your bright lights but hey ooooooo raytracing am i right now it looks way lit than original game uhm i call bullshit the rtx footage is in unlocked framerate its not pushing 30fps things that no one needs old games with rtx update looks like a fan graphic mod thank you so much nvidia again for making rtx for another game i love i now am going to play quake 2 campagin on nightmare mode and finish the whole thing the game is beautiful but rtx made it more beautiful this looks like shit original is so much better nobody even knows what ray tracing is its quite telling how much of a framerate killer raytracing is when the only game that can run it at higher than 30fps on the first generation of rtx cards is a source port of a game from the late 90s quake 3 arena rtx please why not doom i love this so much that i picked up a rtx card as my way of saying that i would like to see more classics given the rtx treatment if you guys have a partnership with bethesda id then please give the other quake games and doom 3 the rtx treatment as well i have quake 2 rtx and i have the graphics card and it looks no where near as good as this wtf i need this am i the only one who is actually not impressed by this the title of the video makes it seem like the game is being relased again bitterman is be black ooooops racism looks like a joke compared to minecraft with seus ptgi e8 ray tracing how can i fill the entire screen pg348q if i only get a decent frame rates on 1080p trailers that cut to a new scene literally every 1 to 2 seconds are horrible just horrible please bring to ps5 so much skepticism here why these are very exciting first steps they should be celebrated this is paradigm shift this game is completely raytraced in realtime at 60 frames per second on rtx 2070 and rtx 2070 is basically gtx 1080 level of performance in games with no raytracing plus a bunch of extra features for less money and its faster at deep learning too unimportant to gamers but explains why demand from people who actually make money with their gpus keeps gpu prices high but its hard to make raytracing faster and more impressive in this generation of video cards when you consider that rtx 2070 costs about 500 and has a whopping 10b transistors thats as many as in the latest 12core ryzen 3900x cpu that also goes for 500 but unlike cpus gpus also come with 8gb of super fast ram a sizable pcb and a cooling solution and they still manage to sell for about the same next generation of rtx chips will use the 7nm process instead of 12nm so they should b i like it with rtx off they could have at least reworked the enemy character polygon models but goddamn they decided for some forsaken reason to keep the ugky blocky low poly models not aesthetically appealing at all lol that poly and textures of the 90s you dont even need a gpu to render it that way will ground zero and the reckoning be included classic now its nice yes but the whole atmosphere is different in my opinion this is stupid this remake doesnt even look new mordhau looks better dont understand how this is supposed to impress me when the graphics looks like ass who tried playing this with a gtx card dont worry no one is going to bully you cool its crazy how simple good lightning can transform a game like this looks shit it kills the atmosphere of the maps rtx on command and conquer generals please barely runs on my gtx 1060 6gb thats y dont waste you time play csgo lol why did they pick the outright worst game of the quake series for this dope i am a frequent quake 3 arena online player this looks sick gonna play it this is both an excellent argument for why rtx isnt ready yet we can only go full bore on really old games and a fucking sick look at what well have with new games when the hardware gets better i want to play this game with ray tracing this game is bigger than me can some one please explain this to me quake2 rtx was a fan effort that got a lot of coverage and what nvidia basically took all that pr and said hay look were releasing rtx q2 off the backs of other peoples hard work pretty fucking shitty if you ask me someone has remade the first 3 levels of unreal 1 with unreal engine 4 adding raytracing and the spaceship is great httpsyoutube0dryzbhjhu please tell me xbox will get this too i am very excited to play this game what need i a pentium iii with 500mhz 64mb of ram and a rts card never play quake before look like halflife if somebody could remaster gta vice city like this that would be great good to see new ideas sonic mayhem join to server what cant wait rtxon e32019 bitch you need glados to run this shit totally ott on the overall brightness level when will you remake doom 1 and doom 2 nvidia rtx is a must have for all modern games prepare for next generation gaming me i play competitive games with low settings nvidia its a 97 game come on graphics is good fuuuck that nin music yeaeaeeaahhhh next quake 3 arena please make this for nintendo switch well i never played quake at all but maybe this will change my mind this really shows what this tech is capable of really doing for games the future really is ray tracing wtf is this for real a quake 2 remaster hell yeah mmm does one remind me of this halflife 1 vs halflife 1 source now i can finally hope for tibia rtx wahhhhh amazing remembering me playing quake 2 when i was young a reinstall is needed rtx worth it rtxon geforce e32019 i wonder how long we will have to wait for this to be a standard in every game 8 years nvidia bringing the ray of light to nostalgia in every comparison the left side looks better the right looks like those zelda in unreal engine videos lifeless and generic gross graphics thanks nvidia love your product keep it up rtxon e32019 i remember playing this as a kid growing up crazy to see it look so different yet the same because of this new tech neat so you made everything brighter really nice to see the improvement and dedication to the rtx franchise 3 in it to win it when your rtx 2080ti goes from 1000 fps to 7080fps average 9293 difference with rtx on they havent updated the character models or the environments just added some stupid lighting effects no thanks will minesweeper gets the raytracing treatment anytime soon this game will never get old truly challenged my pc e32019 rtxon geforce why do you make violent gamesisnt it enough violence in this world as it is rtx is a lie nvidia is dying finally something worth turning rtx on for wow look at the graphic smooth play bring me that scar the whole quake ii rtx idea sounds like when someone tries to make minecraft but 4 dimensional i so want a remake of quake ii or complete remastered cool ok it is working with my gtx 1060 6gb but smoothly only 800x600 with about 40fps 1000 for just water reflect no thanks when your pc cant run a 1997 game favorite game got rtx now just need an rtx gpu honestly and im being completely honest it doesnt look that great quake is good old game happy to see it with rtx i love so much geforce rtx 2080 ti becauze this is best what i have ever see a little too much light and i thought this game couldnt get any better quake ii with rtx why the hell do you improve the graphics of a 20 year old game gtasa with rtx oh shit look how a 15 year old game is so beautiful with rtx looks like the same game with increased brightness and added effects and surface reflections will this work on a 1080 can a ps4 pro do this rtx disabled 200 fps rtx enabled 28 fps nvidia its meant to be played with stutter damn this is actually amazing quake 2 is still my favourite fps of all time i amhappy with 50usd steam card absolutley ruined atmospere nice allright allrightlets do this now we just need higher poly models and 4k textures rtxon pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti wtf its too bright with ray tracing ruins the atmosphere vice city with rtx wait tell jamie sees this and tells joe rogan about it i wish they would make crysis series with retracing remastered 038 where are the rivets of the lamp housing guys it looks cool and all but id rather not spend the money on a gpu with ray tracing just to play quake 2 when all i can do is honestly use a modified engine like berserker q2 or just kmquake 2 and still personally look better i tried quake 2 rtx on my asus gl503vs i can run on max ray tracing settings on my gtx 1070 if i reduce resolution to 640 x 480 brighter quake ii hope i win rtxon will this be available on mac wow nice improvement good job keep up the good work nvidia rtxon that looks like it was an interesting exercise i wonder how long it took to reengineer everything why play fortnite at 240fps when you can play quake 2 at 60fps for the love of god please make classic quake like this also i am a new geforce streaming streamer it will be awesome to win razor blade 15 advanced or any laptop in the need to become a legend rtxon my gtx 1070 runs this at 6 id assume it means 6 frames per second but it feels more like 6 frames per minute raytracing seems to improve graphics by years especially in older games hello sir can i have one rtx please thank you nvidia this is amazing ill probably wont win but i guess you got to keep trying no 3 let me win a rtx lost for words my pc is so slow the trailer is laging the reason i need an rtx graphics card i dont have a gaming pc yet but ray tracing also looks better than real life 2009 but can it run 2007s crysis 2019 but can it run 1997s quake ii this is what i call a death of my childhood id rather play quake on n64 than this heresy of oldschool shooters nvidia you son of a bit bring rtx to gtx 1050 series now ruins the style and atmosphere yeah the look of it rtxon now it only needs tessellation and hd texture mod to make it perfect what the fuck looks awesome it runs fine on my 1080 as well maxed out but with a resolutin scale to 50 just goes to show how important good lightning is in games why quake 2 tho i mean its a good game but is very uninspired compared to the legendary quake 1 then again almost all id software games are uninspired after romero left holy thats a big difference amazing well done who ever did this pls relase it on steam take my ducking money plsss apparently the nvidia rtx tech was in the strogg logistical train giveaway 1000 is a lot of money to be able to play a 22yo game with raytracing at a decent framerate hahaha what settings need enabled to get the effect 033 mine definitely does not look like that lol its a shame it only pertains to a handful of people who own a 2080ti rtx its on e32019 rtxon geforce i have a good title for this quake ii remastered odd thing is i just download the demo and atx is not working for me and my god the fps is real low for some reason rtx is amazing give me a card that can run with 120 fps 1080p please ahh man not good another game i cant play with a rtx wow 2019 and this is the depth of inspiration for new tech seems unreal looking at a classic with such good graphics 0 this is alchemy already polishing copper into gold so the polygons are the same it looks pretty with rtx next minecraft please xd neat now do halflife unreal tournament please joe rogan is foaming at the mouth right now now i want to see halflife rtx nice addition although is not the lighting too bright i couldent care less about quake 2 and with its lame stroggs give us a real sequel to quake 1 its june 6 pls realese it already quake live is broken and im too lazy to reinstall my drivers light add muzzle flashes so you guys are telling me that you wouldnt be able to do a similar graphical quake 2 like this one without an rtx effects look ok but look nothing revolutionary from what ive seen some years ago p its june 6th i wanna play plz joe t1 line rogan will be so happy its june 6th where is the download fancy and all but the new lighting is like straight from unicron land where gibs turn into rainbows and puppies huge hit on the artstyle for the worse purely for showing off raytracing and nothing more which is a bit of a shame this is more serious sam than quake quake iii arena pls including all skins maps the community made i always thought this game would make for a cool movie thats really cool you can play 1997 game on 2019 hardware and let me guess solid 60fps yeah no i remember playing this game on the nintendo 64 as a kid scary scary times lol like if u already have quake 2 and u r waiting this like si ya tienes quake 2 y ests esperando esto so correct me quake rtx is not running on gtx 1060 6gb and higher but no rtx so only on rtx looks too bright takes away a lot of the atmosphere of the original game when all the windows are streaming sunlight in have got multiplayer will this work on gtx machines good start nvidia but you have to fix the intensity of every light source so the rtx mode matches the brightness of the original game gotta make it perfect for the fans and when its perfect theyll start to ask you for more themselves personally id replay the whole set of oldschool shooters with rtx on its like putting nice makeup on my ugly face mhm so that means there will be unreal remastered in future too better games to rtx halo series halflife series killing floor 2 the evil within 12 resident evil 5 gears of war serirs starcraft 2 call of duty 1world at war medal of honor aafrontlineairborne games with a large focus on light when i see 3000 or more games with this kind of treatment then i will think im buying this card the problem with all product is if few people only can afford this technology also the developer of games industry they not priorities this rtx treatment and only 3 or 4 games or ten get it really is not worth it the cost of the nvidia card right now thought im very excited of this rtx it is very game changing experience complete darkness was supposed to set the mood though all this fancy tech and still no muzzleflashes using smoke and mirrors to promote products that are goodas long as you dont use rtx at least no higher than low but are overpriced 10 series cards without rtx dont take it from me do your own research they are using a game that is over 20 years old and has less polygons in one whole level than a single small room in shadow of the tomb raider they are using someone elses source engine quake2xp and someone elses textures but added rtx lighting but look at their comparison shots theyre showing off highres textures with rtx lighting against the original games textures 1997 textures and the original lighting source ports add better lighting than that just wow ive been debating between a used 1070 ti and the rtx 2060 but not for the rtx features the 2060 edges out the 1070 ti without rtx but the 6gb ram concerns me im waiting for amds navi to come out and see what nvidia does i see a price drop on the 2060 coming and possible a 2060 ti at hey rtx pls on half life 1998 good job on fucking the shady brown atmosphere i kinda loved the original polygonal explosions gonna miss them can it run minecraft someones gotta show this to joe rogan q2 is his favorite game mine too man looks cool a little bit like quake 2xp mod hope this also could be like a mod for others who dont own rtx cards cant wait to kick some strogg ass in high def so you didnt do quake 4 with rtx because time to fill up the fridge with jolt cola will this run on 1060 glorious i cant see much of a difference can anybody help me out this is what i needed after the shitty quake champions quake 2 with better graphics rtx need to work with only 1gb bad for nvidia im sorry but this just looks fucking ugly beyond belief just adding a bunch of fancy lighting effects and shine to everything with no cohesion doesnt automatically make it look better in fact it can end up looking worse if you want an actually well done hd quake 2 mod go download berserker no need for a rtx card to play this game ill watch some youtuber do it cant w8 for it disappointing maybe next time use an hd texturepack with bumpmaps and shaders or something so that the rtx actually do something more than just adding a bit of gloss or lightbloom both of which have already been done for a couple of decades fortnight i prefer the classics yeah quake 2 was a good game if only i could trade my 1080 for an rtx 2080 ill just save more money and upgrade with the next round of rtx cards i guess really hoping everyone can see what this is this exists because these cards do not have the power to use ray tracing on a new game and hold decent fps thats the only reason why this exists makes sense they would have re done quake 4 instead no rtx gpus couldnt handle it seriously this tech is way ahead of its time amazing i want this in quake 3 arena fuck yeah i was waiting for such a thing for 20 years and now we got it quake ii rulz this is ridiculous but also cool the only game that allows rtx on fps on you expect us to waste 1000 to play this shit jesus christ you people are delusional what an awesome present thank you intensely sips white monster with a tear in eye weres my rtx tetris looks like the stereotypical game that kids play in movies i can hear joe rogan yelling at his monitor that looks very impressive on such an old game lol i love it sips yup those were the days basically ray tracing on the original coulda called it quake ray this just looks wrong anything over 5aud and not buying boomers unite my titan rtx is ready and so is my body i could ask why but id rather shut up cause i have an excuse to play quake 2 again the future of gaming is in its past wut funny how rt is only practical on a game with 20 polygons on the screen at any given time 010 would nvidia 3d again you wrecked the games atmosphere up it was all gloomy and dark and now its so shiny and bright that it feels like youre running through dedust2 over and over again instead of some foreign alien city cool rtx though 2029 wolfenstein 3d is now rtx compatible okay but why im sorry but reviving an old game with lowpoly models just so you can switch on ray tracing shows just how weak the 2080 is wow what a future reviving 20yr old games to show off rtx because new games like battlefield arent exciting people enough gotta play on nostalgia instead of just adding it to a good game jamie pull that up i cant wait to not run this we could make a new amazing games with that technology but no lets just fuck a corpse hey community is there any work put into it to be playable on radeon cards this exclusivity is killing me it just works on 25 year old games keep lying to yourselves fanboys maybe those overpriced gimmicks will be worth the 1700 one day sweet baby jesus in a blender its beautiful whyd you spend this much time on the grayest quake seriously there were better games to pick wtf is wrong with you fuck you nshitia amd do better doom shareware with rtx ok now i want it ray tracing is really cool but the aesthetic the feel and lighting design of the original game is completely lost in the switch i dont like the end result very much its a different and worse to me result half life 3 next rtx marketing bullshit for a 1997 old game we can expect crysis with rtx soon enough in 2030 wont buy your overprized crap soon pong rtx edition whos gonna supply gamers with gtx 1070 to play this old crap i wish i could have a good computer someday you should have kept the dark gritty atmosphere and the next raytraced game will be half life 2 id kill to see og doom and quake get this ray tracing treatment both would be fing amazing to see cause they were all about dark oppressive atmosphere and creepy lighting i want an rtx now hope this comes with the reckoning and underground or was it ground zero its been a long time since i played this with the expansion packs put it on xbox one x looks awful old square models glitter like plastic xx would love that on console cuz i dont own a pc and why so many dislikes looks awesome sip yep now quake that was a good game my fav game of all time with a new coat of paint you say i hope i can turn down the brightens quake needs to be dark better than cod series my childhood game on ps1 good old days only for pc bullshit bethesda quake 2 and 4 were on xbox put that shit out love id quakeby the way i dont have rtx graphic card i built a computer in the 90s for quake ii and now you tell me i have to build one again for quake ii when will it end joe rogan right now ahh yes 2019 when the best games are from the 90s nice work but you need to turn the brightness way back down and get some good contrast going honestly besides the bling bling in light and reflection the whole atmosphere is gone too much light you can see everything now what made these titles get under your skin was the dark corridors low light corners its like going in full daylight in an abandoned warehouse on earth as long as it is free it is worth playin a few hours just to see the technical achievements looks worse than the hd texture pack to me just looks like a enb series mod or a gta san andreas mod to wet but to bright its a pass from me looks to me they stole q2vkpt model that they made a ray traced remaster quake ii got a soundtrack wayyyy better than most games today have why the hell is this so bright whats the difference between this and those graphics mods in gta 4 i mean it looks cool but kinda ruins the atmosphere also q2 is shit because it doesnt have airstrafe talk to me when rtx is native on q1 were not really proving much if were going to go after the 90s eh already sick of rehashings make new titles with rtx you could however make all source engine games rtx compatible in conjuntion with valve gmod rtx would be sick see custom models finally lit properly joe jamie pull that new quake ii up rogan is free so thats what it takes for it to mantain a steady 60fps next up is mdk this looks more like a fanmod than an official nvidia patch can we get pacman with rtx next a bit too bright and prissy needs to be dark and brooding like the original i was almost waiting for a unicorn to be farting out a rainbow because of it cs 16 with rtx i love how the bullets are invisible xd i just hope this game is not 60 or something like that when no game devs are using rtx so you release the tech on an ancient game to continue your pathetic cash grab we need quake1 rtx too they made it too bright its supposed to be dark and dreary no thanks cant wait to play this on my powerful 2013 ps4 it seems selling rtx cards has become a challenge they turned quake ii into a real time xtrategy game how about quake 4 rtx finally the 2018 graficcards are strong enough to render a 1997 game with rtx yay another hd remake game ill run at low quality settings and think i just spent 60 to play like its the 2 counterpart now lets see crysis with raytracing cue evil laughter too bright the atmospheres gone alot of the new lighting drastically changes the mood and feeling of each stage but its still a fun and interesting new look for quake 2 so i guess this means my potato macbook pro wont be able to run this please may we have a port to ps5 joe rogan is gonna love this quake 1 with rtx please that frame rate hurts tbh why quake ii why not quake 1 why ohhhh be still my beating heart 3 will this run on my laptop lol halfway serious tho well fuck me in tha ass i just bought an organic rib eye steak because of this d if i go away from my pc i have rtx i dont need to pay insane money for those gpus hehe just wish i could get my hands on an rtx card cant apply ray tracing to make any significant difference in modern games so you have to go all the way back to a game from 23 years ago great job nvidia software mode is all i need so they gave it color ill buy this just for multiplayer with ray tracing quake 2 looks better but it loses some of the dark atmosphere which was present in the original maybe they used too much ligth in the scenes to show off their new ray tracing graphics still shit tho come on quake 2 was my least favorite of all of the games in the series interstate 76 with rtx rtx is a big scam i hear ati will have it as well fed up of been scammed by the leather jacket man nvidia fix ur ram issues first shut up and take my money btw looks like someone been messing with the monitor setting and now its rtx comptable thank you youve spoiled it only problem with rtx is ddr6 memory fail and will you do one for the quake i especially with arcane dimensions 044 i see this baby was slightly changed along with railgun the only game with rtx your rig can handle deus ex 2000 with rtx i might be uninformed but i really dont get the whole rtx thing to me it looks like a minecraft shaders mod man killing things doesnt really look so satisfying great now i can play halflife in hd now q2 ctf was the best back in the day necromancy nvidia were laughing with you not at you dark souls with rtx pls i prefer the original i think this rtx stuff is a bit overhyped time to stock up on monster energy drinks congratulations you killed the atmosphere of the quake ii who doesnt want to game this game stop trying to buy us up with nostalgia 1997 realtime 3d beautiful graphics 2019 realtime raytracing beautiful graphics no new textures fail cant wait to play this classic at 24 fps gonna be completely honest does this look nice yeah sure but at the same time the extremely bright lighting ruins the dark and sinister atmosphere of the original game when minecraft and quake 2 now have better graphics than the newest call of duty quake ii when quake became boring and dropped all the neat shit from quake this actually looks pretty awesome this game ran on ps1 no kidding looks like something unity shit out a blast from the past disappointed that this wont work on amd gpus but damn does this look good really appreciate you showing what id tech 2 can be capable of even in 2019 nvidia how about quake 1 id software is the legendary king of video game developers but why though that is the ugliest railgun ive ever seen bfg looks bad but holy shit that railgun if only it was quake 1 well this brought back fond memories of all day all night lan parties i dont know buying a really expensive graphics card just to replay quake 2 with better lighting i think this evidences that when a game increases in poligons high res textures and sprites it is more difficult to see the changes in image quality with rtx on but can it run quake 2 whops wrong game so in 2030 we can play fallout 3 with raytracing its very sad that you didnt remaster quake 1 sips heh they making good games again nvidia painting lens flares on the mona lisa rtx off looks may better imo ufff the original sound 33 i love when remakes keep the original sound are you ready ok half life with ray tracing just buy a new card minecraft modders can you run 4k minecraft me yes nvidia can you run quake ii me has left the chat yeah too bright ruins the original dark atmosphere run quake 2 pc no problem run quake 2 on rtx settings pc shit cold sweat run crysis pc sure thing man i can finally handle it run crysis on rtx settings pc sweats intensely shrinks down like a raisin what kind of madman are you someone pinch me i think im dreaming you can experience the first 3 levels of the game for free only 3 levels sorry but i am not interested still not as good as quake2xp after minecraft raytracing quake raytracing so thats the industry now out of fresh ideas and remaking the old ones from 20 to 30 years ago nice stagnation you have there at your company it would be better with quake iii o next quake1 nvidia please add the original way ahead of its time rise of the triad rott to your rtx vintage games lineup quake ii rtx because raytracing doesnt make modern titles look that much better and we have to sell this crap somehow hmmm quake 1 and half life rtx most pathetic way ever to justify scam rtx market some games should be left untouched just sayin pls remake a quake 3 too the best fps ever made this is what happens when past and future collide once dark and scary game comes now with extra light what is the point of making a game like this and build nee content in it denk remastershit can we get a new quake game with the doom and wolfenstein new orderold blood treatment imagine being able to hack ogres to death with an axe or executing a knight with their own sword we need this words cant describe how erect i am right now continue the story i want to see a continuation from quake 4 i just dont see the point in this okey this is fucking awesome gonna cop this when i get my new rtx 2080 gonna relive my childhood again lets go duke3d with raytracing and 3d enemies hey i can dream dont care what it looks like i want to play quake 2 too bright meh what about other games probably a bit more than raytracing eh ah the good ol days i used to have a notepad in my computer desk drawer with all of my favorite lobbies ip addresses written on it thats right kids we had to type in the ip addresses manually back then to play online deathmatch hey how about adding rtx to half life 3 pc sweating intensifies isnt it 2019 s doombut in egypt do classic quake now anyone who loves the music should check out the remix album i directed stroggos rising httpswasdbandbandcampcomalbumstroggosrising no quake one quake 2 but the strogg opened the curtains to let the light in the game is perfect buttoo much light twentytwo years later buy a 1000 video card and we turn the lights on ingame most expensive dlc ever if only i had a stupidly overpriced rtx card to run it with nice this is probably my all time favorite game quake 3 looks better than any game on current gen consoles how sad for me personally this is a big dislike not only does the game lose all its charm its turned into a bright mess of light it doesnt even resemble quake 2 anymore brighter is not better sorry does this run on a gtx 1070 itd be great to see them add ray tracing to half life i wonder if this will run on gtx cards where are new games i payed 15k for my rtx card and you are giving me old shit game with shit lights make ai better you pricks will this have the textures from quake 2 xp or other new textures even with this game my computer exploded all i got was 10 seconds of 4 fps gameplay and now i have a hole in my wall 1997 game clearly something wrong next one gonna be command and conquer 1995 thank fuck its not skyrim diablo2 really needs raytracing i just creamed a little glad ive owned the game since 97 so um hl3 with rtx or ill die a happy man if just half life gets the rtx treatment nothing special really its p o o r geometric i understand its a old game but 2035 ztx 6090 can run the new gta xiii mars at a solid 400 fps with zyklonb tracing and only 50000 spend 700 to play 20 year old game the way its meant to be played nvidia question why d its so funny no one wants support rtx feature so nvidia must reborn 20 old year game d fuck again q2 is not a classic it is the fps this reminds me quake 1 with dark places mode httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoe3mrdsmmy weird flex but ok the only game in which after turning on rtx it will continue to run in 144fps ruined the look of the weapons now imagine crysis with ray tracing pc gamers love recycling old shit dont they so 144fps off then operation overlord is so damn good waste of money looks like a rip off tf2 what about quake 1 they should remake quake 1 with raytracing now that would be something please have multiplayer then i can play q2 in this glory with low ping brightness expansion pack now ray tracing half life honestly this looks like shit its too bright it doesnt feel grimy or as dark as q2 halflife 1 with rtx when lmao new meme tsunami is coming the irony of quake ii being able to be played on windows 10 while quake iv is too outdated for windows 10 you mfs really gonna make me buy a new card now so when is wolfenstein 3d rtx coming should have made quake iii they kinda ruined it though 033 look at the dark atmosphere and the red sky then its all bright and sunny happy day thats why you dont hire an engineer to do an artist job lame from the thumbnail i thought it was minecraft any chance of thi running on a 1070 2019 games world of warcraft classic call of duty modern warfare quake ii too much light quake ii needs to be much darker better than quake champions does anyone know if shield tv users will have access to this through geforcenow i havent been able to find anything about it being supported or not finally a game that has playable fps with rtx on is it just me or when it was darker it was slighty better because of the atmoshpere so glad that quake2 is back it brings me my childhood memories again i played it the first time for playstation in 1999 and i still play quake 2 for pc with yamagi engine that makes an excellent performance for this game really please minecraft rtx this is like valve reproducing hl for hls over again lolso i bought a 1200 card to get graphics like these p why not for ps4 really wanna see this for duke nukem jesus why the heck did i buy the nvidia rtx 2080 well i can play quake 2 really i just switched from console too i just bought i79700k and amd is dropping some banger cpus that are cheap too what am i getting into ray tracing better graphical fidelity 20 year old game still looks 20 years old they could have remade quake ii from the ground up but instead took the greedy approach of selling us games we already own with extremely minor improvements if you could even call it that huge disappointment poor rail and bfg c please make it for quake 3 as well looks cool and rtx is awesome tech but for quake ii it makes it look too light quake was never that bright please remake all ps1ps2 gen games with rtx honestly this is a cool idea imagine kotor with improved lighting i think it definitely improves the graphic and hopefully make it more accessible for newer generations how dare you defile quake ii with your raytracing sorcery will i be able to run it on my voodoo 4 though gladly i can play this in my radeon vii why is rtx off on the left side looking better than rtx on quake ii is a horror shooter turn the lights off even as a fan of quake ii i have to be honest and say that i do not find the prospect of playing it again after all these years with ray tracing a compelling reason to buy an rtx card surely you have something better than this whats next space invaders with ray tracing why did youtube recommend this to me saying it was posted 20 mins ago it looks better in the original the lighting and shadows do not fit to the games style go tetris rtx looks like some 2 unity game now quake 2 candy edition funny no need for new games new expensive cards has been made for 20 years old games actually looks good but whats the price yeah i live in pussy so its really priceous the original looks better tbh the only people who will be playing this are people in their late 40s who played the game back in its prime millennials will look at it like ewwww the grafficks are sukz dont do this to my wallet also they changed the railgun model and it looks like shit wish they would release a remastered quake 2 for xbox just because we can doesnt mean we should so thats how gaming in future will look like luckily the music remains the same and not raytraced any credit to christoph schied do not touch q3 please who asked for this ugh one of my fav games yall have no clue where to put your rtx so you put it everywhere you shouldnt what about raytraced hl1 i wished that they made a full remastered version of this game cause it is a boombadabim cant wait but can it run quake yeah no just fuckin no just because you can does not mean you should fukin no why does everything nowadays have to be bright as fuck and oversaturated this doesnt look anything like quake 2 so 2000 rtx card only worth to play 20 years old title with max settingwhat a joke wow rtx even increases texture resolution and detail please just use the original textures even with low res textures your tech will make it look gorgeous i played q2 multiplayer primarily q2dm1 for just about 10 years this is awesome please bring rtx tetris why no aiupscaled textures oh my fucking god quake 2 rtxed edition buy now only 60 when you get shaders for minecraft joe rogan has entered the chat i dont have raytracing so ill try this new game with that feature off joe rogan has entered chat hot dam thats a big improvment ok we will chose just mod i would love to mod this quake if theres any father of graphics its nvidia amazingly excellent job nvidia you have just awakened old gaming fan just for this lush natural graphics great tunes by sonic mayhem okay then i guess they noticed how popular the minecraft path traced gi became and theyre trying to take advantage by doing something similar only thing is it uses their proprietary rtx technology and looks absolutely terrible in comparison to what a single person created without the need for an rtx card i mean it looks cool and all but the whole graphical upgrade doesnt really look all that rad in a 20 year old game han solo shot first can you still bhop send this to joe rogan games now days are boring all about graphics what ever happened to a good story line or even the sound tracks in the game developers didnt have much to work with but made a damn good game for being creative eg vice city need for speed underground 2 midnight club etc so many games now days are all about multiple player theres no effort put in to it the only effort developers putting in is graphics doom ethernal or quake 2 with rtx miss it on my ps1 i have a disc that has 3 or 2 games include this everytime move to new door need to loading a bit not sure because of 3 games on a disc or just its slow to load quake 4 please need this in the original half life i did see that coming the time when fps required real skills but why how about quake 3 rtx daaaam imagine max rails servers with rtx on lol crysis rtx do it for science why not just remastered quake ii cmon id i will throw money for that ffs can yall hit me up with a beast pc seeing the graphics kills me a little but can it run crysis rtx looks great but why is it so bright now finally it can support something buy overpriced graphics card to play game from 90s with only half of frame rate you are used to what a great deal nvidia how about wipeout 2097 rtx so rtx is so useless you had to dig out 20 yo game crysis am i a joke to you to be fair quake 2 is the best quake in my opinion and i dident even play it on pc back then i played it on the ps1 yup lets restore other games since most games nowadays are cash grabs or just plain belong in the dumpster that being said this actually looks pretty dope this is incredible my pc could hardly run this video let alone the game d man i loved this game as a kid and watching in awe as my older brother went through the game like it was nothing a shame that this revamp is only for pc cries in console so this will only run on rtx or will it be other nvidia graphics card supported the lighting in original was suppose to be dark i hope it has modding support the daylight needs to be more orangeish and fit the times of the original maps better it doesnt feel like stroggos in its current state all in all besides the new railgun and bfg modelsit is nice and i would defo pick it up if i had a rtx gpu im not afraid of no quake is it an announcement season april fool joke looks really interesting but rail gun model why u changed it id fuckin shit myself in excitement if they manage to get this on blood bad downgrade from the gdc demo minecraft looks better with raytracing minesweeper with rtx it send me back in time too the year of q2 release and i see on the 56k modem internet that u can download bots for q2 multiplayer id like to see a version of this for quake 1 i heard the original is being released on the pc classic mini by unite as much as i love the textures the lowpolygonal graphics dont really fit with this newer raytracing thing and make the game look kinda ugly meanwhile quake champions have you forgotten me am i a joke to you now big brother i can run this so when half life rtx halflife rtx when they had to downgrade to quake graphics to get ray tracing to run reliably lol now for american mcgees alice please the soundtrack in this game is epic buy this game to play in software rendering mode at least can handle a 22 years old game good job nvidia qii forever perfect its still need an expansions the weapon sprites arent that good the weapon sounds still classic any decent recent games beates this in visuals regarding gameplay it is old boring as shit rip atmosphere actually kinda fucking lit q2 is amazing man id love to see hexen 2 with rtx where do i download this coming soon rtx mineswipeer the rail gun is all wrong january 2019 nvdia release rtx2060 cheap ray tracing graphic card users but too laggy to play battlefield v with ray tracing on nvdia we have rtx2070 and rtx2080 users too expensive nvdia lets see what we can do about it users d 3 months later nvdia here you go a game that rtx2060 will run realtime ray tracing q u a k e ii r t x users can you also add weapons of destruction mod pls just announce quake 2 remake already d they better have the 8 person co op on it how about remastered thr cs 16 actually pretty fitting considering quakes history of innovation in the lighting department arena shooters are badass btw all this ray tracing and still n o m u z z l e f l a s h crappy polygon count and cheap textures with rtx still leaves the game look still crappy with low polygon count and cheap textures minecraft with 13 mods and rtx looks even better srsly its amazing how much better some basic raytracing effects can improve a game from goddamn twenty years ago nvidia if this is your killer app for rtx youre in big trouble wonder if this will be compatable with my 1050ti too bright for a dark game quake is not a game of my generation so this means nothing to me someone reply to this when games like csgo get ray tracing this tech is so fkd up that you have to implement it on a 97 game for it to work lmao ok this is how games should be remastered just stay with the old look but also not bfg physicx is where i wish they made it harder its a cakewalk even on hard skill 3 in console finally a worthy challenge for my 12 mb 3dfx voodoo 2s in sli you ever heard the whole you cant shine sht thing yea why old news cant wait for tetris rtxits gonna be amaziiiiiing atari adventure now with ray tracing ohoh do pong or canyon bomber ironic they had to think really hard to solve lighting problem in quake and not make game run at 10fps and here we are putting the most advanced lighting system in video games in it if i cant play a game i enjoyed years ago using my gt 730 im not interested i wish quake champions was as good as qii nice movie but in game 8 fps holly quake market trash like fx series with shaders 20 where your revolutionary shaders and fx now looks too colorful i think quake2xp looks better how to get it i got the classic formsteam reminds me of that oddworld abes oddysee remake the artistry is ruined in the same way stop bitching for what is essentially a demo i have a gtx 1070 and will give it a try just for the lulz if its good cool quake 2 is one of my alltime favorites if it sucks then no biggie id love to see unreal 1 and halflife series with rtx one day hope it will happen in the next couple of years they have to go to 1997 games to get ray tracing going normal fps next original tetris will be ray traced so lame i think this rtx tech is the biggest tech flop of this decade kinda wish textures were updated id buy this at 20 but no more at updated textures id jump to 40 i knew my 2080ti would be good for something lol never thought this would be official personally i think it looks like shit and wrecks the atmosphere and lighting of the game however im so happy itll bring people to play one of the best fpss ever with one of the best video game soundtracks ever seriously tho fucking metal jam quake 2 happy go lucky edition too bright lol now there is a reason to buy rtx card sipp intensifies now why the fuck the textures sucks this is so stupid why not showcase latest doom game omg suck it nvidia unreal engine does a better job without rtx i swear not that long ago i saw this as a project of love from a fan remaking quake with rtx has this just been picked up by official developer now quake ii berserker mod still looks better than this and preserves the original atmosphere half life with rtx would make more sense though what a shit when do you realise people that theres no point in adjusting something which is perfect p i think this game was supposed to be a bit dark they made it to bright but nice job next doom 3 when will minesweeper get the rtx update crysis with rtx quake still a good game yup sip actually hyped for this i liked quake 1 more when we will get that or duke nukem 3d what about doom the original one not the newdoom but i need tetris in ray tracing we need gta sa with rtx so were back to low poly gaming for meme tracing oh yeah you dont need a new card to do it either check out raytacing minecraft can be done with a 4 year old 970 why not quake 1 though we want rtx blood great cant wait for that dead space needs the rtx treatment u know quake is a game that runs on about anything lets make the graphix so that nobody can play it i didnt know turn on rtx would add bump map and turn the original texture hd would be better if they did quake reload with new models and graphic like it did in doom 2016 u guys really want to sell this card right aw this is too bright being all dark and stuff was what made quake so cool imo the only explanation for this is a cruel joke but why how to maximise profit with minimal work input yeah i would definitely buy the most expensive graphics card to run decades old game also its way too bright and it ruins the atmosphere i love quake i think i kind of prefer the original look yeah the graphics are objectively worse but the new graphics make it look too light the mood and atmosphere is completely missing what about doom 3 rtx hey i know why they used quake 2 because the betterness of impact of ray tracing technology is god damn obvious not like in metro exodus i mean it is in your face here the sound track of quake 2 is gold will original soundtrack be includded cant wait to buy it now id like to see unreal tournament with ray tracing crispy quake 2 looks way better dont put lipstick on a pig doom source port like zandronum with rtx would be better why is it my pc i have now is like 100 faster than my old pc but has problems running older games compared to my old pc please tell developers that brightness could be increased by much lower effort but can it play minecraft too bright cmon what year is it added a bunch of light and turned a dark atmospheric game into a typical shooter from 2019 thanks dont need that shit for me its good to be alive crysis with rtx d and another games too sip yep quake was a good game why tho looks sexier than my girlfriend can i trade her in look more stunning than game of thrones season 8 no one cares will we get ray tracing support for halo 1 too i personally think it looks beautiful ill be purchasing an rtx 2060 asap i like quake 2 n all but imagine the special freeze rail tdm and tag matches with all the ice the rail shots themselves the rocket launchers and bfg the portals and lots and lots of already reflective demo areas nvidia only the best nvidia pcs can run rtx tecnology crytek hold my beer far cry 3 rtx on please ray tracing a 22 yo game reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee when you fail so bad that only quake and minecraft has full rtx pathetic rtx on kidney off ps its a jke dont take it seriously anyone else hate what they did to the game looks way better back im the day so i have never played quake before but why are the textures poop do they want a nostalgic feel or is becuase the game is very fast paced they want people to be able to run it smoothly or is this just an old game that they made a trailer for too bright and i have only a 1080ti gg why is everything so bright did they just ruin the whole vibe of the game its fascinating how much better lighting can make even a low poly environment look convincing beast mode lolwhat a fuckin classic when youre buttugly but got a killer pedicure i clicked on this with fervorous excitement 30 seconds in and im asking myself whether this is real life what a joke spit this was my first game in my gaming history i remember it was so frickin hard for me at the age of 6 on hard mode and it took me half year to beat it in the age of 15 i beat this game again on hard mode on my nameday and i finished it in 5 days so good memories 3 guess im going to get this game in 2019 as well to play it cause of my childhood and cause of my memories sorry for my bad english f can someone make the tetris game with rtx it would be fun what do amd think about rtx still better than bf or cod lel pfft if you want to impress me put ray tracing in doom original let the fragfest begin bois hey since hl 1 2 have similar engines to the quake one could we have ray tracing in halflife and halflife 2 quake1 rtx please but where is quake 1 literally nobody asked for quake 2 but everyone asked for quake 1 you fucked up for real this time the game looks like eye cancer vr option please still no proper blood spilling mechanics damn please add ray tracing to minecraft so i could run this on a 1080ti no i would say the downgrade are u kidding us the quake 2 downgrade rtx off can you guys do doom next please minecraft mod lookin good pretty cool im playin q2 on ps1 at the moment im pretty sure theyre using an hd texture pack in combination with the rtx modified game engine lighting makes the biggest difference but if the textures were still low resolution this trailer would be more disturbing edit it would be really cool if they enhanced the texture resolution and added bump maps through ai iirc they demonstrated ai texture enhancement on ocarina of time it was in tech news within the last 6 months 25lighting ruins feel 33can i run 10 series 20nvidia said 2060 minimum 5is this a joke of what lmaoooooo like to find out rest of such a sad story pc dont have games so they must present rtx effects on mediocore battlefield and old game like quake 2 i have gaming pc only for work in 3d sw true gamer has ps4 with best exclusive game list hail pc master race ya lets spend 1000 to play a 20 year old game it looks cool but it looks like they upgraded the lights with the most powerful leds quake was dark and infernal this one isnt rtx off rtx onthere is so much graphical difference that it made me laugh joe rogan is gonna shit himself coming on my birthday extremely cool but you loose darkness in dark places this game not about bright pony its about scary military and angry aliens that living in rusted station what is the fucking point of this when textures are still ugly as fuck what about quake 1 i want that in rtx much more than this one roblox rtx when the legend of fps games cant wait to play it i need unreal tournament with this stuff this better be playable on gtx cards too so we need to inform joe rogan waiting for mario rtx maybe they should go for unreal tournament 2004 or ut3 next buying a 1200usd graphic card to play 90s games at 30fps noice i dont agree with the railgun model choice why instead of proper remake they only update textures thats it my next pc build will hopefully be powerfull enough to play any 1997 titles why not quake1 hey nvidia remastering isnt the same as ray tracing any game looks better remastered no what gpu runs it quake now with a less gritty dark feel and a less bad ass look using state of the art lighting techniques so the game that used to make you shit your pants looks less like quake and more like halo during day time fuck yeah quake oh shit i thought that was minecraft shame they updated literally nothing else in the game can run this with a rtx 2060 rtx cards are over priced ill stick to my 1080ti thanks rtrt has been the biggest bullshit gimmick ever to come out from the green team if amd release a card that is on the level as the 2080ti i will buy it since rtrt is something that i couldnt give a shit about and the amd card will be a lot cheaper can rtx titan play crysis with ray tracing nvidia physx no bring quake 3 arena back not lame quake 2 playing old games at 5fps i guess my gtx 1050 wont handle it well going back to csgo oooohhhh fuck yeah bud one of the best soundtrack in games looks cool but some stages look a bit too brightilluminated strap in were heading back to the future now that is a good gsme so much fricking hate from people yes its an old game sure its a bit bright but modern source ports you can turn that down still looks great and its still a step forward in graphics technology and yes rtx cards are expensive but like all technology they fall over time personally im just sad my old gtx 960 wont be able to cut it id be happy with an hd remaster for consoles of quake 1 and 2 i can make the pc versions look pretty with mods my 2080ti is ready anyone else find it funny that rtx only really improves and is noticeable with older titles game for free cash to gfrtx gg nvidia couldnt complete masturbation in 58secs hl1 rtx its on quakes engine its like when you press the select button on the xbox controller when playing the halo master chief collection well if modern games is commercial shit then maybe i am play in 20th centure game again what about quake i too bright as many pointed out already the original gloomy and dark atmosphere ruined has me as excited as diablo mobile well nice but you destroy original quake 2 atmosphere so bright and now diablo 2 this technology is total bullshit theres absolutely no difference with and without it wow if only i had a 2080ti i could one day hope to play hexen and hexen ii with rtx goodness my gtx1060 is frowning at me help me nvidia please space invaders rtx pls can someones please do this to quake 1 3 4 wars and champions i would appreciate q1 better nvidia can it run quake ii pc no problem nvidia with rtx on pc cold sweat 3fps with a gtx 2080 ti quake 1 rtx when that game was actually good is this the something super that coming nvidia presents 90s style where the hell should i go now syndrome with rtxon rip joe rogan experience quake iii rtx would be cool but this also rtx is not cool p holy shit same game updated graphics what is this fullbright shit i wonder if its because only a game from 1997 will run real time raytracing with any kind of decent frame rate rtx mod for super mario please thanks for giving some love to older games i remember playing this in my childhood nostalgia id like to see the unreal series undergo this treatment one thing that i always hated from q2 is that the guns has not muzzle flashes of any kind i thinked that they add it with that said i could just say that it is only another graphic mod i cant hardly wait i love you guys its amazing how just adding raytracing can make an old game look amazing again you must improve the gameplay too because no one want play with 25 year old mechanics what a time to be alive thanks game devs im crying 40 fps on rtx 2080ti everybody there are not enough titles that support rtx nvidia how bout quake 2 this is a massive waste of the machines potential i would love to see super mario with rtx you have just ruined beautiful original quake 2 radiostity and replaced that with that rtx garbage that double barrel shotgun sound is so perfect its unbelieveable like shooting storm hell yeah id buy it wait for super mario bros rtx buying 1300euro card and play quake 2 thanks for everything nvidia pls talk to me wahhhhh 3 but i have no enough time rtx makes any game looks ridiculously better than with it off even the highest end games we have right now but prepare to lose fps on your potato gpus is this the games that modern pc can handle with rtx on what the f thats called cheeting you guys going to keep using tech in meaningless ways to cripple competitor hardware even though its doing nothing for the game like tessellation throughout hidden areas and overdone details in basic models like in crytek or arbitrary physx like in borderlands 2 so much brighter i hope quake iv will be included with a similar treatment low poly is the future people all these new titles with all their complex geometry and effects will never look as clean and rich like a well crafted low poly game with just fewer but more impactful effects like ray tracing quake 2 and minecraft are showcasing this perfectly next gzdoom and unreal 1 tournament please and for ps4 what next minecraft rtx you can call me a dumb old man but boi this is so much better than almost every new game on a market even with old graphics and now theyve added some crisp to it without completely killing the atmosphere perfection beautiful amazing but i dont have money to buy one these cards sorry nvidia lets see this on q3 i think ill be able to play this on my 1080 ti didnt nvidia enable rtx on this card now via drivers holy hell it looks so amazing this awesome mix of something classic and fresh dwarf fortress rtx nvidia pls why it looks cool but old quake is old quake as the normal modern games are struggling to run on ray traced cards nvidia now trying to show the nostalgia with old games but actually it can be easily run on the ray tracing mode so nvidia can atleast show off their technology with some performancexd i really hope the game is free is this whats super when an over twentyyearold game has better explosions then fallout 76 that bfg projectile is the saddest thing on earth work on those particles please we added ray tracing and did none of the work40 please lol serious sam please haters gonna hate but thank you nvidia this was my all time fav game you won me but why hahaha one of the strangest remasters dare i call it that in recent memory im wishing in the end of doom eternal they announce quake 1 remake as a sequel why else do we have knights on doom 2016 and tentacles shub niggurath in doom eternal trailer now decrease the price of rtx cards holdup wtf is that railgun better not be an epic store exclusive rtx makes sense for 30 year old boomers only they can afford it d while the effects arent as overbearing as your typical fan shitremaster the atmosphere has been completely destroyed half life 1 rtx please jesus looks like mockery especially for those who dont have rtx card to much light 410 upgrade that honestly looks worse than the original what is that game in background but can you put it on crysis oh why not doom now lets all jump on an rtxenabled lan party do this with crysis 1 finnaly a game where rtx is actually worth some effort its from 1997 get your fing shit to gether and stop being so anti costumer best way to show high end gpu ray tracing technology 22 yars old game impressive only one question why so this is how we are going to be tricked into full circle of remakes which we can only play ona highend gpu its the time again when i have to visit my friend to play gta vc truly history repeats itself do you guys think nvidia understands how bad of a pr move this stuff actually is dont get me wrong its cool to have rt for q2 but it just reinforces the negative idea that there are no modern games taking advantage of this technology and these gpu are over expensive and pointless seriously turing gpus have been around for 9 months theres basically 2 games and half using the technology a couple of tech demos like q2 cool sure as hell pascal gpus dont need to be replaced until next gen and what about the first quake the best one so maybe after 10 years well get realtime raytracing for tf2 first person action movie why half life 2 with rtx please too bright aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa fatal errorshutting down wow it looks like ass it feels like they dialed up the lighting to 11 just to show off the technical aspect while forgetting that some artistic direction is needed to make it look impressive rtx on brightness over 9000 cmon i wanted quake 3 i know this is only happening because rtx and raytracing are too early to be used with modern games but im all about it i want to see all my old favorites getting the raytraced treatment quake 2 with rtx is like diablo 3 super bright and child friendly i would love to play this game with ray tracing it makes it look like a complete other game sunlight and blue skies on the strogg homeworld just feels wrong is the lootbox interesting but were still waiting on actual new games to play with rtx ive been looking and thinking about a rtx for a while now q2 rtx pushed me over the edge just ordered a 2070 fe im in soon super mario bros with ray tracing the old is new again try that with crisis wonder how fast hackers will piss on this please fix mouse input lag that intro fmv could use some dlss to all the dislikers of this video you dont like progression you dont like possibilities you dont like technology you dont like innovation or you simply dont like quake because i have 0 reasons to dislike this and im curious to hear why someone would idk why but i expected the playstation robot voice in the end of the trailer shitty gimmick is this what the super announcement trailer was for meh its never been more painfully obvious that nothing is coming out of the guns 037 everything looks washed out and flat now sadly i dont think its an improvement if it was lowered about 50 then i think it would look great will it work on my gtx 1050 in very low resolution wow out of all the games out there they choose this one dont know why im existing for this but i want to play it when realtime rendering is more realistic than prerendered fullmotion video cant wait for the 30fps old games only need rtx and hd texture quake ii download size 25mb quake ii rtx download size 6gb yaaaay we can finally use our 1200 gpus exclusive thechnology we paid like an extra 400 for to play a game from the 90s and ruin its feeling just in case somebody has so much time to have already finished the other two greeeeaaaat games that exist and support this technology thx nvidia good to know youve got our backs i lie rtx in this situation cuz it lights up the game instead of making it darker like in most of the other games now its useful to me might get quake 2 now didnt notice any difference when quake ii looks better than most fps games today rt looks good but overall its too bright in comparison with the original maybe lowering the ambient light output would help make it a bit darker please the future of ray tracing is over twenty years old in other words buy expensive rtx graphic cards looks even more fake now come on do it well or dont quake 1 with rtx please memes about rtx onoff now live again wheres the bullets its not april way too late for aprils fools jokes blood rtx when is this legit rtx on more money on too console peasents blah blah we have spiederman blah blah pc masterrace but do you have quke 2 raytraced at 4k sure its fun to watch this reignited quake ii but where are the other rtx games why not just make better use of the time to make rtx better and efficient rather release revised old games we need more games with these ray tracing remasters this will be the first time i have ever used raytracing on my 2080 looks like what indie devs make now days on the fps scene xd cant wait to blast that nine inch nails soundtrack again adjust the light sources to be a lot lower in intensity and you retain the atmosphere otherwise i wouldnt call this quake 2 unless theres also realtime day and night cycle where are the beautiful weapon sprites rocket launcher bfg shown in the previous tech demo too bad the lighting is too bright most of the time this revamp would be smart if some simple modern physics was implemented for body parts and particles original characters animations are still great but those body parts physics and gun sprites looks ugly now what about quake 2 onwers from 1998 it will be free for us or are we going to pay again 20 years later what a bussines man this is great but how about quake 1 too this is just silly now i love it ok this gives me a reason to get a gtx 20xx and not a 16xx if this makes a lot of money get ready for raytracing remakes of every game imaginable its cool but its staged rtx off not look like this what a joke introducing tech aftet tech that destroys fps when we need to reach 1000fps for crystal clear smooth and responsive motion images sigh can we also prioritize increasing fps please is it free my rtx 2060 should handle it just fine this is a thing i didnt knew i wantedbut i fucking want it fuck me how do i sign up im going to buy this rtx 2080 ti so i can play half life and quake 2 from 1997 1 step forward graphically 10 steps backward atmospherically cool games these days are so bad that the most exciting ones are remakes and remasters well done you fucking greedy ass corporate suits pretty good id say nvidia sees bandwagon jumps on nice showcase for future hardware potential and marketing for current gen but not worth the processing expense right now rocketjumpninja has entered the chat you motherfuckers cough unreal tournament cough that is what i want to see this blood halflife the best soundtracks for games ever star trek voyager eliteforce 1999 going inside the borg cube with green rtx lightning for the price of this card you can assemble old machine for old version that is maximum perfomance for rtx 2080ti no more now modern games cant have full perfomance with max settings and full natural ray tracing wait other old games with rtx love quake series 3 i wait for this and recover for my yt channel come check and sub thanks ppl love you soo much 3 this reminds me of that game they released back in the late90s first there was crysis now in 2019 theres quake ii i love that nvidia isnt even verified by youtube crysis ray tracing quake 4 with rtx i want no way you kill original atmosphere why you not use descent into cerberon track quake ii except its at an unplayable fps that is impressive unfortunately an rtx card is way out of my budget right now can i still enjoy enhancements that dont involve rtx if i should reinstall quake ii actually have a gtx 1060 still a beefy card thats like these minecraft rtx shaders they should release this for the other quake games joe rogan has entered the chat can i play it without an rtx card i have a gtx 1070 truly out of ideas i see classic also this better be free do the same for the first quake please wow its coming out for my birthday cant wait to get it a bit more shinning but far from amazing does this work at all without an rtx card how can you possibly forget quake 1 the quake logo is like the mistborn one lol after quake ii i want nvidia to invest money on midtown madness rtx buying 1500 card to play a 22 yo game this is as stupid as it can get now the game that actually matters amsterdoom make a new game pls looks pretty crappy for the most part that is because the color palette got all messed up seems like i stick to my gtx1080 and wqhd for a long time yeah ray tracingthats why u have to play games from 20 years ago now to be honest i would feel scammed if i buy a rtx card quake ii i am the beast minecraft hold my 4k mod can i run it with gt 1030 or is it rtx graphics card exclusive would love me some q2dm1 with rtx i prefer it with the crappy 90s charmyou know its ok to leave things how they are what about quake 1 rtx can you make need for speed most wanted 2005 ray tracing and mod like that can i apply this mod on game installed from steam halflife rtx when aha i wonder who can afford to play rtx games today probably not me for several years anyone need a slave when quake champions vulkan raw input rtx yea baby free programming socks click the link below haha u big gei quake should have done a real game unreal tournament then you would have me interested i didnt buy a 2080 ti to play this old garbage ok remake quake 3 arena and then were talking and here i am with my gtx 1060 minecraft rtx looks way better this is exacly how i remember this game wird lol using a nuclear bomb to kill an ant so lame a little too bright wow the game looks alive now a million times yes now do duke nukem 3d thanks also blood blood ii hexen heretic rise of the triad tonb rider 2 and 3 u know do em all make millions looks like unfinished mediocre fan made mod with dynamic lightning and bad remodel but too overcomplicated so it requires hiend rtx graphics card nice job nvidia minecraft ray tracing shaders still look better than this ironic wow so much raytracing wow so uselees wow nvidia waste chip area for tensorrtx cores useless in games and to foist gpgpu chip to gamers why everything looks like a egyptian tomb hold my quake 2 rtx totally kills the feel of the game it makes everything super bright mods like q2xp and others have made qii look much better than this hint they dont make everything superultrabright does this have that neato trap that grinds strogg into jerky from the expansion packs i dont remember which one it was but i had a blast using it we need halflife 3 with rtx not quake this effects dont need path ray tracing same graphical level can be achieved without it how long rtx be useless wheres the blood particles come on i fear no man but that railgun skin it scares me just up your brightness and you will get the same resultats the game was meant to be dark now theyve made it daylight its going to change the feel of what the developers intended butcan it run minecraft dont need to see any more lets go i still want tetris with rtx looks good but to bright oh man my gtx 1060 cant handle this beast and doesnt have the tensor cores fml a dose of sarcasm added for taste please consult with your doctor if doses of sarcasm is right for you unreal tournament forever i see a lot of lighting and glossy but where is rtx pony nvidia rtx the way its meant atmosphere to be ruined ahaha can t make modern games with rtx so they port this old ass game how about you make rtx on games people are actually going to play we need ray tracing on mine swapper lol rtx everything from releases like this to user generated mods its looking like the future still not buying your gimmick quake 1 quake 3 and quake 4 with rtx soon get unreal gold to do the same nvidia team pls add ray tracing to doom 3 as well it is the most scariest game ever what if i only have a gtx gpu how will it look like this is cool and all but if its not free i dont give a fuck before but can it run crysis 2019 but can it run quake ii rtx p is it april 1st already again seeing as half life was built on a modified version of this engine how about a raytracing version of that overly bright want an advice nvidia bring ray tracing into more relaxed atmospheric games that would make a better use of it like the myst series the first and the fifth ones would definitely look much better with whatever tracing and as a bonus you dont need a solid 60 fps to enjoy them why is it so bright also please enable ray tracing for all pascal cards what a great concept please dont fuck this up and make this rtx card only i cant believe its been 22 years only quake iii arena baby ah shit here we go again joe rogan is having an orgasm right now cant wait for pong rtx now now this is how you remaster something this game was my beloving from childhood ray tracing can remaster potato graphics confirmed june 6 and the weapons have no muzzle flash or tracers odd only 90s games can be played with rtx otherwise you would need a god tier pc well done nvidia jesus what a joke real time traycing in game from 100 years ago good job nvidia they ruined the atmosphere by making everything so damn bright quake was my second pc game after doom is this real promoting a 90s videogame they need to just remaster all these old games and show these ten year old fortnite gamers how we did it back in the day you can say that quake 2 is now accurately lit p r e p a r e t o f i g h t it is a shameful thing that the rtx card can run the raytracing effects fully on a 1997 game and the nvidia proud of this and of course what you see in this video recorded on rtx2080ti with 4 sli cards amazing this was a game am i the only who doesnot care about the graphics and rather care about getting to play this amazing game its too bright the rt ruins the vibe from original quake art design yeah right next i want to play tetris and pacman with ray tracing lol but i play quake 3 only so now a 1070 cant run a game that was from 1997 rtx at minecraft is better this looks weirdly amazing lmao its like the minecraft raytracing mod nobody nvidia quake ii rtx cant wait for those but can it run quake 2 videos d now all we need is doom and half life i am honestly so sick of nvidias proprietary shit you guys caved to freesync just give up just wait until joe rogan finds out about this i maybe the only one but rtx on brightness up well that looks like utter shit finally a game with decent game play no iapadverts loot boxes or pay to win schemes put some post effects like bloom and depth of field it would kick ass this is sad xd i think ill stick to kmquake 2 it at least keeps the dark gloomy environments that many of the levels had so multiplayer are we going to see quake live and quake champions with ray tracing graphic mod thumbnail looks like from serious sam 2019 quake ii is now rtx compatible 2029 the oregon trail ms dos game is now rtx compatible would have loved to see something like this on launch of the rtx cards brightness up would be interesting if i were a cyclop beatifull 3 ray tracing we deserve someone already did that for free httpbrechpunktdeq2vkpt now we need an rtx minecraft quake 1 with rtx would be awesome im a quake fan since part 1 but this looks like shit adding rtx to a 20 something years old game wont make it any better it should have been given a full on remaster treatment then add rtx what the shit with railgun model holy moly macaroni this was my first game soooooooo im in 2019 can it run quake ii ray tracing kotor when reason to buy 2 rtx 2080ti noice it fucks with the games atmosphere due to being too bright and sunny but still noice the truth is that you can play a game with rtx only if its 20 years old how bout they make a quake 5 as continuation of the quake 4 game it had some interesting story and gameplay this looks like more than just adding raytracing they changed the lighting lightning effects added global illumination id say that makes most of the difference not raytracing sending this to joe back in my quake days rogan rtx is a scam made by nvidia theyre trying to make proprietary ray tracing software so they can charge u thru the nose for rtx graphics cards ok now i have no reason not to get a new card too much light too welllit and the textures look similarly very bleachedout they have multiple sourceports that update the gfx of quake ii and its two mission packs expansions already and better so than the above example id hope the above isnt supposed to be the final product of whatever it is youre trying to do because im not sure what it is youre trying to do there wish they modernized the graphics sips monster energy drink now zoomers can finally appreciate the greatest fps ever made i cant afford an rtx graphics card and even if i could it wouldnt work in my pc power supply too weak computer case is too compact to fit itd have to be a half height model and plus even if the rtx 2050 comes out it most likely wont support rtx raytracing so rip me no quake ii rtx for me it just works quake live should get this official minecraft rtx pls super lighting so ray tracing makes dark games bright i would prefer a remake like doom got the animations are too outdated and overall pleasure with the game is not the same this better be free man idont know about this corny it looks better but the effects are still bad nice lighting but way too bright though i bet it will look great when you turn down the brightness to match the original feel of the game when the ingame graphics is better than the opening cgi i always said with the right kind of lighting effects old games can look really good basically it is a light mode interesting mhmm unreal tournament 2004 rtx and you got me i wonder if theyre going to put rtx support on doom eternal i wish i can buy rtx cuz i dont have a craphics card the only game capable rtx at 60fps hey is this a super something come for us i thought you preparing to launch a new gpu 1040ti 7gb for budget level nvidia makes rtx 2 or 3 triple a games actually use it the community makes mods for minecraft now rtx is in a game that is 24 years old where are all of the modern rtx titles this is what gpu leader of the world has to show us we got pascal volta and turing with rtx none of which truly change pc gaming in a meaningful way mean while amd is showing domination in the data center consolepc gaming markets which is like whatmore than 50 billion worth what nvidia is doing shareholder and investors are not going to like this jenson with his leather jacket and pr mastery will only carry nvidia so far they need to innovate only way you can use a rtx and keep 60fps please for the love of god do unreal tournament 2004 do we need rtx gpu to play this or can we run it with gtx what have you done to the railgun still awesome but why this is great but perhaps nvidia could work on something that wasnt done by admittedly gifted geeks several months ago maybe deus ex please bring quake 2 to console rtx cards exist wallet im bout to end this mans whole career i dont get it is it a joke or what me how much does it cost nvidia oh dont worry only a minimum of your yearly mortgage call me an idiot butcant most of what is being shown here achieved with dynamic lighting volumetric light path tracing is the future in realism and thank you for releasing rtx giving pathtracing a kick start so more developers are enticed to implement it i feel like people who bag it out dont really fully understand what it does the super shotgun barrells look way too shiny imo so now you able to see and dodge easier the best of quake games just getting an overhaul wow rob zombie did the music you should fix the ones from 028 and 029 the raytracing lighting color is more orange than what the sky tells the blue textures in the wall look weird with the sky lighting its better to seal the ceiling to let the purplecyan lights flow instead in general feels like it could use some minimal modelling touch over some maps to make it all look more appealing with the rtx on like for example 021 that ramp area feels depressing by comparison i would scramble the polygons of that ramp a little bit to make it look more rocky without altering the original ramp collision that would suffice wish they had done quake 3 instead a small crowd actually still plays it i used to a few years ago and its also open source texture quality potato how does this compare to the current path tracing quake 2 mod i better see some videos comparing it when this releases what who gives a f make me some fun games f a rtx give me some sega arcade s remastered and i will be happy graphics dont mean fun looks great and am looking forward to it would love to see unreal get the same treatment always preferred quake i myself this is still cool to see though path tracing raytracing quake ii and rtx is a match made in frag fest heaven the original quake was one of the best frag fest fps ever im so looking forward to giving quake ii a gaming go go go ill stick with my 1060 the developers fake global illumination well enough for modern games thats some serious sam levels of brightness could we dial it back a notch and actually have some dark spots to contrast the brighter than the sun levels of illumination edit wait its only 3 levels huh thats uh something i guess what we really need a full on remake with the new id tech engine because id so buy especially if theres a collectors edition because this is my favorite game of all time the only game you can run ray tracing on buys expensive gfx just so i can ruin the graphics except youve set the light way to bright in most areas so it no longer looks like quake ii is supposed to look noone nvidia quake ii now with extreme raytracing available now cant wait for nvidia to upload a trailer for minecraft ray tracing lol funnily enough mc raytracing is still probably more heavy than quake 2 with rtx wow back to the future quake really really really need a reboot finaly i found something to play with ray trace with my gtx 1060 honestly the original looks better some of the smooth animation somehow ruins the feel of the original animation plus the added details are just overkill on the weapons the railgun doesnt look anything like the iconic railgun with the red tube and round shape and the super shotgun is super shiny and looks thinner and less powerful than the previous one which he couldnt even fit in his hand and took up most of the screen the automatic weapon doesnt even have a muzzle flash and the screen doesnt shake to give a bigger impact when firing the gun explosions are less colorful 030 the original is darker more color and the look of the water is iconic and more unique plus the movement is mesmerizing and you can see through it in the upgraded version its like you took a water asset pack and randomly put it in another student project the water is too detailed and the shader and shadow work makes it actually worse with the original having more varied shadows and dark spots in now do it for doom 3 halflife 2 rtx and sonic mayhem give me goosebump again please nvidiagive me for a gift one rtx exactly on my birthday d half life 2 rtx please amazing now bring quake iii arena on rtx absolutely awful did you not have a proper art director for this jedi outcast and jedi academy please the amount of graphical fidelity you gain from rtx features is incredible this makes the game look 10 years younger if we were to get a fully remastered version with better models and higher quality textures this game could look very modern credit where credit is due nviida uses rtx and vulkan christoph schied httpsgithubcomcschiedq2vkpt good that it isnt q3 arena because quake champions would instantly die d quake i need a remas nvidia say no more quake no more pretty cool but i want a new game quake remake or quake 5 maybe or both m original unreal with a voodoo2 looks better than this shitquake was killed in 1998 forever finally wow that something i played massive hours of quake ii good times i dont like this game this game origin is better with dark atmospheric game play making it brighter is actually not a good idea when you bought your rtx this is where your money went theres something amazing about converting old games to use all of the latest tech i first experienced it with gothic 2 night of the raven and its dx11 mod originally a dx7 game it looks amazing and still has the proper feel that you dont get when making a remake the oldfashioned way i cant wait to see quake ii in action we took the best parts of quake and replaced them like the dark moody environments they were so scary no problem lets lighten them up a bit there ya go and hey now you can see those low res textures time to bring back the sin clan and instagib rail lithium where my old q2 boys at halflife 1 rtx plz maybe its a really late april fools joke why in the actually fuck did i get a notification for this shit im not a sub to this god awful channel oo quake 1 should be more interesting using the rt quake see im not dead yet if you want atmosphere play original game or turn the brightness down then i want to see a beautiful lighting and explosions with rtx and not try to see what in 5 meters away from me suckers those who paid 1k for a piece of electronic scrap just to play a 1996 game xddd its too bright one of the major appeals of q2 was how dark it was i first played this on a 3dfx voodoo 1 now ill play it on a 2080 ti what about ugh as next neat i guess why would you do this to quake whata bout halflife it reminds me diablo 3 premiere with rainbows colorful and over saturated atmosphere compared to diablo 1 and 2 rtx on top of the old lowres textures is a lazyass move when quake 2 with highres textures has been available for years now httpsyoutube0uurjzjhok the tech is fantastic but they should have tried to keep the mood of the game as close to the og as possible and thats how every graphic mod should look like not only colour contrast or wet floors nvidia in 2030 today we will be announcing new colors that you can see with your eyes yeah piece of quake i noticed that a lil while ago nvidia gave us folks who have 1080s or 70s the ability to use rtx so my question is will this game run with rtx ratracing features at at least 1080p at 60fps or is that a pipe dream at this point they added rtx to my most fav game in the universe raytraced gibs yum doom 3 rtx when quake 2 praise the sun edition thats the first game that i have ever played when i was 8 cant wait to play it again 4k textures 144p sounds for the best experience you need to have 1997 3dfx 2019 rtx quake 1 with rtx please and if i try to play this with geforce 1070 when quake goes to a radiation zone for awhile where is flashes from weapons everything is too bright they have ruined the grim dark atmosphere it had ffs also quite funny that they are using a 20 year old game to show of the latest and greatest gpuslmao because this is why i paid your batshit costs for an rtx 2080 quake 2 mods fuck you nvidia is this going to be free d cant wait to finally test my rtx2060 with a good rtx implemented game aside from metro exodus p rtx 2070 came out when this is the first game im actually going to use and enjoy ray tracing very cool but also kind of sad can we get rtx porn please looks gorgeous and fun its amazing how this can still make an old game look amazing way too bright in the rt mode it washes out the colour and deprives the game of mood and atmosphere tone it way back in places and the red sky is iconic to quake 2 but its just normal yellow light in this video a modder will surely do a better job in applying rt lighting with proper discretion than whats shown in this video and whats shown in this video is like the gamma setting is stuck on near maximum and is tasteless u500 video card to play a 90s game amazing please quake 1 rtx that intro movie could be realtime rendered now even with more details it would be a nice addition wooooooww back to rocket arena action and ctf railgun deathmatch my heart good to see that ray tracing is placed to classics like this one fuck it shut up and take my money you guyz r freakin awesome i luv ya im waiting for my rtx2060 its coming this week lets try it love the trailer ok thanks but now we need halflife with it xd this is significant to me because quake ii was my first major shooter i played and i got to see the earliest improvements to graphics to games before i graduated i was playing it on my mothers computer in the kitchen with a software render then taking it to school and loading it on one of the autocad computers where i was a ta and getting to see the most basic graphics cards render it then working my first jobs in high school i got my very first graphics card one of the voodoo brand ones and installing it into my moms computer and the impact to me of seeing colored lighting and how much of impact it was i mean i thought it was going to be dumb but it was absolutely amazing now we need the original quake i think it will even more interesting rtx is the most overrated gimmick ever made to a flag of a product do it for q3 finally a game where can rtx 2080ti get stable 60fps with raytracing on now brighter happier now unreal tournament 1999 rtx then quake 3 rtx then ut2004 rtx reignite the war people may think it has died down but you have the power to bring it back in full nvidia i hate how sunny it looks i know this isnt meant to be the definitive way to play the game but it ruins the original games atmosphere sooo this is how you are going to take on amd releasing minecraft shader packs to doom 2 phenomenally ugly congratulations nvidia this is so awesome i still have my origianl q cds and bought em again on steam sofull game for nada here i come d do quake 1 next glquakeesque all my childhood in internet cafes i played this game beautiful times buy a 1000 graphics card to play a 20 year old game at half the frame rate im cumming in my pants what about deep learning upscaled textures and audio everything is way too bright ruins the original vibe completely the minecraft effect the weapons dont have muzzleflashes he doesnt pump the shotguns i have a feeling this is going to be another game without any of the smaller details i this is way too bright completely ruins the original atmosphere return of the ultimate benchmark it sucks i think it ruins game atmosphere it suppose to be dark but now it look like serious sam hd too bright and flat in terms of lightingshadows old version looks more moody i own the steam version as a copy will i get this version auto i would like to see instead unreal gold and ut99 with rtx the easiest and somewhat really stylish way of remastering a game quakes charm was the dark and gritty world all those god rays and light all over the place breaks the atmosphere dont mess with the classics breathing old game to into new via raytracing make it compatible with a xbox 360 controller for windows via xinput then ill try it why not quake 3 arena i dunno about this choice ha i dont know why people have to add raytracing into everything that game even after ray tracing looks like old ray tracing isnt going to do anything if you have low quality models and textures better to use baked lighting so that at least you get the fps in game rather than wasting gpu memory on something where final results can be easily matched without ray tracing needed i hope they will put more polish into the release i definitely want to test that i need quake i with rtx cmon take me back to lovecraftian horror sure is nice being able to see now if only all the old classics could get similar treatment wonder how face of typical zoomer subscribed for this channel looks like after seeing it boy weve gone along way i remember playing quake 2 on my quantum 3d obsidian x24 og sli and getting 60 fps well here we are again now struggling to get 60 fps with ray tracing i love it yeah this is what i want to use my 2080 ti for more content than anthem after nvidia driver sabotage even a 1080ti cant handel it in 30fps im pretty sure the game is supposed to be scary not a walk in a nice sunny field thats a really weird minecraft mod its awesome that rtx owners finally have a game to play too fucking bright to me quake ii rtx minimum system requirements processor intel core i33220 or amd equivalent memory 8 gb ram graphics nvidia geforce rtx 2060 or higher obvs its because of the ray tracing but its just so bizarre to think that my 970 card cant run quake ii rtx thief cool now do that to thief its gonna be waaay darker then ill dig it now this is going to be sweet no release it for consoles idiots hdr support as well hdr boosts rt looks even better i think some of it looks too bright and should be a bit darker to get that quake feel black mesa anytime soon so that was the super thing right d omg quake 2 was my first fps and pc game ever will be getting this so i can pay 1000 for graphics hardware so i can play a game that my mid90s computer could run perfectly just with reflections and fucking godrays are you people mad you have a steam store link to buy the full quake ii game will you support the full game with rtx effects or only the three level demo its become another game cooool me with a gtx 645 god i wanna try this everything just works look how they massacred my boy well done next game pong or centipede for all the people saying its too bright there will be a time of day setting that allows you to change the lighting read the pinned link even if you cant get that original mood exact its still a really cool demo of rt that you dont even have to pay forlol can this run on a gtx 1070 so you updated the weapon models but didnt fix the lack of muzzle flash i paid over a grand for a rtx 2080ti and they offer me fking minecraft quality graphics with fancy sun shine get a grip i would love doom 3 with rtx or quake 3 finally a game which rtx can properly run looks great and awesome way to use the tech without the tech it would not have happened only jealousy or being blind can cause somebody to deny it looks good replace models with higher polycount replace particle system and weapons change the sound effects add some new and extra levels and its great news without it its just a gimmick this is worse than the fan project haha amazing how the video editor synced this with the music love all these do x game in rtx like its a switch or something that can be toggled off or on 90s games with rtx on thats good hope it will be free 2080 ti for 60fps 1080p and sli for 144hz monitors ruins the atmosphere of the original absolutely no one nvidia this was a mod from a year or 2 ago this is fake see i told you rtx will also find its appriopriate niche some day in the gaming industry outside realtime lightning preview for level designers thats actually kinda exciting especially for all the nerds of the 90s this is beautiful looks cool it looks very demanding though not sure my gpu would handle it levels look too bright but it sure as hell looks damn good they failed in the implementation this shouldnt have increased the brightness its been 1000 years i havent played quake dam please can you make remakes of others olds pcconsole games with ray tracing sweet mother of god damm im old great now maybe i can get my 8gb rtx 2070 with 1620 boost clock sold maybe brand new and no one will touch it for a fair amount under retail zz f m l meh quake ii didnt have a good story to it how about modern games nooo the dark is what i like about it im sticking to the original cool to see the impact however as ridiculous as it seems this is how rtx shouldve been pushed from the beginning rtx makes these classics look awesome without having to change the core gameplay we get our nostalgia fix we get higher framerates in modern games with rtx off because lets face it its not ready for that meanwhile rtx gets to be developed further whilst serving a purpose everyone can get on board with just thinking right now if it just works then theyre just about to rerelease every game ever because why not thats one way to cash in on nostalgia with the minimum of effort crysis rtx in 2050 year looks too bright but cool cant wait to try it not sure if this is kinda cool or just really stupid need some demo for character shadowing as well for bullets sparks when hitting the walls so this was that super thing nvidia was featuring about dont tell me i need a new graphic card to play this what are the requirements looks cool but i think it lost its dark atmosphere with all this lighting going on my pc lags from watching this already so whats the point of rtx in this videogame effects like this are possible without rtx in 2019 leaked game footage from 2022 1997 quake ii is a benchmark title that only beast machines can handle 2019 quake ii is a benchmark title that only beast machines can handle we need gta san andreas rtx remake rtcw nownownownownpwnownownownownowwnwownwkwownwlwkwlwlw where are the bullets i still remember getting a 3d accelerator to run quake ii in opengl instead of the default software render this was back when 3dfx voodoo graphics cards were king next game ray tracing system shock2 too bad quake ii sucked 3 half life was better i wonder if my gtx 1060 6gb can play this hmmm its all far too bright imagine using rtx on half life 3 to be honest it looks great but kills the original vibe to it it should be done on games that has more light like q3 or q4 tfw you need to buy a 500 dollar card to play a 90s game yes that soundtrack was awesome i still have the original quake 2 disc that i use in my cd player to play the music i much prefer the dark and moody experience of the original q2 the developers shouldve tried to remake that but with rtx lighting lets go back to the roots shall we im fine with this i liked quake ii but they really should have used a more redish sun the original had a red sky and the yellow is too normal looking for what comes to mind when i think of quake lets go back to the roots shall we halflife 1 rtx when i wonder how is half life 2 with rtx omg the weirdest part is i remember the game i played in the 90s but it looked just like the presented here i think my brain rtxed my memories for me thanks brain its weird how good ray tracing can make a 90s game look hey to many bright make more contrast shadows plz im waiting rtx mod for halflife yo cant wait for minecraft 2 finally after all these years and with a 1000 dollar gpu you too can totally ruin artstyles like never before looks fantastic but generally too bright though gamma down please we need this for quake 3 could revive a legendary game classic there are so many more games you could launch with rtx support whyyyy when ray tracing takes such a tole on games fps that we have to use it for games from the 90s i dont realy like quake i played the older version where the graphics werent as cool as in the new one but still im not very positive that i will buy it so only 1400 euros to play this with rtx sold not really a match made in heaven so good joe rogan busting a nut rn you are in the green and ready to go thats a nice way to start the video nvidia i give you that i also just bought quake 2 on gogcom because of this need even more ammunition for my rtx card bring it on green team doom 95 with rtx please what a waste man man i am excited that this refined version is going to be released can hardly wait to play this version of the game that i have played more hours than any game in my life lol looks awesome buy a 1k card to play a game from 20 years ago dont you miss 1997 i dont i wasnt alive yet but this looks cool rtx on fps off its kinda like when you see someone put 10000 in modifications into a 2000 carmight not look quite right but damn will it be fun to drive hell yeah you know what im saying yeaaaaaaaaaaa up to 60 fps on this 20 year old game with severely outdated graphics shoulda done minecraft instead despite all the nearphotorealistic textures and models in modern games so far the 2 most impressive implementations of ray tracing ive seen are quake and minecraft gotta love the classics i want classic doom like that wow i hope they start remaking other old games it looks great all that raytracing and still no fucking muzzle flashes on weapons only one mod for q2 did it and its called q2xp as far as i know for a raytracing presentation muzzleflashes should be more spectacular only 20000 views is my generation dying folks this is the 2nd coming d will you also release the source code but will you do doom what a year to be a computer enthusiast more games with rtx support nvidia studio laptops amds new cpus and motherboards but my wallet is sad face so am i c 035 i prefer the much darker moodier classic look its like they just added 1000 lights and now it looks like a cartoon version of quake source engine uses the same map formap btw waay to bright for a quake game quake ii rtxhas the highest workloads of any raytraced game released to date so i guess im not gonna bother trying to run it on a gtx one question who the fuck needs that texture low shadow ultra lighting ultra no offensebut this isnt the reason why i bought an rtx cardto play a 15 year old game with it cries in gtx no one expected this because of thisfor the time being my steelseries m750 tkl will be green thank you nvidia god bless jensen huang so what should we do who still have powerfull gc like 9 and 10 series that dont have rtx support just watch gameplay at utube but can it run quake i theres already a quake 2 mod with ray tracing though looks okay i guess does it have ray tracing i know a guy who says this looks bad but he also thought the same of endgame and he liked the last season of game of thrones so this is more or less a remaster right so were calling adding lighting and a higher resolution textures an rtx now are acronyms badass like adding a z to everything used to seem cool to people marketing to young adult males looks like minecraft with a munch of embs deep nets could perceive the scene geometry and textures and associate it with a full detail scene looks amazing cant believe how amazing the transformation actually looks it just works because why not just rerelease every game from the past 25 years with a rtx patch thats innovation and creativity so basically ray tracing is such a performance hit they decided to add it to a massivly out dated games which takes next to zero effort to run on todays hardware just to make ray tracing work properly amd is finished we can all agree that minecraft looks much better with raytracing than this game so much ray tracing mostly it looks like they simply boosted gamma to 150 and they need top of the line 2018 graphics card to do that when running 20 years old game is nvidia expecting us to applaud them or ridicule them cant wait quake was a good game 30 year old boomer so basiccaly rtx is a light switch wow im sure that all 12 people who play quake are thrilled about this witness the power of turning on the lights seriously the rtx version added both lights and raytracing but its the lights that are actually making the main difference in the comparison can i run it on my voodoo card will this one run with rtx on the gtx 1080 ti as well nvidia rtx is the future of gaming graphics coming now to the newest aaa titles also nvidia give us crysis 1 with ray tracing this is the real next level d please apply the same magic in others classic videogames like thief the dark project that game rtx could be awesome halflife 2 ray tracing please it looks awful it was great dark game and now its colorful disney movie for kids much too bright back to the shiny past days please release crysis rtx so we can bring back the age old question finally a pc exclusive insane it actually looks like a brand new game now looks like when you turn textures to low with all other settings set to ultra does it have to be a old game to get good fps with rtx on cool the first game i saw in a conscious age for this i shoud buy rtx mmm okay no just no this ruins the original feel of the game for those of us who played the original now its too bright and cheery it felt like we were fighting in dungeons before now it looks pg13 redo the base textures to be darker at least better than splitgate and people still use reshade and think is ray tracing facepalm i guess this is the sota arent we supposed to have flying cars by now epic store no thanks finally a reason to buy an rtx gpu i dont know what to say so they need to get it from the index in germany first multiplayer this will be amazing if you can still run it on a lower end machine with this graphics old school it looks cool id love to see jedi outcast with rtx and pretty much every other quake 3 engine title i bet there are many people thinking of the many excuses now for why they cant to this or that always felt rtx features was a selling gimmick point but if modders can use this features well its a gimmick that i love now and want quake iii rtx comes out me oh shit here we go again in style of the mr torq awesome btw i would like to see rtx support in unreal engine games too starting from unreal 1 i can only get so hard am i the only one that thinks they over did the lighting quake was so much darker looks still worse than quake champions lol nice graphics upgrade for 700 gpu i may have shed a tear boomers unit and raise your monster ultras looks a lot better now with rtx nice trailer my desktop pc parts are operating

gpu so i have to buy an amd instead now its just gaming pc for my 1 niece and 2 nephews wow cool video thanks for sharing i notice different models for the railgun and the bfg also some new textures for all weapons everything looks glorious now modders change those low poly characters more games with rtx please my 2080 is hungry it is good idea to play on our memories but sad that for this i have to play on 30 years newer hardware i want doom with ray tracing so without raytracing i cant see shit wait quake champions part 2 is also there ah that nostalgia yeah what a nice announcedment for the public unnecessary yes worth it yes time to buy rtx2080ti i guess nvidias not just transforming hardware theyre transforming trends tetris rtx pls i miss the good old days of quake this brings me back it is a shame you didnt do hexen instead even though quake was good it didnt have hexens feel i hope since it is over 20 years old that the high end gtx 10s will be able to do this this puts every other so called new game release with rtx features to shame quake was the first fps i ever played and i played it with 250 ping on a 56k modem connecting to a server in the same city you kids and your new fangled broadband internet comment section 50 boot licking 50 denial because a fortune was spent by them to buy an rtx card im looking forward to real rtx titles and showcases not particularly fond of memes born out of demos the only game a 1300 card can play at full hd ultra settings and get 60 fps still not impressed theres still no muzzle flashes v yes hi big fan can you tell me if ill be able to play quake 2 mods on this especially quake 2 capture the flag lighting great textures models animations awful yesss the classic proves that modern chips performance isnt enough to implement dxr in modern games halo series pc lets get it nuff said justthebeginnnig this is the super tease half life 2 with dxr please im a new programmer and i bought this game recently for one thing this game was written entirely in c not c c or java just c and thats the language im learning at the moment and i wanted to see how the game functions and what you could do for an old game i never played before its pretty darn fun this game brings back sooooo many memories i used to love this game the classic fps with low fps so excited to play it on 1 fps on my 1060 finally looks to be worth the wait so when i oqn quake 2 on steamwill i get the rtx update orrr according to multiple articles there will be a full rtx version of this game not just 3 levels alsowhy is quake 2 banned in germany game 1997 year quake ii rtx minimum system requirements os windows 7 64bit or ubuntu 1604 lts 64bit processor intel core i33220 or amd equivalent memory 8 gb ram graphics nvidia geforce rtx 2060 or higher storage 2gb available space omg free to play rip beautiful skyboxes now replaced with a bland white space stop nvidia is so much proud of rtx they cant wait till e3 to launch this how will it run on 1080 ti though i need those fps this is so cool it is amazing how good games look with rtx even if that game is from 1997 hopfully i will get to try this some day it looks like rtx will bring new life to this old game nice looking so its basically shaders mod for quake cool this is like minecraft with raytracing i will enjoy this very very much rtx on please make doom 3 the next one the level of irony is critical here the most significant and awaited tech is shipped with the one of the most ancient but still awesome game amazing time to be alive next year will be roblox with rtx plz not csgo with rtx wow this is super why is it so bright id play it once more the combination of lowpoly models with the super detailed lighting lends that trailer a claymation sort of vibe its certainly interesting to watch quake meh lets see the original unreal tournament instead loved it that looks fun butter me up im so ready but why joe rogan is gonna freak out im ok with this 3 fucking loved and miss quake ii thought this was another one of those minecraft ray tracing videos i keep getting recommended to me been waiting for a couple of months since you announced it should be released in april but this is great allright now this is just hillarious ultra blocky and old graphics but with raytracing so it really challenges most pcs and actually looks kind of great but i guess good job nvidia when i have my rtx i will play this game beautiful graphics though but used to play quake 2 on my xbox 360 and its amazing not to be to negative here but from all the games why this one it looks amazing ill admit but there are so many games that would benefit so much more back to 90s with a 2019s gpu im in damn thats great my favorite gamenow with rtx nooooice and its not even e3 yet this game shows some actual significant changes with rtx other rtx games you just cant notice any major difference cant wait what is nvidia super answer please great now my pc cannot even run quake 2 wow looks great rtx changed the whole figure of the game which was released back in 1997 literally any game can be revived with rtx its amazing nvidia has taken gaming to next planet i have been waiting for the killer game that i just cant wait any longer to buy an rtx card forthis isnt it just cant afford the card i want dang it rocketjumpninja has entered the chat i want this but with halo ce cool a step in the right direction so how long before we get the quack dlc campaign for this remaster but i will fucking buy it this is clever add ray tracing to an older game so more people can play it as on a new game the performance hit is so huge is not worth it nice try nvidia when they really lost there mind finally just imagine if rtx tech was in modern day games and not games from 20 years ago then maybe id fork out 1200 dollars on a gpu that will be old tech in about a year d the fact that quake 2 is where i started gaming and now i have 2080ti rdy for this excites me very much 20 2nd to comment i have rtx 2080ti and i am sad that ur advertising something super is coming soonwhy making my hardware outdated so soongive me ur new gpu in exchange of my zotac rtx 2080ti amp please i am from india and have paid huge amount more than 110000 rupees is it worth it to replay quake ii with rtx on is there multiplayer finally no water or ice reflection overkill this is so far best rtx trailer by nvidia this looks stupid the dark atmosphere has been replaced with bright lights and boring textures i played quake 3 but with worst graphics hahah is this the new super announcement this brings back so many memories good work nvidia with rtx on this legendary game you are doing a great job guys quake iii arena with rtx please i bet my gt 1030 wont be able to render this too that nostu gamejava platform looks amazing cant even imagine what nvidia will do in 20 years gimme a good gpu please a good moment towards making gaming better than ever awsome thanks for 3 levels lit just bought my graphics card xd thats look cool first first ran it with 1080ti sli x16 on a 9800x and got a driver crash i know both cards are stable 442 driver still waiting for halflife 1 rtx what a waste of talent the most important game for raytracing is tetris everything before that had better simply be practice for the daddy shotgun shells are plastic wtf thats almost a remake at this point thank you brother for such splendid review it is extremely brilliant review binding with your i would say fantastic narrative thumbzzz up dude you are the best one ill be waiting your next reviews thanks in advance keep going wow awesome thanks for this awesome remaster of this legendary game the amount of pain nvidia is going through to mod old games to make rt x worth with 2020 non rtx games not benefiting from the tech i see the potential with ray tracing but i am definitely not impressed by the redesigned quake ii the game now looks very bland too bright and lacking in style contrast and colors it seems to me that future games that utilise ray tracing would have to be designed differently than current games has anyone said word metal more times in the span of 15 minutes before the old gta san andreas would be awesome with rtx now we need ragdoll physics and blood spray physics the big problem with all this metal texturing and sheens is that it makes the denoising really obvious with the pixel swimming now beforehand all those matte textures would hide that factor rather well but stand idle anywhere now that isnt outdoors with cliffsides and youll see it happening we need shadows of the empire ive played quake ii since i bough it when it came out i havent played it in a while though since i got a new computer two years ago and im amused every single scene in this looked familiar ive always wanted a fully 3d version of the original style early doom the dooms since 2005 are more like quake than doom back to the topic of hand back to the topic at hand those are not the same words and do not convey the same meaning topic at hand it is at your hand a finger is of your hand your wording makes no sense i know american english plays fast and loose with meaning but come on if theyre near your hand they are at hand id like to see unreal tbh it been nice doom 64 is path trace as wellpeople go nuts if it happen i noticed that the railgun didnt flash the screen white 100 ffffff when shot whereas the blaster and the chaingun do emit a bright blinding flash when shot 1434 i dont know if thats because of the color of the flash that makes it less noticeable the railgun must appear brighter because it looks like plasma and plasma emits blinding light and watching the video again even the explosions that supposed to cause sonic booms dont make extremely bright scenes 011 i suppose that quake ii came like that in 1997 and im starting to notice also why nearest or linear the best setting would be cubic interpolation gamma correct in the dynamic resolution scaling nononono please god dam no if youre doing something please do it perfect these bloory textures with raytracing are you seriously quake darkplaces with raytracing this will be the perfection i have a 2080ti my problem is that unless you have a 2080 or better you really cant use ray tracing without a huge fps hit the 2060 is barely capable of ray tracing and the 2070 isnt much better codmw for example uses 5gb 11gb of my available vram current shadow technology transparency and volumetric shading is already so good you dont really need ray tracing take a look at crysis running on a core i7 with a gtx 1060 it looks fabulous most people will prefer higher fps over effects to the environment they probably wont notice in regular play i dont think well have a true rtx killer app till the next splinter cell cool version 12 of rtx quake ii came out just as i became 20 november 26th was my 20th birthday my pc doesnt run this shit tho black mesa path traced plz that would be greatz you know some really interesting if system shock 2 with full rtx become avaible alex needs to record the complete volumetric lights lp as soon as possible games can wait i just tried it on my rtx 2060 and can run it at 60fps 1080p medium rt with 80 dynamic res 900p minimum this is bloody amazing great job guys on a side note i would really love to see unreal gold getting this treatment it has so many diverse environments such as spaceship interiors waterfalls ancient temples floating islands castles and etc so much possibilites to showcase a new tech in all its glory one can dream 013 rpg bug glitch ps i want to see blood 1997 with rtx i gotta be honest if they didnt over shine everything itd be nice until they tone that crap down ill just play on quake 2 xp and still feel like im getting the better experience nvidia must return 3d vision 2 support in their drivers for rtx video cards ray traicing is nothing in comparison with 3d stereo view in 3d action games mirrors o just now hearing about thiswhat have i missed i guess ill be building a pc so i can play this one of my favorite multiplayer games ever which leads me to ask how are servers for this new version never thought id had to say my pc cant run quake 2 again sometimes matte looks better than shiny texture especially the bullets when i played quake ii the first time it dindt have the music folder so i played only hearing the ambience and enemies sounds and in my opinion thats a little bit more involving because you heard all the freaking time the machinery and enemies moving and when you get to a dark area full with stroggsyou can bet you will piss your pants off to be fair the whole make everything shiny1 has the opposite effect sharper textures are nice but making everything look reflective and shiny just completely ruins the gritty aesthetics of q2 reflections work best if used sparingly not by slapping them on everything even things that arent supposed to be reflective the shotgun shells look like christmas decorations now next game unreal end of story whats next for the engine maybe raytraced sound wow looks rly dope this must be done to action quake 2 would be insanely cool played aq2 for 10 years or something best online fps ever q2s soundtrack is still one of my favorite of all time so good so ray tracing to path tracing 2016 can my pc run doom 2016 2019 can my pc run quake 2 1014 it should be by our colleague ok morrowind rtx like now please normal shotgun fire on the walls looks weird anyhows does any 1 knows if the netcode has been updated to reduce lagping if playing online it kept crashing for me unfortunately wait the sky still is the wrong earth blue color i read they changed it back to the proper stroggos bright orange oh well never thought id have to spend 3 grand to play a game ive originally paid 20 quid but it does look nice why am i watching a video of someone staring at walls because they are beautiful walls eugh i wish this rtx remaster would make an attempt to maintain the original atmosphere of the game it was dark and gloomy this rtx remaster everything is so well lit wow this is really cool the last time i looked into rtx quake i felt like well they made quake 1 really shiny too shiny why but this quake 2 demo looks incredible im still not really sold on rtx cards yet not sure if its worth it im more interested in ray traced audio for new games especially for vr but when hl2 can handle it ill be interested digital foundry 1 million subscribers in 2020 congrats so what kind of hardware do i need to play quake 2 now 5k light obscured by fan porn music earned a like good work otacon i would love to see the result of this and the vr mod combined would be interesting to see the results if they can get it running you staring at those metallic armor shards reminds me of myself staring at the metallic looking quad damage powerup in quake iii back in the day would nice to see quake 1 rtx and quake arena rtx ill go maybe 3 more years before i contemplate buying an rtx still gtx 1060 gb reporting in it would be nice if the game could be played besides on top end systems looks incredible i need more ray traced games man feels like a waste right now with the rtx hardware but well what can you expect with new technologies integer scaling cant be used in other cards than rtx ones because no other cards have integer units just floating point units i sure do miss rhino squad do you do you though good grief this is starting to look like star wars remastered versions xd ahhh 1997 better days that quake 2 music takes me right back to my childhood good times now give me doom 3 rtx computer updated the best case of rt is quake 2 nice job how about the 2060 does perform well i have a zotac 2060 and i couldnt get to 60fps 1080p with max graphics only 30 fps very odd still no update to muzzle flash and tracers those are part of lighting the metals do look more like metal but they always make them way too reflective making it look closer to polished obsidian glass than metal rtx today is like glide in 1998 groundbreaking expensive yet still requires a lot of work to be done and isnt really doing much of a difference decided to upgrade pc only after modern equivalent of geforce 256 will be released ha i just played this old game a couple weeks ago crazy coincidence goldeneye would be nice so for cutting edge graphics all we have to do is play a 22 year old game unreal tournament next plz now they just gotta ray trace og doom i went to play q2rtx right after i watched this video and wondered how does this guys 2060s have better graphics and performance than my 2070 then i realized that i didnt update my driver meh quake 2 is kind of basic as a game though it aint so good what is the point of this xd really wish someone would update star trek voyager elite force for these new rayracing cards there was a software raytracing mod for it a decade ago which of course ran incredibly poorly rtx its best way for official remasters classics from 90 without much investment 146 why is nobody talking about the biggest elephant in the room the weapons namely the shotgun never in my life have i seen or heard a weapon made from silver black chrome the way it shrines it looks absolutely terrible that thing would make all sorts of light reflect in your eyes and annoying you if not making it downright impossible to aim at anything this seems to be heading the same route as doom iii make something look cool and shiny but not necessarily realistic maybe part of the fault is q2 being so old and doom iii as well obviously not as old and the concept used for their maps relied heavily on metal materials everywhere so everything will be metallic and grey but the problem is that everything they make that is metallic needs to reflect like a mirror and ends up giving that cheap chromed plastic effect most of the time other effects as well for example it is cool to see the underwater fog showing how less the light will affect the deeper you dive but sometimes the water will be crystal clear like it was in the first version it doesnt mean it got better just that it is a different scenario not all mirrors will have a blue tint some glasses will be deformed in different ways resulting in different refractions specially if it is cracked just because something is metallic doesnt mean it the bfg in the mirror is old school now do something about that polygon count and we are game where is my star wars jedi fallen order pc optimization d nice video btw watching this video i was thinking the entire time damn i wish they would give half life 1 the same treatment seems im not the only one i would love a new quake singleplayer game a doom 2016 treatment but obviously more serious continuing the strogg storyline this is by far a great looking game in rtx just wish i could get the ost on steam with the game this but for quake 3 arena and team arena is there any interest in having a ray traced version of return to castle wolfenstein is it true that this doesnt even use the rt cores it looks shit what we need is a middle ground we need a new generation of gpus with much improved raytracing and we need a middle ground game like skyrim raytraced and other similar games runs on 8 fps on my 1060 shotgun shell casings are supposed to be made out of plastic though i bought a 600 euro gpu to play a 20 years old game with proper rtx and that too with dynamic res wow impressive but not for me all these changes sort of strip away the drab grim look that actually gave quake 2 its original appeal and atmosphere compared to other gaudy bright games at the time man if someone makes a path tracing mod for halo combat evolved i will buy an rtx card just for that by the time i get a raytracing card quake 42 will be out d railgun needs to lose those wings painkiller would kick ass with rtx i can play quake 2 at 30 fps feels like the 2000s again i hope we see a quake collection with upgrades like these for next gen consoles quake in patch 12 looks like a current next gen game id play all of the games over again looking like this on the ps5 or scarlett id do something about that its a quick money grab for you to bundle all of the quake games for 30 with ray tracing and high res textures im sure im not alone in wanting this that said why is the reflection not representative of what its reflecting the gun definitely looks like the original and not the ray traced high resolution textured one on screen im sure the character is the same i really dont like how clean these new textures all look and the hall of mirrors screams tech demo hopefully the other raytracing remasters nvidia has planned dont have needless gimmicks in them it stops feeling like a remaster and more like an advertisement wow crap tastic i dont give 2 shits about rtx its worthless nvidia gtfo who are you kidding just because its doable to inject ray traced features into old games it doesnt mean its worth anything and the effort at all hey guys lets play tetris with rtx enabled wow nvidia you guys are really coming through on the promise of partial shhhty ray tracing i cant wait to see tetris running at 480i 15fps with this tech enabled golf clap i have the game i have the rtx card but where do i get the soundtrack the game has no music future of rtx soon dead okay these are some improvements after a slow start things are now looking much better the question is how much of this technology can be used in other gameslarger more modern game titles i thinking things like classic racing games games like medal of honor on the ps1 theyd be a completely different experience for sure i have an amd gpu epic not doing this for unreal is a real shame since were going back in time waiting for pong rtx remake it just works at 30fps but it just does can we all agree there needs to be a homeworld rtx can i get a hell yeah i petty the fool who buys a rtx for this game 10 hour volumetric light obscured by fan when although i understand the amazing effort i somehow still prefer the original textures cant say why exactly thought the metal and overall shininess feels a bit too much now maybe too much reflection on some objects sometimes objects would be matte in real life those lights shafts that fan phwoar demonetised how odd that its a 20 year old game and not a modern one that makes me want to upgrade to rtx this is how ray tracing should besome other games i have seen questionable you i have one thicc rtx graphics card the gf saharah desert you it can do volumetric lighting in front of a spinning fan the gf soapy wet slip and slide yea this is way you pay 1400 to play a game that is more then 10 years old too bad the current gen rtx gpus cant have this level of lighting effects on in modern games they can only use them sparingly because performance would be unplayable due to hardware limitations oh man don t think my 2060 gonna run it well amd fanboys downvoted this video quake 3 arena rtx remaster and i would even buy it thats a lot of impressive improvements it doesnt look like a mod anymore but a modern game besides that disastrous original asset self reflect 3rd person model still not the performance we wanted but this will only improve in next gen gpus although impressive all the shining stuff is just too shiny it might look like metal but way to clean and reflective who the hell polish the shotgun and the air vents in the other hand stonerocks textures could have benefitted from fine details like unreal and serious sam presented to us the metallic sound is not a bug its because the audio is now bouncing off the new metallic surfaces no no no the volumetric lighting under the fan is already too sexy even without the smooth jazz and sultry voice also how did you get those sidebysides did you record some demos or maybe mirror input across multiple machines volumetric liiiiight obscureeeed by a faaaaaan mmmmh alex you are our german barry white 3 id love to see unreal tournaments glorious reflections i get 40fps on a 2070 god damn fix those ppppops quake ii is forever volumetric light shafts in front of a spinning fan 3 i just really want to know where the textures are this game is using because after exploring the pak files im not finding any normal roughness or metallic maps or any higher res textures anywhere id like to go through a fix the texture errors such as the shotgun shells having an odd ruby metallic sheen to the shell rather than a plastic which is ofc something to do with the dialectric setting in the material pipeline but i dont know where the material is gtx1080 here i ran it with rtx on at 1366x768 and managed about 13fps to start ouch turned rtx off and it ran at 999fps the maximum is 999fps i guess turned up resolution to 2560x1440 and it was still over 800fps if i remember correctly bit of a performance hit for nonrtx yet supported cards what confuses me is that i think nvidia had slides showing the performance gain was 6x or something similar for raytracing on turing vs pascal but the difference here is closer to 100x difference in fps not that i care that much but i wonder if theres much point trying other rtx games just to see what they look like though apparently it doesnt yet make much visual difference in most cases for me it shines way too much it looks totally unrealistic it kind of looks like a prerendered vision from the 1990s of how future fps games may look like except its 2019 and running in real time i would like to see portal 2 with this raytracing features its damn gorgeous and runs much better lovelove that music my verdict is still a bit meh the original quake looked dark gritty and atmospheric rtx reminds me of when people made gta san andreas shiny and wet but called it hi resolution it all seems too bright to me almost to the point of being mistaken for overwatch rather than a horror gib fest maybe when programmers become more used to it things will change but as it stands metal is the the new wet feeling like i missed out i didnt spend 1400 in 2019 for a 2080ti so i could play a modified version of 1997s quake ii portal rtx i need it they went way too shiny metal for my taste or do strogg just love to clean their walls all day 801 that was so abrupt and random and surprisingly sexy i love it hey guys what can we do for quake with raytracing just put more shiny stuff ok quake 2 is out again and i can barely run it on my computer just like old times do people still play this multiplayer is it possible to add ray tracing to skyrim cuz regular drugs are illegal oh wow 12 does look nicer going to have to download that and play the whole game all over again on nightmare yayyyyyyyyyyy and then it transmits through to the other side now tinted and darkened by the glass sold color me impressed who cares you run around shooting opponents if you stood around you could lose all day remember when games were games not interactive movies just make our games run smooth fast with zero lag and input delay here i started the game at 4k max settings on asus blabla 2080 ti which is much too high settings and resolution to get 60 fps game from 1997 1200 video card from 2018 to run said game at 10 fps yeah seems legit which means we need another 5 years to get quake 2 rtx to run 4k 300 fps at max settings btw is just me or theres way too much shiny things in this version in reality not every metal surface is so perfectly smooth with a layer of oil over it sheesh ray tracing will only have significant impact when the next gen consoles and games are released so i guess 23 years at least that look really nice how about ray trace audio support plzzz can i have insert your favorite game here dont rtx gpus have integer scaling in the control panel would love to see unreal rtx so basically they updated quake to the unreal engine the game runs smoth at 60 fps on my gt 1060 notebook but att low resolution tried 30 fps goal it feels jerky lots of games are 30 fps but why do this feel more jerky then others i heard that the ray tracing in this game is not based on the rtx cores from the gpu is it true quake 2 still have that 1997 box sitting here unbelieveable that my favorite game from way back when became a technology showroom 20 years later d more reflections to the god of reflections yep all the metals are that reflective in a real world i would like to see the reflective tanks and other shiny military equipment raytracing is still a gimmick on a software driver levelpciexpress 40 will overtake it and will bring much more efficiency in performance than these rtx pascal refresh cards that are still dying due to overheating and artifacting gddr6 1350 mhz gpu core lock bug and numerous bsods so theres a meme where digital foundry takes like 20 minutes to say something that should have taken 2 minutes to say thats an exaggeration for comedy purposes but this video is at least 5 minutes too long at very least and im allowing for the 10minute youtube monetization window anyway im glad you covered it regardless i agree that qii rtx is one of the most interesting things to come out this year but what does that say about games in 2019 heh damn my pc is to weak for quake ii in the entire quake 2 campaign i think theres only one glas maybe three awesome lets pay an extra 600 dollars for a 1080 ti that can play quake 2 with fancy lighting rtx is a scam for now im playing through quake 2 on ps1 at the moment and this looks amazing in comparison lol 11 flat 12 fucking meeetal and glass plus water plus lighting plus music plus all of the shiny stuff in a nutshell there ya go cheers sweatinggif this is the best demonstation of a realtime ray tracing in a game to date imo the only thing that holds it back from looking perfect are very outdated assets aside from updated weapons and old sprite vfx hopefully they wouldnt stop updating it and bring the new vfx like the ones that they showed a while ago at the nvidia conference i think descent would probably look amazing with ray tracing where are the raytracing haters are they missing do i have to pay them to hate raytracing did they run out of arguments please help me we need more old games like this imagine gta 3 ray traced and manhunt whats this music playing in the background wow quake 2 at sub 120 fps yea count me the fuck out rtx is such a waste of money has an rtx card literally has stopped playing games the technology might be nice but the mod tenebrae for quake 1 in 2003 looked somehow better than this its not that great that pilotwings 64 music im waiting for quake 1 ugh i just got a computer to run quake ii now i have to get a new one to run it again man but seriously i would be willing to get a new computer just to be able to play this version of quake ii shotgun shells arent made of metal just sayin geeze so much rt wanking most of the improvements make it look less realistic not everything is shiny or metal yet everything here is and it ruins the artistic aesthetic the id guys created is it cool it can be done sure but it looks like utter ass for the most part 544 that looks absolutely gorgeous on the right if the whole game looked like that id finally be convinced by this technology being used for this game unfortunately pcs arent good enough to run it well at that res conclusion rtx by itself is almost meaningless its up to devs to make something outstanding with it you could literally have your own pc gaming channel and take the world over this was great quake ii full remake with id tech 6 engine textures and animation would be wonderful portal rtx please loving the music i hate not being able to afford a new pc i was a quake 2 junkie back in the day was a member of a clan and used to be ace with instagib wow memories but i havent been able to afford to build a new pc in years and not any time soon either too many family priorities nowadays but this quake 2 rtx stuff looks amazing i still have this on disk i was fortunate to have been gifted a 1080ti and boy does quake 2 rtx look fantastic never would have thought i personally would have seen ray tracing before i picked up a card that had it its glorious sonic mayhem never gets old man quake iis so cool yeah shotgun shells are not really metal though doom 3 needs rtx more than anything i was thinking that the texture looked like a scene from q4 too shotgun shells shouldnt be metallic where is fallen order pc and ps4 tech review quake 4 was great i love that relaxing pilotwings 64 music wouldnt it be more beneficial just to start from the begining from the ground up and remake these classic games with 2020 modern graphics in the same style instead of getting the originals and just trying to clean them up and put ray tracing in it for me its point less make the game again with a new engine and then shows us what ray tracing can do with a new half life or quake doom ect with the morden look volumetric light obscured by fan i love alexs videos theyre so much fun to watch we want super dragon ball heroes world mission on switch df video and when do we want it hopefully sometime soon come on guys its the first time its been released outside of japan liked i always preferred quake 2s scifi look if discuss that change honestly they just like batch convert all pbr layer texture with some normalized settings almost without any designer touch like what polished metal walls and gates weapons from local child toys store tnx looks pretty now add ragdoll physics d add a pbulic comment or enjoy the evolution of alex legend you need 2 titan rtx in sli to run this at 800x600 low settings with a 20 resolution scale cannot wait for my jacket loving gpu man to tell me to pay 1000 usd to play this in 4k 60 fps with 3080ti im uploading this to porn hub 134 is that the character model being reflected the weapon in the mirror is not the same model i wish quake iii arena could get some love not necessarily rtx but some kind of massive update to the qualitygraphics would be nice other than the rehashesmods like ioquake3 and quake live etc its a very modfriendly game with a pretty big community around it and id like to see what one of these studios could do with it there have already been some incredible games developed based on its engine so it definitely has potential i bet a todays remake of this game with the usual techniques of faking reflections and gi would make this rtx version much less impressivelike the titles released so far cool nonetheless quake rtx doesnt even use the rtx cores on nvidias gpus so its technically not rtx nvidia would like everyone to think that whenever the term rtx is used rtx is something nvidia calls there gpu ray tracing is called ray tracing this game actually uses a form of path tracing so its neither rtx or light ray tracing also nvidia didnt invent ray tracing its been used in cgi for that past 15 years if anyone deserves the credit for ray tracing it would be imagination technologies img powervr powervr had ray tracing gpus that were crazily enough mobile gpus powervr had ray tracing demos out in 2006 but knew it wasnt ready for mainstream but showed what was possible so now nvidia licensed the ray tracing tech from img powervr not many realize this microsoft deserves a shout out too if it wasnt for microsoft no one would have ray tracing on there pc remember its windows dxr api that makes ray tracing possible with out the need for proprietary hardware what is this if it needs updating it means it was never right to begin with and showing differences proves its just a hack just hilarious but 90 of you lot wont get it more good money after bad when will it end you should check out sli for this theres great scaling another waste of time not to say this serious sam look that doesnt fit quake 2 in any way my mouth wont close im drooling too much i hope half life gets fully ported back to the quake ii engine in all its rtx glory quick fact the very first footage of half life was seen running on the quake 2 engine back in 1998 before the overhaul i wish i had a pc so i could play this i been dying to for months now since they dropped the rtx version is the demo also being updated they need to do something like this on quake1 what we really want to see is ray traced atari 2600 pitfall always wanted to win a ferrari playing quake 2 like thresh i want quake 3 fully traced back to the topic of hand lulz i will never get tired of saying this playable realtime raytraced rendering is fucking amazing even in goddamn quake 2 the difference is transformative and it looks absolutely delicious once we see this being used in modern engines with all the fancy bells whistles and materials well be in heaven and i dont just mean gi or assisted by rt i mean a complete replacement of rasterization i wonder why more games dont use integer scaling for resolutions where applicable also ray tracing would be very interesting to see in 2d games like octopath traveler where the artistic choice works to benefit the addition of rtx 023 thats lights off vs lights on thats not an enhancement quite the opposite its not how the game is supposed to look 800 right on top there with johns smack talk i want to see portal path traced why ray tracing is so expensive regarding fps if card have dedicated hardware acceleration with no ray tracing rt cores dont do nothing with ray tracing rt cores should take care of it and fps shouldnt drop cool will need to try this over the weekend argh the entire shotgun shell is not made of metal the red material is supposed to be a matte color and not as reflective as the brass still overall this is impressive work is it still using 1 cpu to force low fps i dream of halflife 1raytraced amazing work alex thank you for the video 811 something wholly holy d theyre god rays p missing from version 11 i see in the notes they fixed the microstuttering which appeared for me in like maybe september making it totally unplayable hope this fixes it so i can finish the game edit tested and its fixed runs a little better too the dynamic resolution scalar works really well to keep the frame rate at 60 without any noticeable drawbacks so did we go from can it run crysis to can it run quake 2 oh yeah give me those volumetric light shafts in front of a spinning fan want tomb raider 1 and 4 half life 1 turok 1 mdk 1 jedi knigt 1 max payne 1 kotor 1 oblivion and skyrim ddom 3 dead space 1 assassin creed 1 dark souls 1 rtx and of coruse crysis 1 and maybe medieval 2 total war rtx dont forget quake 3 arena too id love to see half life 2 bioshock or system shock 2 remade with rtx or even hl1 buy over 1000 gpu play 20 year old game because nothing else runs rtx properly dark forces rtx pleeeeease why does 4k resolution even matter you guys play games on a 43 crt monitor anyways someone should apply this to the darkplaces engine it be great with wrath aeon of ruin it looks like shit tbh i would still rather play the original would love to see half life 1 with rtx still looks horrible sorry what is the point of this video volumetric light obscured by a fan oh yeah where can i buy this track next generation of nvidia cards better have at least x45 performanceyeah i wish on the rt cores on the lowest model otherwise iam never getting one for that feature alone let alone nvidia in generali mean i love rt but the performance is still disgusting halflife sin unreal 1 deus ex oh yeah d this already looks orgasmic now imagine bioshock with this technology wait a rtx 2070 super cant get 60fps on quake 2 in 1440p not worth it coolt loved that game back in the day but im not buying a rtx card just to play it they are stupidly expensive everyone bending over backwards to praise this kind of thing to me it looks simply gaudy art direction counts for a lot more than overused implementations of advancements in graphics i get the technology i get the direction we are heading in and see the promise of it but this is all a little infantile both in terms of the technology itself and peoples response to it i can only ever see this as a novelty not as a replacement for the original design when retrofitted such as this the original quake ii looks far better in my opinion as was intended this version just looks like a really garish technology wank where everything looks completely unrealistic and overused too clinical clean and reflective where the atmosphere is missing entirely not to mention how bad the performance is for a game this old when you apply full scene ray tracing which shows how far is yet to go for modern games the underwater effects looked pretty impressive though ill give i will be enough rtx 2060 super for cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p 60fps vsync enabled high veryhigh hardware unboxed optimized with rtx enabledi ask because i want to know if to buy rtx 2060 super to not loose something by playing without rtx on or rx 5700xt to get more fps in most if not all gamesthanks and sorry for my english sadly if you stop to appreciate any of these effects your are dead fake reflections from 550 the gun is different in the reflection compared to the 1st person model or reflecting the 3rd person model which is different than the 1st person model doom 3 rtx when they should just go ahead and redo all the bad guys in q2 make it a proper remaster i really hope they keep making it better and better the sky is still the wrong color lipstick on a pig why 1440p 1080p would make much more sense here can you get this update on steam is it actually using the physical nvidia rtx cores or is this just called rtx while being open source you know like nvidia did with freesync its gsync compatible now please pull the microphone from your mouth and learn to avoid plosives it is very distracting was that pilotwings 64 music during the volumetric lighting shotgun shell husks the red part are plastic not metal would love to see them add this support on doom 3 with all those shadows metallic objects and skins and lightsources i discovered that audio bug too i just switched the audio source from openal to software and its okay now i tried to play this on steam and it still wouldnt work need this evening my rtx 2080 is doing nothing other than wow bfa right now thief 2 thief 2 thief 2 thief 2 please let it be ray traced thief 2 please nvidia update half life and deus ex all will be forgiven this looks amazing really impressive the realism that the accurate lighting of a scene adds to what is by todays standards a very barren landscape is quite astonishing excellent video and explanation as always thank you pouring perfume onto a pig i would much rather see crytek ray trace half life so more can enjoy it half life 2 rtx would be beautiful to see i have a 2080 and i cant get 30fps whats my problem driver up already done i thought linear scaling and integer scaling were the same thing whats the difference i could never understand some peoples obsession with metallic sheen you know metal can have a multitude of finishes be it from the polishing process itself or by painting it more matte or you know corrosion over time not all metallic surfaces must be shiny it looks too bright the original was dark and repressive damn this makes me want to see the halo mcc use rtx for some of the metallic textures across the game people that says graphics doesnt matter are just inept but can you invert the mouse and play mods with it why not a dynamic quality setting you know turning on and off some settings along with the changing the resolution to ensure a target fps with a minimal impact games i want to see remastered this way half life 1 its expansions orange box portal 2 hl2 ep12 portal farcry 1 doom 3 its expansions bfg preferably deus ex splinter cell series 1 2 3 4 quake 4 fear fear onine brother in arms road to hill 30 gta 3 vc sa max payne operation flashpointarma cold war assault all expansions of this classic masterpiece of course crysis franchise mass effect 1 2 3 bioshock series fallout 3 vegas alien isolation elder scrolls franchise witcher franchise dead space series homefront series so atmospheric i also generally want to see a remastered rts games such as company of heroes 1 2 world in conflict complete set i remember playing quake ii to the end back when it came out and thinking ill play it again soon but never touched it since i think its time to install it again who wants quake1 with rtx for me they need to get it into halflife 2 that game with proper lighting would probably look incredible this could start a new craze of retro ray tracing gamingthat half life looks amazing i dont know about 12 but the first raytraced version is not actually an rtx title nvidia paid for it to say that but rtx card are not required for the raytracing just another game to add to the list then which was released prematurely to cash in quicker problem with this approach is that sometimes games dont get properly fully patched they remain broken unfinished messes for all time deus ex rtx please id sell everything just to play that someone should haxor the crytek rting jazz onto this for us lowly non rtx card owners o i really hope to see unreal rtx when i see that i hope i still cared about that kind of stuff its still nice and nice tech but it seems i dont care any more not sure if i should be sad or not about it but im not digital foundry are you guys multiboxing when you do the sidebyside comparisons between 11 and 12 youre making almost the same exact movements in both versions at almost the same exact times which makes me think thats how youre doing it if not it may be worth considering for you guys when doing comparisons like this as it could make things even easier for you youd have one machine running 11 and another machine running 12 with both hooked up to the same keyboard and mouse theres special hardware for this thats actually relatively affordable though im sure you already know that once youve got that setup starting both versions of the game at the same time is as simple as doubleclicking the games icon on each machines desktop at the same time and from that point the gameplay will be more or less 100 synced between both machines ready for you to capture should really help make these comparisons as apples to apples as possib i want this on my ps5 shoutouts to the pilotwings 64 soundtrack rtx is just nooooot worth it how to waste money i want to see festers quest nes raytraced 611 you can clearly see field of view is broken scam business in plain sight or maybe character has eyes on boobs get your goodie bag and pretend that all is good 1025 sounds like a lower sample rate naive question is there a possibility of this but with software ray tracing fear with ray tracing would be dope i get motion sickness playing this and i love it anyway flawless in dynamic resolution scaling mode pegged at 60fps almost better than real life levels of immersion not bad for a 22 year old game fantastic things about pc gaming on show here rtx the original doom or maybe even doom 3 i hope the reception to this official rtx update for quake 2 shows id that interest in the story of strogos hasnt died out and we can maybe get what ive fantasized about since i played q2 back then a futuristic modern remake of operation overlord the strogos invasion what about og doom rtxd no really it looks better than back than with modern hardware features textures thank you digital obvious those vents metal the armor metal fragging the fraggin hell out of 90s aliens you better believe thats metal use and utilize have exactly the same meaning and sounds less like a child writing their highschool essay very informative video thanks for sharing quake 2 have most beautiful soundtrack in videogames ever we really need quake 2 remaster with id tech 7 engine 910 integer scaling what is this witchcraft its possible to have games without them blurring themselves to the max if only this technology had been discovered earlier heavy sarcasm thats how i feel when i try to run games at 720p 144fps on my 1440p 144hz monitor with my puny gtx 1060 801 pilot wings ost for pr0n music fantastic wish they would do quake 1 that game was dark and better in my opinion 1352 song is called quad machine what an indepth and high quality analysis as someone not too versed in graphical settings the sidebyside comparisons make it easy to follow along maybe if i someday can afford an rtx card ill give this a go i would love to see quake 3 given rtx so that jedi outcast can benefit from it still no rt though is it or is the illumination done with reflections of reflections of reflections of reflections cant wait for 5 years time when they release skyrim vr with ray tracing the only thing it needs now is vr support seeing all this in stereoscopic 3d would be amazing and with dxr sli support rumors are that the game barely uses rtx tensor cores according to someone who reverse engineered it and yet the opengl version still looks better in my eyes forget about higher resolutions and run it on crt next hl1 and hl2 rtx xbox fanboys mouths drops after seeing true 4k60fps unlike that pathetic fake 4k20fps on xbox one x id love to see them add rtx to the full half life 1 qq ost is still the shbomb volumetric light obscured by a fan what a great update we just need more classic games announced on top of all the top end triple a games and its going to start looking like a pretty fleshed out feature the addition of the original soundtrack is the best part of this patch imo the rest of it is pretty dang sweet too though im a little surprised with all the other tech involved that the game doesnt appear to output in hdr great job putting this video together im a huge fan of the side by side comparisons doom 3 would fit right in with this rtx project that game was all about mood and lighting i would love to see games like mad max get the ray tracing love 30fps 1440p on a 2080ti we need faster hardware so many subtle detail improvements wow still waiting for computer space rtx volumetric light shafts in front of a spinning fan thats some sexy talk right there i would really like to see an rtx turok that was fast theses glorified rtx commercials are always so punctual stalker with dxr vulkanrt will be amazing due to its dynamic weather and lighting image halo with this hooray we came from stone age to metal age by using cutting edge tech of 2019 what a leap hating the shiny super shotgun design i wish they would alter it a bit so it doesnt look like a gun made out of two glued together pipes this further proves my suspicion that rtx is a scam probably one of the biggest scam in the gaming industry lately ive been having a blast with this game but i sure do wish theyd create a new texture for the grenade while its in your hand as it looks pretty terrible i also wish theyd add the flow effects to the bfg like they showed in the reveal trailer all hail open source well someone just needs to go volunteer to add raytracing to black mesa since its just about finished hl2 rtx as the chavs down the road would say wow cool bruv so in order to run rtx 60 fps we have to go back to quake style graphics and 1080p for 1200 bucks no thanks man lighting is crazy theres nothing quite like a volumetric light shafts in front of a spinning fan that shit really gets me going if they make all the oldschool shooters raytraced imma gonna buy an rtx card right away i will never understand why it is more and more common to show whats new first and after that the old one either way like always really interesting video thank you more proof that ray tracing is about to push general graphical quality back twenty years for the sake of technically correct lighting when we can already fake it spectacularly well i sincerely hope that no one uses the ray trace hardware in ps5scarlett for lighting devoting that hardware to physics is the only way to redeem the idea of enabling ray tracing in games today 203 shotgun shell casings should be plastic the red part not metal lol have you or they never shot a shotgun anyway does this port works with expansions or player content can i get a rtx remaster of system shock 2 i was waiting for this sin or soldier of fotune need to be next cant wait to play it on gtx 1080ti its amazing just how good raytracing makes this game look would love to see it done to the first quake and maybe doom 3 yay quake ii id love to see lithtech games with rt like avp2 im finally upgrading to a 2060 super from a 970 i am overly excited thank god for black friday christmas and preselling my 970 to put towards the card for reference im the guy who applies for every contest and watches every deal so this is a huuuuuggggge thing for me half life 1 2 with ray tracing when quake 1 needs the same to be honest i want to run this on my 1060 but at more fps than 7 cmon i honestly wish video games went more in this direction with technical progress chasing complex lighting situations and atmosphere rather than triangle counts i feel its where art direction can really shine without spending resources on things that are just higher and higher fidelity sometimes losing the focus limited options can bring out actually ideal world would be a space where both can exist i downloaded this just for the lulz and on my 1070oc it runs at 720p30 but its still kinda impressive to look at in action damn this is a more of a remaster than an update of a remaster anyways 801 lmao volumetric light obscured by a fan cool but it does change all of the cinematography quake is awesome my childhood half life 2 with ray tracing it needs to happen even by 2019 standards the game still looks decent so with ray tracing and reworked textures itll look amazing id love to see the original max payne with raytracing 3 they might as well update the character models a bit give them a bit of polish after going through the doom trilogy on switch id love quake 1 or 2 ported lets be honest this quake 2 version looks fucking awful with its jarring contrast between ray tracing and 90s sprites how far you can look under water is an artistic choice in clear water you can totally look that far like in the old version it gets darker and darker but you would have to look very very far out for that any chance youre doing a vid on alien isolation switch analysis volumetric lighting jam ahoy i love me a nice shaft lol what a horrible raygun design rather unnecessary change i stayed for the music p i couldnt work out how to get the soundtrack working in this game id love it if they added tessellation or pom for all the textures next 801 reported this is scandalous demonetized ray tracing is truly the future of visuals this makes me want a halo anniversary style quake 2 remake in the new idtech also that new railgun model is dope so basically 2041 until rtx is at a reasonable level got it we need deus ex to receive ray tracing mods always amazes me how much of a difference lightining alone can make i want to see hl1 or deus ex with this ray tracing tech some kind of ai module in cpus would be great for improving ais in videogames i want to see this stuff in doom 3 im always saying i cant wait for rtx to become a common thing in gaming cant wait for super mario and gta with ray tracing for instance next thing to replace is the character models gheez 156 the drab matte asthetic makes more sense really the whole game was dark and gritty its nice to show off the tech though quake 2 shiny edition am i the only who doesnt care about ray tracing that glossy super shotgun looks like shit this update wrecks quake 2 on an artistic level a huge lack of respect going on here dont get me wrong on a tech level its phenomenal but the lighting and style is being compromised considerably cool now all i need is a pc made in the last decade so i can play it lol just stop rtx is a bad marketing joke it can be done without tensor cores only 6 games officially support it i actually am early so are they just going to keep updating this game or make a brand new quake damnnn rtx looks good on this old title this will be my first played game when i will get an rtx card next year when amd and nv will have new cards always nice to see a good digital foundry just when i get home thanks alex after this im definitely listening to the whole ost of quake 2 while cooking my food masterpiece i love that quake 2 in 2019 is a testbed for future gaming tech i came at the speed of 10 gigarays blast from the past damn i feel old im not really computer updated a good surprise just after getting home alex battaglia talking about ray tracing first if u dont jump atleast 3 times per second in game than u have no idea what q2 is most of the people who comment here are probably console gamers lol im running quake ii rtx with a gtx 1660 ti it runs about 19 22 fps doesnt matter though i still see a beautiful ray traced game with a 200 dollar graphics card ray tracing should never of happened on this generation of gpus but next year when nvidia release there 7nm ones and have more performance then yes that would of been a better move what is this ai though the enemies just run around arbitrarily and only shoot every 3 seconds or so but check the cpu usage from ogl to vulkan uhhm i guess they locked the game at 1000fps huh anyone who says raytracing is an important step for video game development needs to watch this test once and drop the act raytracing is a hard fail for now and barely improves visual quality though it does have great less expensive uses for sound raytracing should be revisited in 510 years but for nowany gamer that is fine with a performance decrease of 6070you arent a gamer im a console nerd at heart and the nextgen consoles are looking to be a dream come true actual competitor to pc gamingbut if raytracing is pushes by devs or publishers that hope is gone back to 30fps trash at 4k will this run quake ii i dunno im pretty impressed playing it on my 1080 at superlow res some of the later levels with darker areas are sweet might be an rtx in my future lol 70fps at 1080p keep trying nvidia 98 gpu load holy fuck rtx render sucks native opengl or software is the best for it brought to its knees man 0225 we need a 999hz monitor damn you must be new at quake youre really bad at this game my pcs leaking tears humiliated xd this game is just a waist of megabytes so whats the purpose of this half life rtx it was your goal to play as noobish as it possible finnaly i won t bottleneck my pentium ii with my rtx card when i ll play this game when your 1000 dollar graphics card runs a game from the 90s at 98 percent usage lmfao 1000 fps i thought we can rum games with max 300 fps cpui schleep gpuawoken i haveconstant pain i shall recieve 2080ti 70 fps 1080p really hmmif i have 2060 i will have 30 or 20 fps fckn failvidia rtx off 999fps maybe more looks like rtx on 70 100fps dear nvidia i have a question for u r u kidding me like wtf cant wait to buy 13k gpu to run a game from 1997 above 60 fps sponsored by nvidia gpu 98 most of the time should i buy rtx 3080 for quake 3 core2 duo e8400 300ghz gt 730 6gb ram ddr3 can run pubg or fortnite well its amazing how ignorant you people are the fact that this task can be accomplished in the first place is an amazing feat this is true ray tracing as compared to the aaa titles coming that have it which is half assed i only got 15fps using my 1070ti and im very impressed once the tech becomes more widely available and easier to render horror games are going to actually be fucking scary man just add a damn flashlight to the game lol wtf pizdec nahoi blyat 70 fps on rtx in quake 2 this card makes my 2080 look so pathetic my grandmother always hated that huu every time he jumped you totally missed the shotgun at the beginning rtx 2080 is nice this is the quintessence of ray tracing d 7090 fps on game from 1997 xd not worth it thank you nvidia i will keep with my gtx 1080ti hdr is it you thanks for the straightforward gameplay instead of people yapping on and on like a lot of the other videos 1010 just watch the whole video yall r dumbasses amd wins oh srry wrong vid finally a worthy opponents please next time turn on raytracing lol now im waiting for super mario bros rtx i hate germany this game is on index 100070 930 fps missing raytracing2019 80 fps on a game made in 1990 with a graphic card that costs 12k well now we see why raytracing is shit you pay 1200 bucks for what raytracing man nvidia made the worst move in their history why after rtx released they launched some 1600 sries no sales on rtx nvidia should make 2 versions one with rtx and one without and compare the sales like who the heck will give a shit about ray tracing there are 20 of gamers that daily use it and 3 or 4 games that use ray when they released ray 0 games had ray tracing support 1000 plus card no thanks this is pathetic second the best finally in 2019 i can buy a graphics card that will run a 1998 game in 1080p at 70 fps such delight the difference between rtx on and off is so huge its incredible 1000 fps without ray tracing 70 fps with thats a 1400 difference wth lmfao imagine how much fps he wouldve gotten without the 1k cap look at the cpu usage intel wins i originally benchmarked this 3440x1440 ultrawide but really terrible performance i did another video like this 1080p great vid nvidia will do anything to get the overpriced and a failure of a gpu to selllolseriouslyquake2 from the 1990si still have the disc including quake let me know if you would like it nvidia awful performance but it does look good it makes this old game look nicer can you please do a ram test 8 vs 16 vs 24 or 32 thinking of adding 24 i really really hate nvidia right now this rtx trend is becoming embarassing and cringy in my opinion i know 2080ti is 1080p card fuck nvidia msi rtx 2070 armor or asus rog strix advanced what this man ahhahahahah funny video ty nice technology d rtx on or off doesnt matter quake 2 is just bland without the music in game with 1000 vertices max on the screeen impresive 60 fps on 1300 dollar card maybe we need a stand lol pls do ray tracey on reign of fire on game cube looks good can you do the same for yoshis island on nintendo gameboy advanced people are so stupid when it comes to this technology if youre going to bitch about something at least learn what it is that youre bitching about half of you dont even know what rtx is my rtx 2060 could only reach 60fps it was always around 50 55fps how the fuck can this game take so much performance xd vulcan where is the raytracing rtx on fps off rtx off1000fps rtx on 70fpsdown 930fps ray tracing is incredible impressing but for the wrong reasons cool its kind of useless in the open only usefull if you have a box over your head and you poke a hole in it 1200 rtx card cant handle high frame rates with ray tracing this card is shit frames drop to 995 it cant stay on 1000 nice buy this 1500 card to play this shit next time 2 rtx 2080ti to play half life gtx1070 1080p low 12fps15fps lol rip cpu oh wait my phone has just had a software update and it says i have ray tracing rtx support in games now look at cpu its only 1 2 optimization inthis game is shit you have same settings of this with 2070 but worst fps is not normal httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyygzdph4b0y cpu sleeping rtx 2080ti omg this is so hard to run the promos looked better fps in 70s and 80s at 1080p what fps are people getting in 4k what is feel like game on 1000fps its not the graphic card look at how much the cpu usage is only about 25 thats where the bottleneck lies 2080 ti getting 80 fps in 2019 playing a game that is over 20 yrs old definitely the most powerful gpu now make the same test with an entry rtx card d 2700x 2080ti 4k 20fpspretty shit whos nexttetris rtx mario rtx doom card for loot money mega technology and old game is this in 8k or it really have only 8090fps as highend graphic card rtx is malware guys im gonna get a new pc this summer and i wanna stay with my i5 3340 but im gonna by a gtx 1080 ti u think its gonna bottleneck so much no one quake ii devs we have ray tracing now and the game is free now cpu at 1 load what the frick is that even supposed to mean where i download it test 8 games in new windowsmay2019 vs old windows pls crysis 3 too wow this game should be able to run on a nokia 3310 but a 2080ti can only do 70fps oh dear really rtx2080ti avg70fps wtf cool 2060 anyone 30fps i ran this on my 1070 in linux and put the video up on my channel yea its a total slideshownot meant for 10 series cards at all unless you scale it down which at that point your better off just playing the regular version of quake ii with a rtx 2080ti youll get only 90 worse performance with rtx on on a game that is 22 years old yay pleaseee tell us what font youre using for the afterburner overlay it looks great d im getting around 4750 fps on the 2070 is this really the best that nvidia could come up with to advertise these rtx cards hey you can now play a mod for a fucking 20 year old game on our 1000 gpu this is just sad it doesnt even look that great 80 avg fps at top card cpu clearly the bottleneck here but can it run quake thats the question in 2019 finally my 13k grphics card can run a game at 1080p with just above 70fps is this meant to be impressive quake 2 original gameplay httpsyoutubectyykmmlf6e edit i really dont think rtx is all that now tbh how to go from 80 fps to 1000 fps wow but quake ii rtx maxed out the 2080 ti 2070 wont be able to run it where is the shadows its raytracing realy rtx on bottlenecks 1000 fps can this be played without rtx i mean with only the updates weapon and models in opengl edit it can but you dont get the updated models without rtx enabled u need rtx titan oh thanks i forgot i set a timer for this i wanna play it with my 2070 and see the reaction of my father when he see the gameplay he used to play the original one in university back in 1997 cpu is using 2 max thanks for the likes what do u mean free rn just becasue i am bored and have no life amd wins it looks like the sunlight is completely gone i had that too but after i changed some video settings the next day it came back guys which old game you want to see with rtx on is it game remasteroo sorry but i dont see anything impressivei would understand if you call it a remake but rtx medal of honour allied assault quake 3 arena the original doom rtx when lol enemies turn into lumps of meat still makes no sense it may look better now but the latest video games dont need raytracing and still get a photorealistic touch i want a full remaster with the new id tech engine i played this when it first came on back when i brought 2 voodoo fx cards at ultra setting to the max and it just work perfectly smooth and stutter free unlike todays tec and games nothing works right you would think that by now things would improved for the better but thats not the case it seem it got ton worst in performance but better in graphics and bad stuttering in games you dont need to own it on steam gog version works too for the half of the video i was waiting when youre gonna switch to that cool rtx mode i guess the time has really sprinkled some gold on my memories of the original q2 for the half of the video i was waiting when youre gonna switch to that cool rtx mode i guess the time has really sprinkled some gold on my memories of the original q2 can you play this on a thinkpad laptop im running on an intel core i54200u and 4 cpus of 160ghz the original medal of honor series twisted metal and even the tekken series on ps1 would blow my mind also silent hill 1 but then again some games are left untouched hahaha so much nostalgia i had the same spec pc i used to play q1 ctf clan games wow memories imagine half life 1 with rtx on anyone else hear the fly i want to see you do a full video on your first ever pc i want to see them do this to the original tomb raider metal gear or splinter cell half life 1 sadly ive never played quake rtxon this looks the same as opengl q2 max payne with rtx i will throw all my money at that 4 words splinter cell chaos theory rtx on that would be amazing decades you mistake q2 for q3a a filthy pleb that hasnt known the glory of the arena go back to your call of duty yo i would definitely play the fuck out of the true classic battlefield games on pc if there was something that was new but can also play the old games with no issues even though ea cut off support for all the true classics of the bf series at least on single player its still a thrilling experience have you not reviewed minecraft pls do id love to see unreal get the rtx treatment myself hell even ut2003 id die to see get a rework gta 2 and original max pain game splinter cell with rtx plz quake 2 rtx is it not really just quake2xp raytraced a lot of this awesome eyecandy is the result of long in the making mods decade time of labour from dedicated nerds though the lighting is super cool in the ray traced version it is a step up for sure but i would like to see the original game ray traced without the fancy textures added and that shit ass rail gun wtf was that lol ok now i definitley need an rtx and this is without music wich is one of the most important thing in quake ii yeas please on total annihilation if they could sort online multiplayer to star wars bf2 2005 on rtx pleeease black mesa source rt 3 it hurts kill me now comon bfbc2 with raytracing yes please d please do this to bf3 serious sam with raytracing tech sounds awesome too me but gonna have to wait on some improvements for the tech for that to happen really dont care of rtx rather more fps simple lol in 45 fps rtx on super mario 64 i would lose it why does it look like the mozambique when it comes to rts games its interesting to see company of heroes getting rtx upgrade 1000 years from now more like 100 years 22 year old game still can only give a demo half life 2 wth rtx this is the only game nvidia was able to optimise ray tracing on rest is unplayable great now the game looks like you run it with mods worth that much money d nope i still rather stay with mods for now at least interesting i remember quake looking exactly like this the tricks your mind plays on you gta3vcsa with rtx back when cleaning the lint and dirt out of the mouse rollers man the nostalgia i had a pure 3d 3dfx card it was the gateway to voodoo 2 cards i call it now nvidia based rtx like here will die and an open version will take its place why levelcap here is on a 2080ti a 1200 card maybe 2 and gets 1440p 60fps for 1080p 60 fps you would need a 2080 still 800 anything less wont even 1080p 60fps the established standard not enough people to sell the feature not enough devs getting on next gen consoles being all amd so they need a likely open standard one for rtx to take off its very likely to go the way of vr nice gimmick but thats it for the next maybe decade 1080ti turns down to low 30 fps my list would literally be quake 2 and total annihilation gg levelcap great minds think alike d wtf is that game the bullets go so far from reticule the first cod would be cool with rtx how about its dam near 2020 we make new games with fucking awesome graphics im sick of xbox one era it is time total annihilation homeworld 1 2 some whacky racing game like carmageddon or destruction derby or interstate 76 yeah thats what we all wanted lighting effects how about a console thats actually worth the cost fear 1 dead space 1 and dead space 2 should get rtx those games had great lighting to begin with and they would certainty benefit greatly with rtx and would improve their horror atmosphere halflife 2 mario and donkey kong 64 doom 3 half life 2 unreal tournament 2004 i was more in the unreal ut camp back then so im still hoping for a unreal 12 remake and make those nalis cover in fear but when it comes to favorite games i like to see a refurbished battlezone 12 deus ex and freespace they are definetly on the top of my list sly copper and jak and daxter are my childhood game but those are console and may never get ray tracing i think counter strike have ray tracing brings back memories this was the first game i ever played with a true 3d hardware card i believe it was called 3dfx or something like that and cost 250 if i recall good times rtx lego racers i wanna see that hl2 and the portal series would be awesome joe rogan has entered the chat last wolf quake 2 is special to me as well it was my first pc game it was beautiful in open gl march of the stroggs was one of the greatest songs ever put into a video game halo and the first 3 splinter cell games would be cool to see rtx on fps off 6070fps at 1080p using 8700k and rtx 2070 we need thief the dark project with rtx nobody nvidia raytracing for quake 2 i know its impossible with the source 1 engine but i would like to see portal 1 with rtx would love to see this on unreal so glad you mentioned it damn the days i was the shit because of my 100 ping i was going to do a video on this but was so underwhelmed already uninstalled it its a cool tech demo and i loved seeing mirrors in some of the levels but it hurts the original art direction and runs terribly the original star wars battlefront 1 2 272nd like and 53rd comment so early lol awake 0036am theres no way you said the tits with a straight face i would like to see the terminator future shock series get this graphical remaster httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlzlryw4dowa also reviving a bethesda classic is a good refresher after the epic fail of fallout 76 original deus ex with this would be epic it was the when red dead 2 comes to pc it would be incredible with rtx i wanna see this done to the original battlefront 1 and 2 from the original xbox that would look great please correct me if i am wrong but ray tracing for ps5 is not a sound technique for checking if user should hear sound or not i wanna see soldier of fortune or no one lives forever kids cant appreciate this like the old school gamers can 10baset garage lan tconectors and endresistors golden times return to castle wolfenstein including the multiplayer good times gaming on fat tvs and static lol serious sam and max payne halflife 1 expansions return to castle wolfenstien quake i and ii entire doom series all these games with full rtx would be amazing half life 2 medal of honour just for the beach landing in rtx the old elder scrolls games with rtx yessss plzzz finally i was using the path tracing mod as a quick fix and now i can use rtx its always great when professionals bring up the good old days quake doom wolfenstein how many can say they have even played them it can only help bring in a deeper respect and appreciation of these games and how they have evolved from their roots this makes me wanna see halo ce with raytracing i feel like you copy everything jackfrags does uhhh somethings wrong with your settings theres no sunlight lmao what will pc fanboys do when ps5 has rtx thats looking good glad to hear rtx being used by more games jesus it basically shows you just how nonviable it actually is in the top left you can notice that his framerate is 6070 on most likely a 2080ti this is for a game from 1997 rtx is basically just a marketing scam nice video levelcapgaming i look forward to seeing your videos but does it have an m1 garand nope so its similar to bfv wew im early im not sure but something looks wrong with it in terms of brightsness first like and comment on my newest video and i will gift you a sub like and comment on return meh waaay too bright bloomy and blury but it has more colors now then previous brown only joe rogan must be freaking out what is the overlay you use for the gpu info while playing looks slick this guy not a human recompiling a run from someone else is one thing but claiming you ran it is pathetic this is a segmented run from 2016 not yours httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhjklmkgilg0 just try to play berserk mod its a lot better than rtx trash guys this video is targeted by organized hateful kids i am in the middle to punish them for their abusive actions do not pay attention to dislikes it is artificially created by hateful kids or organized users that stalked i on multiple social platforms this video is recorded with real game speed without any speed up with video editing real life in game speed of 30 fps recorded with 4k 30 fps as well without any timedemo or video editor speed ups only boss like moves or swiss watch like moves and jumps precisely calculated everything is precised and i am calling its word record time of quake 2 rtx completion as fast as possible without a single death worlds best time or worlds record because nobody can do better if somebody can do better post video down below and keep in mind that full gameplay video should be displayed without a levels preloaded screens but with loaded in game animation of levels end if i will cut end of level animation then time will be 1735 exact simply the best time of quake ii rtx full game completion in the world thanks for watching why not original time of the day and skybox real speed wow you are the beast man you deserve to have 2 2080ti you are the absolute expert enthusiast i recorded a gameplay video of quake ii rtx the fastest completion of full game in 18 minutes and 5 secondsincluding all the bosses 18 minutes and 5 seconds is the world record show me better on your videos if you are capable do not miss this legendary video and be the first that will watch quake ii rtx video completion of full game in 1805 without any cheats any balance modification any level modification just default game of quake 2 with rtx on nightmare difficulty and all 10 levels completion as fast as possible without dying with classic hard rock music on the background the sprite effects are overkill a cross between falling snow and default particle ue4 effects makes the game look cartoonish not sure why the railgun and the bfg had to be redesigned is quake really that good someone tell me i see the frame drops not long tho we can get there awesome p edt show me this tech in splinter cell chaos theory i bet nvdia wont since the og pc release will look just as good while not struggling to maintain 10fps no offense to nelly but is this seriously suppose to impress me is this how far gaming gfx need to go back in order to deliver these almost next to not even obvious effects that early ray tracing can bring how is it that weve reached a state in gamingtech that back when crysis 1 showed its first screenshots it actually looked and released as an obviously visually advanced title that put everything else to shame for almost a decade yet here we have an nz2500 gpu struggling to play qk2 at 30fps with ray tracing that clearly needs a side by side comparison video to really show the difference no thanks give me bf bad company2bf3 and crysis 1 visuals and destruction 60fps1440p4k over this trash any day why is gaming so god damn self deprecating this is only gaming for surebut considering everything it dayumm i got a similar result using i5 6600k 4ghz 2x16 gb ddr4 3200 mhz and 2080 ti 1935 mhz but playing it at 1440p instantly went over 60 fps omg under 30fps on a 20 year old game on a great system like yours i dont want anything to do with ray tracing its a ridiculous technology to be bringing down hardware like this they are never going to be able to optimise it for mid end users they are the biggest market not everyone can afford systems like ours its bringing them to their knees why not quake 1 too am i the only one that doesnt give a fuck about rtx come on bethesda buy duke nukemcome ondo it wtf not quake iii though graphic are still shit though crap rtx too bright fucker fuck nvidia too bright ray tracing with shitty texture what a combo i am waiting for halflife 1 and 2 bethesda proceeds to sell every past game with rtx on every platform again i purposely watch this in 144p for premium fidelity alright bethesda the joke is getting old where are the aaa titles gone the team that had ambition to make memorable games you dont necessarily have to shoot the blaster when you find yourself in completely dark areas in rtx i think they added an extra weapon that can shoot flare candles its control key should be the 0 if i remember correctly i love you bush more than mussaw ever could i have an erection im a couple of generations behind you equipment wise overclocked 5930k 32gb of 2666 dominator msi 1080ti gaming x trio an asus gtx980 to offload handle physxjust because it can but i do enjoy your cutting edge equipment video demonstrations bang the problem je not from the card looking amazing only if it was at least 60fps still remember when i first played it good old days of hl unreal tournament etc not so tough now are ya did you hear that even the 2080ti is getting a super version announcement on 621 q2 rtx looks awesome and as q2 fan im really impressed i will be able to see one of my favorite fps games in a new light but before i will play it on my pc i need to buy rtx card with hw rt but the thing is next year new generation of consoles will launch and all current turing gpu well maybe besides titan rtx will struggle because of vram with 24 gb ram on xbox scarlett and ps5 probably too games will use well over 10 gb vram so 3080 series will be a must soon in 2012 i have bought a high end pc right before ps4 launch and very soon my pc was vram limited i have learned on my mistake and theres no way i will upgrade my pc before ps5xboxscarlett launch i dont know what to think about that 236 is not even close to what what i have seen on pictures from nvidia looks poorly hey my cpu is downclocking from 4700mhz clock 9900k to like idle you force max power performance nice performance for a guy who cant have played quake more than a time or two before recording it oh and the rtx really glides through this title nicely also no cool music get winamp and load the soundtrack like digital foundry did it loses half its atmosphere with no tunes your cooling amazed me again thanks while playing bfv all ultra i get max 62 celsius but with these settings my gpu reaches 74 and more sad for me 20 year old game modern technology unplayable game 44 frames with a 1200 dollar card i dont know apologies you may hear some distorted sound in this video im using a new capture method and im still working out the kinks oh and 4k is just not possible in this game 20fps lol so im not actually the only crazy person whos playing this game for the first time ever in 2019 good xddd you mention liking this level design that everything connects then you can thank john romero for creating that design philosophy with the first quake and since youre playing this john romero made a game on this same 3d engine called daikatana it would be interesting to hear your unbiased comparisons about level design between that game and this one right here it would be even better if you didnt read anything about the game before playing it besides the infamous legacy of being called one of the worst games ever might attract some viewers to your channel and also dont that reputation at least make you feel a little curious about it hope you play it this year next year whatever ill watch it waiting for rtx titan quake ii with xp mod looks better that this rtx version and i have on gtx1080 with max settings and 4k over 140fps demo file for benchmarking your system that i am using today if you would like to test vs your pc at 16k8k and 4k resolution can be found here httpsmeganzmr10ikky7j5phflqpysqun8xmsf7wt926o3f55bjn64oky4xdk remember that demo file is not a full game or demo game it is just benchmark replay file called demo file that you must have quake ii rtx installed on top of quake 2 demo or quake ii original game extract the archive and copy it in your base2 folder run the game open a console and run command demo benchmark guys dont forget to support with your like and here is my honest thoughts about nvdia rtx technology quake ii rtx mode has dynamic day time feature so sun is emulating the lighting based on your time in your local pc system it could be night morning evening dawn or automatic i was using earth skybox texture because original skybox texture in the game does not work with global illumination so i used nvidia earth like skybox texture that brough that sun emulation pretty well local machine time was 10 am and it feels like 10 am with proper sun position and exposure during my quake ii rtx gameplay lighting global illumination refraction reflection were mathematically correct through path tracing with rtx technology for path tracing accelerations somehow quake ii rtx mode is barely using cpu and cpu was idling almost 99 of the time at 800 mhz at energy saving mode i showed high and low visual presets performance on rtx 2080 ti video card during my quake ii rtx gameplay so my ultrawide monitor same rez 3440x1440 doesnt show the gun any fix thanks for posting this now im 100 convinced that rtx is the biggest scam ever just a waste of computing power on meaningless graphics effect that doesnt even look slightly good 40 fps on 2080ti card for this shitty effect i hope journey is ultrawide i pray it is wtf these frames are trash maybe you should try out that minecraft raytracing mod going back to even before worldcup 1998 and still not able to run it with some lightsaber effects jokes aside it looks pretty good on a rtx card on my gtx 1080 the only way to get 60 fps at 2560x1080 is setting the internal resolution to 50 and disabling the volumetric lighting completely it still looks quite cool but very blurry as well hey whats your cooling solution your gpus temps are extremely low 2 fps per year little tip put a fixed resolution scale of 50 with the resolution set to 4k it will use integer scaling from 1080p and look better than other scaling ratios edit this doesnt use rtxdxr it uses vulkan path tracing and its fully pathtraced like an animated movie apart from the menu and the hud elements there are no effects here everything is ray traced thats why its so heavy you have set reflection depth to 8 which is quite a lot i bet you wont notice difference if you set it to 4 and it wil run a bit faster have you noticed the oneframe drop that happens when switching weapons or just randomly in certain spots definitely annoying and happens regardless of resolution hope it can be fixed i hope this comes to unreal seriously directx 11 is amazing but this will completely revamp unreal back in 320x240 resolution should go i think at 200 fps i can play this with my gtx1080 with rtx render with 30fps at 680x460 d on a 2080 ti and i7 8700k running at 43ghz 2560x1440 it gets 45 fps with rtx settings on high rendered with opengl i get 1000 fps even though my monitor is only 144hz a 955 reduction in performance is absolutely unacceptable in any case adds reflective puddles r t x everyone you are showing this without a fps count only the sunlit areas look impressive most of the indoor stuff is pretty dull looking not a very exciting demonstration of the power of ray tracing only getting 30fps with a 2080ti stop rendering videos at 60fps also put an fps meter this game runs like dog shit on 2080 ti i am getting 22fps reminds me of doom back in the day im sure this wont run on other cards when youve played this game a hundred times at least and it enrages you seeing this person miss all the secrets the fps is really bad it doesnt feel like 60 fps rtx quake arena iii comming soon purchasing a 700usd graphic card for a game that came out more than 20 years ago shakes head its sooo good to remember this but darn its a bit funny my current vga probably will not be able to run this oldie d i only have the 1080 ti but they did activate ray tracing for other cards too so ill get this just to see how it looks im sure my frame rate will be low as its ray tracing through software p and now do some ray tracing for the sound still screams 1997 teamevga approximately how many db is this card in clc on load im curious before i go to other cooling solutions dude ive seen people with 2080tis and 7700ks struggle to run this shit i just watched this in 1080p60 with my gtx770 and 1366x768 monitor help show the fpsthen compare with rtx off and on so lame i get 10fps on gtx 1080 for this amazing effect not to mention that metro exodus ray tracing runs on 4550fps for me how the fuck a game from 22 years ago suffers such low fps just because of rtx nice graphics i wanna see the insane fps sweet im about to download this myself as always for more details please take a look in the video description at 131 i turned on nvidia image sharpening because it was to blurry at the dynamic resolution with the new nvidia driver 44141 they improved the performance of quake 2 rtx 120v which by the way uses software ray tracing however the performance is still bad you cant run this game at max settings at native ultrawide 3440x1440 res you see it at the start of the video i used the native resolution afterwards i changed it to dynamic resolution with that it was playable you are producing my favorite quake 2 content on youtube rtx is a scam most people dont know that path tracing needs ca 10000 rays per pixel and raytracing needs just one per pixel maybe 4 for antialiasing for exsample i can raytrace an image on an i7 intel graphics with 200fps but for pathtracing i get barely 1fps so showing of basic raytracing wasnt an impressive move since global illumination is the real challenge be nice to see this done on the dark forces 2 jedi knight do a video on amd antilag coming from you it would be great and im sure you would get a ton of views for it thank you finally a sensible video about realtime raytracing as much as raytracing is cool in this game they didnt do enough work with making sure that the lighting would fit the tone as well as the original lighting i was underwhelmed by it probably because our brains always remembers old games having better graphics than they actually did i think quake ii rtx is important because many current gamers will have never played any of the quake series and quake 2 was one of the best the rtx version will offer those who never played it way back when to give it a go and appreciate their new tech at the same time this is important because unlike the vast majority of games pumped out by the giant studios of today who care only about profit quake 2 was a labor of love and it shows not everyone will try it or like it or play it for long enough to see it through to the end but for those that do they will have a new or refreshed appreciation of what a quality game should look or feel like vs just another call of dutyfield clone for example the terror you experience when fighting tanks early on without access to heavy weapons the power you feel every time you fire the rail gun missing that crucial railgun shot and dying because you have to get better having to figure things out and not being spoon fed cheap victories like y i love that we are getting to the point that ray tracing is being used in realtime in games but it just wasnt ready for the mainstream yet the performance isnt there when it comes to todays games that are already putting a lot of strain on gpus corners have to be cut and compromises made to make it playable and that puts ray tracing in a poorer light than it deserves the hardware and software should have been developed for another generation or two before it was released to the public pair that with nvidias extortionate pricing of the rtx cards and you get the reaction you see hello battlenonsense i have been following a game that wants to go mmo since 2012 that game is star citizen it was supposed to be an mmo right out of the gate but it has never been able to have more than 50 people at once in the game world without the server crashing and if you put in a large ship youd be lucky to have 10 people in the server without it also crashing i was wondering if you might take a look into this game and give me a much better understanding of what is going wrong here why are they having so much trouble getting this to work i mean the dev team have been working on this game since 2014 in earnest you would have thought by now that they would have solved this problem what the heck is going on here to my laypersons eyes it should have been able to have as many people in a server as you want after like one year of development i just dont understand it the engine that they are using is the lumberyard engine from amazon which someone should do this with one of the updated classic quake engines the people are very cynical for a reason chris the world of youtube is full of lies deception and shilling im still gonna use the ray tracing even if my laptop is shit im still gonna play it my hopes will not go down on quake 2 hoping to see when the atomontage guys inevitably decide to integrate this have you been following their work battle have you seen some of the path tracing mods made for minecraft not a game im very interested in but the showcase of incredible lighting made my jaw drop raypath tracing is the future of realistic lighting in games and i think people underestimate just how important lighting is to the entire experience rtx is garbage it only looks better than 22 yo rasterization paying 1200 to barely play a 22 yo game at 1440p barely playable fps this shit is will never make sense until 510 years from now why you have to justify everything what if you get paid for any video this is your fucking job you deserve to get paid doesnt matter if its patreon youtube or nvidia you do an excellent job so stop justifying in towards assholes in another matter when are you going to talk about bfv terrible stutter and bottlenecking of i7s i5s and other good cpus is it the net code is it the servers what is wrong with this game that only with vsync runs more or less good oh you not only can play it on your smartphone it was even possible to play it since 2003 on early symbian nokia phones and pdas the important part is that nvidia is trying to monopolize the tech with proprietary techniques which is a cancer in development and only hurts the potential adoption of it besides a better application of ray tracing by far and away is ray tracing audiosomething thats both less demanding can be done on almost all modern gpus playably and more important to the actual gameplay audio has lagged behind and actually in many ways regressed over the last decade or so that is what should be targeted not a proprietary halfbaked implementation that you have to spend 1200 on only to run at 1080p which is just offensive a 22 year old game and with path tracing still looks and runs like shit for 2019 standards you can even argue the path tracing made it look worse than the original aesthetic wise no thanks rtx on fps off just to clarify raytracing is not a new technology it has been around since 1980s only the hardware to run it on real time is new people dont realize that rtx cards have rt cores to speed up raytracing or wtf dont have to tell me i know its important ray tracing makes it substantially easier for devs to make beautiful realistic looking games oh and its a great excuse to remaster old games and resell them cant wait interesting since i swear i have used a very very similar tech in programs like cinema 4d for rendering and so on nothing new to me today i just have a quick video for you about path tracing and quake ii rtx which i think is more important than many players realise yes because you realise today that without adjusting the render scale at qhd you can basically only play this at 45 fps with a 2700x 42ghz and a rtx 2080 21ghz basically its important because everyone now realises how much of a shambles rtx is like a year on and dlss was a failure and rtx is for the most part a huge failure that isnt implimented in most of the titles they promised yet just like dlss remember those juicy fps promises using dlss in ark etc ah yeah you do there was a huge graph of a tonne of games where obviously they had dlss running on them already i mean how else could they have benchmark of the gains from it so another nvidia lie because a year later still those games dont have dlss oh and then its played down as one of those things for people struggling to get 60 fps like any gamer wants to s ya no doubt the tech is impressive and will likely be a good foundationlearning tool for future games and developers that said i still look at nvidias 2000 series cards as overpriced early access hardware which has you paying to be a beta tester truly good ray tracing will come from the next generation of cards if not later i guess this shows how much of a coding genius john carmack is that even after so much time his earlier engines are seen as elegant and easy to adjusttest things in unfortunately since hes not involved with the id software anymore bethesdasids latest quake seems to be honoring his legacy with an engine and netcode brought back up by doomguy straight from hell it is in such a horrid state that even the most dedicated fans of the series have sadly stopped playing rtx is absolutely the future and im glad amd and intel are going to adopt it too q2 rtx is deffinitly a big deal because it shows how much it can add to something that is now very primitive more engines are finaly getting more support for it and once gpu power goes up and get more effecient the performance hit goes down if you dont understand how big of a deal rtx actually is then you havent been paying attention its quite litteraly the biggest jump in computer graphics made since the source physics engine nvidia just really dropped the ball on marketing but this is shit is happening why not just take q3 or q4 engine to remake all that they were infinitely better and so much can be added from all the quake mods over the years this was when arena fpss really got their beginning aside from of course duke nukem and shadow warrior then fps shooters got into high gear when quake 3 arena the mother of all fps favorite map the edge favorite mod grappling hook that red lazerbeam kind happy to see you covering this as well schne grue von dem dfteam d the apparent disinterest of realtime path tracing probably resulted from nvidias poor timing and rushing of the tech compounded by consumers expectations of instantaneous gratification unless the visuals are revolutionary greater a loss in fps wont impress it definitely is the future and im looking forward to see what comes out the information starts at 433 i was not paid for this coverage isnt that what all they say the point of advertisement is to convince a consumer thus stating it is a paid promotionadvertisement does the opposite thus everyone say it is not a paid promotion to make it work my point is that the statement is moot more important than you realize is going a little too far at the moment personally all i know for now is that its super demanding for the pc to perform this and i care more about stable 60fps gaming more than anything ill sit out and wait this one until real time raytracing becomes optimized for even lowend pcs that it doesnt affect performance im okay with baked lighting techniques as it is the interesting part of quake rtx is that the original quake 2 came out at a time when gpu acceleration was a new concept it blew cpu rendering out of the water so using a modified quake 2 to showcase raytracing acceleration is only fitting as it is yet another paradigm shift made possible by a new class of accelerators thank you what a breath of fresh air hearing you talking about ray tracingpath tracing positively nvidia released their rtx cards and ever since the whole internet has been hating on a technology thats been around for decades and is truly amazing and has nothing to do with nvidia really i share the same feelings as you do i was a 3dfx voodoo gamer as well back in the 90s and excited for the future of gfx again thanks in part to quake 2 rtx cheers hey there not to criticize you or anything but im really curious about your accent sounds kinda germanish but with a different pronounciation so my guess would be that youre austrian am i correct big fan of quake but cant bhop seems legit first they should make sure that everything runs at at least 60fps then they can focus on 4k or 8k after the somewhat clickbaity title i expected a few deliberate thoughts on why ray tracing is actually important i know too high standards for battlenonsense videos keep up with the amazing work wow the indie uptake of rtx in ue4 and unity is a great point that i hadnt considered hopefully they will flood the market with globally path traced games because i agree that the experience is much better than playing in rasterised environments it is definitely an easy way for indies to compete against aaa studios for market share do people not see something here the textures being low and the lighting being good makes amazing shooter you dont need huge textures just the right lighting quake2 rtx some one said it runs on gtx 10 series and in the comments people was sayin their frame rates but it dont even load on mine i have dual fan 1050ti 150 500 it would of done well i think it runs real cool with these fans and thats better performance dear criss path tracing is great what is the gpu you are using to play 20 year old game at 1080p resolution below 100fps is it 1200 rtx 2080 ti which you play on your smartphone well even mobile games look in the meantime better than this you ever play the paintball2 mod for quake2 can you try testing input lag with radeon chill losing over 950 frames per second is not worth it when so many youtube channels do present advertisements as content being suspicious isnt being cynical its simply paying attention i have been console gaming since the atari 2600 and the intellivision and i now have the xbox one x and i cant wait until the next generation xbox to play 1st and 3rd person shooters at 1080p or 1440p at 120fps on console 4k 60fps would be nice for racing and sports games but i just want a console that has a steady frame rate around 120fps at 1080p which shouldnt be hard to ask in 2020 i know all the pc players will just say go play on pc and i can get over 120fps but i dont like gaming on keyboard mouse and controllers are at a disadvantage on pc playing fps games against km should of used the flare gun to really c the lighting in action too bad youtube turned your video into a blockymess i pity the fool who would even attempt to connect the word shill with battlenonsense im excited about ray tracing ill wait until there are more games and you dont need to pay 500600 to hold 60fps in the most demanding games though rtx prices are ridiculous i think real time ray tracing is absolutely a monumental technological advancement but i feel like currently it seems a bit pointless since weve developed a lot of really good ways to fake the same look while still maintaining great frame rates and the hit to performance just isnt worth the gain right now i love seeing people doing awesome stuff with it hell the minecraft ray tracing shaders look absolutely amazing but i think ill wait a few generations before i pick up a card that can handle it this rtx on made me realize how original quake did not actually looked that bad i love how everyone that actually knows what theyre talking about is like ray tracing has interesting implications for gaming and is the future of computer graphics and all the 1337 pr0 gamers are like ray tracing is garbage is doesnt even look good i just want 144 fps would be cool to see this techonolgy used for some more older games like halo 1 for exempel d in original graphics not the ugly remake which actually just stolen assets from reach and look out of place ray tracing is interesting feature i think the negativity come from nvidiass pricing for rtx cards the 20 series cards offer very little performance benefit for traditional games over the 10 series and in some cases the prices are higher for 2080s than what the prices for 1080tis had fallen to rtx is not great its nvidia trying to lock down a feature and its anti consumer ray tracing on the other hand will be great within 5 years it all depends on how easy it is to implement how much of a performance hit there is and whether it even looks better or simply noticeably better if you can fake these effects with the same amount of effort added and get the same visuals or really close to the same visuals without turning your game into a powerpoint presentation then its not going to be a huge draw for devs or gamers but new implementations of tech are cool and time will tell i am for sure an advocate of more realistic looking games the division 2 needs ur attention ray tracing and diffuse lighting and modern surface rendering techniques are the future of modern remasters and thats a good thing in my book especially as older games platforms and formats become obsolete i embrace q2 rtx and i embrace buying halo ce again in ten years with ray tracing and more realistic materials why not i have a fondness for some games and offering it to me in a much prettier package is an option i bet i would enjoy revisit bf5 netcode please im well aware that quake 2 rtx is completely different but quake 1 dark places looks way more quake style p also youre a shill youre promoting q2pro and didnt even mention r1q2 wtf man p in all seriousness though id love to see someone run wod on quake 2 rtx the cluster grenades and laser mines lighting up the map lol ray tracing is cool and should be great further down the line but rtx isnt actually he hd version looks like phone the regular version actually has good art rtx isnt important at all in any competitive game all the extra lighting and reflections are just distractions i dont think anyone doubts it will be great at some point i think people doubt they should pay 1300 to play tech that isnt ready yet with a weak ass performance gain on the side nvidia is putting a bad taste in peoples mouth for raytracing i dont get the point of this video oh wait there is no point hey chris love your videos can you maybe teach us how to use wire shark to analyse our ping and server refresh rate that way we as a community can collect more datasets on popular games as well as analyse server performance on some niche games that are not worth the effort to make video about would love to hear your thoughts i can not even count the number of hours i spent on q2 ctf i got an isdn connection instead of a regular phoneline to lower my ping on dialup thought i clicked on a df video awesome to see more coverage of this im a big fan of quake my guy yo lets make petition for serious sam remake in ray tracing right on q2 on lan those were indeed the days edge all day every day im glad idtech hit its stride again with doom people will always criticize new technologies remember first smartphones with touchscreens new windows operation systems and now this new ray tracing tech one day itll be such a normal thing that gamers wont imagine games without rt imho gameplay graphics it will take a long time until we see new titles with complete pathtracing whole scene not just shadows or reflections since the amount of needed computing power is just insane raytracingpathtracing is not a new technology so there is a reason why it didnt manage to get a breakthroug in the gaming market yet small example i donwloaded the blender bmw benchmark scene and made the gpubenchfhd with 35 samples just enough to get over the noise in the picture my 980ti took about 2minutes of my precious time to completely render a single frame now imagine how much performance you need to put out a complete frame every 16ms i dont know if blender supports rtx and if it is possible to do this test with an eg 2080ti would be interesting to see how fast these cards can do that but i dare to claim that they wont manage to get into the milisecondsdepartment even with only one sample per pixel it looks horrible btw it takes way lo will q2rtx require an rtx card not really lol you seen the rminecraftay tracing yeah you dont even need a rtx card to run it cause it isnt ray tracing its all screen space and looks a lot better than this shit lol feel bad for you guys buying these overpriced cards that wont even give you over 60fps on a game made 20 years ago do i need a thousand dollar gpu to play that a mixture of rtx and current gen shading is better as we can reduce the overhead of the path tracing by using less sophisticated method incorporating these two perfectly would be better coop with a friend at 1024 x 768 only available if you had 2 x voodoo2 cards those were the days good balanced clear smooth gameplay must always be more important than being immersive and highly detailed battlefield v is the perfect example of where this has gone completely wrong am i the only one who thinks the original quake ii footage looks better than the rtx version i cant put my finger on why the rtx version looks so meh comparably i support ray tracing in games in 15 years not with rtx again with battle nonsense i love your informative explainations of complex topics to help people like us to understand battlenonsense yes you have to make a disclaimer like that if you want to be taken serious as a neutral youtuber you will lose the peoples trust if you dont disclose your allegiance towards a company nvidia is known for their proprietary bullshit and if you want to advertise a game that only runs on their very expensive hardware you will have to disclose your stance on them that is the state of youtube otherwise people will stamp you as a shill gpp has really shown people what nvidia is capable of not to speak of the bullshit gameworks does with amd hardware so as unfortunate as this is for you it is necassary at this point i am just happy that amd produces all of the consoles hardwarethis means that raytracing will get wide spread adoption only when amd implements it into consoles would of been better if they did rtx to quake live or quake champions like always great video i still wonder if you could give a hint on how you made this awesome intro it would be nice if amd implemented the support for directx ray tracing properly for their consumer cards theyre so compute heavy that they might actually be able to run stuff like q2 rtx pretty decently probably like 1080p30 on a vega 56 but im not entirely sure what the holdup is people get cynical about the rtx stuff but its important to remember that this is just nvidias marketing term for dxr which is an open standard any graphics vendor can implement nvidia may be trying to push it due to needing to sell their current rtx cards but theres nothing stopping amd from supporting it 1080p is a good enough resolution for gaming i rather have a higher framerate or better lighting than 4k or even 8k at low framerates really looking forward to rtx30xx series hopefully by then rtx tech has grown beyond its current overpriced paying tester phase but you didnt explain why quake ii rtx is even more important than i think its nice and all but i have to say one thing that i tell everyone rtx doesnt mean anything unless it can be done in an esports title without hitting your frame rate these days graphics do not sell games the way that they used too in the 2000s rtx would have been a show stopper today rtx is just a little gimmick no matter how important it may be because everyone cares about competitive esports gaming put rtx in apex or overwatch and have it hit someones fps by like 2 to 5 fps max and well see a surge in rtx applications until then its not really going to go anywhere tried it with my new pc that has an rtx card looked really nice great to show off an older game like this too quake champions analysis hey chris what about scanline sync feature in rtss u said u will test in future but still u didnt and please can you test radeon chill feature also plz i watch every video of yours big fan 3 i am waiting to see a netcode analysis on mortal kombat 11 since the 10th was trash and some people complain about the new one aswell i tried it on my topoftheline two years ago obviously nonrtx computer and experience was about the same as playing the original q2 on my first computer 15fps well it fpses became better when i dropped the resolution to what i originally used to play on 800x600 but then rtx made no sense anymore cause everything was so pixelated you couldnt tell things apart d hey chris are you planing to analyze the game insurgency sandstorm sometime great video as always the denoiser is actually an ai algorithm that through a neural network selflearning feedback loop managed to get good enough to approximate what it would have looked like with a higher resolution of rays u lads should do minecraft raytracing when its out man do those 2080 tis run hot though rtx on hardcore minecraft shaders i think its too bright with ray tracing on funny thing is that it works exactly opposite from real life instead of stuff refracting etc towards you it calculates it is coming from the character thanks nvidia and ebay didnt kliksphilip do this exact video and how much would a pc cost to run such a thing i wonder do a spherical mirror and put lightstand in it with rtx see what it looks like maybe a psychics engine game has that can you please play this on a stream as amazing as the rtx 2080 is it is still early days for the technology the reason it is quake 2 is because of the strain ray tracing puts on the cores a game like say tomb raider will run like dog shit even on the rtx 2080 ti with ray tracing on there is amazing potential in the future but i wouldnt put that money down for a 2080 ti right now for ray tracing its gonna be a few years before the tech is usable in modern titles especially because nvidia are ass holes that do incremental updates rather than giving out the true potential of their current hardware unless amd brings the fight nvidia will continue to give tiny updates year on year im surprised the yogs can get any type of sponsor with the behind the scenes bullshit ill leave it at that its a fantastic prof of concept just needs a few years of advancement before its time to invest in a card capable trott have you worked on any level design seems like you know your stuff enough sorry lads but not even a hint of criticism about that frame rate hit is why i am disliking this video its not because of the sponsorship i dont like how the player getting hit sound is different from the original game despite the enemies having the same sounds as before anybody know why they did this quake 2 is one of my favourite games of all time this looks amazing and i will def be playing once i get a much better pc yo guys can you please show off ray tracing using the newest minecraft shader it does a way better job than what they did in quake ll its honestly so impressive and you guys should take a look at it especially with a high res texture pack should be fun for us to watch too i hope they get to this as i want to see their genuine reaction to what minecraft has become with these super talented guys making shaders conspiracy the quake engine was used to make halflife 1 which was the basis for source which means source 2 might have raytracing which means halflife 3 will have raytracing i wonder how it would work with crysis 1 to be honest i wonder when tech gets so good that hardware can ai generate a world as you go in life realistic graphics and physics i played the shit out of this and doom ii as a kid i thought the graphics were amazing back in the 90s too haha god quake with rtx is ass the rtx looks like an upgraded texture pack i wonder if it has to do with youtube compression but it doesnt look like its worth the money yet especially with those terribly low frame rates i really like when hats do sponsored hardwaresoftware content as opposed to some other channels ive seen do similar things they seem to actually understand enough of what theyre showing that its more interesting than just a bunch of people going woah at the screen for forty minutes the reason they went with quake 2 was because quake 1 and 2 were some of the best games of the modern age people really need to realise that nvidia didnt invent ray tracing and path tracing i noticed a drop in frames trott really shines in this video its wanked all over the frame rate hasnt it the immediate drop in frame rate is certainly wonderful on the eyes imagine 4k with full ray tracing trott says while playing a 1997 game at 1080p at around 30fps itll be a while p geez if the frames drop that much on a 20 year old game i think ill pass woah i thought i was clicking on a digital foundry video i am both glad and disappointed its you guys cool ad but i already have a 2080ti sli wheres the oxygen not included video sorry i dont have a pc god i wish i did cant afford one the steam version is straight up the windows 95 quake ii client so everything youre seeing for the steam version is 1997 era cuttingedge hardware accelerated 3d graphics you guys presented this really nicely didnt suck off the company at all and gave us the facts without making it boring good stuff im looking forward to a vr driving game that uses raytracing for reflections in rearview mirrors and windows it really matters in vr because your head can move so reflections are subject to motion parallax of course by the time they have realistic mirrors in racing games all the real world cars will have replaced the review mirrors with flat screens misleading its not just raytracing involved here theres higher resolution textures and importantly normal mapping which both improve the quality of the render significantly raytracing actually did very little work besides dip your fps love that fps drop my laptop imploded just from this video i think i understand at least at a very basic level i might actually go watch that video haha also awww yeeee get dem sponsors laaaads hahaha i have to be completely honest i didnt think this was a hat films video based on the thumbnail thankfully i dinged the bell and it popped up in my notifications playing quake ii on medium lol lets not address that huge fps drop right wow youtube compression shat itself majorly when trot went full particle ray mode f ye its cool but not 12k cool why are a lot of the textures different rtx isnt a game changer for me lighting can not justify the thousand dollars it costs to get a card that uses it id rather have graphical fidelity than a fancy lighting or physics system i am now more fan of nvidia thanks to this sponsorship and hatfilms i have both versions i can agree it makes a huge difference it definitely does improve the visuals and lighting no doubt but there is something to be said about the classic baked in lighting in these classic games that adds to the nostalgia factor both are good options lets see more rtx in modern titles also all this quake reminded me to say you guys should try playing brutal doom its the multiplayer mod for the original doom 1 2 but also many custom maps and insane difficulties with some taunt mechanics as well would be awesome to see how you do one more time with feeling this time make me care about whatever the hell you were droning on about when i played quake 2 back in the day i didnt have a mouse and had to use pgup and pgdwn i doubt i can play somethin like call of duty with just the keyboard nowadays tho i want a 5 hour video of trott just gushing about ray tracing genuinely educational had no idea what the difference was also you lads should play some no mans sky vr when the update drops on the 14th rtx just isnt mature enough yet to be worth the upgrade from anything newer than a gtx 980 ill be waiting for better performance and fidelity before i invest is it just me or does the fps take a hit when rtx is enabled im dissatisfied with my rtx talk about a fuckin meme i love q2 wouldnt mind you boiks modding it getting skins and playing the deathmatch like ttt but for streaming quake 2 was my childhood game now ive grown up to play other arena shooters like quake live unreal tournament xonotic reflex arena diabotical toxikk warsow etc some of the most hardcore shooters out there if youre looking for a challenge i dont think quake 2 is worth the price of a 2080 lol ill wait until they release current gen games using the tech then decide if its worth it right now 1080 is good enough if i am honest im happy with current lighting and shadows if this becomes a requirement in future its pure greed thats driving it the real question is why didnt they remaster quake 3 just remember that even when we can render a scene using realtime raytracing theres still a huge limit to how many objects can be loaded into memory games usually use a method called occlusion culling to only keep in memory the objects directly in front of the player you cant see anything behind your character so theres no point in keeping information about it in your computers ram which frees the ram for other important data like high res textures highpoly objects data for npcs etc with raytracing you cant use occlusion culling because youd be skipping a huge part of light sources and objects occluding light around you which would make the scenes look unrealistic this means two things one that cpus and ram need to become faster to better support realtime raytracing two level designers need to relearn how to create levels because they will no longer be able to create vast open spaces with dozens of miles of draw distance thats a part of why the while i do think that rtx isnt great at the moment particulary from a framerate and crispness point of view mainly because the technology is still in the fairly early days i must say that just from a technical point of view it is really very impressive and i can see how next gen games are all going to be using ray tracing and trott actually did a really good job explaining it all even to someone like me its a great showcase of the potential as staged as this was but the fact this is a modified version of the game with this enabled is a bit pointless if it was capable of passively doing this to old games etc then it would be super impressive i loved the mods for q2 like slow rockets that shot out lightning beams or the hopping cluster grenades when you upload more ads than turps the reason they went with quake 2 was because this is how far back they had to go to get a game that could be rendered 100 through ray tracing its a shame it requires a 12k investment for a 2080 ti to get a moderately good experience if the 2070 super was in the 350400 range instead of 500 i would have picked it up until then ill wait for the mesa drivers to mature on linux and see how the markets lay in the future so no wonder my computer couldnt run the rtx edit very informative video to me it looks like quake ii turned into serious sam cool demo bois good job making it not boring did ross call smith a chunky boy at one point that must be a fuckton of processing power to render reflections in realtime this is some nextlevel shit too bad ill never have the money for the equipment to run it very interesting to watch though is it weird that i prefer it off it does look incredible rtx off looks so much better thank you for taking the hit so i know not to upgrade rtx is nice but i dont think i ever use it in gameplay i mostly use it for screenshots at the moment it is very early in development and there is so many artifacts dodgy looking materials and just straight up broken lighting in parts of games most noteably in bfv tomb raider and metro are the games ive tested my rtx 2020 ti with i say in maybe 2 years it will be worth getting for average play yep can see the difference because of lower fps why arent you guys playing co op smith is moving way too much even when the npcs are on cooldown from shooting he is strafing back and forth and missing his shots while the npc is standing there doing nothing dat potato aim tho ripping my dick off now were getting to the point in graphical fidelity where lighting can make or break something when crossing the uncanny valley and raytracing is a giant step towards photorealism in realtime rendering really exciting technology i always love the hat boys playing an fps because i can spend the whole video watching ross move his head about as he shoots i mean rtx looks nice but there are not enough games that utilize this in a meaningful way for me to justify upgrading to a 2080 from my 1080 ti last time i was this early my girlfriend dumped me fov too low 010 i never left for pornhub so quick i had already seen this from their newsletter path tracing up trotts anal cavity please bunch of sponces how many voodoo cards do i need in sli to play this with my voodoo 3 it looked the same now add raytracing to tetris just point me to the team deathmatch part of this legend of a game rtx cs 16 when nearly no difference to glide love this thing why do they put an old game like this on a rtx card when a laptop from best buy could run this does rtx 2080 super go with rainbow six siege rtxon rtxon the textures are certainly a drawback from advanced lightingminecraft works so much better on that rtxon raytracing and still no muzzle flashes they id dropped cause they used models and didnt like them very much i was surprised at how poorly this ran still pretty cool though this looks freaking insane bring rtx to diablo 2 will anybody kindly help me with only 1 million us dollars please will anybody kindly help me with only 1 million us dollars please will anybody kindly help me with only 1 million us dollars please will anybody kindly help me with only 1 million us dollars please will anybody kindly help me with only 1 million us dollars please will anybody kindly help me with only 1 million us dollars please will anybody kindly help me with only 1 million us dollars please raytracing is not just makeup for games it is an upgrade 100 need this rtxon e32019 looks like a good game its crazy how much better it looks edit with the raytraced lighting rtxon wow the lighting made it look reworked absolutely beautiful why did the tomato turn red because it saw the salad dressing nvidia even helps old remastered games with their rtx how generous rtxon e32019 never play quake before see this probably make me wanna try it d i wish i could play this with my gtx 970 card it is clear how much lighting can do for the realism of a game rtx on doubt id win but it never hurts to try rtxon e32019 geforce game on i already downloaded this game in my rtx asus rog strix ii and is amazing this looks cool rtxon e32019 real time ray tracing for gta san andreas digital foundry did some great coverage of this when is raytracing minesweeper who needs textures if you got rtx great lighting is this a alpha version spiderman web of shadows rtx this is awesome cant wait to replay my childhood game yes i said childhood rtxon rtxon every oldheads fav game seeing old textures and enhanced reflections feels too odd for me great to see remasters with rtx e32019 rtxon remake beast rtxon e32019 one day i hope well see halflife 2 with rtx what a huge difference and it also looks pretty good even with the old textures change of the genre it look beautiful in rtxon e32019 cant wait rtxon e32019 its amazing what difference lighting can make this game is older than me ohhhhh myyyy the game that couldnt be improved just got improved with rtx on wish i could play this would love a new gpu rtxon e32019 i want rtxon well my gtx 980 cant run this time to upgrade d i love the style of this game but i wonder if no ray tracing makes too much of a difference this looks fun makes me wanna play doom eternal even more though rtxon e32019 ahhh memories e32019 rtxon the denoising is amazing such an iconic game all gameplay no fluff not something youd expect to see but not complaining never got into quake before great new looks of an amazing game enjoyed e3 need upgrade rtxon e32019 yey remember that game wow that takes me back that would be fun to do the best game of all the times and now with those rtx graphic it looks super nice nice with rtxon ok this looks unreal pun not intended but also yeah kinda intended dont me dawg rtxon e32019 fascinating rtxon e32019 holy shrap you know how some say to stop and smell the roseswell now i stop and see the tracings the ray tracings fps must be good with these textures and rtx on rtxon e32019 i really tried but its a little tough to get excited about this one excited to see modern warfare with raytracing rtxon e32019 ive actually never tried this game i bet it would be fun look at that fire shoot up it looks amazing e32019 rtxon just a spectacle to see hell yeah quake with realistic graphic rtxon how old is this again always love refreshes of old games e32019 rtxon ive gtx 970 hopefully 2070 will be next seeing this game looking this nice after playing it all the time as a child really makes me nostalgia trip so hard d very neat very nice really cool to see an older popular game brought back to life with modern techniques like realtime ray tracing fantastic rtxon e32019 gonna buy 1 rtx 2070 when ill have enough money i want to play this like in the old times in the school and maybe play some csgo 16 rtx it would be funny rtxon e32019 bet i couldnt even run this haha theres so many types of weapon in this game that i enjoyed it playing alone in lobby lol rtxon quakeiirtx quake perfect e32019 rtxon geforce looks like a weird minecraft texture pack oh yea rtxon quake 2 iwas about 5 yrs old when i played the first quake haha rtxon e32019 geforce show me some ray tracing time to test out my rtx 2080 id be interested in seeing a lot more old school games implement rtx the game of my heart and youth now looks amazing with nvidia geforce rtx rtxon raytracemyheart nice it is a remake but i hope that this will ne so legendary like the original interesting this is awesome quake iii please brings nostalgia good times man good times rtx original doom anyone still lookin good after all this years i mean this one aged pretty well the texture is on point with all of the blocks minecraft 20 i still have my quake cds somewhere just a great game and with rtxon it looks amazing e32019 i want quake 2 so bad rtxon e32019 this looks so good i would love to replay q2 with the new effects almost like a new game rtxon e32019 e3 2019 has been great so far looking forward to something super god bless lighting looks great run 4 fps with my gtx 1060 with rtx on i need a new rtx graphic card a good reason to replay this amaizing game thanks nvidia love your product keep it up rtxon e32019 welp needless to say im redownloading quake ii rtx e32019 rtxon geforce oh my god i am so hyped for this year in gaming and this awesome giveaway rtxon e32019 geforce let me win for onceeee dear god rtxon i was shocked that this games 22 years old he look so mad with rtx cool rtxon one of the better quake entries imho new raytracing looks incredible a new rtx card would really help me appreciate this game all over again is this only possible with 2000 series cards rtx all the games do oregon trail next 017 well it better be the best looking quake 2 i wanna play quake 2 with nvidia rtxon e32019 cant wait to see what the new call of duty modern warfare looks like with a rtx 2070 rtxon e32019 nice e32019 with rtxon looks good e32019 rtxon geforce dang havent heard anything about quake in forever i forgot about this game rtxon e32019 dang havent heard anything about quake in forever i forgot about this game rtxon e32019 dang havent heard anything about quake in forever i forgot about this game rtxon e32019 dang havent heard anything about quake in forever i forgot about this game rtxon e32019 more love for unreal engine me likes it very much this comment is raytraced with rtx really nice to see the improvement and dedication to the rtx franchise 3 please i need rtx in my life e32019rtxon this truly is a masterpiece and id love to see more rtxon e32019 looks really fun shooter awww no it has ray tracing guess i cant use that at all lol for some reason this brought me back to the original goldeneye 007 imagine that with rtxon rtx on mario now thats gonna be gold rtx card watch dogs is e32019 rtxon another quake means another good fps its crazy how much you can change the look of an old game like this in it to win it that rtxon power rtxon halflife next please the potential to be had with rtx is just too tantalising brings back the memories d bring back hexen can only get 10 fps with older gtx 1080 i want a rtx rtxon e32019 hoping that one day i will experience the quake with rtxon e32019 shut up and take my money yes please before im satisfisfied with its graphics but now it will be more satisfying to play i remember going to my friends house in 1997 and he had quake 2 and he was trying to get me to play it and i just didnt know what i was even looking at lol it was just a bunch of blurry dots and i didnt know what first person was more old games should adopt ray tracing makes them look much better and frame rates should be good go rtx go rtxon e32019 geforce so this is like adding icecream to eat cake but the cake doesnt have any taste at all welcome back childhood lots of time spent on the original rtxon e32019 older video games getting a new life after 20 years damn what a time to be alive everything rtx this game looks very graphic intensive lul amazing to see how a new technology can give a second live to such a classic rtxon e32019 i know somebody in my family would love to see this well not my favourite game this looks gorgeous it shouldnt look this good nice rtxon e32019 lucky shot e32019 rtxon lighting makes a big difference to a game never really played quake but looks fun nice rtxongeforcee32019 1010 rtxon e32019 wow the realism its awesome this makes it feel like a new modern game again this is amazing great job have loved quake since its inception and cannot wait to get my hands on the latest it looks like as if it made just for gtx better get that gtx to be able to try it out i am totally amazed by what raytracing kann do rtxon e32019 can someone give me an etc card to know why such an old game needs this next rtx pong quake brings back memories from school for sure could be better with some new textures cant wait to give this a go later throwback tuesday great game i played years of this in the 972xxxs nothing the attracts me to this game rtxon e32019 levels in this game i have memories look this corner i was waiting and hidden moonsters this videos is great and this game looks amazing rtxon e3 heck yeah quake 2 baby e3 is going to do best release e32019 rtxgaming gamingislife sure would be nice to win a card to play this on my medical bills means im not upgrading for a while geforce rtx3 e32019 rtxon maybe mario in rtx next nice one sir lol remake the whole game now a new laptop whould be my dream because im gaming on a laptop thats runs roblox ar 29 40 fps and is at worst graffix quality any thing new would be my dream just the laptop i want to play this now i subscribed nvidia giveaway thats my dog this is a first for me this is really cool e3 this year is ganna kick some booty e32019 rtxon geforce thanks for the giveaway love your products need a new gpu computer crapped out i need it amazing pictures and reflections gj rtxon e32019 i remember playing quake ii on the first pc i bought myself in 2000 i was playing in 1600x1200 with my athlon 600mhz and geforce ddr 32mb that was quite spectacular at the time this is something else i actually grew up playing quake 3 on the dreamcast so seeing this series return is enriching beyond words very cool the harlem quake shake and quake easy quake oven e32019 rtxon looking forward to play quake ii hopefully with rtx rtxon e32019 interested to try out raytracing 2x 1070 ti slid run at about 27fps honestly it looks like a brand new game in alpha stage o so excited to see more raytracing at e32019 rtxon is the future hope i will be selected d damn that is so cool to see an oldschool game like this one getting a nice graphics update wish you would turn rtxon more game classic well done nvidia any laptops with thatsend me one looking slick lets relive the old quake days this is e3 coverage hope everyone is okay with the power outage phone bout to die waiting for pow get me an rtx card please i really wanna play this game pc master race i am so ready for this cant wait number of comments 11k rtxon e3 e32019 cool vid thanks for sharing rtxon e32019 i remember playing this game on my pentium 4 geforce 2 now i playing with my ryzen 3 2200g gtx 1050ti still this game so best 3d game on his

e3 brings us here we are in 2019 and quake 2 is relevant again the nostalgia is hitting hard ill have to see how this 2k60 ray tracing compares to 4k60 regular which can be done on preray tracing gpus doom 3 had some dynamic lighting though due to the lack of ray tracing gpus at the time only so much could be done the furture is now played so much quake back in the day amazing one of my favorite franchise i wonder if in ultra graphic the blood spill on your face too so crazy seeing it go from old school to new school 3 point pew pew pew rtx does some crazy stuff hands on my favourite hardware why not quake 1 too quake ii with rtx why the hell do you improve the graphics of a 20 year old game gtasa with rtx oh shit look how a 15 year old game is so beautiful with rtx cant wait for the release of this wow its just amazing how such an old game can look so magnificent lets see crisis with rtx lets see crisis with rtx now this is amazing is this an e3 vid when old school games get rtx upgrades full of lighting experience 0 happy winner for rtxon giveaway sweepstakes its like the remastered version of the old game old game with no textures but 1010 lighting darn that is impressive cant wait to try it out rtxon raytracedbut 3d modelling is still rather basic cant wait to play it looks really good cant believe this is a 22 years old game cool beans ohhh man that looks awesome i can hear my fans now 22 years has passed far to quick when i played this on my then new nvidia riva 128 i was 31 years old at that time wonder how many fps that would do in raytraced quake 2 game is on rtxon game is on rtxon lightning for the win this look amazing it would be really nice to play this game with a scar 3 i am looking forward to e32019 with nvidia rtxon geforce this looks amazing well this can support my pc 3 looks interesting dk if ill play it though good resolution is this free game or i need to buy it from gog steam etc not a fan of quake show me some mortal kombat 11 thats exactly how i remember quake ii thanks rtx for ruining my memories im ready for a giveaway woot woot rtx on greetings from finland now for only quake 1 with ray tracing why am i fangirling about 1997 game oh because its made by the same team that made doom and wolfenstein and during the time games were still made to be great not to make profit it was fun playing with the quake 2 with a graphics card and a sound card it is newly revival or surprise thats some next gen graphic style this is good tear card right here quake ii looks pretty cool like this lol the glorious gibs i cant see playing this in 2019 wowmemories thats so lit this is insane the game looks like they have applied a lightning mod in the previous quake and are selling it as a new game old school new school well yeah thats a game with ray tracing remember buying the original quake back in 1996 and subsequently getting hooked on the series the soundtrack was awesome as well with trent reznor and the nine inch nails ill have to buy this and add it to my collection cant wait for this game on rtx exclusively on pc yea friends we have lived to this point ray tracing makes it very nice broo ok but why quake ii quake iii arena and the original quake were way more popular and better than quake ii considering how old this game is not to shabby rtx everything rtxon it is a great showcase of raytracing a fps game has to be responsive so with fully raytraced frames it is impressive rtx on to record 60fps demo used 2x2080ti only for 2500 come and try new technologies in 1997 game 1080p 60 on an rtx 2070 they werent lying although flares can make it go down to the 50s rtxon the real deal of this decade quake 3 and quake 4 rtx soon raytracing my a this is really low for so called raytracing just a bit better shader raytracing my a this is really low for so called raytracing just a bit better shader never got to play the first one hope i can play this one someday pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti given this ran on my p233 with 32meg of ram on a 2gb hdd with a 8mb in 640x480 amazed gabe didnt ask for halflife to have the same treatment unreal might be too much for this rtx stuff as unreal engine was always a looker over id tech back then so many old games can be re done in the q2 era however a rtx soldier of fortune is gonna be too demanding or a rtx counter strike or sin its a tech achievement yes is it fair on the people paid the price of a 2080ti no as they gonna get mugged by the q2 community that will blow the dust off their windows 98se machines from the attic just to enjoy a spot of rtx hunting rtxon rtxon wow makes me want to get rtx to play this again people even play this wow it become overwhelmingly great i played quake ii when it came cant wait to play it again im in love with quake so itll be one of the first title to try out when i can get my hands on a new rtx card i like when old games get remastered it gives me a chance to have some nostalgic gameplay and an opportunity to introduce new players to the game wtf nvidia playing a 1997 game just because it now has raytracing nobody cares about raytracing or even a 22 yo game jesus i see this as an absolute win 22 year old and comes with ray tracing thats amazing rtx gives you whole new experience so cool now this is epic rtxon e32019 i miss the old days of gaming its just not the same anymore downloading now looks awesome now these are very smooth ray tracing is awesome i really want one someday rtxon thats cool these graphics looks incredible dont waste your time with this theres already a hd graphics modengine called berserker which looks so much better cant believe this game is more than 20 years old now i remember playing it with the siblings on playstation yeah couch multiplayer was really something back then this was the first fps i saw someone using keyboard and mouse it blew my mind when i was a young teen where how my childhood me i cant read the board at school mom i think you need glasses me wait i had rtx off this whole time me turns on rtx me woah brpthers i have seen some other other videos for this lol it looks awkward having like a 500 tri polygon with real time lighting and reflections but i still think it is fun watching old games get revamped what next mario rtx interesting fucking useless and overly expensive everyone i need a gpu to render this so cool seeing old games adapt rtxon after this i would like to see halo combat evolved with rtx makeover damn this was one of my favorite games back on the n64 the hyperblaster was so much fun this is exactly why i want one of these cards lol love playing quake back then what i would love more is getting my hands on one of those beafy rtx 2080 ti the changes mind blown need a rtx gpu now interesting piece of work you put into a game that is still to this day popular great job this looks awsome indeed future has come this looks superalot more slick than it usually looked rtxon baby e32019 kinda interested maybe ill check it out old school is back

awesome just need an rtx card now cant wait for wolfenstein 3d rtx me trying to run far cry 3 on lowest setting cool i will literally buy a rtx card for doom 3 i am a new geforce streaming streamer it will be awesome to win razor blade 15 advanced or any laptop in the need to become a legend rtxon ive actually never played quake ii or any of the later quakes but the graphics improvements definitely look nice looks really fun talk about bringing games back from the dead p now we can see it in a whole new light enddadjoke shouldve included ai remastered textures and a dynamic flash light and higher quality audio because the default was ear rape in headphones designed for pc speakers of the time doom 3 non bfg edition next please nice thanks for this rtxon ahh i wanna play it dont have rtx c 32 fps with nvlink 2080 ti 19 with only one card 4k q1 and q2 will always have a special place in my heart i spent a lot of time playing both growing up anyone remember mplayer shitvidia can suck my warty chode im gonna bareback ass fuck evil huang idk why but i got scared a lil when i first played quake ii as a kid but i still played it back then this looks fantastic cant wait to try it myself nice i like this thanks sucks have rtx but cant play cuz everything newer than 419 bluescreens nice game looks so hard to run rtxon what next doom with rtx cant believe that i paid 600 bucks for an rtx 2070 that cant ray trace cant do 4k 60 fps when all i had to do was wait till november to pick up a stadia for 130 bucks 80 fps dxr instead of 999 on ogl this actually looks insane remember good

that looks neat looks so beautiful that it aint scary anymore bring it to csgo wow the memories it reminds me when i bought new pc master race gaming pc with best graphics card 16 gb of ram etc few years ago and then for about 2 years the only games i played on it was original doom doom2 quake2 and few other 90ties games yeeesss new technology is sooo cool memories coming back hopefully the trend goes on for several other old games so they get remastered looking gorgeous with rtx quake 1 rtx please rtx 2060 4head why cant we play this with the soundtrack why who cares they shouldve resurrected kingpin havent imagined that such an old game can look like this this is the best quake 2 has ever looked well the game is more than 20 years old so i would certainly hope so i could go for a new quake game seeing this makes me miss rocket arena and urban terror the retro remastered quake2 rtxon geforce e32019 does ray tracing with new amd cards and nvidia so liitttt ray tracing but i need that graphics card msn gaming zone flashbacks can i get a sysop rtx is on it looks just ordinary to me i mean whats the point of all this unless you can really spot the difference or it really makes the scene look alive runs extremely stuttery on my rtx 2060 even with 60 fps and above welcome back i wish more older games would be remastered using this technology this looks just like how i remember it what gives why why focuses on modern games goddman it now cs source i would try this this is pretty cool does it even run on a 1070 anyone tried make more rtx games please oeh let me get some of that pleas the ray trace in the quake 2 nailed by rtx series is making it more better in the players graphical interface well played nvidia quake and unreal tournamentchildhood woah raytracing love it i love to play this game in rtx if i win someone we cant use rtx technology in any new game nvidia quake who will play it on 2019 rtx owners for a free hopefully cant wait to play it here in in germany wait rtx old game somewhat new game its good enough omg i played this in elementary back in the day of course not with these graphics rtxon cool cant even run the game thats brings back really good memories thanks for this good luck rtxon this game was made before i was born but what it looks after the ray tracing tweaks is epic 3 thats pretty amazing i remember playing this game at my friend a long time ago and i loved it ea bad the e3 ruiners the trailer is lying no music ingame pepehands please allow us to import the music from the original game as you did with the maps i quite like how mixing an older game with new tech has turned out think it looks great tom and the boys love quake but can only play original coz pc is old and senile gtx680 has no ray tracey pls make the boys happy with god ray tracing and smooth performance pls we have exams at uni and need to escape with ray tracey pls we love quake and sims 2 when ur pc is 5 yrs old ands its soo old because you cant afford a new one oh thank you nvidia the game is free and sweet 5fps on my gtx 1060 this game looks classic and the graphics aint that bad maybe they used rtx card on this ultra graphics fair enough is doom next so ray tracing rtx nvidia gpus can run only on game thats 20 years ago impressive it looks sick for sure id love to win one of these rigs watch the trailer and visit their site to check the price me cries in the corner 19fps ftw hey just wondering is this e3 that recaptured the magic of quake a job well done they really must have a hard time selling rtx cards wheres quake 1 rtx my god its its beautiful now i just have to wait 20 years for my current game set to get raytracing what a way to see how rtx can make even the oldest game titles have a brand new refreshing look 3 dem bounced lights the arena fps genre strikes again looks amazing even while being that old its still rocks throwback yess the game has finally been released now ill just wait till they make a new rtx graphics card giveaway love to see the future of rtx this looks great the difference in lighting with rtx is amazing this is the best quake 2 has ever looked no fucking shit great way to showcase the old and the new i would love to try the demo with rtx i love this game can you imagine playing this on the bfg setup that would be sick woot woot the word overkill doesnt come to mind s praise nvidia the inventor of the gpu a highperformance processor which generates breathtaking interactive graphics on workstations personal computers game consoles and mobile devices 3 i love you guys thanks nvidia wow that looks good to bad that the rtx cards cost an arm and a leg rtx all the things never played quake but id love to try it on stream this is soooo sick going to have to speedrun this again i love this additions of rtx to quake it makes for a nice contrast between the old gen graphics with a touch of some of the best aesthetics we have today its not like you can recreate that without rtx and it works on basically any system raytracing with crappy textures cant wait i was sitting on steam refreshing the store page for this until it finally released hey nvidia how about releasing more of these rtx mods the idea of being able to play more classic pc games with rtx effects sounds very appealing seriously id pay for this man this lightning is dope but it should be added into new games im excited to see ray tracing hands on loved playing the demo at 640x480 resolution with my gtx 1080 interesting rays of light one of my top five games ever plus probably the best soundtrack outside of doom 2016 in my opinion of course a classic time killer now with ray tracing sweet been so long since ive played it new quake its fine ray tracing looks amazing but i cannot get exited about 20 year old game when we get descent performance on fully ray traced game on reasonable priced hardware hardware ill be on it till then ill just play non ray traced quake and ill still love it httpsyoutubem8biopcsmsu nvidias corporation with a multibilliondollar budget and a multibillionstate staff was not able with the help of a money milking device in the form of ray tracing what made one at like and better im suddenly wanting to see cs 16 given the rtx treatment i need rtx in my life that steam logo at the end made me happy i7 8600k oc 48ghz 16gb ram 3200mhz rtx 2060 ssd 35 50 fps my spec is too low rtx off 1000 1200 fps sick game and the ost is still the best music of the history in videogames this looks incredible cant wait to play it oh shoot here we go again i want crysis remastered with ray tracing implementation how much super excited to see ray tracing support extend to older games bfv and sottr didnt convince me but now i need an rtx card gameplaygraphics i like it so many hours of my life playing q2 multiplayer sli 3dfx cards sitting on a shelf at work if they make gta san andreas remaster with latest technology it would be awesome so many memories im quaking in my boots whats that a million other people you say same exact pun least original statement ever oh it is an very interesting game thrilling game wish i could play this with ray tracing on metal music and gunshots turned down the volume edit watched the video im glad they removed that ridiculous sunny blue sky yes i cant wait to get my pc so i can play this i would really like to play on a pc whit rtx honestly looks better than triple a games today this game is free in steam i have played quake 1 waiting to see this on rtx which ill win never played quake back in the day not into fps looks good though i never played quake and im hyped woah cant believe quake looks this good i finally get this i thought quake ii was a new game and i was like bruh why rt when the game looks so shit i mean old i did not know that its just a rework i am not from that generation just missed the gameboy and started with the nintendo ds lite to make clear to what generation of gamers i belong rtx on rocks that quote from pc invasion this remaster of a game from 22 years ago with todays technology is the best its ever looked in other shocking news nvidias logo is green ray tracing makes everything better excited for this lighting looks great hello nvidia i really wishi can win a new rtx 2080ti and finally i can play and stream my games on full graphic love you all greens rtxon e32019 well played nvidia well played rtxon e32019 everything the light touches but whats beyond that you must never go there justthebeginning let the days of lan parties return rtx game on in my opinion i found this really useless when having it with a bundled exclusive rtx on my rig mods might always do than to that aint lying cause even though quake ii returns it still runs the same with lameass textures with some good damn graphical quality they might better off making a remake but thats just not the case since the popularity of making remakes except still no proper muzzle flash or tracers very confused why because theyre lighting elements got to get this game for just the lightning sexierthesecondtime however the first one was iconic as all get out cant deny that im so excited for this good old days remember playing in cafes absolutely stunning how the lights add another dimension to gameplay i was too little to play this game back then too much violence ahahaha tfw your hardwares killer app was released over twenty years ago giveaway this should be called rtxquake ii bring the painrtxon literally played this game for the sick soundtrack gets me so pumped every time my buddy is freaking excited for this game now halflife rtx rtx come and complete our dreams rtxon gimmie some more of this rtx goodness trace those rays hopefully its not too hard to run i remember playing quake ii and then getting my voodoo 3 and i was amazed how great it looked the best game is back with awesome ray tracingbut i dont have rtxlol needs better textures i need a pc now what would r6 siege look like in ray tracing rtxon now do rtx on halflife 2 love seeing older games being played with new technology i cant wait to play mine craft at 4k with shaders and rtx on rtxon hello again my old friend so ridiculous whats the point cant wait for e3 that score at the very start of the trailer was that dark piano short from half life is this the only game that includes all three of the ray tracing features nowrun dark souls on max graphics 4k ultra shadows ultra textures quake on rtx that sounds like a window for even more classic games being touched up with rtx sweet so is this the only game a 2080 ti can handle all those realtime stuff smh unreal tournament with rtx omg i need to replay quake i havent played it since i was maybe 8 now do it for skyrim holy shoot 25 year old game now looks like a 15 year old game id love to win a prize oooof wish i had a rtx card for this gotta love moders on pc lets place our bets on how fast ill be downloading this man we need a new quake like this enough of quake arenas id software is a bit of valve at this one remaking quake 2 with quake 2 rtx is like remaking halflife with halflife source but in rtx add more water im wondering if rocket jump ninja going to play it or not sick i cant find anything bad about it i get only 10 fps on quake 2weird huh the memories here there not a giveaway quake was really fun bring back some old memories god im old lol do heretic next why not quake 3 i like it ray tracking seems fun i havent played it myself yet but it looks really fun omg im so excited about this but i still dont have rtx free stuff polz its good raytrace thats possible i love this hope i get a new computers didnt know quake could look so good its free on steam cant wait to play this again why no link in the description god this game looks good rtxon awesome and hilarious that quake 2 is returningit dies look amazing though wow this game came out in 1997 and they wanna support it looks amazing think im going to have to get it they need to do this with unreal god only knows why they stopped making them along with the tournament series while every other 90s fps has been rebooted makes no sense rtx on games is wicked quake 2 as it was meant to be i missed playing it and now i have a reason too hopefully we will see more classic games updated using raytrace the difference is incredible how not to relaunch a franchise and doom did it right nvidiageforce quakeii doom are the best shooters like that and if rtx will arrive to doom its will be huge evolutionbut i dont have rtx card looks amazingly fun wow will this really be published great memories now imagine this with system shock 2 rtx pong please gameplay over graphics such a classic ziggurat vertigo lets rock it will be a pleasure to revisit this great video game now with enhanced graphics ray tracing i hope this is repeated in many other titles of the 90s im stoked for everything rtx this brings back memories cant wait to try this out quake 2 is a great game looks better with ray tracing hoping this will hit 60fps on my 2080 not sure about you but this game gave me some quakes its gonna be awesomeeeeee do what now its the shareware version with rtx update spared you a clivk things like this make me want to have rtx very cool oh my god this looks epic i cant wait for this to release i am so glad that you are modding the original quake ii and not trying to rebuild it from scratch i think that there will be something that feels very special about playing this game that is over 20 years old with modern high quality graphics i remember playing quake 2 back on my n64 oh those were the days i dont think i can even run this glorious update rtxon i know rjn is excited he loves quake rtxon ill be trying this on a 1070 omg the nostalgia cant wait to get home from work to give this a go i never did play quake much back in the day time to change that childhood memories are looking good just here for the 2080ti very beautifull i get redirected to the deat version of the site and there i get a 404 fun fact this game only averages around 7080 fps with 2080 ti at 1080p this game looks wayyy better with rtx flashy flashy at its best after this please do unreal with rtx so we can revive every glorious fps videogames of the past i can only imagine what this would be like on the huge nvidia monitor with a rtx gpu life would be so perfect poor quake champions well if id software is working this closely with nvidia possibly doom eternal will support rtx as well my toaster can play quake and cook toast woow its cool flashbacks to the past raytrace make everything old like new again would play if it support a xbox 360 controller on pc loving it the doom u if i see these images i wonder how my sim racing system would do with such a card damn still no raytracing in roblox i remember this game a little more pretty than i recall i want thief the dark project with rtx 0o pretty please yep this is a must time to go old school amazing dont have a rtx card though would love to win one cool but my card wont handle it guess i will have to go through quake 2 again for the 30th time bringing new gen graphics to old gen games the ultimate combination wowpeople excited for quake ii what year is it good thing rtx on still waiting for the rtx version of pong i use to play this game with my dad seeing them add ray tracing brings me back soo many memories how will it perform on 1080 ti anyone why is this not on trending for gaming 1997 great pc but can it run quake 2 2008 great pc but can it run crysis 2019 great pc but can it run quake 2 to be honest i am not sure that raytracing worth it at the moment especially if you play in 4k quake 1 was amazing when it first came out and quake 2 remake with rtx is the next lv something hilarious about having essentially the most advanced lighting system on top of a 3d game developed during the genres infancy why not rtxon should actually redo doom iii with ray tracing the lighting in this game seems very well done it looks beautiful good job rtx i need to play at least once a game with maxed out settings in my life lol rtxon i remember going to the first cyber cafe im my town and playing this just looks beautiful ahhh quaka 2i remembered playing that game long ago paying up big money for rtx gpu to be able to play the game from 1997 never felt better now this is a remaster its amazing how much lighting and reflections alone can revamp an old game even without higher resolution textures nvidia goes back in time and use ray tracing to make our gaming history even nicer its amazing how rtx can give life to old games like quake and make new games pure eye candy definitely getting this game love it rtxon now they need to do this with doom 3 next up ray tracing wolfenstein 3d i would love to see what other games would look like if they got this treatment kinda makes me want an rtx card the only game where game doesnt lag because of ray tracing simply because its from 1997 great game something new something old and something red how would it runopen on a 1060 do half life 1 and 2 next please oh and if possible half life 3 too me comments on every e3 video from nvidia and doesnt win anything also me reality is often disappointing the lighting looks awesome in this dang the ray tracing actually made quake look way better a timeless fps classic given a massive upgrade nice really is a visual overhaul i love this game never heard of quake but it looks pretty damn good o this game has ages really well i wand one nvidea choose me oke i give you 5 to let me win oke pls ok shut up and take my money rtxon this is going for my steam wishlist when is the release of rtx pacman can wait to see some gameplay footage its crazy how much raytracing changes the look of this game sexy like the good old days pretty game i didnt get to play it when i was a kid tho i might play the new improved version with rtx only if i get one d wow a really nice game playing games with rtx is awesome but not having one is not looks great but an update for the textures would be nice too rtx on i have played all quake parts but without ray tracing which to see that in personmore like to play in person just here trying to win a new gpu card p banned in germany so thx no not even the overly advertised nord vpn helps i wish i have an rtx its crazy what good lightning can do for retro games ray tracing is awesome every game looks amazing even if its old is amazing rtxon e32019 geforce first rtx game to have decent fps maybe oohh my heart brings me back to when i was a teenager so much hype i love a remake when it uses a new tech how do we get this lol their is 666 thumbs up right now leave it here and never look back wasnt expecting it to be released free thats pretty awesome hopefully it still will be if i ever get a card that can play it whoop whoop e3 here we come something old something new everything fab than make q2 for vr this game always refreshes my old gaming memories we want new games not old ones with the rtx technology terriblethe game runs at 800fps on a intel hd graphics and when you enable rtx will drop to 10fpsnice work like the hair works featurehahaha btw i did not like this rtx visual i dont know about everyone else but i want clear example that shaders are more important than textures in achieving photorealism in the end it is still quake ii bubbles and clouds with explosions and rockets crack siiiipp yuuup quake ii was the best the nostalgia of playing quake and with rtxon the experience just got even better what a time to be a gamer do this with quake 4 rtx its amazing ah quake ii reminds me of the good ol days rtx really makes this game shine i like quake 2 was the first game that got me hooked on online multiplayer deathmatch games the thing nobody asked for but everyone wants the texture are op looking amazing with rtxon its here paving the path of history again the first fps i played on a console doom was my first shooter ever played but quake 2 will always be the best one love u nvidia it was reborn but better good work nvidia dude im just rockin with an oem sff from 2012 make me a winner

what can say thank you for making this masterpiece alive again still illegal in germany need the pc and tv or asus scar laptop i used to suck at this game back then and definitely now too this is proof that textures are not everything lighting in of itself significantly changes how a game looks for the better wow it looks great i might be able to stand how it looks longer then 15 mins rtx is on rtxonnvidiageforsee32019 welp cant wait to see it released cant wait to play it but is the sound track back can i have one when you were told that lighting is crap berserker mod looks better than this when is it comming to consoles a good lighting is what we need in new games and remakes of old games with that good lighting what about superresolution textures and audio just gave the demo a try on my 2070 its awesome the reflections are truly amazing you really cant fake them with any other technique ray traced reflections are the king as im stuck living in the past this is great lol i tried to play it heres my fps result 4k and all high 24 fps 1440p and all high 45 fps 1080p and all high 60 fps or more yep if all rtx features is on more power needed you need 2 gpus to run at 4k 60 fps all on and high but visual amazing but if you are in a really dark spot you will notice some artifacts thank youits like a here they work see lol im waiting for crysis rtx but we prob would need the amd supercomputer for that so is it ray traced or path traced is it on steam there is still something off about this corners dont cast sharp shadows shadow only start a bit after the corner items on the floor dont cast shadows at all it looks more faked and baked than the earliest fake gis no fresnel reflection on the water no haze or darkening in the water that fresnel would cause plus absorption i think this deserves a doover the original game looks as good or better i want to buy this game but then i realise me not get a rtx the one thing that bothers me is that the game isnt available in germany because they banned it on release for being to violent nice job id love to see more classics reborn in rtx nah not interested not gonna lie not what i was thinking about when i first heard about rtx xd give me a new quake game with rtx please thank you 035 thats why its pcmr and not consolemr cant afford an rtx but its only pc and that makes me happy the soundtrack is good can somebody from nvidia explain why a standalone rtx processor using sli or x4 pcie isnt possible like physx physx was kinda pointless but rt is on its way to becoming a staple of gaming and a large powerful standalone processor makes more sense than a fraction of a chip barely making the grade for me id pay 300 for a decent rtx chip to add to a 1080 but i wouldnt rush to buy a 2080 or maybe even a 3080 at 700 i think the 20xx series did well in hyping up rt but a standalone would be like a generational leap and if the visualscost to make gamescontent etc could justify it then people would gladly spend the money esp if rt takes load off the regular gpu and brings up the entire system how about quake 1 rtx i can see this being the new trend in remasters in a couple years nice i want an rtx 2080 too i want to see a remaster of time splitter future perfect on better game engine with rtx this game had multiple environment from different era as u time travel rtx just for this because for new game it is not power full enough rtx on fps drop lets download it ill give it a shot for at least testing the whole rt experience by myself silky smooth 6 fps on my gtx 1080 and to be honest the game still looks like potato it only took remastering a classic in quake to change peoples perception of rtx so can i play the full game whit rtx nice looking but not my kind of game wow this is what my 2080ti is looking for shut up and take my bank account yes yes now us rtx boys can flex about rtx with 60 fps in a game which came out 23 years ago rtx version doesnt support the music despite being present in the trailers face palm never tried quake i still dont know if i can poorgamer i wish it worked on my pc thank you based geforce feels realistic i have never seen light stick thrower and for god sake i played it for alot of time is that new imnot paying for that let me guess i need a 2080ti to play it at 1080p60fps i am so glad it is officially out now if i could just win a 2080ti from nvidia to play this game other new releases what the hell is this game having trouble reaching 60fps mainly going in the 4050fps range running my rig with a ryzen 7 2700x and a 2080 what are the best settings to reach 60 this looks awesome when i played the game it looked like a new one halflife next please quake 2 the best soundtrack you ever heard m m this is not right rocket jump ninja is gonna love this not worth it runs like dookie on my rtx2060 i have to turn my resolution all the way down to x1024 and global ilumination medium 6075fps but it feels like 20fps i get a steady 60fps when i set global illumintion on high but then it feels like 5fps hello i hope this gets fixed good nvidia finaly rtx graphis card for 8001000 eur found right way to paly 22 year old gamesgratulation when will you do minecraft rtx can i play it on my gameboy color need more like this now do need for speed underground 2 except the replaced textures look like shit doom 3 in rtx could be awesome too your dl link is dead upscale textures and do the raytrace to the q1 sadly its just not that great a game its more a doom game than a sequel to the fantasy inspired quake 1 imagine quake 3 with this i hope my 3dfx voodoo can run it its a really interesting juxtaposition the classic quake ii graphics and the futuristic raytracing love it now that is why we have u1200 gpus for thanks nvidia for improving the graphics market with such innovations so do quake 2 owners on steam get an update for free or hm got the cd here but no drive oh and no rtx card nvidia any help if only i had an rtx card cries in gt 730 your link is dead specific instructions on how to get it pls im not gonna lie to ya this makes me want to get a rtx card more than any new game has its been 84 years you just basically made quake iii please can you make remakes of others old pcconsole games with ray tracing for how well the game is remade its still missing the modern touch you can see that its an older game at 1440p with a rtx 2080ti only 50fps no thanks quake 2 or the first fps i finished and its been stuck in my head since i was a kid v its like upgrading your highend pc any way it was a great game and by adding real tracing its even greater gotta love that new look good thing the ost is as heavy as ever too whats about quake 3 shoutout to nvidia for improving visuals of an old game i hope this influences other developers to visually improve their old games rip germany this is a great day for humanity but a painful day for all germans because they forgot to get the game unbanned here or they just didnt want to pay the reevaluation fee avg fps 50 fps 1080p high rtx 2070 r7 2700x 16gb 3200mhz meanwhile in oculus quest quake 1 is killer app now what about making a remastered because that freaking models are so bad also so nostalgic waited a long time for this ill start to save for the rtx highest lighting and low texture combine what a combination only 100fps on my 2080 ti oof and lags on rtx 2080 ti come on dude why dont just make a full remastered version then adding some lighting and reflection effects and what about battlefield 5 the game looks awesome on turning rtx on but the fps is like im playing it on gtx 1030 if i can see i can figth rtx prurpose in this relauch of quake 2 in a nutsell god bless rtx for bringing back quake ii to my life i am waitin to test this on my rtx 2060 ive just played it and its ok definitely more nostalgia then a wow but feels zoomed in abit and cant seem to change that is this better graphics with rtx well yes my desktop pc parts are operating system windows 10 pro 64bitcpuintel xeon e3 1220 v3 310ghz haswellws 22nm technology ram 160gb dualchannel ddr3 799mhz 10111030 motherboard asrock h87 pro4 graphics 3072mb ati amd radeon r9 200 series msi storage 223gb kingston shss37a240g sata3 ssd1tb external game drive power supply corsair 500wcasecooler master trooper case montor40 inches toshiba tv at 1080p i could not afford any nvidia gpu so i have to buy an amd instead now its just gaming pc for my 1 niece and 2 nephews i am not fan boy amd or nvidia i just buy the best card with what i could afford ps to all those who replay to my comment i am just ignoring all of them such a shame why people cant express themselves of the right of freedom of speech this is the best quake ii has ever looked no shit imagine you been living under a rock with your windows 98 pc for 20 years this is the only game you play and have installed on your computer suddenly it asks to update i prefer the real quake getting so much more coverage than anyone cares been waiting a long time for this pity ill not be able to use rtx on its just me or does this looks like gta sa with rtx on i feel like i have been transported back to 1997 having to buy a particular brand of video card to play one particular game lol sadly the game is still banned in germany s steam or some other trash me how much graphics do you have nvidia y e s waiting for rtx on doom 1 today i will stream on the channel and see how much fps will be on the initial rtx 2060 card looking crisp windows download link is dead lol my version is gog one is there a mod to restore the original skyboxes textures 0 lighting 100 quake comes to life with rtxtechnology video games keep aging so nicely thank goodness we have moved back into coloured lights in games who else thought it was a new gpu quake 2 was my first fps on my pc2mb s3 virge thats pretty darned amazingsort of breathes new life into one of my favorites i miss the grappling hook thats not what we want from youwe need better and bader guys lets make this most played quake title on steam will be trying with my 2080 ti hope i can hit 4k if the game even has it despite the ray tracing workload edit i have now tried with my 2080 ti with horrible results 20 fps at 4k 40 to 55 fps at 1440p you dont hit 60 until you go down to 1080p so even the absolute best card can only do 1080p 60 yes you are above 60 but you are lower than 60 at any higher resolution thus 1080p is still the maximum in this game the 2080 ti gives me the same performance at 1440p that my 1080 ti got me at 4k nvidia should be more forthcoming about this game by telling people that to get the performance they want they need the absolute best rtx card and even then they will only be at 1080p resolution i dont care what ray tracing is it is not worth this absurdity at least not until we have cards that can handle it with relative ease so i heard commenting in one of your videos you give an rtx 2080 ti i thought youtube does not let porn uploaded but i think this is an exception im like 90 positive that this is a new game this looks pretty incredible given that i played this game when i was 5 lol unreal tournament 2 rtx they might make unreal rtx next ray traced crysis when nvidia loyalist here this is freakin amazing loved the trailer this will now be my third playthrough rtx off rtx meh rtx on here before 50 comments first game i can actually test rtx with ill update this comment if it fries a 2060 laptop edit it fries got 45 fps with every rtx setting on at 1080p and global illumination set to low turning global illumination off completely and its a playable 60 fps experience i can manage 80fps with everything up and resolution at 1366x768 but thats blurry i feel like this is a user build realistic mod from 2014 like gta sa i love the theme of improving the overall graphics of games in unimaginable ways but over the months i wanna ask when can i see monster hunter world on rtx my marathon of watching missed nvidias video starts now i missed videos of 2 months cause my phone got stolen so now i bought this one it just took 2 months to get enough money for this crappy phone d i 025 sit up and pay attention because you wont see any difference rtx on and off xd111111 2080ti on water 2100mhz 8000mhz on the mem hope i can hold 60fps at 4k with the benq hdr 32inch ainsley yeahhhhh boyyy ok i need to get a rtx card asap rtx is about to blow up so in 22 years we will be able to play a 2019 aaa game with all raytraced wow this looks incredible and im stuck here with a gtx 1050 just reaching 60fps had a 2080 since launch thiswill be my first rtx game d raytracing is a meme another game that i cannot afford this is the first ever youtube video i have been able to comment first multiplayer death match starts at 11312 great now it looks like a source game that is not how you suppose to play quake ffs seeing a bethesda logo on quake 2 is surreal but can it run quake 2 is this quake champions its a little sickening watching nvidia use you for marketing their rtx graphics cards vinny this new lightingcard system seems in line with a lot of games trying to look toyetic or claylike with their shaders but that doesnt really work with quake iis gritty creepy aesthetic rtx right now would probably work better with celshading and something along the lines of the links awakening remake based on this alone i wouldnt rush to make every new game rely on this kind of card which isnt yet widely available this is not one of those streams you wanna like have a nice chill night and have some background noise to youre just gonna hear huagh jokes on you vin i had this playing in the bg and giggled like a dumbass at all the huaghs i did a double take when i saw the bethesda logo at the title screen then i remembered we live in a hellish timeline where bethesda bought id software that vinesauce brand hand sanitizer had better have a tagline like for getting rid of crust and scum this actually looks like ass rtx is completely useless i can get a source port with mods that make quake 2 look exactly like this that works on 2010 era pcs dm favourite weapon hand grenade interesting choice cool story but i also like people putting effort into optimizing the things that dont work we already have plus like most gpu gimmicks i dont think it will be adopted as some kind of industry standard in 4 years as some people seem to think though we might see some use on future console generations since its they dont have the same issues of compatibility judging by the visible lag when shadows are recalculated im going to guess that the real time coloured lighting from weapons isnt even ray traced but is done the usual way sip yup quake ii rtx is a good game wow the pistol in this game makes me want to use the flare gun in turok 2 i dont recall the first game having such ugly starting guns though ive only watched vinesauce play them i keep thinking this is a version of quake ii debuted at the rooster teeth expo poor binyot downgraded from a gtx 1080 to a 2070 why do brides wear virgin white most do not deserve that right ray tracing is just a big meme 5145 make this a hitsound in tf2 what is the cost of lies nothing vinny as long as you get enough people to believe in it or in a dictatorship like russias as long as you can murder those that dont was there no quake 2 intro scene so theres just no music in this game how atmospheric one of the most memorable parts of quake 1 was the soundtrack for me it is a good demonstrative demo though i think we wont see proper implementations of rtx in pc or console untill 2024 can we talk about how vinny still has the epic games launcher in his desktop and most likely still has fortnite installed rtx makes light into physical pixels this gives it more realistic physics it could be used on audio which also allows for realistic echo and doppler effect imagine being a marketing mouthpiece for gpus you should do arcane dimensions for quake 1 quake awesome quake ii ehits ok quake iii arena scene missing quake iv aids quake champions who cares remember to run q2rtx at 1080p dxr is pretty good too no games support it yet but you can mod it in also known as hoaaaghh the stream why is vinny popular hes so bitter and mean sounding they just fucking gave you a 2070 so you could play quake ii the fuck i can see why vinny hates that pistol dyew dyew all that nda mystery from weeks ago for this wow im pretty sure nvidia just wanted you to upgrade the rtx as someone who has worked pr before i really have to give nvidia my compliments i dont even think the quake ii rtx is that impressive looking but they went out of their way to give super stubborn streamers like vinnie a free rtx card under the pretext of letting them play and promote the game sure thats the most prominent reason however would vinnie have ever at any point in the next decade have upgraded to rtx technology without this ploy hell no and thats the true genius of this whole thing its not the rtx tech demo its the gullible streamers like our dear vinnie getting tricked into upgrading hats off nvidia color me impressed quake ii mission pack 3 the streaming in which vinny looks at graphics and dies a lot ive never given a shit about graphics and i am not about to start doing so now seriously i have no problems with the way the original quake 2 looks its great that people are trying to push technology forward but i mean come on whats the big deal if we get og deus ex rtx i can die a happy if insignificant man still not impressed at all by rtx watched a douzen of videos about it dont see the big deal also rtx on old games like quake 2 tends to make them uglier in my opinion rtx tends to smooth everything like a permanent light bloom effect its just ugly fixed shadows are fine you can artistically work with fix shadows play with their density trick the player sculpt the look of a room with fake shadows real time lightning is not better just because its in real time you desperatly want real time shadows go outisde so it just makes everything bright just fucking increase the brightness this just makes me want a new jedi knight game which i know will never happen as long as ea holds the license a little over the 8 minute mark he mentions a horror game im not sure which he is talking about does anyone else have more info rtx to me is kinda like the physx debacle unfinished tech that that adds minor extras while using alot of resources to make it work right cant we stop getting good tech getting stuck in its infancy just to get a quick buck in rtx is just not ready yet in my opinion anyway that moment when you have to upgrade your pc to play quake 2 for a second time twenty years later hmm for a game with static environment lighting rtx feel like a bit of a waste when every ight in the game by desing can be change this might rly bring something new now its just more or less eye candy i was wondering why vinny would play this for so long until he said it was sponsored oh yes that hwap jump sound is still there meaty twitch front page is catered to my viewing habits is that why mine was all the twitch thots vinny and joel maybe if theyd showcased the new lighting effects with another game like doom 3 where lighting has a greater effect on the environment and atmosphere much like vr were about 10 years early on this tech itll be amazing later this was a cool stream i wish i was able to watch the whole thing live thank god for fullsauce it looks like a half life 2 mod for the amount of times vinny was confused by the lack of light this game could really use a clock showing the time of day maybe idk just put the majoras mask one there in the bottom of the screen rtx noun areteaeks 1 a feature so insignificant that nvidia gives streamers free hardware to make it catch on 2 usercontrolled lag generator 735 not true at all deffered rendering if youre talking about realtime dynamic lights from guns and shit what you cant do is raytracing which is global illumination and reflections so let me get this straight you got a free 2070 from nvidia to play quake 2 rtx and potentially other rtx games at max graphics and youre fucking streaming and recording in 720p love you vinny but for gods sake isnt it time to up the ante to 1080p i really hate that original q2 shotgun has a reload sound effect that plays seconds before the animation actually happens wheres the fov tho funny how a figural tech demo from 1997 turns into a literal one in 2019 so basically its a fairly shitty barebones source port with some fancy lighting effects and visuals that look arguably worse than most advanced source ports totally worth buying a new video card thank you nvidia youve quite literally shown me the light the real innovation here is the cast shadows vin as you said many studios have workarounds but notice the cast shadows are way better less jaggie or as you say crusty i use real time rendering in alot of my work in rendering so its always something you have to deal with vinny this game is awesome stream this game youll love it im vassed up and ready to go it doesnt look that good or anything it just looks like bathroom tiles or like any other normal game without ray tracing like with bump maps youre all retarded for all this hype about raytracing hur dur its da future shut up you fucking hipsters with your startup scampanies and hyperloop and shit this is the best quake game since quake the quakening i have that exact model its really good 4k ultra in games like everspace is just delightful i think the most impressive thing about it are the reflections so far cant wait until its actually there where it should be who dropped the blaster i wax would love to see the first deus ex with all these big boi graphics colonel ive infilitrated the lava and my balls are melting they made you sign an nda for this lol shoulda given vinny a 2080 ti with all these freezes 955 is my question thank you for answering vinny watching this live i was very disappointed in chats reactions it seems weve become so spoiled we cant be impressed with the concept of something unless it looks indisputably better than everything else this wasnt necessarily meant to be impressive because of how it looked it was meant to be impressive because they were able to apply raytracing to an old game and make just about every part of the graphics be a result of strictly raytracing rather than how some games have been doing it using raytracing only for very minor parts while still using the fake stuff for the majority of everything else the idea wasnt to fully remaster quake 2 the idea was to show what ray tracing is capable of on its own on an older game without too much else being changed once the tech becomes more refined and costeffective i can see a lot of cool stuff done with this for now though its a neat novelty for people with disposable income or people deemed part of the twitch kool kidz klubb starring john quake certified space marine of the john spacemarine program bbq shoes on rtx off rtx shoes on ray tracing is the future when its all running properly and universal it will in one stroke solve all lighting issues all shadow issues and all reflection issues devs wont have to spend hundreds of hours faking it like they do now and it will all be accurate in a way lighting and reflections arent currently it will just work though obviously tweaked for artistic reasons however right now there is no need to bother with it its still quite limited and the faking that the devs do is really impressive thats why there isnt as much difference as people expected ray traced lighting and shadows has been in video games for 15 years or more just not realtime prebaked as it is in half life 2 it is the future its just not worth worrying about its almost more of a developer tool wow sunday already where did the soundtrack go rtx mode reminds me of star wars ep1 realtime raytracing is pointless at the moment these cards are fucking revolutionary for 3d rendering though at least the gpu has a better video encoder the lighting in quake 1 darkplaces look just as impressive hey vinny dont forget capcoms at e3 you better not forget to watch it 11742 succuro vinny dies twice god bless vinny for playing the worst game in the quake series with no music and a graphics pack that makes it look like a unity game it works what and so rtx continues to be a joke dont forget the e3 starts tomorrow mr vincent starting with ea play we live in the future luigi really real time lighting this is was already in games like in hl1 when you shot a rocket there a real time lighting binny why you unlist bideo uh oh vinny got in trouble for this wait why can we still see the video in the one off video list if its unlisted so whys this video unlisted this version features path tracing which is a very demanding implementation of ray tracing basically here ray tracing is applied to everything from global illumination to reflections and shadows hence the low fps count does not surprise me at all especially at 1440p thanks for this vid im just getting a rtx card and was looking for something like this to see how my i7 would cope with it like we are back 20 years ago shooters at 35 fps hope nvidia optimize rtx more with drivers for smoother gameplay can i use your video for a forum contest i would put a voice on him and i will put the link to your video in the forum if you leave me seems you r playing it first time who needs quake 2 rtx when you got quake 2 xp thank you for your work nuking the resolution with the resolution scale slider makes it playable too bad you didnt touch it i wonder how the original quake would run on your rig vega 64 will be at 19 fps while navi will do 30 fps possiblity only on navi 20 but no where near from rtx 2060 doing 45 fps on 1080p never turn off denoiserits very important to have it on eyy no use laptop happy your new system i see all your videos 1997 can it run quake ii 2007 can it run crysis 2019 can it run quake ii at this moment real time ray tracing is still not worth and clumsy we need at least 5 more years when performance will get close to stable 60 fps on xx60 or xx70 cards it looks like vanilla only slower its an waste of time thanks for sharing this very informative i own the same videocard going to try it on my 1050 thresh that dude boi rocket jumper for life the high poly weapons are better looking than this somehow the bfg 10k was underwhelmingrailgun was meh too guess rtx is not everything it is said to benot that i believed it would be or that i ever planned to buy a card that is half a million huf lol while the grenades are still in the launcher they look like duracell batteries its too bad they put all that effort into making new weapon models but dont even touch up the animations the animations definitely could have had some tweaks p love the designs something dont look right here wfg i play all except flare gun this weapon doesnt exist on quake 2 30 version what is your pc spec wtf sorry for the unrelated comment hunt showdown will leave early access late this august do you plan on covering the game again after its fully released ooh that hyperblaster sound reminds me of the tools that dentists use they still look and sound like complete shit nice can you do quake 4 uh what happened to the railgun 134 could be the beat to a song im so angry that they fucking changed the railgun do tf2 im not high when i definitely see the grenade launcher shooting batteries 8th comment quake champions 2 is looking cool today on games that dont need to exist 360p hello there viewer general 360p edit wow looks like my comment is no longer relevant first quake ii vs quake ii rtx weapon comparison httpsyoutubez9xaxotnke 0003 blaster 0020 machinegun 0038 chaingun 0058 shotgun 0116 super shotgun

description with the new nvidia driver 44141 they improved the performance of quake 2 rtx 120v which by the way uses path ray tracing however the performance is still bad you cant run this game at max settings at native 4k res you see it at the start of the video i used the native resolution afterwards i changed it to dynamic resolution with that it was playable ps im not going to do a 1440p video of quake the performance is just as bad but im going to do an ultrawide video just for the cinematic 219 effect as for next month besides the rdr2 advanced graphics videos the halo masterchief collection is planned detroit become human the darksiders hack slay and more how does your wall of corridor is so shiny mine is matte which option i need to turn on for that at 121 your getting 60 fps with a 2080ti i am getting 60fps with a 2060 super at 1080p misleading title not 4k after the first few seconds which you even mention in your pinned comment great video and well presented could amyone suck anymore at this you use what program for show fps this stupid game is made for 3090 rtx and 10900k 51 ghz my 2060 easy to get 60fps on max settings 1080p at dynamic resolution turned on this channel needs more subscriber bro because this channel is good try promoting if you want any help reply me back so that i can help u you can learn more about quake ii rtx check out a new trailer and view rtx on rtx off screenshot comparisons in httpswwwnvidiacomenusgeforcenewsquakeiirtxjune6releasedate i have been playing this game for better aiming you guys are having too much fun with rtx haha the latensy is soooooooooo low i need to win the giveaway wont give up crysis rtx remastered please oh ya my head now actually hurts having listened to this asus rampage 5 extreme intel i7 5930k and asus strix 2080ti mine runs like the old quake 2 i have no enhancements am i missing a setting somewhere i came here to hear from mr tracing about his work remastering quake ii great job ray how do you get this detailed frame and gpu utilization profiles i am using vulkan on linux and some not to hard tool to use would be great i know of ability to give names labels and tags to various objects shaders and passes in vulkan and they show up in renderdoc for example but a profile that can also tell me performance of these elements would be awesome i see some mention of vulkan and vkray i guess it is vknvraytracing in 20193 nvidia nsight systems changelog does it also support dlss denoiser thingy profiling would love to see unreal original game with ray tracing now that was a beautiful game that deserves a remaster so basically raytracing just makes every game look overly bright and almost identical to half life 2what a time to be alive for these improvements want the nvidia 2080 super to power up cyberpunk 2077 rtxon does rtx 2080 super go with rainbow six siege rtxon very informative and they made a complex subject easy to understand i wish i wouldnt have watched it though it makes me feel like my 1080 is an old broken down ox cart although it did remind me of how much fun i had playing quake long ago always enjoy seeing classic titles being brought back into the light interesting to see how this tech works lovely can this actually happen lol the video is lagging fail everything just works light stuff personally quake 2 rtx is sacaded on my i7 6 core 12 treads 64 gb of ram and a rtx 2080 8 gb of ram extremely disappointed with the result xtreme g 2 has a very fattening soundtrack for those who want to had a few pounds i played waaaaay more quake ii with rtxon than i thought i would and that was at 800x600 on my 1080ti still worth it just played it it looks rubbish but then its very low poly sparse environments and with very low resolution textures however things like reflections from screens and so on look great i think this is a great demo of the technology i have an rtx 280 ti and dont care for rtx i only play at 1080p 60 fps too dont need 4k either on a sweet monitor that said an older game like quake its cool to see and use that a lot computing need to be done in 1 frame hope you all can make a deep full tutorial about it love to learn how to make it my 1080ti work like shit on this the science of ray tracing looks great rtxon ive tested it on a gtx 1070 the result is unplayable this wasnt the point anyway with rtx on but the graphics are even better than ive thought now i badly desire a rtx 2060 and all my games to be fully ray traced imagine replaying them with ray tracing and how most of them might really change like quake 2 you could completely rediscover the whole game cant wait rtxon e32019 rtxifying intensifies rtx behind the scene how its made how does it works thats how rtx works you did a great job to be honest im a little disappointed to not have a few more fps with rtx enabled on a pascal graphic card but it was netherless fun to experiment rtx and above all rediscover quake 2 this was one of the games i played way back then kudos will be waiting fir this game long live q2 awesome pls do it for doom and doom 2 as well more ray tracing enabled games are on the way cant wait to see thid id also love to take a peek how monster hunter world is gonna fair with rtxon e32019 ray tracing has promise but it will be a couple of generations down the road for modern aaa games this looks and feels like an nvidia training video for in house customer service reps the remaster makes quake 2 very colorful too colorful for this type of game growing up it was an action horror game so i hope the remaster keeps working with the colors and toning it to keep the same feeling that the original gave us or at least me was running rtx 2080 ultra setting on 1440p with rt on bfv honestly im not impressed more frames less bs please woah this is not a passing fashion rtx tech is going to stay and spread from this generation onwards rtxon e32019 why arent flight simulator software companies taking advantage of ray tracing and things like vulcan the explanation seems simple but inside the algorithm the intense calculation maaan weve gone so far in tech thanks nvidia love your product keep it up rtxon e32019 give me rtx for pso2 i have no use for ray tracing it does nothing for me yet really nice to see the improvement and dedication to the rtx franchise 3 in it to win it commentator looks like he just told jesus that he is a fraud that god is now staring at him through a glass darkly how do they explain that without using its rt coresthe rtx 2080 is 25 faster than the gtx 1080 ti a few years back people would say can it run crisis now they say but can it run quake ii rt nice rtxongeforcee32019 quake ii rtx lookin fine thanks for the detailed explanation im impressed that you guys can keep all clear in your own heads to be able to make this work bestgame great tech this was really interesting thanks thats my dog love your products need a new gpu computer crapped out i havent even watched the whole video yet and i already find this amazing is rtx opening the pandora box can you do the first unreal next thats a good ray tracing knowledge jeez couldnt resist hitting the watch now button during install as soon as i read the words raytracing so nice now please make classic doom with rtxon just imagine d i cant wait to finish my pc to try this game ill never be able to afford a pc good enough to run the video card but the game looks dang good thank you for this explanation video ray tracing makes some sense now i am quite weak in ray optics you know cool thing to do please give us quake 1 id unironicaly buy the fastest card just for this quake looked like shit when it came out duke nukem 3d was better for the time new technology insane this is an insane technological feat i mean making a 97 game look incredible in 2019 is just amazing hats off to you folks there at nvidia why do you use ambient light if you compute indirect lighting quake is eternal thank you nvidia for making it even better with rtx you guys should do a couple of more oldies if possible would be cool to have the original deus ex or max payne in an rtx remaster maybe the original tomb raider games or the original mafia game could be another genre how about need for speed 3 hot pursuit or the original driver have a 2070 and it still doesnt work nice its been quite a while good to see you doing a video mr tamasi did gary tarolli get a chance to see any of this rtx tech before he retired or since for that matter i was just curious seeing q2 pathtraced reminded me of some of the clever and pretty things that were being planned for tbuffer but so much more elaborate now glad to see youre still getting chances to reimagine rendering now and then pleease give me rtx 2080 ti pleease give me rtx 2080 ti bad guys still look like cartoons tho rtxon quake was the one game i missed when it came out if i win a graphics card ill give it a go im glad to be playing quake ii in 2019 and it is taxing my pc nice tech video rtx breaths new life into a 20 year old game thats pretty crazy can you imagine what a rtx halflife would look like so i downloaded the demo the framerates are horrible you just break the lighting game mood with rtx on idk just tweak the lighting mood like the original man and all this runs on vulkan api checked it with rivatuner statistics server dont mind me just here for the prize that i will problily wont get but woth a try atleast it takes a huge amount of work to make things realistic and even more smarts to make it practical its looking pretty good now i cant wait to see what its like in another 5 years its cool that the whole game is raytraced i wanna that rtx i dont really understand what this is ill probably wont win but i guess you got to keep trying no 3 i understand now rtxon ray tracing love good luck rtxon when ur pc is 5 yrs old ands its soo old because you cant afford a new one people say crysis still cannot run on ultra settings praise nvidia the inventor of the gpu a highperformance processor which generates breathtaking interactive graphics on workstations personal computers game consoles and mobile devices 3 i love you guys actually a big lighting difference amazing job geforce so do i need a rtx gpu lol i just spend money on a gtx 1060 great now do hl1 rtxon giveaway nvidia keep start with gtx and never end with rtx rtxon random 316 when he throws the torch into the corner it looks particularly realistic rtxon i want to see the halo trilogy with ray tracing e32019 nvidia is truly the premier company for next generation hardware next up ut2004 hope they are gonna remaster more old games it makes them look awesome imagine if they also improved the textures surprisingly rtx made this game look more alive good work nvidia nice explanation i love seeing old games remastered its the same gameplay experience but fancy rtx such a failure that they have to remake 22 yo old games to keep any interest about rt that said i have a 2080ti but not for rtx but only for gaming performance ray tracing change the game totally did you steal this mod its just a much richer experience than the original quake 2 the absolute ego on this guy all you did was shit on the art direction and tone of the game with cool technology get over yourself this isnt a literal improvement on the style and experience of quake 2 whatsoever its a technological visual upgrade thats sacrificed a lot of the carefully crafted artistry in defining a good environment from the original such a dirty disrespectful use of words honestly release quake 2 rtx already i am waiting would have been much better to use quake 3 as an rtx demo than quake 2 woah game looks so new because of the ray tracing 0 nvidia make soldier of fortune 2 double helix gold rtx it would be cool if they did swat 4 remaster next all i want is winquake with nin and maybe widescreen i cant see why this wouldnt run on gtx 9xx series my voodoo 2 card can run this game and a gtx 1080 can run battlefield 5 with rtx i think nvidia could give the rest of there loyal customers some support even a gtx 780 could probably run this comes on out steam on june 6th bring it on halomasterchiefedition on xboxx completely destroys the original look of the game though the graphics were made with the more primitive lighting in mind now you have all the models on full low poly display higher res textures and cool lighting automatically appealing visuals please reamster halflife 2 when can we play this rocket jump ninja is gonna be on crack on this game its amazing how far technology has come very nice would be great if could do this for rtcw i mean cant wait please update textures as well this is how you go from 1500 fps to 15 interesting that nvidia chose this game to demo its rtx tech back in the 1997 quake 2 was used to show off 3dfxs new rendering technology svga 256 colors 3dfx 65536 colors svga no colored lighting 3dfx colored lighting svga 15 fps 3dfx 30 fps svga no texture sampling 3dfx texture sampling voodoo 3dfx shipped with dedicated 4mbs of onboard memory totally unheard of at the time especially since systems came with 4mb of ram and most were happy to play games with an svga video card i vividly remember seeing the quake 2 3dfx demo at a computer show sale in my area and that day dropped 300 for a voodoo 3dfx card adjusted for inflation that would be 47766 in todays dollars does anyone remember that 3dfx quake 2 demo rtx is here to stay once you have this level of lighting realism its hard to go back add in some highquality models may be used some highquality weapon models and boom new version of q2 now if you can add these features to quake 4 by the video thumbnail it looks like joe pesci got into game developmentthis game amuses you what like a clown xd sooooo 1080 ti can use ray tracing then this mans forgot for honor i love you guys have sponsored by youtubers make their games more faster and more powerful and one im all you need to do and i really fun and be cool to have you got the card you guys always get sponsored by youtubers and youtubers they want you guys to get there quake 3 arena remasted for xbox one plz i wish i could understand the guys that are just so vehemently against these new turing cards listen we know that 1080tis are also great cards but for the next generation of graphics realism raytracing is inevitable its remarkable they can implement these new features and still give comparable performance and price point for nonrtx titles as well comparing 2080 vs 1080ti they chose to go with a 20 year old game because if the used anything from the past ten years the demo would be at 480p 20fps also you can achieve all these effects with rasterization only look at unreal engine 4 demos on youtube of old game remakes instead of using one third of the chip for rasterization and getting 135 teraflops use the whole chip and get 40 teraflops ray tracing is ten years away from proper realtime implementation 1 sample sucks 50 samples per second per pixel ten years from now will look good path tracer reminds me of the new renderer in vue a landscaping 3d artist program daz studio uses nvidia iray which i built my custom water cooled 3 card gtx1080 system 2 years ago to take advantage of id like to see how this performs on my system in 2x sli daft punk get lucky playing in the background 223 oooooo ray tracing to refresh old games yes please this is powerful daily reminder that every single gpu in existence can do this path tracing the rtx gpus just have some extra hardware to accelerate it but its nothing new calling it exclusive to rtx cards is misleading but nvidia loves doing that why does he look like the free real estate guy need to turn the brightness down a bit can this be implemented in mods like action quake2 looks too bright for quake 2 im stil not sold on this xp mod is still damn stunning u nvidia corporative boys are just full of shit u know that right damn thats a whole new level of gfx shit didnt know u needed rtx so that the remasters look good bahahahahaahaha xd 30 off any rtx for everyone who watched this informative video magine justthebeginning i wish ray tracing comes to all old classics as a mod fingers crossed for max payne 12 another great video by tony i love the title director of technical marketing more companies need this position sooooo will the rtx 2060 be enough to run this at 60fps at 1080p when will we get ray traced pacman games that deserves remaster halflife 1 2 syndicate war wing commander 3 4 theme park world ultima 8 pagan mechwarrior 2 actually pretty poor sign that a 20 year old game is required to show the improvement between traditional or better said 20 years old rendering and rtx when comparing modern games the differences are just suttle therefore i understand why they need this old game see you all in 5 years when i upgrade my pc again ill buy whatever youre releasing today then currently pricing for gpus is still legitimately insane most of my computer combined costs as much as a decent gpu really nice explanation helpful thanks path tracing ray tracing why are you intentionally confusing people id like to see quake 1 given the rtx treatment so with the new rtx cards we can play a game from 1997 great advertising nvidia amd your move q2vkpt google it nvidia stealing the small guys spotlight imagine they would have done this for unreal gold sigh id love to see something like this for quake 3 i have way more memories with that game i am sorry but its too bright this aint quake yes its cool but this is 1997 game with 1200 usd superultramodern graphics card making it look somewhat decadeagoish at best i just dont get all the hype it seems to create over internet this isnt the case to make me put that kind of money into gpu which hasnt proven itself really other that it can do 4k pretty well btw quake 2 gameplay is somewhat boring compared to unreal or halflife from similar years if this was raytracing overhaul of halflife well id maybe be hooked but im looking forward to what becomes of raytracing in next 10 years thanks you are doing an excellent work of explaining should rename the video how to straight up destroy the colors of a beloved fps game to sell dweebs on a gimmick can i run this with gtx 970 weve really enjoyed bringing quake 2 wasnt it a group of students last year doom 3 with rts best game 2019 i sure hope my gtx 970 can handle this great just now that i bought a non rtx nvidia videocard recently so this is what rtx has come to remastering old no ancient games each individual element might be very subtle by itself but the total impact in the final image is astounding keep up the great work i am so excited for the future of gaming when they double the performance of the rtx and cut the price in half ill be happy to replace my video card hopefully intel will come out with something that forces nvidia to significantly lower their prices forget the textures the ray tracing single handedly makes the game so beautiful this game wont save you nvidia unless your lower your price for all rtx cards rtx is a pretty cool technical exercise and is great when demonstrated on older engineshowever newer games have had complex workarounds for light simulation that make rtx pretty much unnecessary considering the cost to render rtx finally a game that runs at 60 fps in rtx mode well you did it in a shit way its all too bright wow u guys are geniuses i love how hard u guys work for our fun very much appreciate it so sick would be great to hear more about denoising algos and what goes into the overaall process id love to see this in serious sam the moment that the rtx can only run a game from the 90s with rt on xd thats a step backwards i guess how does putting your new tech in a 22 year old game make me want to buy an overpriced gpu 335 so does this mean ray tracing is technically possible without an rtx card tony tony tony has done it again why couldnt you guys do this with metal gear solid 2 and 3 instead of releasing it on shield tv only fuck raytracing not even a big fan of nvidia but man the potential to make old games look legendary is absolutely incredible awesome job team green does this mean that they used the original quake 2 engine took out the source code and added ray tracing into it so its like quake 2 n64 with the n64 memory expansion pak installed well done nvidia in making a game from 1997 look better in 2019 so with a 22 years old game you are trying to sell rtx tecnology i hope you added an option to disable the sun the game wasnt really designed for there to be direct sunlight make the sky red again having created and rendered a wide range of 3d models for decades i realize the benefits ray tracing especially realtime ray tracing adds thats the main reason i opted for the rtx 2060 for my recent amd ryzen build sorry but 2070 and 2080 are simply waaay too expensive to be an option my biggest gripe is theres simply no content that offers rtx realtime ray tracing other than a couple of titles why was nvidia so ill prepared at rtx launch and still ill prepared considering rtx content is still essentially mia at least this upcoming quake ii rtx release is a teeny tiny nano step in the right direction yep nvidia definitely gave itself a huge black eye on this one and thats very sad as realtime ray tracing is definitely the way forward rtx should have been the shining star instead of the butt of jokes nvidia needs to get with partners and get the rtx content out and i mean tout de suite quake ii is my childhood raytracing doom please great job please we need the original quake nowtake your time though interesting that they still havent figured out how to effectively use the tensor cores in realtime applications yet dlss turned out to be lukewarm at best its official im wet these comments have got to be fake ray tracing is not that exciting reflections have been around forever i seriously doubt most people will even notice a difference why would you want ray tracing in such an old game makes no sense literally worthless why do you keep trying to push this as a consumer toy this is a really amazing tool for artists but just makes games shit the bed for now i get theyre a big chunk of business but 3d shops arent upgrading because you arent helping them enough work like apple did in the 1990s start with the pros and the consumers will follow love you guys want to see you succeed ngl i thought the guy in the thumbnail was ray tracing my dad always told me about how many hours he put in this game with his friends in university i cant wait to see his reaction when ill be normally playing this remastered version with my 2070 i think he will be like the pikachu face meme now i wanna see 2080tis getting destroyed by a rtx remastered version of crysis quake ii with ray tracing what a time to be alive d you explain it very good thanks for that get rid of the ambient term my brain ouch whoa that looks cool that was mighty interesting its amazing the world of difference there is thanks to ray tracing i cant understand it but by the pictures i certainly understand it it was an information how nvidia makes an art i see the current rtx line as a ray tracing tech demo for the future its not worth it yet i guess i wont be able to play this with rtx because my 1070ti wont keep up it only gives me 2520 fps american mcgees alice next quake 1 please calling it remaster is a big stretch yes you added a lot of eye candy but you totally ruined the atmosphere and feel of the game with how bright it is free on steam right wasted resources until we get real open world affecting gi lighting path traced very well in real time like brigade or better these cards will never be worth their money thanks for the informative explanation i really appreciate these videos very well explained thanks original doom next pls really great job at breaking down how it works without being overly simple or confusing really cool tech i cant believe i have to upgrade my graphics card again to play quake 2 d amazing video thanks for making it will the source be made available so that the community can assist in applying additional features great explanation sir better and i hope my computer teacher start explaining things like this halflife rtx plz where is flashes from weapons come on vulkan bust this card exclusive stuff wide open will there be vxgi for ue4 on rtx soon i am loving these new technical breakdown videos keep em coming how many bounces would you need to eliminate the need for denoising godlike a great explanation ill join the rtx crowd in a year my good ol gtx 970 has outdone herself during these past 45 years so how do you apply that to qii i cant boot up my old floppy disks from ye olde times and just run it on my rig nowadays these explaining videos are my favorite so i can see and learn how it works thank you for taking the time to explain the path tracing process and in such a concise way very cool to see some of the background in how the rt cores help bring magic to the screen if quake ii rtx had ai denoising training done would replacing the denoising with work done on the tensor cores reduce the frame time even further just curious good idea to bring ray trace to old games its what i have thought like year ago these videos will go a long way in explaining us simpletons what the magic of rtx accomplishes thanks but it change completely mood of game before was dark scenery now everything is lighten up just like inside fucking mansion for sale i want it you explain it quite easily rtx is future no doubt but hardware need more progress cool video moar of this plz when is it actually going to release this reminds me of when halo 2 remaster came out looks amazing and i cannot wait to see where this tech leads half life series rtx next how to bring back a game alive ray tracing alone really made a dated game look really nice please bring this to quake and doom 3 too will be playing this as soon as its available yes i was waiting for this since april now we have the release date all this kind of technology should be open source for the humanity now if they could implement it on quake champions that would be awesome this is the only super thing about nvidia at computex yeah yeah i understand everything just let me play the game man i love this game i hope this is just the first of many remastered classics no muzzle flashes in 1997 i was in high school and playing quake ii i understand that rtx is demanding but to have a game that supposedly runs on a pentium paired up with a 2080 its a bit too much i understand graphics is important but that is too much for just a few lighting effects in my opinnin finally this huge graphical step that we can clearly see waiting for rtx fans but i truly hope for more remasters imagine doom 3 with ray tracing need more rtx games the water effects in the game just looks so much better with rtx on lets raytrace the first super mario bros next hahaha credits were credits belong to phd student christoph schied httpsyoutubevrq1t93ulag httpsyoutubebrcafdbme2y before nvidia jumped on it for their marketing purposes cant wait to play this so glad that you are letting us download and play this it is amazing how good rtx can make this old game look is it going to be free and when can we play i really want to test my rtx2060 even though this is just quake ii i dont think my integrated graphics could run this lol the remake we never knew we needed great showcase i want halo pc rtx must have been great experience i cant wait for this this video was awesome by the way more like it please this was the game of my childhood fps owe everything to this hopefully get an rtx card to try this one day just checking do you remember to turn off the ambient light because that has zero business being in a gi scene crysis next i dream of a halo ce rtx grand theft auto san andreas would be fire with ray tracing cant wait for rt games that dont look like crap this was very interesting thank you very informative id lie if i say that i absolutely understood all but only the result matters and its here really beautiful game is a year older than i am and looks immensely better than me salt if they make rtx features on half life half life 3 will release the rtx frame breakdown was very interesting i love explanation videos thanks nvidia amazing in depth look at path tracing and the mix of rt wow great work pleeeeeeeeeease nvidia deus ex rtx only you can make it happen why cant we get a modern game no one wanted this game remade this just shows that raytracing is to hard to integrate in modern games id love gta vice city with rtx i loved playing that game so its no real hardware ray tracing its software based ray tracing look really good freaking impressive i must say thats really deep calculations and the rtx card does that simentaniously thank you it was really educational 318 now that door can actually be seen in the normal opengl mode and maybe software rendering too but im not 100 the lighting in that room was always so dark that it made it hard to see this door i watched a live stream a while back of someone playing the xbox 360 version of quake 2 my life in gaming and he kept missing that door over and over same thing happens in the pc version this version looks like shit compared to the gtc version what a shame ray tracing tech giving life to the old good days i love quake 2 and probably spent too many nights staying up to 5am playing online ive always though the opengl renderer looked good with some tweaks but this is awesome it shows how lighting can really push the quality of a renderer but apart from being pretty does this offer any competetive advantage whats the point in adding just the rtx support and not remastering it completely it looks just as bad as it looked back in the 97s quake that brings back memorys looks good to me im up for it roadmap for amd and intel what are you thinking maybe your rt is so far ahead it doesnt matter i cant wait for quake ii rtx to see if it looks realistic this is nice to see wow did i enjoy this explained like this awesom vid hmmmm is path tracing comming theyve put path tracing in their thumbnail it wont be just nostalgia it will be a totally new experience it wouldbe a great present for those whose birthday is in june great indepth video i understood every thing even though i am so bad at physics you can be a good teacher btw quake is eternal thank you nvidia for making it even better with rtx loved the insight into ray tracing technology wouldnt mind if nvidia releases a insight documentary for this tech im so glad this happened ive never played quake 2 but im definitely going to now make unreal i how fast will it work on 1080 ti i wonder how well this works on a 2060 cool stuff for some reason this presentation looks somewhat less impressive from what ive seen in the past from independent devsresearches i dont know if that really is so different or its simply a matter of showing different maps now update mirrors edge catalyst with rtx reflections in 1997 i could not run quake 2 on my pc and skip to 2019 and i still cant run quake 2 on my pc w 1st does anything explained above mean that i have to upgrade my gpu i have gtx 1060 6gb 2nd when will quake ii be released this looks weird and good at the same time quake 3 next please the return of the 90s gameswith reflections it is realy cool how they remade a twenty year old game with newer and nicer graphics i mean i played quake but i didnt realy enjoy it how ever if it would have graphics like this i would reconsider it seems that they had put a lot of work into it good job guys ship it already i hope this is the first step to more rtx enabled remastered games really love the ray tracing effect very cool i used to be a diehard quake player back in the late 90s early 2ks i played alot of q3a spent some time in the rail only 116n scene then moved onto threewave ctfs met tons of great people playing it too when someone got a good shot on you you actually told them ns and meant it i think i have a full copy of q2 that was included in my quake 4 collectors edition what a let down q4 was minus the sp that was actually ok gonna have to check out some mp q2rtx one of the main issues i have with ray tracing is that the enduser should not care about it as much the developers of insects game that name here considers about it enough to put in the game nvidias rtx tech takes lighting into the next level of reality with realtime ray tracing making games more immersive and giving geforce gamers a reflective competitive advantage oof 6 times less performance on the 1080ti i was hoping to push at least 60 fps on 1440p look how they massacred my boy maybe this game run in 60 fps nvidia pretending they invented raytracing lol new opencl async computer ray tracing is currently in the lab nvidia is about to be real competition im talking twice the frameratres on vega56 your move nvidia man retro games on rtx makes them so much better looking cant wait for more retro classical to get some love give me that educational nvidia any day dad will be happy ray tracing breathes new life to so many classic games i cant wait for modders to add it to all my favorite old games i wish i could toggle real life ray tracing on and off it gets way too bright in my room sometimes that akward feeling when you have to show off brand new tech breakthrough on a game that came out in 1997 because thats where you atleast get decent fps with it ill just take the better graphics and stick to old lighting system i really want a rtx now just to play this game this is interesting information here is my challenge put ray tracing on doom the original one wheres pong ray tracing well thats interesting why not to useadapt tensore core accelerated optix denoiser its already existing in the optix demo package for the denoising step so you can really show what turingrtxtc can offer so fascinating thanks for this video well better than on windows with gtx 10 wow it actually runs pretty good what you guys already moved to path tracing while ray tracing is not fully be optimize yet alway hoping for the best to you guys i like everything except the blue sky httpsgithubcomgfxrsportability gfxportability build status gitter this is a prototype library

quake always loved quake 2 and quake 2 the reckoning i totally want to barbecue those gibs they look like theyd be delicious on the grill i think this game marks when id software went downhill fast this game sucks while lighting is really good textures look so meh with it whoa give me a few to digest this boys like i said in another comment the music is on the discs best way to describe it is that the levels are connected to each other in sets or episodes like doom differences is you go back and forth between those sets until you get to the next set of connected lvs in which case theres no return brutal quake 2 when tho im gonna drop some first impressions it feels way too bright i liked the more toned down colors of the original making you feel like shit has gone down the planet is at war and so on also no music is quite a bummer i guess the steam version is to blame because quad damage collection on gog has the working music like whats up with that i hope its not some legal mumbo jumbo with sonic mayhem also the quake 2 guy is called bitterman either way it looks really good but again the brightness should be toned down a lot andrew kinda sad the music doesnt play in the stream version because ya need the discs also you gonna play the expansions sweet and frist i like the red sky game looks amazing but the blue sky destroy the feeling apparently you are 31 years old do a video on minesweeper with ray tracing game with good graphics but bad gameplay looks sucks the atmosphere is fucked up basildoomhd check the video pls like and share for basidoomhd would like to see the original deathmatch maps with lithium 2 or some lmctf not the bloody single player snoozer next angry bird with r t x you need a 20 years old game to make rtx properly work lololololololol the sun should be bloody red blue skies on a happy sunny day is so not quake i have a rtx 2060 runs ok on low global illumination wheres the shooting light effect where is quake1 quake2 too boring nah it just lacks the charm that made quake 2 so great the ray tracing is cool and all but this has to be one of the worst looking tech demos of all time they ruined the atmosphere it legit looks impressive and reminds me a lot of early 00s games they often had this cheerful and colorful look to them looks amazing and very slow4k even on 2080ti let me out how to completely demolish the artstyle of a game for dummies if only the had implemented some motion blur as well i mean since higher frame rate isnt really possible then some kind of motion blur is the next best thing would look soo nice glad to see someone who knows this game why did they replace the red sky with a blue one this demo shows an interesting future for retro game specially old 3d console emulation i can see in a near future ray tracing can do for such emulators what some upscale filters like hq4x did for 2d console emulators with ray tracing emulating consoles like the dreamcast nintendo 64 or even the playstation 1 will be like playing modern indie titles and i still dont know what rt does on games srry i dont like the sky i prefer orange but the rest of the graphics are awesomeness i played it with the quake2xp mod what they real need to fix is the sound now ugh i can just see it now that rtx catches on everything is going to be chrome in games for the next couple years just like n64 had to have fog in damn near everything and 6th gen had to blur every background at the same time im really looking forward rtx fire in hdr too bad they didnt do this to the original unreal it looks good both ways i never played quake its just quake ii but someone opened the curtians finally the nvidia boys have to entertain the happy buyers of the 1200 cardsenjoy 710 cant see bullets theare is no feeling play like in mars now you play quake in earth itt people who dont know about settings xd but why the fucking sky is not orange does this mean that we can get halflife with raytracing too looks like pre and post total recall ending what a terrible choice to remove all the dark from the game even tho they got the skybox wrong its still awesome i want see cs 16 wity raytracing looks amazing great gameplay as always looks better than battlefield 5 with rtx off damn csgo looks pretty good now looks neat but they totally fudged the atmosphere of the original game what graphics card do u have only time will tell if ray tracing is a feature or a expensive gimmick but right now in 2019 its a meme mister doom this is i really mean it tho this is dont get me wrong this fucking amazing d i think im my left nut blew o you top i have a 2080 60 fps with rtx on lol 130 when off remaster eeeeh swap out the lighting engine for a ray traced version and slap a price tag i think they got the wrong skybox in there xp it doesnt look like hellish mars 035 im 10 years when it first came out quake 2 out in 97you r 3132 ok rraytracing makes games a lot more realistic am i the only one that wishes they had kept and just revised the bloody red fiery orange smoggy overcast dreary sky instead of this new bright clear almost cheery sky wheres the hellish atmosphere damn the graphics look so goodfeels like its a remaster of the game lul omg plz change the fov thank you for posting such a legendary match great to see this remastered in rtx thanks for posting why the fov at like 75 though bro this video seems to have been pretty popular even though i was using a pad but as you guys saw it wasnt the greatest experience there will be several followup videos to this and in future videos ill be attempting to use mousekeyboard but be warned its not pretty and its certainly outside my comfort zone i love when you do commentary over it got sea of thieves a 1440p bench of that would be cool i am getting 10 fps less than you wtf the same settings also you forced max cpu clock my is like on idle at 1514 that aim need a lot of work something is weird about this game the bullets are shooting a bit under the crosshair i restarted the game twice but it seems this is how it got coded the fps you get is dependent on the time of day in environment setup you can change the time of day night of course is more fps since there are less lights the default was current time of day for me so that might be part of the fps differences people are seeing need to benchmark it at the same time of day setting and possibly sun angle since everything is ray traced another great video do you ever take request for future videos i get 66 fps with my rtx 2080 ti why you only get 55 and my gpu is overclocked hey nelly i must download quake 2 your framerate is much better than mine with similar specs im running an evga rtx 2080 ti ftw3 stock and 16gb ddr4 3600 mhz and an i7 8086k 5ghz and with your settings i getting 45 fps did you do any further tweaking minus the oc i oced and i got a few fps improvement but nothing close to yours hey man i respect the work you do and the videos you post are great but there is a thing i dont get why you planning first person shooter on a top end pc with controller you are annoyingly missing the target i thought this game was going to be in butter well i turned on the game and almost got a heart attack hey great video i have the same gpu and am lookung for a 240hz monitor to play fortnite on 240fps ive seen the alienware aw2518 which is available as free and g sync version do i have to spend more for the gsync version or will i be fine on the free version as well ey man you just gotta use nvidia geforce now on my ryzen 7 2700x msi aero rtx 2070 mini itx config the 1080p fps is constant 5762 sometimes 55 but very playable i remember that quake ii supported 3dfx videocards and it was a big leap in graphics now it is the same with rtx thats cool too bad its quake 2 definitely worse single player in the series 1280x720x 50 resolution and it runs 70fps on gtx 1080 gonna go run some mods cause fuck stock q2 im really tempted to get an rtx now any idea if the remaster is compatible with user mods and levels uff i cant play with 60 fps im used with my 144hz monitor and 60 feels like vsync everything is slow and delayed hey i have almost same pc but i have some doubts about it idk can you share your score in benchmark unigine heaven or valley i would like to compare it with mine im getting 10fps with the same settings with a gtx 1060 6gb that demo is showing that rt cores are necessary to run correctly fully raytraced games note this is not a parody video this is the real performance being displayed 000 opengl avg fps 1000 capped 030 rtx avg fps 5 this quake 2 rtx cant be played with gtx graphic card it must rtx graphic card is there a way to switch it to opengl i want to see the game but since i have 1050 ti i think i will just shut up and take my chances it wont be possible welp this answered my question on whether my 1060 could run it or not now try 960x540 gi on low and windowed mode nice video man i own both card 1060 2060 ill do sooner a test comparaison between the 2 side by side im kinda confused why the sound is broken with rtx on on my machine that did not happen the sound is played smoothly how ever the game lags with 8 fps theres a post on steam you can easily increase the fps by disabling global illumination caustics and the steam overlay how do you run it on 1060 im getting an error saying no rtx capable gpu found can you enable any advance feature on the opengl render hell yeah were going back to the old days with shit resolutions this is playable honestly this is basically experiencing the framerates of back in the the old days on modern hardware same here i have gtx 1650 no ray tracing capable gpu found will it run quake ii i have a message no ray tracing capable gpu found and my gpu is also gtx 1060 how to start it then how to play modern games with rt when the 20yearold game doesnt really work maybe i shouldve tested at 1080p that looks a lot more playable rtx on is enabled since you put your rtx gpu or you activate it via a button hello what resolution do you play and how many fps you have i turn 29 40 fps thank you for your answer this is fucking amazing to see having played this map so much 20 year ago only one thing that aint better no metal music can you try minesweeper with rtx you should try cube 2 sauerbraten a very fun game quake iii reigns supreme and you know it how about duke nuke em i used to love this game and doom brings back some many good memories hour of game play on pc it would be interesting to see how well this performs with rtx on while using a nonrtx video card i think variety content would be awesome for the channel i personally really liked your battlefield 1 videos but bf5 wasnt in my interest so i havent been watching the videos for a long time now but if you decide to make more videos like these then ill 100 start watching again its nice and all but does it warrant buying a new card for some lighting effects ill have to wait a while before i get an rtx card looks nice though as a fan of the old quake 3 arena i would love a reboot

glitches while walking sometimes and then stops it also happens when gliding down or in the airany fixes favorite ac game is 2 ac origins bc im obsessed w ancient egypt im playing it on the xbox one x on a 4k tv and for some reason its just better to look at maybe because the frame rate is better idk what console is it on its classic not like odyssey is that ps4 thats poop why dont millennials know the difference between when and whenever my favorite assassin creed game is origin the doctor of cook theradbrad one of the reasons i loved ac3 is because my name is connor as well lol mine is oddyssy because its graphics and its interesting hello friend what headset i buy for ps4 plz help i dont use mic on headset i dont care for mic haytham was far more interesting then connor but i remember when this game come out it was massive i remember my local game shop all signa up even the game plastic bag had assassins creed 3 on it can not believe that was 7 years ago its been a while since ive watched a play through for any assassins creed i honestly dont remember what goes on im excited this remaster sucks but oh well i shouldnt be complaining either cus the dlcs that came with this remaster are pretty good my favorite ac brotherhood havent played origins or odyssey yet i just started playing ac3 and i have no idea whats going on i looked up the story to figure out what im doing and it says the main character is a native american but he looks like an english gent to me im just going around to where the green tells me to go and killing the guys the red dot tells me to kill but i have no idea what the main characters mission is assassin creed iii assassins creed 3 my fav my favorite one is 3 and 4 my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed 3 think about this for a second spider man spider man does whatever a spider can assassin creed 3 do u think that the first assassins creed will be on the ps4 plz let me know i am hoping for a remaster of assassins creed 1224 how to cross this 2nd pole im playing on my pc assassins creed brotherhood always nothing much has changedconsistency is key for ubisoft 5326 those two look like the finnagins from assassins creed rogue at least they look like it nice vid bro black flag unpopular opinion buttt ive been with you since 2012 this one that youre playing right now we need a haytham series thiss not 3 assassin creed syindcet i agree with you saying they dont make games like this anymore the fact that you meet devs well tell them to make games like these again then was desmond played by nolan north love ur vids brad acii was my shit oddessy as it is the only one i have played but it also is a good game overallit does the naval part better than black flqg and has a wide range of wepons and aumor 1516 that bastard killed haythams father and i will never forget him im getting this on switch i watch and got confused i didnt realized that this video is ac3 remastered but it almost same as the old one the only only only assassins creed i dont like is black flag assassins 3 and origins i really really love the assassins 2 and the xbox one assassins creed game about the war of 1812 and connor is the grand master 2016 what an ugly kid that intro gives me chills whatisnameofhin is there no way to get to the stage without scaling the inside of the building just seems ridiculous as everyone and their dog would see you oh they turn it around how convenient 1851 the narrator is john de lancie he played q in tng one of the very best assasin creed game ever made i remember playing it long time ago i first look at a ps3 and ac3 then i rest my choice on a ps4 i was afraid ac3 didnt exist on the ps4 but hey there is hoping for assassins creed samurai assassins creed 3 and 4 were best for me rest got boring real fast oddysey i still need to try though i am biggest fan of you im pretty sure this is ac4 black flag not ac3 as ac3 was with the half native american kid and mainly in the snow doesnt look remastered to me my favorite is the entire ezio trilogy and black flag i miss these games rip i play xbox and i would love to get this game i plad shes gam the intro of this game is extremely boring love your videos brad keep up the good work you should play assassin creed rouge remastered wel the assasins creed series is gonna make a norse viking ac game next and is planning too make a dynasty and ww1 ac game so i cant wait im playing the original iii right now its so much fun one of the best great time period character and story my favorite assassins creed game is brotherhood its sad when the kid looks when he kills him has anyone ever realised that haytham means young eagle in arabic i remember playing this and killing everything that moves good phsycopathic times ac 234 are my favorite especially 3 that was my first ac game actually 1 but that shit was too boring my favorite is ac2 and ac orgins assassins creed odyssey and three you cant remaster a game thats already on next gen i actually liked this game i just didnt like connor but yeah there was something about ps3 games that i really liked a lot more than ps4 i dont know why but aside from a couple games on ps4 the ps3 game just stuck with me more ac3 had the best story out of all what happened to ac 2 we actually need assassins creed black flag remastered agreed great game i play sassans creed three on switch another comment section filled with crybaby morons im about to order ac 3 for ps4 its my personal favorite of the series rad can u please do dying light 2 when it comes out assassins creed origins 920 ah shit here we go again assassins creed 3 is my favorite assassins creed 3 is my favorite this isnt remastered version after ac origins and ac odyssey many things in the previous games make a lot o sense now that was some great music for the introduction 1421 this dude is like tf just happened my birthday is december 21 does that mean im the end of the world i hope they do a remastered of black flag it was so good that was the 1st one they ever remastered that scene where haytham looks over to the new land and the song starts playing always give me goosebumps assassins creed bother hood that doesnt look that much better assassins creed iv black flag is my favorite game ever ac unity assassins creed rouge you have 35games you heve pkayt knowledge altair abilities ezio equals desmond how did you download this in ur comp i like assassins creed black flag assassins creed 3 will always be my favorite assassins creed haythem kenway was a true alpha male hard to believe that haytham kenway is edward kenways son when you learn what happened to them though it becomes believable what is a lot of people coming down to this is really good this is the best assassins creed video game heat makes very good videos him lyrics imagine im so excited i cant wait to see this parkour but what did they do to his face terrible change in face textures did they even talk with the old animation team looks slighty worse than the ps3 version there is a glitch in the first assassins creed so i couldnt finish it this is more of a movie than a game why does it look like the graphics are from 2015 instead of 2019 i have a ps4 and my favourite assasin creed game is brotherhood my favorite is assasins creed original assassins creed 3 this is remastered the faces look like crap it just looks unfinished even they didnt rush the original assassins creed 3 they took their time desmond went to being chubby to being skinny as hell assassins creed 3 my favorites also odyssey hmm is this series the story of the evil iluimnati turn on subtitles and watch 2750 guys i am so happy thanx radbrad i have been watching your vids and i have started a channel today i have 7 views 4 subs i am so happy you can play far cry 5 you can play far cry 5 ac odyssey well have to say every assassin game start is best when the logo comes with that music this game especially haythm part sucks the most and now i say here we go again no remaster same graphics everything same my fav game is assassins creed unity my fav assassins creed game is unity the graphics looks worse yo sir whats your name first game i ever watched you play when you played it the first time of course 347 eye of ra origins alpha odyssey tin next ac set in ancient china just a logical guess this was the series i found your channel i hate commentary on video games like why cant you just not talk and play the game assassins creed iii remastered man finally after all ive been waiting finally assasin creed 3 is now have been remastered i cant wait to play it so whats the difference between legacy and the original one that your playing who all has been here since the first ac3 walk my favourite assasing creed is black flag im currently playing through ac 2 its well good brother hood it looks so bad odyssey is much more good in graphics in every thing wish it was assassins creed 2 though best ac game just a quick question for any1im planning to buy this digitally since this is on sale on switchcan i understand or atleast get a hold of the story if in my entire lifetime i only played acbloodlines on psp lmao anyone getting static on the top during cutscenes my fav assassins creed connor please we need a remastered ac 4 i hope they remaster ac 2 u know that was edward he killed up there playing it now with the new update still a lot of bugs though but good game awesome to play again my favorite assasins creed game is ac3 becuause i know a lot about the time it takes place in assassins creed 3 odyssey and origins arent even assassins creed they blow remakes is the only thing they should be doing this game is a piece of shit i like this game wtf is this it just looks a little brighter thanks so much for a walkthrough of ac 3 remastered because there are no other youtubers that have put up a series of it keep up the great work dear godi love the 3rd game so much assassin creed unity assassins creed 3 playing on playstation 3 would like to win on playstation 4 i finished this game today wow is it me or does william miles sound like alarak from starcraft 2 never made that connection before but pretty sure its the same voice actor small world i feel like radbrad didnt know who haythem was and he was talking about ac4 been top 3 favorite ac mine is odyssey you cant decide just by watching video that graphics has been changed untill you play it by yourself just on thing the characters look good in original desmond ah shit here we go again i like all of them this is my favorite assassins creed game i remember building up a army of red coats chasing me and fight like 50 at once i loved it as a kid lot of great memories i already have the assassin creed collection and they have to remaster them too i have the americas bundle so i had black flag at 3 and freedom cry liberations honestly i like this graphic looks more similar to unity im thinking about getting this game for ps4 but im really having trouble deciding as a person who has not played the original ac3 i feel like i should play this game for the ps4 and try it out however there is so many individuals saying that this game is terrible and not worth buying as i said i havent played the original ac3 so this would be new to me if somebody could reply telling me if this game is worth it or not from my perspective it would be greatly appreciated they took this from destiny lmao assassins creed 3 my fav isnt haythem the son of edward kenway and a templar in ac rouge they should make a show about this the first one fresh old memories the game looks like shit nowhere near what a 2019 game should look like my favorite ac games are black flag then unity the way the clothing worked was so cool and the just everything but idk just my opinion i want to my channel is big unity not sure if i spelt that right this is actually my favourite assassins creed game used to be assassins creed 3 3753 brooo wtf is that my game is assasints creed 2 pest game my favorite ac is revaluation or brotherhood ezio hits different when i was 11 that ship is cool i keep forgetting that charles lee hits kids next ac better be a norse viking game and you can later on in the game conquer ireland my favorite assasins creed is assasins creed origins xbox one assassin creed odyssey assassins creed rogue the third is my favourite and this looks great you are always so greatly positive about videogames i like it assasins creed brotherhood ac3 is the best assassins creed game imo i like assassin creed 3 i love the games that talks about the 19th century or 18th century ac3 remastered mebut it looks exactly the same when i played it you know whatll be a better improvement if ubisoft remade assassins creed the first onei mean like resident evil 2 remake changing the graphics control making it look realistic remastered my ass wii u is the saddest console ever and i have and its getting no new games assassins creed 4 ac3 and ac black flag is the best games imo please can you do a review about assassin creed blackflag because i dont know what happens after story can we continue playing please help you sound like christopher odd its freaking me out i had no idea nolan north voiced desmond hes truly a versatile voice actor this game is amazing i appreciate the playthroughs since i cant splurge on games all the time hahaha its beautiful even in its oldish version when you got off the horse you shoved your head up the horses butt now days they are known as the deep state my favorite assassins creed is assassins creed syndicate why didnt they remaster assassins creed black flag instead black flag is definitely my favorite you can get it free if you have season pass of odyssey syndicate i know im very late but im just now getting this and cant wait to play it my favorite assassins creed is brotherhood or 3 actually i love rogue as well ac4 is my favourite watched jse play origins it looks awesome yuk how can your favourite ac game be odyssey you disgust me my favorite was assassins creed 4 when i first heard about this game i didnt have any intention of getting it the game was alright but i bought it once already and didnt need to buy it again but i ended up having so much fun with odyssey i bought the season pass without realizing it was gonna give me ac3 remastered as well it was a nice surprise rad you are amazing i have been a follower for a long time and i am always excited for your release big love rad where is jennifer kenway the sister of haytham the daughter of edward kenway there is no way to play except murder and violence we have been bored with this way by playing only killing and violence mine is 3 cuz im qbout to get it the graphics look shit here we go again lol my favourite is black flag this is without a doubt the best assassins creed game assassins creed three syndicate was the one that changed up the series so unity was the last in this sort of style assassins creed odyess ac3 still my favorite lol brad saidspeak with the doctor of cook just shut up were interested in the game only not to your rubbish my favorite assasins creed game was black flag as well actually the game was always a good one but the story just didnt give connor a good character his dad is a charmful one though but connor was just being angry and shouting at everyone in the game haytham looks better when its not remasted its like inception lol my fave assassins creed games are this onerouge remastered and unity the newer releases have been glitchy in comparison assassins creed 2 mine fav ac game is unity or orgins key to locate gold target ads ads ads and ads no thx why do people have subtitles on for its annoying why are you talking dont you feel just bcz of this we cant hear what is happening in the background its unpleasant pls shut up my favorite game was assassins creed 3 haha december 21st is my birthday cool cool how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in my way shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow tomahawk chop is my death blow favorite assassins creed syndicate assissans creed 3 is my favourite also assissans creed brotherhood ac rogue and liberation are my two favorite of the series by far i am excited to try syndicate assassins creed 3 is my favourite funny that i got the original game and asssasins creed revelations with the first game assassins creed so yeaah but for some reason i cant play them anymore my mom says you are gonna be a serial killer if you on with killing people my reaction i didnt do it it was him kills guy brutally with axe see it was my hands not me mooom thank you for the great gameplay video so much great moments with one of the best games i just love the desmond miles assassins creed games they are the best for me and i think it is them that made the franchise what it is ac3 is such a nice game it was hated by some because it had 3 hours introduction holding your hand blah blah i personally like it because of that much more immersive and story driven introduction something the present games have forgotten in the pursuit of open world content garbage ac3 remastered is a 100 purchase for my greatest games collection since i have ezios collection for ps4 the only thing i miss now is an ac1 remastered i really hope to have it someday i was there this is a shit remaster assassins creed 2 gave you your 50k likes the odyssey assassins creed is awesome id like to play this one i am trying to get the platinum on this game but one challenge says that i need to get all the weapons and i need crafting recipes but i opened all the chests around the map and i didnt get themanyone knows how to get them was a bit confused when i played the game and i couldnt climb up the ropes rescuing john ac3 is my favorite my favorite is assassins creed 3 ironically please help why in my game connor and desmond run different and when connor is in a tree he cant run over the tree just in a slowly way what is this a remastered i love resident evil my second favorite is definitely assassins creed i love the way you play these games at times i cant stop laughing thanks brad assens creek 3 remasterd assassins creed remastered 3 whenever im looking for a play through i always see brads channel and im shocked of how much he makes the remastered includes all the dlcs my channel subscribe like and comments this is my personal opinioni believe the remastered couldve been way better but personally its best to wait for the price to go low 2000 then it will be worth it especially if you didnt play it but if you played it dont expect so much from this game these graphics are terrible ive seen better itd just how i remember it but better ac4 bflag mc edward kenway was haytham father xd play assassins creed rogue remastred or unity remastered legends says that they are still searching difference between remastered and original i have as3 original but never finished and willing to start over if the remastered is worth it is it wtf youve got ten mill and ive never even heard of you this definitely isnt a remaster its more like a fancy port with better lighting but to this day its one of the most underrated games in the series and by far one of my personal favorites i could always look past the random rifle floating in mid air and the clipping because i thought the timeline and story were terrific id honestly say that its a tie for me between this game and ac 2 followed by brotherhood black flag and origins i really thought unity had potential but was way to buggy and the story was a disappointment i will say that origins was an improvement in the series but didnt enjoy odyssey as much it really looks like they went to the engine used for black flag on those to games instead of using what they did for unity those two games could have been so much more breathtaking than they already were i get that they had glitches but why not use a similar engine my wish now is that they take the best of the original series and combine it with the new rpg elemen assassins creed 3 was always my favorite one black flag is on current gen no need for remaster oo you play as haytham kenway grandson of edward kenway yay a li wait i already new that because i own black flag omg i want dis but im too late but my fav game is unity so far but this may be my fav editwow i said but a lot assassians creed oddyssy the faces on the characters look like they came from the shrek is love animations ac3best ac i like oddest the most the graphics dont look much better ac odyssey was always my favorite assassins creed brotherhood i have not played all of them because of pc limitations but of the ones i have played revelations is my favorite gettin this game by tmr cant wait i remember playing this game for the first time and getting so attached to haytham and then getting so mad when you find out hes a templar my fariot is 3 my faveroute assassins creed game is brotherhood this was the most easiest assasins creed lile it was like your a walking hack i wonder how well this will hold up on the switch they have had some great ports but assassin creed does anybody know how to sprint on ps4 when i press r2 connor only jogs and its lowkey annoying idk what to do cus in the original ac3 all u had to do was press r2 and hold x but idk what to do for this assassins creed roug remaster ac ii becsuse it was the fucking best sc of all time desmond one of the worst looking protagonists of all time looks like emmanuel macron this is one of the greatest franchises ever i really enjoyed it until origins came out then the franchise felt different to me hope the next game is like the old ones know what fuck haytham this and black flag hands down are the best of the series lmaooooo heres your knife back assassins creed still is my favorite assassins game ever ill go as far as my top 5 favorite games ever liberation is so much better than 3please play iti finished it in a weekend and it has one of the best main characters in the franchise looks the same to me the graphics are the same my favorite is ac 3 i first played ac3 when i was 17 the same age as him i and dont know why people dont like him he has a bolder character because of his tragic childhood and life his main goal is to train and revenge giving his tribe freedom which is a heavy burden for a young man ezio in the other hand had a wonderful childhood lived in a peaceful pretty and poetic place until his family was murdered hence he was much different assassins creed 3 was my favorite i know it got a of sht but its play style was amazing my favorite assassins creed games are the ezio collection assassins creed 2 assassins creed brotherhood and assassins creed revelations brad black flag is already on the ps4 since for a few years now u should play it again also my fave assassin creed was the 2 one on ps4 and i also beat it he roles completely wrong over your shoulder not your head it would fk your spine up if you do it like this dude but cary on who like gta san andreas to be remastered it looks bad i wouldnt call it a remastered mines the assassin creed remastered the another one edited assassin creed 1 remastered liberation is really really fun i survived the 21st of december 2012 d mine is assassins creed 2 926 oh shit here we go again my favourite game is assasins creed iii i remember playing it at my friends house when we used his older brothers xbox id love winning a copy cool video by the way its crazy that ive been watching theradbrad for 8 years time really go by fast my favourite is ac origins and bayek assassin in ac origins has now become my role model 1837 it was a sendup of the british nobility including veiled criticism of the head of government neither of whom traditionally have a sense of humour ive never met a queen who liked a knockknock joke apparently shaun has never heard of the time some nobleman farted in the presence of queen elizabeth i then went into selfexile for seven years when he finally came back the first thing the queen said was my lord i had forgot the fart my favorite game is rogue my favourite ac game is ac 2 assassins creed odyssey please play ac 4 again it would mean so much to me whaaaaa there was a remastered version of aciii ahhhhhh assassins creed iii 4725 the backwards dude lol assassins creed 3 is my favorite assassins creed game samee my fav game rn is odyssey which graphics card you use mate wow the lighting has changed everything they should remaster revaluations anyone else really like ac2 if i see desmond again in the next ac game im going to cry for sure my face is odyssey because i love the concept of sparta and athens i busted to this video i love all the games with ezio hes the goat revelation might have been the best hi mr radbrad ive commented again to ask if the ps4 copy of assassins creed 3 remastered is still up for grabs my favorite is liberation oddly most people dont talk about it though but i like black flag was released on xbox1 and ps4 i still like ac2 the most i like assasins creed 2 assassins creed 2 my name is haitham odyssey is terrible should i get this or the ezio collectionim more biased towards ac3 bc the ezio collection looks like a potato i think ive memorized every line in this game mine is odyssey not everyone likes it but i do my favorite assassins creed games are 3 or odyssey i loved assasins creed black flag the storyline was great and the character development as well as the graphics were amazing plus who doesnt love a good pirate shanty i still have it the original assasians creed 3 and i have my ps3 too brad i found your channel off of this game holy shit man i wasnt even 10 years old yet i rly dont see any difrence in graphic just more light that is all dunno maybe it is just me character models still look trash my favorite is any of them in the ezio chronicles ezio was my favorite we basically saw him from birth to death asing creed black flag i found your channel when you played this game the first time some of the hair looks worse at 1416 its just a flat dome ac origins nothing about this really screams remastered anyways great video on your part black flag is my favorite unskippable cut scenes same story same weapons even uglier character models fuck no cant choose between odyssey and revelations lol the game looks like shit so dated assassins creed origins assassins creed black flag assassins creed syndicate favourite my favourite assassins game is origins my favourite assassin creed game is three assassins creed black flag assassins creed rogue the crynation graphic mod is a lot better than this my favorite is 4 plz can i have a copy on ps4 im super fast am subbing who sub to me guys am honest sub and say done ill return fuck i miss assassins creed 3 my favorite ac is black flag and ac3 assasin creed odyssey what was the point in remastering the older games just to remind us how dogshit origins and odyssey are assassins creed revelations the voice of william miles is that the voice of john de lancie tf the graphics are almost the same wow man you can play this gameo damm you must have good pc i wish can play too this game nice btw 2009 2012 desmond sucks he ruins the whole series present day desmond was the only reason i cared about assassins creed no give way for pc you said you wish they would remaster black flag the game is already on current gen consoles what do you mean dude lol loved ac3 but by far my favourite is revelations happy theyve remastered ac3 tho now im watching his second ac 3 series yaaaay assassins creed 4 when you watched the original ac3 walkthrough and brad starts making the remastered walkthrough me ah shit here we go again connor may actually have cousins haythams sister jenny was kidnapped and made a concubine in damascus in the ottoman empire also the man who drove haythams carriage was actually involved in helping to rescue her and later helping haytham kill reginald birch the head templar in great britiain who you first meet inside the opera house before killing the target reginald birch is the man who had edward kenway murdered the target at the opera was called miko he was an assassin the little boy was his nephew and ironically the hidden blade used to kill him was his own it was stolen by haytham in a previous encounter 624 this quote was in both this game and far cry 3 coincidence i think not 624 this quote was in both this game and far cry 3 coincidence i think not 558 people saw this scifi looking glowy wall and decided to spray graffiti on it its not like people in 2012 were in the mindset of the native americans of connors tribe who painted stuff on the wall they thought it was the work of gods none of the bugs left in the original version have been patched daggers and muskets still use tomahawk and axe animations swords still use tomahawk animations for double counter kills haytham still counter kills like connor all said animations are still on par with the last generation consoles where the weapons go through each other in a clash side activities like the assassin recruitment missions barely make themselves known to the player that they exist the textures dont even look equivalent to origins and odyssey maybe even syndicate whats remastered about this game ubisoft didnt even master the original the only improvements i see are to the lighting and the textures the best texture improvements are the cloth textures they are so satisfying however cloth textures and better lighting are not worth buying the same game from 2012 for 60 oh and they remastered liberation well thats just great how well did they remaster it this time yes this ti i find it ironic that you cant eat the apple of eden it sounds like eaten my favorite assassins creed game is black flag 4 6 years ago was when i watched the gameplay of the original game on your channel that led me to keep watching your channel and i have absolutely no regrets theres some definitely some deja vu watching this now the memories good old times my favorite is the one in englend i loved feeding doritos to chickens assasins creed black flag they should make an assassins creed 1 and 2 remastered so we can play the og games and this time actually goddamn make the game better this time nad not do a half aed job and only do graphics and lighting like at least try to make it uncharted 4 level my favorite is either ac3 rogue ac4 or brotherhood it looks bad compared to the original ac3 my favorite assassins creed game is this one assassins creed 3 brad we love you but that isnt a remaster it looks like they shit out the same game the character models look horrible i used to play this on my ps3 and i loved it this is my favorite assassins creed game the first one i ever owned and it got me hooked on the series ive played all of them now except the two newest because i dont have money lol but this is hands down my favorite it doesnt even look that good this is like buying the harry potter books again just because they changed the font waste your money the marked will only flood with more remasterings than actually new content assassins creed odyssey is my fav also im suprised with this remastered look at the all face wtffff original is better lolll 1520 gays best work so far nahhh black flag is still the best i like unity because i can play with my frends if i get one can i have the x box one plz bill burr playing game assassins creed revelations and ac3 are by far my favourite assassins creed 4 definitely the best desmonds trash tf assassinations creed black flag is my favorite my favourite ac game is ac4 translate indonesia please i remember watching the original on your channel when it came out you only play through last of us two times dang man i play through it almost 6 times because i liked it so much it really good black flag because i loved the hunting for outfits and the sailing was amazing id get on and just sail for hours and listen to the singing almost every dayps4 hey brad how did you get this game i bought the season pass which it said i would also get this but idk how to get it fav is odessey and ps4 pls my favorite assassins creed is origin im used to origins and odyssey so im really struggling to get into this game the graphics and the fight mechanics are terrible imo would have loved to see this redone as an open world game with the graphics and fight mechanics of the more recent games i just like being able to go and do as i please instead of limitations my fav is ac 2 my favorite one is 3 because ive always loved native american stuff and its mostly played as a native american my favorite game was assassins creed odyssey also they could port the ac 3 on ac odyssey engine assassins creed 4 black flag assassins creed 3 is my favourite ahhh so nostalgic im not gonna lie i was hoping for a few touchups to the combat like more than just freeaim but im liking what im seeing here assassins creed syndicate 3 definitely black flag or syndicate there is any new mission or not in ac3 my favorite assassins creed game is this one assassins creed iii imagine if they remastered the original assasins creed 2017 new meme my favorite is og ac3 i thought it had a wellrounded plot and good gameplay my favorite assasins creed game is 3 connor is god my favorite is the first and i play on xbox dude is standing with his head in the ass of a horse ah well thats weird my poob hurts help black flag old school the remasters are a waste ubisoft needs to be shot the originals are much better looking the only thing is the environments a upgradeda bit they shouldve left the character models along assassins creed 2 i will be happy if ubisoft would make remaster of ac i and ac ii is this game worth buying assasins creed revolutions is my favourite my favorite ac is deffinetly syndicate mostly bcause of the time it is in assassins creed 3 is almost like the movie the patriot american revolution war movie this was one of the best ac ever just im native american toooo doctor of cook huhweird not making fun of you man investigate the nose on the lower deck brad 2019 bead your voice was much higher in the original walk through we still love you man keep it up brads first part of ac 3 lasted almost half an hour back in the day of course odysseyorigins assassins creed revelations is the best one all of them are my favorite i cant choose odyssey is the best ac yet 3 is my favorite as it was the first one i ever played why does the original actually look better than the remaster hey brad i like what you been doing and i was a member from when you started halo and cod campaigns one of my favorite assassins creed game is black flag the graphics were good and i liked the story line ac always kick ass play borderlands 3 plsssss brotherhood will probably always be my favorite playing the multiplayer mode with my friends is so nostalgic instead of hiding the pieces of eden through again and again why dont they just out in the pacific ocean and throw them in and say good luck finding them templars i wish they would stick with a character for more than one game ezio is everyones favorite and i really think its because we spent so much time with him if he had one game he would be meh i would have loved another game with kennway or the twins my father brought here as a child black flag ending why people playing remastered i got the real thing here i will sell it for just 4 dollars because i dont like it anymore and i got more ac creed games d ps i use paypal so dont try me to give dollars because i live in eu back on dead space 2 i am an og been an awesome journey ps4 mine was this one it was just that i was having so much just killing the guards left behind from the group i play ps4 ac black flag was my favourite game i dont really have a favorite assassins creed game but i do like the older ones a bit more than origins or odyssey theyre all lovely but i prefer the more stealth related games this remastered gets an entire playthrough but kingdom hearts 3 doesnt anyone see that at 346 literally dropping hints about the next games just now noticing this next episode the most boring tutorial ever known to man i remember watching this game with you loooooong time ago lol this was my favorite ac i really liked connor i think origins or odyssey is my top choice now sohow is remastered better this brings so much memories back they should have vikings version of this game assasins creed iii is the best like u brad the next assassins creed is assassins creed kingdom with vikings i dont see the difference between the remastered and the old game they really didnt work on it i dont care it looks the same im just glad its coming to handheld campaign base games without multiplayer was insanely rare if theres a level to every each game this one should be around 100 assassins creed 3 for me definitely was so original and raw for me when it first came out assassins creed iii brought so much duel weapons climbing through windows up trees the rest were trash after i dont know what to day other than im disappointed in the graphicsi mean i always will have this game close to my heart because its so god damn good it had me drooling when i play and i get to actually throw tomahawks at people ahem but the graphics give me a headache its like a major down grade from a decently detailed game in what 2012 ihate the look of it but i know ill get use to the shit because tf am i going to do complain about graphics all day im finna watch and play this game to see whats new assasin creed 3 was actually the best in my opinion assassinan creed odyssey ac brotherhood and ac 3 is the best series the other series of ac is buggy sucks gorila dick time traveler walking backwards out here 4738 my favorite was assassins creed 3 was my first game love it had a lot of great memories first time i watched brad was the original ac3 and this brings back memories best ac wish they kept with this plot

assassins creed 3 happy you did this remastered fav origins as i havent got odyssey yet but odyssey looks even better xbox assassins creed 2 ive been spoilt by the graphical advancements games have made over the years this looks terrible to me unfortunately graphics for me are a big part of what makes a game immersive for some reason o say haytham have a little bit of evie frye in him one of my favorite moments in ac3 was when connor and charles lee were both sitting in the pub right before connor killed lee its like they both had the same mutual respect for each other even though they hated each other yoooo i remember watching this playthrough on the original my favorite is ac syndicate love the cane swords rouge my favorite ac game is blackflag its the first ac game i have played connor kenway was a half cast when everyone forgets about my favorite ac gane ac rogue did you know that edward kenway is hathem kenways dad assassins creed three is the best what is remastered chef of cook

this is remasteredthey havent touched any face detailsthey look like old assassins creedea and ubisoft disgrace to gaming community favorite assassins creed has to go to black flag my fav assassins creed game will always be revelations but i also think the whole ezio trilogy is the best part of the assassins creed franchise assassins creed 4 creed 3 was my favorite my favorite one is 2 ac 4 is my favorite ac3 had the most animations for a single 3rd person character on release conner moves fluidly while previous ac games were clunky have any of you tested all of conners animations he can kill many using only 1 ropedart multiple times and can execute with a snare in a combo everything looks good but the facial textures when you jumped on the sun on stage it kinda reminded me of that level in that tin tin game assassins creed 4 i know im weird my favourite is origins this whole deal with the pieces of eden is so similar to everyone hunting the infinity stonesgems in marvel watching this while playing destiny 2 and thinking reginald birch sounds very familiar ive been with u since 1 mil and my favourite youtuber assassins creed 2 no fucking change appreciate you giving out games my fav is syndicate ig is godlikeoscar my favourite assassins creed game is unity because of the parkour i was with you wen you play dis back in the days when i press start it doesnt start

music too i thought graphics are good it is bad loved ac iii and brotherhood do the full plz assassins creed unity definitely a very good game my favorite assassins creed ist still black flag d this and halo 4 is what got me started on his channel still own ith original games on 360 been here ever since love ya theradbrad what are the best hdr settings 2016 holy shit the kids eyes are terrifying my favorite ac game is ac unity it had so much potential to be a amazing game and also was the stepping stone for origins hey man honestly my favorite ac game has to either be ac 3 or ac 2 but mainly ac 3 since its based on my favorite war nah didnt like the game odyssey is way better me i dont have a favorite cause i cant play them with what i have but i want to try it does anyone have a suggestion on which one i should try when i have the chance for the ps4 the nostalgia been a while since ive played this they also should do ac 2 remastered im gonna be honest i dont like it i might need a sise by side comparison but like even if i do these graphics still arnt impressive i started watching you when you played assassin creed black flag and my favorite is 3 hey radbrad is it me or does anyone else notice how charles lee is such a dogooder and by the end becomes such a monster as a half choctaw indian and american i really wish they would make some more games dealing with this era and westerns maybe make a game that is where you are a chieftain of a tribe and fighting other tribes anyin s keep it up the love this series and while im on my soap box if you think of the chup they are putting out for everyone to get our technology and advancements in ai i can see this happening right now and if anyone has experienced the mandala effect like i have there is definitely something going in and someone is changing history past and present and how the freemasons put everything out there for all who can see and those who cant are meant to be ruled peace isnt it funny how we live this game and history of these games and yet in real life we have the freemasons and other secret societies in our midst they run the lives we live and cause us to think of conspiracy theories there is so much truth in this game to real life if you think about it crazy nostalgia trip i was there when you first played assassins creed iii ac revelations best game for me the soundtrack had me in tears you need to make the rest of the episodes long like this one played all ac games and my favorite has te be ac2 loved the vibe of that one is it me or is the quality kinda potatoish like a snapchat filter for playstation webster dictionary definition of remastered 1 to pay again for something you already paid for and that maybe you still have in your collection 2 to be honest it looks like they didnt even change the character design assassin creed odyssey thanks sir i love all assassin creed games assassin creed odseyy assasins creed 4 is my favorite my favorite is unity yeah i said it aside from the glitches its one of the most complete games theyve given us the character customization was only rivaled by origins offering many options for gameplay styles open missions i havent played odyssey yet the story inside the animus was well scripted towards the end i felt really invested powerful because of its character progression it may have also been because i played it on a ps4 thanks for coming back playing this such nostalgia this was how i found your channel the last of a dying breed my fav ac game is 4 assassins creed 3 is my favorite xbox my favourite assassins creed game is oddyssey it such a big and fantastic game good story and never gets boring assassins creed black flag my favorite is 3 for sure i kinda miss the old school eagle vision mine is brotherhood my favorite used to be the the 4th also until i played odyssey the narrative part of odyssey is what in my opinion made it above all the others my favourite used to be assassins creed rogue but now its unity assasains creed syndicate bc of the setting assassins creed origins because i love egypt and the age that bayek lived in yo i cant believe your doing this over the first was lit its all the same as 3 no remastered thing this is why i love the older assasins creed games cause youre an assasinunlike the newer ones when you are a freaking gladiator killing everyone with an axe and shieldthats bullshit we want the good old assasins creed games not god of war ripoff shit origin is my favorite my favourite is ac rouge ac3 is legendary orins is the best ac game not much change my favorite ac game is 3 it actually made me cry at the end when i first played favorite assasins creed game is odysse my favorite assists creed game is rogue just because it gives you a new perspective for longer than the very beginning and most of the middle of the game if theyre gonna remaster three they should get some action of brother hood 2 and revelations the wisdom of our creed is revealed through these words we work in the dark to serve the light we are assassins nothing is true everything is permitted one of the best game franchises ever made i learned history and had a good ass time playing going to school and knowing what tf was going on cuz i played assassins creed im about to complete sequence 6 and im hyped cant wait for the good old connor outfit on connor assassin creed brutherhood assassins creed brotherhood syndicate assassins creed 2 will always be my favorite are the new ac games worth getting 4739 ughhhhwhy is that guy walking backwards 2015 anyone else find the kids eyes wuerd my favorite is odyssey im late but this is my favorite ac game i just love the native american culture in the game and the strength of conor i have play this game on my ps3 i never noticed just how much desmond looks like ben stiller before definitely one of my favourites my favourite assassins creed is definitely black flag 4 the vibes of being an assassins pirate and sailingexploring the caribbean islands is beautiful shipping with your mates and signing shanties fighting off british and spanish ships ac4 gives off a beautiful vibe and will always be my favourite i loved assissan creed rouge is it just me or does this remaster really not look much better than the original to me it just looks like they made the game brighter assassins creed 3 is this brotherhood asassins creed brotherhood i remember it looking like this when the game came out i like ac creed odyssey my favorite is black flag my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed 2

assassins creed 3honestly 2 and 3 are my favorite but i loved 4 i stoped playing after syndicate becouse i didnt like the games as much as i did the older ones my fav ac was with ezio auditore and black flag 4603 the memories that came back to me once i saw this again one of my favorite game played this on the will u assassins creed unity is my favorite assassin 3 is a cool assassins creed 4 raise the black flag assasins creed 4 black flag im re downloading black flag to get farther assiasans creed is my favorite game series im currently playing odyssey and i love it the graphics remind me of metal gear remake kind of my favorite ac game is 4 because being a pirate was awesome the music is so good and on point mines been 3 for a whileand black flag assassins creed oddessey ac3 was my favorite just for the fact that one of my favorite things to learn was the american revolution assassins creed 3 my favourite is either ii or origins my favorite is assassins creed 2 assasins creed 3 because of gerorge washingtoni mean come on history and a video game in one nerds fantasy ac revelations for sure chief assassins creed 3 the only one i completed my favorite ac game has to be ac 2 i was soooo excited when that game came out man i would watch the trailer over and over and over again man i would go back and play the first one and pretend that i was playing ac 2 lol my mom got it for me for christmas and i was so excited that my brother and i went and searched through her closet for christmas presents she never hid them well and there it was man ive never wanted to play a game sooooo bad lol it took every bone in my body not to tear it out of the packaging and play it right then and there ac 2 is my favorite game of all time man hands down but i will say i loved ac 3 almost just as much same thing with the trailer i watched it over and over again i play on xbox and i actually just dug around for my ac 2 and played through it last week a trip to memory lane just as i remembered my favourite is either ac3 or acunity mostly for the movement innovations cant speak for odyssey or origins because my pc cant handle those best ac was syndicate ac 3 it was the first game i ever played on xbox 360 assassins creed brotherhood i always loved assassins creed 4 black flag this looks awful original is way better assassins creed iv because ships are cool assassins creed liberation remastered is a game that has better graphics that you pay for until you then realise theres no difference assasins creed 4 assassian creed iv i think still the best assassins creed game is revelations the grapple hook was absolute nuts while moving and combined with the parkour the special kills you could do with it was the best my favourite game is either black flag or 3 my favorite is syndicate i need to win this its my second favorite ps4 plz omg i remember watching part 1 of your ac3 walkthrough a year or 2 ago that was how i found your channel ac3 is my favourite assassins creed aswell conner is also my favourite assassin he watched his mother die his village burned to the ground he had to kill his best friend and his father as well as watch his mentor die and in the end he was betrayed the men he sought to help were the very ones that drove his people away making his journey worth nothing all he did was create a nation he originally wanted no part of assassin creed revelation og ezio assasin s creed 4 this is my favorite creed yesssssirrr unity oh shit i wonder how will the altair look like if it looks better i will definitely try this remaster i like assassins creed 3 because connor is a goat ac4 was amazing and my fav game of the series man im eagerly waiting to see you playing the new borderlands franchise stay healthy man assassin creed 3 multiplayer is one of the best assassins creed brotherhood for sure lets do this love when you say that lol my fav character is edward hes brash and funny guy and a great character my favourite is black flag by far it is beautiful hey brad i love watching your videos man assassins creed iii is hands down my favorite ac game however im very bias ive just finished my studies in 18th century american history and settling into my new apartment unfortunately for me i scratched my ac3 bc i forgot to eject the disc while moving i have a ps3 as well as a ps4 but ac3 was a ps3 hard copy i would love to have another one if you havent given away yet im really looking forward to this one thank you and i concur kingdom come deliverance has insane lock picks this game is really cool until you switch from playing haytham to playing connor connor is such a whiny annoying little bitch it made me wish there was a button to slap myself back to the basics i really loved revelations the multiplayer animations were all i needed to get the game favorite still has to be ac black flag but origins is a close second connor finally fixed his grandfather biggest and most mistakes im proud of him that was ac3 and now what a remastered version of that well im okay with that oohhh beee soft i hope they do a remaster of the fourth one the fourth one is already on ps4 and xbox one though i love assassins creed syndicate please play the full game my favourite ac game is absolutely assassins creed 3 just because connor is so freaking epic the 3rd assassins creed game i played was assassins creed 4 i absolutely loved it i played it on the xbox 360 but played origin on ps4 and odyssey on xbox 1 but black flag was my favourite my favorite fucking game this is dope ac odyssey is one of my favourites as its a mix of ships land and based off the peloponnesian war assassins creed 3 forsure assassains creed 3 connors story really hit home i hope the remastered version is better ive played every single ac game ever but the og ac3 just wasnt that good to the point where i stopped playing halfway and went on to black flag what they should do is remaster ac 1 i would die of excitement lol my favorite assassin creed is black flag i kinda wabt to play it but i already played the original version wow last time i saw you your were at 900k subs youve come a long way congrats man its my most favourite part and never forgott desmond and connoe they release the same game every year with an incriminating number slapped on the end of it and decided that was too creative assassins creed 3 for sure the best favorite ac game is odyssey my favorite assassins creed game is unity but i have only played 3 also i love your channel so they remastered arguably the weakest entry into the ac story line wtfi mean i initially loved the interweaving of ac with the american revolution history teacher here but connor is undoubtedly the weakest assassin to get emotionally involved with i found myself wanting to play haytham way more connor just wanted to kill periodhaytham had a mission beyond just killing assassin creed 4 black flag and origins favorite game is assassins creed 3 this is the game that brought me to your channel back than now we playing it remastered time flys my favorite was black flag because i love pirate games and i loved watching on this channel just because of how into the game you seem to be awesome work youre doing with your channel i enjoy watching your videos very much assassins creed rouge easily the best game please pick me for the ps4 copy 3 is definitely the favorite can i have a copy back when modern day wasnt shit assassins creed iii was my honest favorite it was the first one i ever played and finished while enjoying the story line my favorite assassins creed game is unity 3 one of the best assassins creed games hands down ubisoft has a tradition of creating faces of the characters they always make men faces a lot nicer than women ive never seen a lady face that look acceptably beautiful in their games this is crazy ac 3 was the first series i watched on your channel but my all time favorite would either be botherhood or black flag even though ive never played them my fav ac game is ac 3 and now that the remastered version is out i need itinsert spongebob meme reference so uh yeah i want that giveaway im on ps4 btw they did remaster far cry 3 brad its far cry 3 classic edition assassin creed 3 really loved the game did everything and felt really connected to the storyline mine is assassin creed 4 black flag love the ship combat definitely the first game is my favorite issa classic creed 3 the og assassins creed is my favorite holy that game rly helped thru hard times im also a fan of odyssey but my fav was probably revelation simply because i loved the opening cutscene the only thing i hated was u didnt play the main assassin till halfway through but i liked ac3 my top 4 1 assassins creed ii 2 black flag 3 unity 4 syndicate assassins creed odyssey id say assasin creed syndicate because of jack ripper dlc brad lobe your vids man i just realised one of the voices in the beginningthe dad is the same actor who played q in star trek the next generation assasins creed 3 i want it strange i cant run this game all i see is a black screen 2853 really this is what they called remastered i was seriously considering going to buy this but good god im not paying money for a downgraded version ac odyssey ended up taking first place for me but i also love greek mythology so that surely had a lot to do with it assassin creed 1 d is anyone else having issues with sprinting on the ps4 i can only jog and the usual sprinting methods are not working how do i fix this why the fuck does this game look like borderlands might get a lot of hat but ac3 is the best its the first one i ever played this game sucks assasins creed 3 im on xbox please im begging i want it so bad speak to the doctor on cook im sorry bro but that made me laugh wow ac came a long way with the graphics assassins creed orgians my favorite is two definitely a close second is revelations my fav game is assassins creed three grew up on that it looks like a new game dont make me laugh it looks like shit clearly paid for brotherhood is the best ac imo id have to say my favorite assassins creed game is either 3 or revelations btw if youre reading this i play on ps4 assasins creed 3 the best assassins creed game why does desmond look so much like richthofen assassins creed origins i genuinely thought this was apart of ac revelations not ac3 all this time i thought you went into that temple in reve lol assassins creed black flag wtf i was litterally just thinking of this great showcase my first assassins creed game was syndicate pc excellent texture detail world design but repetive gameplay last night i got a c 3 remastered to go along with unity origins black flag rogue odyssey syndicate liberation remastered im late to the party but i can see why the series is held to high standards for gamers of this franchise the remastered looks great gameplay is smooth thanx for posting my favorite ac game is black flag its the only one i ever playedi also completed the story its very very good i like origins and odyssey too syndicate assassins creed 4 see this is a remastered game not like dark souls remastered which was just wholly reused assets with a few minor visual changes that you have to look for to notice lol assassins creed 3 wow this looks good i never finished pt 3 guess i can do it now you should do the full walkthrough assassins creed 2 for me has still not been beaten 2013 graphics this is a remaster its all it is about assassins creed 3 you better be doing a full series of assassins creed 3

to say my favourite ac game is ac3 but im not sure i love brotherhood and it was the first game i played but i feel more attatched and intersted in the story of ac3 p assassins creed 3 was my favorite the real historical characters really made it fun to play assassins creed brotherhood best assassins creed odyssey is your favorite deam you are more wierd then i through assassins creed brotherhood hands down assassin creed 2 this game got me into gaming my favourite ac game would be black flag d assassin creed 3 ps4 syndicate my favourite is origins my favorite is oddyesy even though i dont have it i always loved how they introduced the title for this game assassins creed 3 is the best one ever made change my mind assassin creed 3 conner was the best assassin assassins creed rogue assassins creed black flag is my favourite oh my god id love if i got this game so much by far my favorite and ive always wanted to play it favourite ac game is brotherhood because i got it when i was 13 n it was so dope doing effortless double takedowns assassin black flag my favorite assassins game is odyssey the rpg elements and the combat are smooth plus the hours of gameplay that it brings just pure fun its same to me this is just to take money from kids that they didnt catch aciii realease am i the only one who doesnt find anything new in this remastered game assassin creed 4 is my favorite my favorite assassins creed game is 3 after that is rogue back when it was really about assassin creed assassins creed 4 ac3 is my fav ac game i will always love black flag they should have remastered black flag this i love the gameplay but i didnt like the story of ac 3 arrrr black jolly roger was me jam me harty this is my favorite assassins creed game but it really doesnt seem like they did much to the detailed graphics well sadly i was to young for most of the early ac games but i loved ac 4 black flag and put in a ton of hours on it making my ship and trading bigger and better has anyone else seen the person walking backwards at 4739 tbh this is a shitty remastered game graphics are outdated and the animations suck my favorite is brotherhood because of ezio my favorite is ac origins my favorite ac game is black flag my fav game is origins the original games facial graphics were so much better assassins creed iv black vlag i just finished the ezio collection and been saving this games to finish out the series cant wait to play it 3 is the besttt my favorite is still probably assassins creed 4 favorite ac game is black flag remember when radbrad was just a small

assigns creed game is syndicate aw man brad these questions are are but this one is the hardest i have to go with assassins creed 4 or odyssey the ship gameplay is just to good and ik about rogue but the jackdawl is the real og battle ship of the brotherhood my favorite assassins creed game was black flag but rogue holds a special place in my heart as it was the one that got me hooked on assassins creed games ac brotherhood was the best dont me anybody else having problems loading the game on ps4 after the ac logo appears it stays on a black screen my favorite assassins creed is rough my favorite is ac oddessy ac 3 was by far my most favorite out of the ac universe i only played 3 assassins creed game so my favorite is odyssey note the game i played were syndicate odyssey and origins in that order mine is assasins creed odyssey only thing holding me back from buyin this is that fuckin awful tedious 5747 hour long introduction ac 3 was one of the top ones but the whole desmond series ac 1ac3 was my favorites it had such an amazing back story everyone knows that the best assassin creed game is black flag my favorite assassins creed is 3 and i am glad they remastered it black flag was my favorite assassins creed black flag my favorite ac game will always be unity a lot of people hate on it because its so glitchy and off but i love it i think this is the best assassins

in my opinion hope u make more of this game good work all these people commenting that ac iv was the best of the series i stopped playing it halfway thru due to the fact that the game was so water driven read pirates and having to upgrade that damn boat just to advance in the game really was a let down seriously water warfare did nothing for me as a gamer and made me dislike the game as a whole i resorted to watching the rest of the game on here to just finish the story line yo brad during ever other assassins creed game y said ur fav was black flag but now this one is it really that good

assains creed is origins i think someone didnt understood what the difference is between walkthrough and lets play my favorite ac games that ive completed in order first to last ac origins ac 3 ac unity ac black flag ac 2 ac syndicate thats supposed to be remastered how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in my way shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow tomahawk chop is my deathblow 4740 is he walking backwards wtf assassins creed 3 wasnt first ac game i picked up but the first o finished i had purchased it for the ps3 and played it till the disc sadly got scratched with buying a ps4 i was hoping this game got remastered and it did so hopefully i can pick this jem up or by some lick from god win the giveaway for ps4 ac iii was what got me into the assassins creed series definitely one of my alltime favorites but ac iv black flag was a close second btw the lock picking game in unity was the toughest in my opinion assassins creed 3 was always my favorite if im being honest but revelations was dope ash too mine is black flag the best assassins creed its revelations black flag is my favorite this has to be one of the worst remasters i have ever seen almost all the faces look like complete shit assassins creed 3 black flag remaster is the must my favorite assasins creed games is assasins creed 3 assassins creed 4 is the best this brings back so much memories when i played this and im 13 now and played this when i was like 5 assassins creed 2 ezio was my favorite assassin ac 3 was one of the best ac that ubisoft sent for us i mean i love most acs but these last ones i just found them wack for what the game and story was most acs after this one are full of glitches and even bad gameplay i played ac black flag that was decent imo unity wack as hell and even ac syndicate it was my last drop of patiencewaste of money that i spent on a ac its good that they remember this game i hope they see that the last acs are not worth the cash grab ac black flag is the best assassins creed 2 your a true gamer man i remember playing this a few years ago my favorite assassins creed game is four assassins creed unity had the best customisation and cooperative play my favorite is unity my favorite assasins creed is brotherhood assassins creed 4 3 revelations graphics havent changed the ezio trilogy was my favorite the first game i played was ac 3 on ps3 i liked the indian style thing ive played all the ac games so far my favorite assassins creed game was ac 2 by far ps4 my favorite ac game has to be ac 3 its amazing in my opinion i beat ac 3 two times and when i get this its gonna three 1 is pretty good assassins creed origins is my favourite they still havent fixed desmonds hair or facial animations compare cutscene desmond to gameplay desmond its like quality downgrades everywhere i mean to think this would be where they shouldve started damnit ubisoft game only has new lighting some extra textures and resand bam now its a remaster go look at metro or final fantasy for real remasterthis here is called a regraphicretexture againdamnit unisoft do the full thing wow this blows my mind i found this channel when you originally play

ubisoft im just gonna change the filter and change the resolution of textures done my favorite is the black flag dlc and i can play 4 or odyssey because im broke lol unity assassins creed is a great game in general but my favorite is assassins creed 3 the new mechanical system the new way you could use ships to basically go to war with was astonishing everything about ac3 except for the graphics put this up to be my most favorite one ps4 unusually my favourite ac game is revelations partly because it was the game that introduced me to the franchise play more this is like the first assassins creed i played fully what has happened to the faces yo i past history class because of this game my favourite assassins creed game would have to be 3 ac3 was my first ever ma15 game and when i found

assassins creed game is origins anyone realize the person walking backwards 4739 i still think assassins creed unity is good tho surprisingly my favourite is assassins creed origins i always loved ac2 but origins just took my perspective by storm my favourite is actually assassins creed 3 its due to the tomahawk the ending was also pretty great including the dlc assassins creed brotherhood was my favorite love ur vids theradbrad definitely want to see more of this game bro this game changed so much assassins creed black flag brotherhood my favorite ac game is 3 as a boston native the setting was exactly what i was looking for great story and in a interesting time period it was a very solid game my favourite game as ac 4black flag loved how he had two swords 3 is my favorite i wouldve enjoyed watching the full opera just turn on the brightness and youll have a remastered version my favorite is this assasins creeds i loved the open world and the 2 sides of the story as the temple dudes and the assasins dude the nostalgia i remember when brad asked what video was his viewers first of him i really thought theyd make this game look good its really hard for me to decide which one is my favorite i love ac 2 black flag and syndicate the most though assassins creed iii is my favorite because it was my very first assassins creed and it really what got me more into the assassins creed franchise this game always has been and always will be my favourite game of all time my favorite assassins creed is probably 3 assasins creed 3 cause it was first assasins game and i loved it 4750 omg i remember you saying doritoz to all the chickens it sounds cheeky buy my favorite assassins creed game is bloodline which is exclusive to psp blag flag is definitely my favorite hands down youve played about 258 give or take a few games since you played this the last time assassins creed iv black flag is my favorite one and i beat it in four days with 100 synchronization and it was fun the whole way i havent gotten a chance to play ac odyssey but when i do i might enjoy it as much as you be sure to let me know how long it takes to beat odyssey ac unity my favorite is i think 3 or odyssey been watching you for years and youre still amazing my favorite assassins creed was brotherhood i loved calling in assassins and watching them destroy everything lol how do you compare this game to darksouls this game had the easiest combat ever assassins creed rogue was also a lot like 3 and i think thats why i liked it so much my favorite ac game is ac3 i think its the best haha its great man cause i remember watching the original walkthrough of the game on your channel mines origins i love the way origins and odyssey is played out but i honestly miss the way the series use to play out mine was assasins creed iv black flag assassins creed 3 and black flag are my best assassins creed games my favourite video game is assassins creed syndacate and unity assassins creed 3

first liked then start watching assassins creed 3 assassins creed brotherhood with ezio was my favorite because i would steal all the civilizations and guards money n work my way up to buy the horse stands n all the shops to gain even more money and upgrade ezios weapons and suits 4 was the best one of all time it also had the biggest map my favorite ac game is the original one from 2007 during the 12th century with altair i think they spoiled the franchise with this edition it is too long and gets boring at some point in my opinion they should remaster the first one i also enjoined very much ac 2 with its two expansions what you do for living man how you can buy every single new gamehow many console last version do you have by the way my favorite assassin creeds game is 3 i expected multiplayer assasssins creed 4 was my favorite game it helped me through tough times and watching you made me survive those tough times my favorite is ac4 please play the whole thing my favorite

was just so beautiful favorite assassins creed game is ac syndicate honestly its the best out of all the seires been subscribed for a few years now found you playing watchdogs and been watching since my favourite was black flag but also played ac3 for many many hours my favorite ac game is 3 i win the giveaway thats it everybody this is thee best assassin creed game ac 4 was my favorite mainly because of the naval battle stuff for a while i avoided the naval shit but when i got into it i couldnt get enough of the game my favorite ac game is aciii mainly because of the tyranny of king washington dlc did they change the intro part and parlour part assasins creed 3 my favorite assassins creed game is 3 and i cant wait to get it for my x box best assassins creed game was revelations 3 is my favorite assassins creed assassins creed 2 best ac game its not a good remaster change my mind assassins creed 3 all the time favorite ac game is ac 3 it was the first i played and has a special place in my heart assassins creed 4 is my favorite i started watching your channel around the time you did the og walkthrough i have like three accounts since then lol i want an assassins creed set during these times that has an open world as big as odyssey my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed unity this one and ii are definitely my favorite ac my favourite ac game is syndicate hmm well my favorite assassins creed would have to be assassins creed 2 that captain is a chicken did mills die why are the faces the ugliest thing ive ever seen yo did they make it on ps4 now cuz i love this game on ps3 this definitely does not look nearly as remastered as it should be what was the point of telling the captain that information not much of a remaster tbh ive played all the assassins creed games but i havent played the new one yet but out of all the games my favorite is assassin creed 3 my favorite assassin creed is this one the games around that time did all have the enemy highlight they copied it from the earlier assassins creed games my favorite is assassins creed 2 like the missions were all so in depth and they were all very fun especially the one with flying contraption ive only played like 2 assassins creed games but i guess 2 was good my favorite assassin creed game is 4 how did you gain so many subscribers from one million that quickly black flag is my favorite they need character customization in the assassins creed games creed 4 idk if the giveaway is done yet or not but i really liked assassins creed black flag ive never really been able to find a good pirate game on the ps4 or ps3 since then edit brad if youre reading this you should totally shout out the people who win the giveaways i think that would be cool assasins creed brother hood is i liked the vid my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed unity in my opinion why fight the people who are going to help you with your assassination there was way more than five men on the boat ac origins and brotherhood i like the boat scene his name is haythem and not desmond ac black flag is the best ac game to date 3842 i thought the character in game said oh shit connor my love is back why would any of those people assassinate the guy assassins creed unity was my first ever since i started playin the game i couldnt stop would like to get a ps4 copy of 3 my favourite assassins creed game is blackflag this is defiantly my second i need this for my ps4 that other man wants you to kill that guy too how is he so good at seeing things i havent got that far in this game yet ubisoft were never good at making remasters is this the playstation 3 version that is remastered i have the ezio collection should i get this you have way more advertisers by now my favorite is assassins creed 2 it was the first i played so its special to me is haythem a templar been a while since i played these games assassins creed iii assassin creed 3 3 is definitely my favorite ac game odyssey is 2nd then 4 is third odyssey for sure i played 2 3 but they were not as good that game was a masterpiece brotherhood was my favorite assassins creed black flag i cant choose my favorite between ac 3 and revelations ac 3 was the first i had ever played and it has a place in my heart for that revelations was just all around a great game assassins creed black flag was the best assassins creed i played i remember playing the campaign a lot i even have everything unlocked 100 done the multiplayer had me playing all day and night it was just an amazing game assasins creed brotherhood was by far my favorite really anything ezio auditore is great assassins creed black flag this is awesome eeasily number 3 i remember watching the original as they were coming out didnt people have a problem with ac 3 or did everyone love it lmao as always awesome brad my favounite ac game is brotherhood oh gush the nostalgia the best assassins game is definitely the assassins creed 3 i loved that game and it was the start of my interest in the independence war i would love to play that game again on ps4 watched u when this came out and im proud to watch this again a few years later on my favourite assassin creed was unity my favorite ac game would be assassins creed black flag assassins creed odyssey assasins creed unity is my all time favorite ive played ac origins and syndicate my favorite i would say is origins ive platinum that game i heard a lot about this game hopefully i win im on ps4 they couldve made the graphics more better like comon 4732 we all know what you were thinking brad and what you wanted to do my favorites ac series are ac brotherhoodac blackflag and also ac iii if u ask why just those ac series i ever played v best assassins creed was 2 for sure fight me bro my favorite one is assassins creed brotherhood definitely getting it but they couldve done more favourite one is freedom cryblack flag never tried the recent ac games tho my fav ac game is definitely ac3 this is what got me unto the series and i think it is the best i play on xbox and i would love a copy thanks i loved playing brotherhood my favorite ac game is actually rogue oddly enough my favorite assassin creed is black flag assassins creed lll was my all time favorite asassins creed 4 es mi fav my favorite video was assassins creed unity my favorite assassins creed game is ii syndicate is my favorite this was my favorite ac the music the story the combat and parkour were all great imo that being said im also from boston so i may be biased can you please tell me which console youre playing syndicate my favorite assassins creed game is surprisingly ac3 i liked the setting and time period it was in my favorite assassins creed game is black flag because i remember buying and playing it when it came out exactly ok holy crap better be better bc original 3 missions sucked worse its all over the place but the combat is badass and i liove that when your in combat enemies just keep coming really feels like an war instead of just killing the one patrol its all quite but overall missions total shit and allies help u their missions to have them join u are eh i have no idea why people hate this game it is easily one of the best games in the series assassins creed unity is my most favorite ac game my favorite assassins creed game is black flag assasins creed black flag did it come out for season pass users in odyssey yet stop editing proof that ac3 was perfect the way it is i started you chanel with the original assassins creed 3 this was my game back then on the 360 assassins creed iii was actually my favorite one assassins creed odyssey is mine i would have to say that by gameplay black flag is my favorite because that is the only one i have played sigh i have this game and its taken way too long for me to realize haytham kills his father can anyone tell me what happened to his sister assassins creed the first one is my favorite assassins creed 2 hands down the best awesome graphic man this is and will always be my favorite ac game they did well with the remasterbesides the faces black flag is easily my favorite brother hood is my favourite ac game personally my favorites is ac2 and ac odyssey omg i love this game i found u when u played prototype 2 tied between odyssey brotherhood and blackflag oml im just now realizing how long ive been watching brads videos i was here when he did a walkthrough of the original ac3 thats crazy time went by so fast assassins creed origins honestly i would say my favorite ac is 3 because its the one ive played the most but there is just something about revelations thats sooo good revelations was my favorite ac 3 was a little glitchy so hopefully they fixed all that in the remaster if they could redo all the games 1 2 bh rev 3 4 syndicate with the unity parkour and combat then id buy them all again i thouht the remaster will have good graphic honestly 3 was my favorite i also liked black flag favorite assassins creed game might be origins but black flag is definitely a close second my fav is 3 out of all assassinscreed games assassins creed 2 i liked the brotherhood it was really good game including the 2nd and 3rd my favorite assassins creed game is origins the first series i watched on your channel was assassin creed iii my favorite assassins creed game is ac brotherhood my favorite is black flag but i havent played alot of the new ones it is beautiful but some scenes need to stay original hehe assassins creed ii it was so good i loved it one of my favorite assassins creed games my favorite is assassins creed black flag the best one my favortie assassins creed is 3 beacuse it was my first assassians creed and my mom didnt let me play it so my dad secraetly bought me the game people will maybe think im weird but my favorite ac is the ezio trilogy i know there is 3 games but idk how to rank them so yeah just loved the story of ezio and the

history the way it really happened in ac odessey about something unnecessary we make our own history through animus by having dialogue choices can even fuck a assassins ancestors mother if i want history to progress like that or maybe make them gay lesbian if i want to this is evolution of technology breaking of lore is what is the biggest evolution human ever achieved my favourite assassins creed is probably black flag ps4 btw wow an amazing journey this has been the first time i found this channel was when you played this game on the xbox 360 my fav is assassins creed odyssey my

century it takes place in best in my opinion is ac3 and unpopular opinion but connor is my favorite assassin my favourite is hands down assassins creed odyssey 83 series playlists between the original to the remake on your channel ac3 has been my favorite game out of all of them i liked unity but ac3 is the best one always hoped so they remastered it on ps4 ans they finally did my favorite ac will probably always be ac2 i think just from a development standpoint it did leaps and bounds for the series and helped solidify the franchise as a whole also its just stupid fun to explore the italian countryside with the likes of ezio auditore da firenze the ending is also super badass and sends chills up my spine anytime i think about it my favourite ac has got to be black flag or rogue my favorite assassins creed game is black flag 1 assasins creed 2 assasins creed 2ezio 3 assasins creed brotherhoodezio 4assasins creed reveloutionezio 5 assasins creed 3 5 assasins creed black flag 6 assasins creed rouge 7 assasins creed chronicles 8 assasins creed unity 9 assasins creed syndicate 10 assasins creed origins 11 assasins creed odyssey 12 assasins creed remastered when they retextured they could have at least put more effort into it assassin creed 3 is my favourite i played that game non stop assassins creed 2 assassins creed 2 my favourite assasin creed is number 4 how many people were voiced by robin atkin downes i swear that nearly every other character sounds suspiciously similar to kazuhira miller my favorite ac game has to be 3 i completed it about 7 times on ps3 and when

it came out favorite of all time is assassins creed 3 could play it all day really wanted to play this but the intro as his father was way to damn long my favorite assassins creed game was assassins creed 3 i really liked every detail of the story and it being set during the united states revolution era but to be honest every single assassins creed game is great since the developers do take their time on researching and making each game according to its era having this game remastered is really awesome you are the best brad i found your channel back in 2012 right before the game launched if i remember correctly but favorite assassins creed is still honestly this one i loved the story in 3 and the combat and timeline the new ones are great but i still like the classics better my favourite game my favourite was assassins creed 3 my favorite is assassins creed syndicate and i want assassins creed 3 for my brother because he love that game as lttle kids i played assassins ceed 3 my whole

the customization and the sword of eden black flag was the best one for me because of edward kenway he was very likable anyone know the issue about triple monitors for assassins creed iii remastered for me show only one monitor adjust 5760x1080 before remaster i used to play assassins creed iii with triple monitors has got to be assasins creed odyssey hands down honestly mine was brotherhood or unity not that big of a difference but looks pretty dang good my favorite ac game would be syndicate 4600 admit it ubisoft this was the best music you ever had in your series wait its out my favorite ac game is odessy or brotherhood i dont really like what they did with haytem kenway conner was 1 of my favorite assassins back then assassins creed black flag the first assassins creed game i played i cant believe brads favourite ac game is odyssey to me its easily the worst one in the series assassins creed rogue was my favorite from the bunch black flag is my favourite maybe also syndicate thanks for the videos my favorite is origins taking the story to the begining was fascinating do more please if they make the ac brotherhood or revelations game mechanics same as ac3 or ac4 black flag that would be better idc what yall say ac 3 is the best brotherhood and assassins creed 2 who is waiting for ac1 and ac2 remastered my favourite ac game is assassins creed 2 and brotherhood because they explore the beginning of the series and characters perfectly my favourite ac game is iv black flag assasins creed4 the guy you assassinate at the start looks so different also whyd the get rid of

newest ac lets plays cant wait for another hitman game to come out those are always fun to watch my favourite is ac4 or origins havent played odyssey yet though favorite ac will always be brotherhood the online multiplayer was amazing as well kinda weird with the faces but i can get over it because everything else thats remastered looks amazing started watching brad since the original assassins

i have the original non remastered version still play from time to time like if you have the original ac 3 non remastered my favorite ac is syndicate despite the bugs i like assasins creed syndicate ac3 was genuinely my favourite i have gotten a lot of hate for that opinion who else loves how much brad says how convenient my favourite ac game would be 2 i just love how simple it is with out all of those fancy gadget just you your blade that it my favorite is is assassin creed rogue unity was my favorite it might have had its glitches and bugs but if you get rid of those its nearly the perfect ac game detailed customization addicting executions smoothish parkour and a story worth playing my favorite assassins creed games are black flag rogue and odyssey theyre all so good my favorite is 3 thanks for the video i have not played every game but loved ac2 the best favorite is most definitely black flag this is legit deja vu first ever video i watched from you was this game way back when it came out i think brotherhood will always hold the highest place in my heart the setting was so beautiful i never win a giveaway my is ac2 my favourite assassins creed game is black flag revelations or 3 ac 2 was the game changer for meloved exploring and stabbing but anything with the first civilization mystery just blew my mind i tried playing this game at the time but was a bit burnt out from the ac2 expansion games i would love to play this now assassins creed brother one of my all time favorite games my favorite ac game is assassins creed odyssey most definitely assassins creed 3 is actually my favourite in the series assassins creed rouge odyssey is my favorite this game has always been my favorite in the series it was the first one i played and in my opinion takes place in the most interesting time period assassin creed black flag my favorite ac creed is the 4th because i love being at sea with the chants xbox one btw never played any other assassins creeds my favorite assassins creed is odyssey assassins creed origins will always be my favorite do more please i love this game it was the first one i played on ps3 assassins creed syndicate my favorite is brotherhood it is interestingbeautifuland awesome my favorite ac game was the third one did one civilian say hes a marvel i heard and saw it say the lines it is because the

and i loved that one as well well my favorite ac is actually ac3 cause i learned so much history of america and its fun thanks radbrad assassins creed odyssey is the best yet i loved it og assassins creeds are better then syndicate and any that comes after that my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed 3 ac4 was for sure my favorite but i also like this one a lot playing this on ps4 would be great my favourite was assassins creed 1 i know it was little boring playing same like missions often but itll give as new gaming experience thats my all time favourite 3 is the fav for me so i bought the season pass for oddesssy on my ps4 does it come with ac3 what i dont get is why does brad laugh at everythinglike someone walks he just laugh for no reason you good brad assassin creed odyssey is my favorite because after watching your videos on it i bought the game and loved it i hope i get a copy of remastered though that would be awesome mine is pretty much ac 3 thank you for giving two copies of the game thats really cool of you assassins creed odessy my favorite of the games is ac 2 full game please hi i liked ur vid my favorite game is assassins creed rogue ac4 bf really needs a remaster even tho it has had good graphics atm but a remaster would just keep me glued on my chair assassins creed origins best ac cant wait mines still shipping will come tmrw i dont usually watch brad but i have one question why doesnt he use a face cam this is my favorite by far ac3 man i love most of the assassins creed games my favorite is actually probably 3 or brotherhood i sadly have never played black flag or oddesy last one i played was actually my favourite and it was the 4 but story i am a sucker for the ezio line shame im on a pc and probably cant run this and neither nothing after syndicate love the videos please keep them coming my favorite is ac game 2 assassins creed blackflag giveaway ps4 my favorite ac game is the first mostly because is the first game i played on 360 so i keep it close also was the first game in which i unlocked all the achievements my fav is ac3 ac3 is my least favorite ac game worse than unity rouge exio with the white robes was my favorite actually ps4 and this assassins creed loved it since it came out my favorite will always be assassin creed brotherhood i cant decide between this game and odyssey for favourite i would love to be able to replay it remastered on ps4 brotherhood has a small spot in my heart brotherhood is my favorite my favourite assassins creed game is ac unity assassins creed black flag assassins creed is my favourite video game franchise and 3 was one of my favourites i would love to have a copy of ac 3 remastered for xbox please assassins creed 3 is my favorite for sure black flag was by far the best one i played so far odyssey is up there too i do not see any improvements i was expecting more ive got xbox 360 version on xbox one x and it looks exactly the same on 4k tv assassins creed 3 was the series that brought me to your channel and im feeling pretty nostalgic right now weve come full circle and thats pretty beautiful man ac syndicate was my favorite we need you to keep going with the remastered games brad has played so many assassin creed games hes practically an certified assassin assassins creed 2 was the first game in the series i owned and completed i tired origins but the loot system was retarded and ruined the game it was just an excuse for ubisoft to add microtransactions rogue was always my favorite i really wish they continue shays story mine is probably black flag i havent played odyssey yet wanting to when a copy of ac3ps4 and my favorite assassins creed is assassins creed origin favorite assassins creed was origins class of 2019 i prefer assassins creed brotherhood you has play this game 5 year ago man ps4 my favorite is unity assassins creed 2 will always be my favorite ac rev is my personal favourite cant wait for brad to feed the animals doritos again lmao my favourite was the second assassins creed iii iv are my favorites and i would love to have ac 3 remastered on my ps4 pro played every ac except this black flag was my favorite love the pirate feel assassins creed 3 is my favorite assassins creed game black flag was my favorite assassins creed 3 you already know i love ac 4 ac origins was epic my is black flag favorite ac is black flag because it was my first platinum trophy on ps4 favorite assassins creed game is unity whoa they have done with remasters for ps4 i need to get this now what if they made a ac game were you could make your own character this looks so good this was my favorite game man black flag was the last assassins creed game my favorite assassins creed game is number 3 assassins creed brotherhood or revilations id love to win the ps4 version but judging by my luck i probably wont i cant find ac3 in the ps4 store how did u get this game omgac 3 is my favoritt game of all time my favorite ac is syndicate brad keep up the videos this was one the first games i saw u play and its amazing please finish it my favorite is actually this one assassins creed 3 play more assassins creed 2 and assassins creed brotherhood but i also like revelations then i played this one and then black flag and then thats when i decided to take a break until syndicate came out but i decided to try origins i hated it so bad assassins creed black flag has to be my favorite game in the series i put so much time into it and i had an absolute blast my fav is brotherhood why the f did thay remaster this game it was already awesome the ezio trilogy are the best ac games assassin creed 4 play for honor again they fucked up the charakter models its too hard to pick just one since i have to ill base it off just story and gameplay syndicate i loved the environment and could get immersed very easily plus the soundtrack almost beats ac iibrotherhoods my favorite assassins creed game is definitely three connor was a badass my favorite assassin creed game is ac3 i love that game so much love assassin creed 3 but black flag is probably a little better brotherhood for me d odyssey this game is how i found you in the old days id have to say revelations i know some people were tired of the same mechanics and saying that there wasnt really any revelation but to me it was the true ending of the series something about seeing the three power players of the series back then in the same cutscene even if altair was a skeleton and hearing the amazing music in the background it hit me hard to see ezio knowing that everything he had done and fought for didnt much matter in the end he was just a messenger who had a minor part in a massive universe and i just loved seeing how he knew that he couldnt do anything else and showing how he has accepted this knowledge to me this was such a great way of showing his development through all the games although there wasnt much of desmond i did enjoy those little side missions where it showed desmonds journey of being a runaway to fully embracing his assassin heritage altair had more personality and character in revelations as well his later story was tragic hav black flag is definitely one of the best but brotherhood has to be the top brotherhood was my favorite ac 3 is my favourite i was with you when you first played it assassins creed black flag is my all time favorite so far assassins creed odyssey for sure my favorite is assassins creed 3 one of my personal favorites assassins creed three is my favorite pleeaseee i really want this game well assassin creed black flag is amazing i loved it in my opinion the game looks the same as the original assassins creed 3 looks exactly the same they shouldve remastered the ezio series i would totally love it if i won a copy for ps4 ive watched the playthrough before but would love to play it myself my favorite is either black flag or brotherhood i know there is probably no chance but i would love to win this game my favorite ac game is odessey favorite was the whole assassin creed 2 series ohhhh i remember playing this but dont remember the beginning well my favorite is definitely ac2brotherhood but the ost in ac3 was amazing hands down one of my favorite of any game still have the ost to this day hey brad did you ever pre install the game i would have to say assasins creed 3

3752 the hell is wrong with haythams eye looks the same to me is this out right now for everyone oh and rode to the fact that we got to see like the templar side of things was actually kind of interesting and a ship customization options the fact that you can change the sale in the steering wheel and the other thing was amazing and also my favorite part about that was so you can make it look like the jack straw from assassins creed black flag assassins creed 3 is my favorite cause it was the first one i played my favorite is assassin creed brotherhood please send me a copy for the xbox one ur the besttttt broooo my favorite ac is brotherhood glad they did this looks better hope the bugs are smoothed out too hey brad i love your videos my favorite assassins creed game has to be black flag fingers crossed i hope you read this and i hope i win assassins creed 4 black flag is the best ac revelations is the best change my mind definitely black flag is best assassins creed odyssey is my favorite as well i love kassandra and the side quests like the minotaur and cyclops but ac syndicate will still hold a special place in my heart assassins creed 3 was very long my favorite would be assassins creed 2 quite a good story assassins creed black flag all the way haha this is unironically my favorite assassins creed game assassins creed ii i love this game i used to play it over and over again until my laptop cant run this game anymore haha ac balck flag was such a nice one too brotherhood assassins creed revelations that is my hair i just love the fact that you can customize your color of your suit and you can like open stars stores and black flag is another one of my favorites i like the pirate theme but overall revelations in black flag are on the same level on which one i like more so theyre like at like the top of my list like both of them at the same level assassins creed revelations has to be my favorite simply because its a great and fitting end to the story of ezio my favorite game was assassins creed 2 ac 3 has always been the best im glad they put nathan drakes voice actor in this game ac 4 is still my favorite remember watching you play it until i got it on christmas and finally played it myself favourite assassins creed for me is unity and ac 3 was my first assassins creed game ps4 full series please its been so long since the original one so its a good refresher and throwback 3 my favorite assasing creed is the 3 my favourite ac is probably ac brotherhood such a great game mine is odessey because my favorite youtuber rad brad plays it my favourite is 3 my favorite is assassins creed rogue loved it so much this was the game i found your channel through d top 3 acs are 3 4 and brotherhood i love assassin creed lll so much and im so glad this was remastered assassins creed i stopped playing after 3 but watched all your videos recently bought them all on pc and so far ac4 black flag is the best one theyve made i havent made it past that game tho cant wait to play origins or odessy but ac1 will always have my heart as altiar was so damn bad ass and ezio being right behind him you should do the entire thing this game ever since it was first released back in 2012 has consistently persisted to be one of my personal favorite games i was happily surprised with the news of a remaster and really look forward to diving back into this amazing and for me at least familiar world odyssey is my favourite too although im only 50 of the way through its addicting to say the least please send help i havent slept in days my favorite assassins creed game assassins creed 3 and the first game imagine if it had odyssey graphics origins is my favorite at least tied with brotherhood though i find ac2 to be the most replayable best ac is 3 imo the setting the american revolution and the characters were really good the best assassins creed is 2 i hope ubisoft do a remastred ac3 my fav this was my favorite assassins creed ever unity how many people remember that ac3 song that smosh made ac 3 was the first walkthrough of you that i ever watched i like your videos keep up the great work thank you i didnt become a fan of assassins creed until i played the second one then the first one and the rest after i loved brotherhood until 4 came along im sure odyssey will be my favorite after i play it i own it and still havent played past the first few minutes lol wooooow i actually subscribed to you when you played it first time around back in 2012 i am so stoked to watch you play this again much love brad my best assassins creed is black flag walking back down in memory lane p p doooo the full thing my favorite ac is revelations favorite ac game has to be revelations please make this a full series the faces in the remastered version is terrible but i would like to see you do another full walkthrough of this game again ac rogue is my favorite brad black flag will have to be my alltime favorite assassins creed game great story and character development good video i love assissans creed the graphics omg odyssey is my favourite too assassins creed 2 is my favorite and first one i played ac3 is my favorite favorite ac game is ac 2 the last good ac game tbh yo brad big fan here could you ask ubisoft to give us assassin creed 2 remastered please man hook us up assassins creed 4 is my favorite assasin creed black flag my fav ac game has to be black flag man the newly introduced naval combat was a game changer for me unity was the best my favorite ac is definitely black flag mine is assasins creed unity and syndicate for me the best one is ac 2 and brother hood assassins creed syndicate ac brotherhood apsolutely the best ac gamefirst of all story was 70 of the game and the best story then u have parachute crazy knives crazy swords crossbows u could recruit fighters heavy or the fast ones u could buy girls to follow u so u can infiltrate anywhere and when u are infilltrated u could press e to a guard to get his attention only in ac brotherhood u could make bombs u could craft them main mission when ur driving wooden bunker is siiick and the mission when u fly with wooden kite looking thing those side missions with wolves are wickeddd and puzzles in there omg ac brotherhood had the best puzzles then revolution revolution is next time 3 my favorite ac game would be revelations because you get to play as both ezio and altair man its weird coming back to this game assassins creed was the first game that introduced me to this amazing chanel and here we are again tbh i think that facial graphics in the original were a lot better and the faces of characters were more expressive though i still love ac3 from the core brother hood for life favorite assassins creed game is actually this one fav one hands down is ac2 assasins creed revolution assassins creed black flag was my all time favorite game period also i forgot my favorite game is assassins creed 3 and then odyssey and to reiterate if you havent read my last comment i have been subscribed for 9 years to win this game will be something special for me since it connects to how long i have been subscribed thank you brad assassins creed brotherhood is my favorite assassins creed game but does it have multiplayer tho face animations still and always will be ass assassins creed 2 will always be

favorite assassins creed is black flag odyssey is by far my favourite game just because of the rpg elements my favorite assassins creed game is 3 god i hope i win my fave ac is probably unity or ac2 ac3 was definitely the best one connor cuts through redcoats like candy connor is most ded the best assassin in this whole series this is a nice game but for me ac2 trilogy and oddyssey is my favorite

firenze acbf still y favorite til this day pls play it full my favorite ac is assasicn creed 3 assassins creed ii hands down my favorite assassins creed is black flag and ac2 love your commentary as always brad upload more of ac3 brad this game is definitely underrated my favorite is ac iii honestly brad i used to like assassins creed 4 too but after playing odyssey the compelling story and the new engine ubisoft used for it it got me really into the game and the story its nice to know that there are others that think the same way much love keep it coming man wow ubisoft really didnt give a shit this barley looks any better an ac4 remake with the way ubisoft made origins and odyssey is my dream game thanks for thisthis game sure brings memories assassins creed 3 more my favorite assassins creed game is 3 it has been my favorite ever since childhood my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed iii oh shit its remastered hell yeah ac3 was my first assassins creed and one of my first games on xbox 360 but black flag is my favorite unpopular opinion i really like this game not love just really like it popular opinion i really wish ac would go back to how it was before it all went to shit odyssey 100 and i cant believe ive 100d it they dropped the ball on connor character i feel like they didnt show much of his personality he should have gotten the character development like you couldve did a sequel to go in on his character development or just completely give him a new personality because they have shown so little of his personality that it seems like he doesnt even have one he couldve been a mix between haytham and his mom have his moments where he tells jokes and is more so extroverted and some moments where he is like his mom and is more introverted or have him just have some type of personality never seen this game or played it would love to see it continue it will be liking every video unity or black flag everything is being remastered assasins creed iii favorite assassins creed game origins best of everything and it felt fresh to be honest i really think that ac 3 was my absolute favorite especially with the new mechanics that were added when the game originally came out this game really sucked my favorite ac game is origins assassins creed 4 my favorite ac game is 4 but i have alot that are my favorite that is could play forever but ac 4 is my favorite so far im not a fan of the new ones tbh from syndicate and now arent my favorites at all good job i lobe your walk throughs they help me go through some bad times assassin creed ii ac3 because i like connor weapon equipment and was the first game i played for the series this is my all time favorite assassins creed game i think the story is overwhelmingly underrated its sad as fuck but also one of the last triumphant black flag a very close second first video i watched of yours was the original assassins creed 3 been watching your videos ever since idk what it is i enjoy how you dont have an act you are just a real guy playing games i find it hilarious and enjoyable when you struggle with a part or do something dumb my favorite assassins creed games are 3 and black flag i would love to have a copy of this game to relive the great memories love your channel and cant wait to see more videos mine is still 4 those graphics look better than the mkiceandfire graphics thats what i see how does he have this game today my favorite ac game is 2 3 is the runner up assassins creed 2 ezio is bae my favorite assassins creed was the ac3 it was the first xbox game i ever played and since then have played every assassins creed since then but ac3 was by far my favorite black flag loved the ship battles and the movement hey theradbrad you should play the whole game if you can you amazing ac3 is my favorite one best assassins creed is black flag does anyone remember rouge my favorite ac game is ac rogue assassins creed three is the best me haythams face model looks absolutely ugly assasins creed 3 was the first one i bought and from the start i loved it one of the only games i fully completed definatly my favourite assasins creed and favourite game at all i first started watching your channel when you uploaded the first part of the original series what are you abstergo or templer my favourite one was actually this one i really enjoyed it so im glad theyve remastered will definitely be buying once i have money spare to do so i found this channel through ac origins my favorite ac game is 3 the multiplayer though is it still there edit nvm assasin creed 3 we need ac1 remastered controversial opinion revelations was the best assassins creed my favorite ac game is either ac4 or ac3 both are still fire tho and great video i love seeing an older assassins creed game remastered and i think this is the ac game is the reason i started watching your channel mine is odyssey also assains creed odyssey is my favorite now too if i win i have a ps4 assains creed is the first game i played with my son lol assassins creed 4 was my favorite tbh i like it more of an action character development rather than rpg type assassins creed syndicate for me one of my favorite assassin creed games is assassins creed syndicate ac2 is and always will be my favourite but seeing this remastered brings back some good nostalgia favourite assassins creed game was assassins creed iii they should make the next one during the irish famine my fave assassins creed is brotherhood because of my childhood nostalgia im so glad youre doing this remastered in my favorite assassins creed is going to have to beat assassins creed 3 honestly the giveaway is probably fake cause you cant tell who liked the video but my favorite is assasins creed black flag could be my favorite game overall they will not do a remaster of black flag that game was originally release for the next gen consoles so it will not happen until ps5 more likely assassins creed 3 was my favorite the soundtrack is on point as usual we need black flag remastered my favourite assassin creed game is number 2 my favorite is ac 3 ubisoft should stop remastering shit this is awful favorite is probably syndicate my favorite assassins creed game is the third do the full thing pwease main theme plays oh god the chills already played the whole game but i gotta see this black flag will always be my favorite my fave ac game is ac rogue i love the music the story and shay oh i love assassin creed brotherhood that game was my thing i used to play it hours and hours good times my favorite is syndicate i think black flag is definitely my favorite odyssey comes in a close second but i love pirates keep up the great work please keep playing and my favorite game is assassins creed brotherhood brad play the whole game pls ac brotherhood was fire my favorite ac is ac3 the game is simply amazing i rlly love conners running animation it looks real to me unlike ezios wonky animation almost looks like he is naruto running other than that the combat is rlly well out story is meh but conners outfit is badass but there is no doubt that every second i play this game im having fun fingers crossed on that giveaway just bought re2 so its gonna be a while before i save money for this game edit also how does the giveaway work how do u contact the

again ac 3 is my favorite definitely deserves another play through this game was great when it first came out and the remastered version looks awesome assassins creed 4 black flag this is crazy this is the game where i found your channel my favorite assassins creed game was the fourth because of the new dynamic of the game for innovating the way you can move through the map besides of the story that i liked it a lot greetings from venezuela my favorite assassins creed game is 3 because i love the american revolution history assassin creed 3 definitely odyssey or origins i played this game so many time assassins creed iv is by far my favorite of the series its a close call between that brotherhood though keep up the good work my favorite youtuber my favorite ac game is definitely ac origins my favorite was assassins creed 4 i like odyssey and origins for the story but unity is great for the multiplayer they should make their next game have the mechanics of odysseyorigin but have

played ac3 assasins creed 3 ps i play on ps4 i never finished this one it just was to slow for me im going to say unity and syndicate are probably my favorite right now although odyssey andoriginsare decent i miss the hidden blade i remember watching the whole of assassins creed 3 when i had a fever helped me a lot back then thanks for your vids brad haleyoep p i think ac2 is my favorite classic one love the soundtrack no way remastered assassins creed rogue i love the change in sides mid game favorite assassins creed game is revelations that game is just mind blowing you should play god of war on new game why would you upload this game my favorite assassin creed is the very first one ac4 is my favorite game but 3 is close behind my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed brotherhood it was more smooth and introduced combo moves using weapons such as the hand gun finally they brought something original not like synd origin and odyssey these are so unrealistic nothing else other than ac1 to unity so damn realistic about story driven 3 is actually my favorite of the assassins creed games i absolutely love the time period of the revolutionary war mine favourite still is assassins creed black flack i really enjoyed unity of course it was my first game ive played of the series hope i can play this one too ligit my favorite assassins creed 3 crapy ending tho ooo im getting it whether if i win or lose assassins creed 3 was the first creed game i played 3 will always be in my 3 syndicate my favorite you inspire me to be a great gamer just like you thanks rad lots of love my favorite is brotherhood ac3 the best one without a doubt connor had the best story and motives i found your channel with this game level 3 notoriety with the patriots they keep spawning one man army was amazing your playthrough of this was how i found your channel is the story line the same or did it changed even if it was a bit weird not remastering brotherhood come on that one was the best mine is syndicate plus the dlc either format if im luck enough thanks assassins creed 4 was my favourite so many good memories ac unity i loved the story and its memorable characters u must have got it early because it doesnt come out for season pass holders until tomorrow lucky assassins creed unity anyone else 10 times happier to have the odyssey season pass by the assasin creed brotherhood is my favorite played assassins creed liberation at psvita i absolutely love assassins creed origins the egyptian setting is absolutely captivating and on xbox one x looks even more spectacular an i found your channel when watching the beyond two souls series ubisoft will grow way bigger due to the remaster of this game my fave assassins creed is black flagit was actually the first one i played and then started them all from the beginning assassins creed brotherhood xbox 1 ac3 was my favorite lol assassins creed 3 i find it pretty amazing that one of my people have a character in my favourite game assassins creed iv black flag definitely my favorite the only one from the franchise that i played more than twice hopefully they can remaster ac 2 and black flag yoooo wtf this is so damn cool assassins creed 3 was the first video i saw on your channel a long ass time ago assassins creed rogue assassins creed 3 is my favorite because it mostly sort of had history in the story my favorite creed luck be with me i still dont like dis game cuz of da fighting stealth and parkour my favorite is assassins creed 2 please do the whole game conner is my favorite assassin of all time i love him ive always liked 3 its like a shifting point where ac took to becoming such a great game honestly i hope they fixed that glitch near toward of the last memory of sequence 4 where connor dives into the tree for some reason the screen would cut to white causing a full synch fail that always pissed me off fingers crossed this looks so good and crisp 2 was my favorite as that was my first ac i experienced on ps3 but ac3 became my favorite because of the native american history storyline and the parkour like you mentioned brad am i hearing things or does desmonds voice sound like the voice actor of nathan drake might just be me black flagyour awesome love the videos thanks assassins creed 3 is the goat i found you brad by just randomly looking up dead rising vids i dont really remember which series i caught you at but im glad i did this is a really good remastered version im going to have to get my hands on a version for my ps4 itll be a birthday gift for myself since today is my

on it pls announce winners on insta as well as some dont have access to twitter i would have to say its a tie between ac 3 and ac 4 my favorite ac game is brotherhood i feel like it has the best story my favorite is assassins creed black flag i love your videos would love to win the giveaway you should do more videos especially if they make a ac 4 remastered brotherhood is my favourite assassins creed game by far ass ass in my favourite assassins creed is either 2 or 3 textures are popping randomly tho assassins creed unity stop cappin this aint no remastered look the exact same assassins creed 3 assasins creed 2 this was my all time favorite black flag definitely the best one black flag will always be my favorite even though assassins creed 3 is really good the amount of content to do in black flag is what keeps me playing the game i would love to get a copy of ac3 for the playstation because i never got finish the game and havent got to try the dlc either assassins creed 1 with altair hey brad i love you man always support you ive been here since the first time you played ac3 im not the only one that barely notices a difference right maybe a few lighting additionsshadows and such you are great gamer and my role model i loved unity ik it had issues with online but when i played it it was rly smooth and the coop worked so good my favorite assasin creed game is black flag desmond is back the game is bright i kind of like this one you get to play as a kid and then grew up this intro always gives me chills ezioconnor rest of the series mine is assassins creed rogue my favorite assassins creed game is the third one and oddessy assassins creed ezio trilogy because it was the most rememberable great part 1 brad love how you talked about your previous ac 3 playthrough my best was ac black flag that was black flag definitely and then brotherhood i only played origins and odyssey but the latter is defenitely the best out of the two guess it likes better but seems the same just like walking dead was remastered or edited but dont know if i can get in a game if its just the same if it has add ons but i think i took this game to game stop so i dont have it no more i loved this game but it doesnt really look like much of a remaster acb honestly i really enjoy ezio story and the multiplayer back then assassins creed brotherhood assassin creed iii is and will always be my favorite game cant wait to play it again definitely going to platinum this game this is remaster is kind of disappointing make a full series six year mr brad six year assassins creed origins this game makes you really feel like remastered my favorite ever assassins creed game is assassins creed 2 hands down it began the best trilogy in my opinion and i enjoyed the story and platforming in that game so much ac odyssey incredible game i have two favorites black flag and odyssey my favourite ac game ever is ac revelations the music and the story is just so beautiful if they remaster that ill definitely play it btw brad would love to play this game as well it has some of the most epic scenes ever especially when connor kills charles lee one of my favourite ac moments ever the dialogue is just so epic it gives me goosebumps everytime i see it my system prefence is ps4 would love to play this game again best in assassins creed black flag favorite ac game was unity but it was sooo broken you always make great content keep it up brother assassins creed 3 was my favourite because of charles lees death the way he just says with his eyes like yeah man you did it so lets get this over with if you see this then please ps4 i probably wont win but it still feels good rewatching this game here my favorite assassins creed game was odessy which i got hooked on when you did your play through holy shit this is my favorite assassins creed game my favorite assassins creed is actually ac origins i loved the setting of ancient egypt probably syndicate or this please do more missions of ac 3 this game is so nostalgic and my favorite one assassins creed 2 personally is an amazing game and one of my all time favorites assassins creed origens do a whole play through ive entered giveaway mine favourite is black flag my favorite is definitely between bf and odyssey but leaning more towards odyssey assassins creed black flag more i dont care what people say ac3 is probably my favorite ac game so good and so so underrated it was the first game that really changed franchise and carried it through syndicate sadly ac4 which i think is terribly overrated just got the majorities attention and hopped on the hate train for ac3 just because that was the thing definitely looking forward to going back and playing all of the ezio trilogy rogue and this one whenever i can make time been here since silent hill downpour dont remember when that was at this point but i do remember you playing this when it initially came out maybe it looks better on your end but looking at it i feel it actually doesnt look that great everyones face looks like playdoh even then comparing this video to the 2012 video big difference and definitely in the older versions favor ps assassins creed 4 was indeed already remastered was one of the first games that was remade on ps4 and xbox one if i remember right assassins creed 3 is my favorite because it was the first assassins creed id played this assassins creed was mad good until they made it an rpg it died for me and the end of desmond story was just badly told tbh but i still enjoyed all there games up to unity then i gave up lol assassins creed black flag is my favourite gosh i didnt know that haytham was an asian dude xd how is this a remastered 4 has to be my favorite but brotherhood and revelations will stand the test of time especially for the history of the story dead space 2 is my favorite assassins creed besides ac2 my all time favorite was this one ac3 was the first one i ever owned i loved it hope i can win mine is 3 of c this is the series i found your channel on along with halo 4 assassin creed 2 is my favorite my fave ac has to be the first one assassins creed blackflag not hating on u brad u always make good shit but no one asked for the game to be remastered everybody wanted 2 or the original one done like no body asked for 3 to be remastered what a waste of time and money keep it up tho brad always do good stuff again not hating on brad im hating on the game assassins creed 3 was one of my favorites in the series assassins creed 3 is the greatest game of all time for me i found your channel when

favourite is odyssey please can i have the game am sorry but wtf is that 1530 my gav is rogue thats how i found your channel in the past was looking for someone who plays ac3 needed help because i got stuck and didnt find a way to pass the situation you showed me thank you so much to play it one more time best dude ever hey i have a problem because when i click on a video theres no vids under

here you are 10 mill subs later still kicking ass who have played it when it was not on remastered ac3 is my favorite ac definitely assassins creed odyssey my favorite assassins creed is ll aka assassins creed 2 and black flag code please for ps4 i checked u got 35 million views on your earlier video massive amount my favourite game of the franchise is surprisingly assassins creed 3 theres just something about the storyline of connor that is so powerful and captivating plus also following desmond through his life with the animus through ac 1 ac 3 legendary franchise in my mind but not the new ones i find origins and odyssey to be not so much ac but more hack and slash if you get what i mean i wrote a lot but asassins creed means a lot to me so oh well assassin creed odyssie i play on ps4 brotherhood was definitely my favourite my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed origins it looks no different from when i played it 6 years ago assissans creed rouge love to see desmonds story again i actually really like origins but i do prefer the structure of the older games my favourite assassins creed was the second one i played through that shit like 4 times now i cant feel any enormous changesalso the faces are too bad the first ac i ever played the father of understanding guides us my favourite is ac black flag cause it is the mix of pirate assassin which is awesome ac3 is my favourite ive been waiting for this game foreverrrrr i cant wait to play this on the switch unity has the best parkour but my all time favorite is ac 2 and black flag assians creed black flag my favorite assassins creed game is also oddessy because its a masterpiece and i also love greek mythology ps4 why does haytham have a massive forehead lol how come ubisoft cant make decent assassin greed games anymore up until syndicate the whole franchise has been shiet my favorite assassins creed game is easily 3 wasnt the game supposed to relise on 29th how can you play it now on 28th ac3 was my favorite assassins creed game for so long my favorite was ac3 or brotherhood my favorite game was assassin creed black flag assassins creed 3 is my favorite one play it to completion im torn between assassins creed origins and assassins creed odyssey as being my favorite cuz they were both amazing games graphically and storywise i love both of them from what i counted of you game playlist you ha e played 1430 different games give or take a few i must say way to go brad my favorite ac is ac sindicate i play on xbox one my favorite assassins creed game has always been 3 all three of ezios game are my favorite an amazing story and character someone who you could sometimes relate the ability to have been able to watch him turn into a master assassin and then after just an amazing trilogy assassins creed 3 was my favorite i liked all assassins creed until the one with egypt and odyssey it didnt feel like assassins creed to me personally hope i win the ezio games were my favorite 2 brotherhood and revelations the nostalgia is real with this one i love assassins creed 4 this is the best ac game ever my fav was always assassins creed 3 does anyone else hear nathan drakes voice assassins creed 2 is my fave one of my favorite creed games assassin creed 2 on my playstation3 then when i had xbox i bought assassin creed black flag my favorite assassins creed was 3 haytham looks like fucking garbage what did they do to my rugged and experienced lad edit all the models looked they went through extensive plastic surgery wtf what absolute garbage if they made ac not about history it would actually be fun my favorite ac game has to be 3 my favorite is also odyssey i would like copy for ps4 but i doubt i win my second favorite is ac3 my favorit ac is ac 3 i just love connor cant wait to play this game again can u please do a playthrough of both this is actually the first game i ever watched on your channel been a loyal subscriber since cant wait to pick this game up myself my fav is odyssey my favourite assassins creed game is definitely origins assassins creed unity assassins creed 3 was may favorite because i never played the ones after it if youve ever played resident evil outbrea picking locks in that game with no team help to back you up while zombies are coming at you with a middle finger up and need to kill yeah hardest lock picking ever then they give you options of four like it should matter odyssey was great for definite but in terms of what i would consider an actual assassins creed game really not saying odysseyorigins is bad theyre amazingly good id probably say acii that was just wow p xbox one the best assassins creed has to be brotherhood cause of the story line and also all of the enemys armor was amazingly created i cant chose between 3 4 and origins my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed 2 ac4 for life ac black flag is my favorite my favourites are origins and syndicate and the combat in ac 3 cant

favorite because its the first assassins creed i ever played this was actually the first game that brought me to your channel assassins creed brotherhood this was actually the first game that brought me to your channel back when you could assassinate in assassins creed thought this comes out on the 29th not the 28th and anybody else get ac odyssey season pass just to get ac3 remastered for free my

ac 3 or ac odyssey everyone dont go like our ancestors did they know what it is and not wish you to repeat it so what the hell did i just said that i just adore assassins creed games but sadly never played one but my favourite assassins creed game is odyssey ac 2 will always be my favourite game i even bought the ezio collection annnddd err theres some complaints but im just going to relive some

syndicate assassins creed black flag continue the series ac2 is my all time favorite ac game and the third all time favorite game overall and on xbox one mine is assassins creed unity i loved assassins creed 3 but most people hated it guess im different assassins creed 3 and unity my favorite assassin creed was the second one for the ps3 ac 2 is my favorite among the series when i finished ezios collection in ps4 because of the storyline i watched many playthroughs of the whole franchise since open world makes many of us experience different parts of history requiescat in pace people haha please do the full series of the liberation part i found this channel when the original assassins creed iii came out so much time has passed can you call my name once during this series keep up the good work ohhhhhh yes thank you for playing this and tbh my favorite one of their games is either this on ac3 or blackflag i think ac3 might just beat black flag in the tiniest bit i still love both of them though lol favorite ac game is ac rogue my fav are unity and syndicate id choose syndicate over unity bc of the mechanics but i totally adore the atmosphere of paris versailles the revolution the scenery is crazy i love it so much and arno is such a dork plus he gets to work with a young napoleon are you kidding me and he can have his own cafe to make money idk i honestly would prefer it over other ac games im just stuck with those ps for a long time this one was my fav bc i liked it more out of other tree but then the latest fames happened and yeah i would love to watch it again bc i never finished it my laptop was still pretty bad brad pls finish this series cuz i really love tge game and theres nothing big coming out anyway so pls man finish it peace my favorite assassin creed game is assassins creed black flag assassins creed odyssey bc of the jack the ripper dlc id felt like it brought the game a lot closer together then most with no dlcs favourite ac game has to be ac2 this doesnt look remastered at fucking allllllll they barely tried this still looks as shoddy as black flag my fav assassins creed is brotherhood ac3 is my favorite ac game and i would like it for ps4 this was the game that got me to subscribe to your channel when it came out man hearing the fightclub theme after so long give me goosebumps why not 60 fps youre uploading too fast stop remaster huh cant they just give us a remake of ac 1 already i see no point in remastering a game that as clearly aged very well like ac 3 assassins creed origins is bad ass thats my favorite one but i still gotta try odyssey you the man thanks for all your hard work my favourite ac game is this one mine is assassins creed rogue its interesting to see another viewpoint beside assassins it self long life the templar brotherhood best assassin creed game so far i played was origins the dlcs for it are outstanding not played 3 for donkeys been subscribed many years every walkthrough you do is

the game play the game again please my favorite assassins creed game is a pretty unpopular opinion but its got to be ac iii while it definitely isnt the strongest title of the ac series the modern day missions in this game just completely engaged me throughout i know some people dont like the modern day story in the ac series but to me its what gave it more depth and added more to the ac games ac iii couldve definitely done more for the modern day since even with the modern day missions it felt too short there couldve been more to it but those missions and the story going on in the present day was what made me feel like i was finding pieces of eden and killing templars for a bigger cause assassins creed iii was also the first game to improve the parkour system and freerunning another reason its my favorite oh and the first to introduce ships loved the naval system and how it was expanded further in the next title asian creed two ps4 assassins creed origins is my favourite i remember my first ac was rogue second 3 also my favourite when i played 3 i didnt know what they all were talking about or what was happening but i remember having a lot of fun playing and learning the lore it

assassins creed 3 obvs but its that game no lie anyways have a week and a great weekend later on nice video plz post more videos of this game and its my fav ac assasins creed 4 black flag favorite is brotherhood no cap my favorite is ac 2 personally as for odyssey the main story is pretty good but i very much dislike the modern day and the dialogue choices in the animus portion of the game with the original ac 3 while ezio is my favorite protagonist his story was told and it was time to pass the torch but with 3 and why i was so disappointed is because throughout the story he only seemed to progress as a character during the homestead missions as well as the plot twist with washington meaning basically nothing and the modern day ending was completely horrible desmonds death was a complete disappointment and after his death the modern day lacked direction assassins creed origins assassins creed black flag the great parkour game remembered when this just a simple symbianjava games i like how he says ill see how the video does knowing the videos always going to kill it well more likely than not love this channel brad is great his personality is the best mine is ac rogue

watching ur channel when u did the original ac3 this was my fav ac game assassins creed revelations and syndicate my favorite assassins creed game is definitely 3 or brotherhood my favorite ac is ac black flag i love the channel i just dont see much of a difference between this and the original its just that the original and this are only 7 years apart so the graphics arent insanely notable but with something like resident evil 2 the original and remake thats two decades apart so the graphics are something else when compared when it comes to the remake of resident evil 2 and the original the remake has better graphics its a fact but with this its just not great enough when compared and yeah they give you liberation but still it doesnt seem worth it is this a joke these graphics looks worse than the original 3 is easily my favorite assassins creed game love the game my favourite assassains creed game is ac origins my favorite ac has to be ac 3 my favorite ac has to be ac 3 bro what

black flag this game is what got me into the series i love this game not many people do assassins creed 4 my favorit is assasin creed orgings assassins creed 3 you should do an entire series of all of them accept chronicle from altair to whoever it is in odyssey i havent played that one yet could take up some time but for us assassins creed fans it would be a breath of fresh air being as all we ever really see is either fortnite re2 or apex it kind of gets boring its was a downfall for the assassins creed series from the unity favourite ac game assassins creed odyssey ps4 my favorite assassin creed game is the 3rd cause of how good the story is my favorite assassins creed is syndicate because u can play as a male or female and it based in industry london odyssey all the way i love asassins creed 2 whenever i see haytham kenway i dont believe he was son of edward kenway oddysey please give it to me easy assassins creed revelations the multiplayer was clean good old days when ubisoft wasnt ubioft whos ready for assassins creed america honestly hits my nostalgia bone ac3 is my favorite i think you should play the whole thing because theres some new gaming mechanics in the game we want desmond back alive assassin creed origin because i havent played assassin creed odyssey unity my favourite is assassins creed black flag that game is amazing my assassins creed favourite

joy holy shit ive been waiting for this i think 2 was my fave creed my favorites are the third and black flag i havent yet got the chance to play the new ones my favorite assassins creed game is assassins creed bothrhood wow i subscribed when you were doing ac3 the first time and my favorite is ac4 whats with this trend of remaking and remastering old series ac black flag what a game my favourite ac game was unity 3 fun customisation plenty of weapons to choose from great combat mechanics not too long and just fun to play except for the fact that there are way too many glitches collectables and side missions and sometimes the puzzles can be too tough i cant seem to get altiars outfit because the rift thingies are too hard tbh but still fun especially the parkour it is really fun and satisfying feels the same looks the same still hate it but thats my opinion cant wait until they remaster black flag with adwaly ac2 is my favourite one my favorite is odyssey too a huge improvement assassins creed black flag 4 5 months and 6 years this is still good played it when i was 3 assassins creed 2 is the best i love black flag and it my favorite my favorite ac game wow i checked ps4 store and its not on there at all well done theradbrad for clickbaiting unsubscribing lol my favorite ac games is ac unity and keep up the videos love them my favorite game is nba2k19 and spiderman assassins creed 2 was og was the first ac i played i hope ubisoft can remaster more of the games in the ac universe they were a ton of fun but man if i could choose which one id want remastered probs black flag because i only played from 3 syndicate is it me or i cant see better graphics as compared to old assassins creed 3 black flag since it came out i discovered your channel

unstoppable watching you and xbox ac 3 assasins creed 2 rogue easily has such a great concept to the game my favorite was ac 3 because you play as a native american with a badass tomahawk and kill redcoats rip my ps3 memoriez this game looks so much better omg it looks the same to me till now my favorite assassins creed game is china and india hey brad you should play the last episode of the dlc on assassins creed odyssey also keep up the good work ive been with you for about 6 years assassins creed 3 because it is the only one that i came close to beating assasins creed 4 black flag is my favorite oh boy this is were brad and i met each other this is were i got stuck with this guy when is it released theradbrad should be the gamer of the year not sniperwolf i didnt play odyssey nor

the whole game pleaaaseee brotherhood is the best they fixed the subs so nostalgic its black flag i love that game my favorite game would have to be rogue the story line was great and being able to sail around the ocean amazing 4739 that guy in red shirt is clearly the best ai edit 4823 that guy too my favorite assassins creed is now origins it used to be ac3 ac3 is like runner up assassins creed 2 overall favourite ac 1 and 2 gamplay black flag always said that aciii is underrated ppl always ranked it low but tbh honest i always liked it and lets be real the older ac games are better iiiiiiblack flag and rogue but i also liked origins please do the full game for both of them my favorite is probably orgins easily top 3 assassins creed games of all time how convenient my favorite assassins creed is and always will be ac 2 it was my start with the series and what made me fall in love with it keep up the grind brad you a real g i have still not completed the original game but i

i am 18 now so yeah brad you are an old man my favorite assassins creed game by far has to be black flag because the scenery and that you could just kill whales sharks and black panthers wow i miss that game cant see how this is remastered still same graphics tho my favorite has always been ac iii it has to be origins for me this is my favorite ac game of them all great choice on remastering this one ac 4 black flag is the best ac and the best pirate video game change my mind black flag is my favourite the surroundings are well developed but the character texture is still the same and the lip sync is still quite laggy my fav one mostly is ac brotherhood yesssssssss finally brad finally maybe im tripping but i dont see any difference especially if you compare it to the last of us remaster my favorite is assassins creed 3 finallythanks for this video brad i dont see the difference i got the season pass but i dont have it im confused best game for me was ac4 black flag people just call it a pirate game but for me the story was soo good assassins creed 4 black flag im a huge fan of the assassins creed franchise but tbh i didnt really like liberation my favourite ac game is ac odyssey and every other ac main story game made 4739 just a guy casually walking backwards assassins creed 3 and 4 would be my favourite but 3 mostly do the ezio collection assassins creed black flag why they no remaster ac2 its easily th best fight me if you think otherwise this is by far my favourite game out of them all i hope you play it all the way through on the channel my favorite

warfare 3 long time keep it up 3 is probably my favorite i just always enjoyed it i would love to win but my favorite assassin creed game was creed lll revelations and brotherhood and black flag so yeah please play out last finaly some good game i like assassins creed 3 surprisingly i didnt like it at first because of haytham but connor really grew on me ac black flag has got to be my favorite ac game ever solely because of the story and the holes in filled both in the plot and my heart that and they pretty much nailed the balance between pirate and assassin thanks brad for being my cool down dont stop doing what you do best cause you deserve everything for it all wishes i went to an oldfashioned opera like that before assasins creed origins dont hate me but i love black flag and its most likely my favourite it had been a while since i was able to just cruise around an open world with the ingame music playing and really sync myself with the world feeling like an actual pirate with a crew to redeem myself i will say ac2 is a close second xd brad never say gta 5 he always take complete name assassin creed black flag you r the best plz keep up your hard work you still need to do rouge sir i think youd enjoy it also im curious what if you plugged the animus into the memories of someone who had used an animus some point in their life would you get to experience their journey through the animus or just being plugged into it to clarify i mean the journey they had in their animus favorite is ac liberation you should read assassins creed forsaken the game is based on this book story of haytham kenway ive played ac3 so many timesbut am still gonna watch remastered cus graphics my favorite ac is 3 whats new with the combat btw i stopped playing after revelations but brotherhood was my favourite nottheradbrad remind me about rogue assassins creed black flags is the best ac brotherhood is hands down my favorite also love you brad im preloading it now cant wait to play it i never understood the hate for the game its not one of my favourites but i still enjoyed it enough to buy the season pass way back when i always felt the main theme was epic and probably my second favouritefirst being ac2s or ezios family im glad theyve remastered it around the 23rd minutethe game is too frigging bright ac four ofc 3 i love assassins creed oddessy because of all the fun boss fights lol why the fuck would they remaster 3 easily the worst one and also not really graphically dated please do more i really enjoyed it as creed 3 was one of the best assassin creed game i first found your channel when you played this originally best ac game ive ever played hey brad plz do a full series of this oof choosing a favourite is really hard ezio trilogy 3 4 and rogue are all my favourites not a big fan of the stuff released after 4 probably the first time i came across your channel was assassins creed 3 this is my favorite assassins creed im a fan of assassins creed addition and would be looking forward to playing it thanks rad keep the good work do more part of kingdom heart iii ive been here since 09 10 and wont be leaving anytime soon finally my favorite ac game get the graphic it deserved my favourite is assassins creed brotherhood i like black flag the most my favorite ac is brotherhood because of ezio and the cool multiplayer characters if ac 3 has the multiplayer then it would be a confirmed buy from me ac4 is still the best but thats just my opinion brad love the vids keep up the good work this made me nostalgic one of my favorites in the ac franchise in terms of story best but sad gameplay soundtrack and characters are you going to play days gone when it comes out loved this game think you should do the ezio series too all three of them great games play the full game again loved this game think you should do the ezio series too all three of them great games ubisoft must remaster every old series of assassins creed like if i am correct the original ac was glitchy as hell and you couldnt swim but i loved that shit killing those crusader templars in jerusalem i wish my copy still worked 20 minutes late pls do a full walkthrough picking locks are easier on console when compared to mouse controlsas u had to move the mouse up and down hold it there and then move it left and right then press the rmb repeatedly the first 4 assassin creed is my favorite black flag man it was the best thing one on 360 definitely brotherhood favorite and one of the best games when it first came out but also origins mainly because it was unique with its different setting and how everything played from controls to eagle eye up to story especially those dlcs personally my favorite dlcs haytham looks whiter i agree with brad making a remastered of black flag i have it and feels so good to still play it dude i was searching this on the ps store for nearly an hour and then i watch it until the end and realize that this is an early copy smh fml this is the first ac 3 remastered walkthrough on youtube nice brad my favorite assasins creed game is assasins creed 3 my console is ps4 ac2 easily the best please play it my

work i really enjoy watching you assassins creed 3 is my favorite i havent played the others yet am i the only one that thinks it looks slightly worse on some spots and little to no difference and its

abzu pls give the trailer a look pls like so brad can see notification squad what up yo brad youve been a great guy love the series first to comment liked it very much first to comment hey with that copy right i saw some other people playing this the video said nothing about copy rights 5434 charles really committed 2548 why in the world did hid bandanna go up then down every time that i play hit man i forget that im not spotted yet lol funny when desmond wiggles his body while talking to his dad how is it remastered looks same as the original this game tries so hard i guess its one of the best but thats kind of sad for humanity so its just the same game with only graphics revamped its pretty just a cashgrab people say this game aint good but personally i think its one of the best ac games tho black flag is mah fave the ship that is following haythem could be the aquila because the assassins are following him and the aquila is their flagship 3142 what is that board game called it is little similar to backgammon what changed its the same game wow this copyright thing is s wow youtube smh 755 oh shit here we go again v i wanna play this game but were tf i can get a license key key generator dont work tho george wasshington the george washington mr 1st president was with braddocks troops before the mess i mean the war he means the greek hero you lobcock lol and thats what i call a remasterized leap of faith uhmm boston huh i smell a tea party in the coming years whats is the relation between haytham and edward kenwaythe answer haytham is edwards son making edward kenway ratonhnhaktons grandpa first da vinci as ac2s inventor and now ben franklin in ac3 omg its ben franklin aka mrs dogoodremember national treasure4745 you red coats are starting to be very annoying well hello america the assassin cometh to the new worldepic intro btw important rule of the sea no fights on board or youll spent the rest of the trip in jail the mute 7not 6 minutes of hell 12061900 thank you mkiceandfire i can not get the game myself and all the other walkthroughs were the people talking the whole time so thanks the facial look is far better in the original but in this remaster it look like potato mod hahaha its just a sweet fxits just you can ubisoft this looks stuningly the same looks kinda same to me as the vanilla version minor changes to be honest assassins creed 2 is the first assassin game i ever played ac 3 is the second ac game ive ever played i wished ubisoft remastered ac 1 ac 2 ac revelations i always wondered why they changed desmonds face design after ac brotherhood this game did not age well jesus copyright horsesite the graphics have become too cartoonish turn off the music and re record so you wont have to mute i do that all the time before i record so i dont run into those claims on my videos whaaat why are there flashing images they didnt even make the bushes dynamic what wrong with the audio some times it lost what is that bullshit boardgame at 30 mins in lol ac for lifeone of the first ac games i ever played loved it ever since ac hasnt been great since the pirates of the caribbean one this is one of myfavourite acs i find the combat so satisfying does anyone else thin this seems like a testing ground for new mechanics units and activitys for a new revolutionarynapolianic era ac game this looks so bad it looks cell shaded or something the eyes lol whenever i need to watch some gameplay with no commentary i can always depend on your channel keep it up please i think the nonremastered is more beautyful than this game it legit looks like a new game but the faces though it dont seem remastered the graphics look okay but not as good as unity so whats remastered i see no difference the original was great itself but this is just ubisoft milking the series assassins creed died with desmond black flag was ok barely salvaged by the ship gameplay unity was an unfinished project that needed at least 6 months of review and polishing before release syndicate was god awful and then ac origins and ac odyssey were absolute trash with some of the most sloppiest combat systems ive ever seen not to mentions the enemies in them including syndicate looked cartoonish and the animations were so bad that spongebob square pants looked more realistic the blood animations look like shit now too ac3 was my favorite though wait did they remove counter kill in this remastered brings back a lot of memories playing aciii when i was a preteenager guys i have a question can anyone tell me why they remastered from ac3 it will cool if they remastered from ac1 and i thought they already had ac3 for ps4 just saying 835 desmond miles the man who will boogie the world to safety i love the old assassins creed games my favorite is assassins creed black flagi still cant believe that haythem kenway became a templar after all his father did to keep him away from them who else is here because you cant download the game yet 4648 soldier are you mocking me hahahahahaha if i was there i kill all of em well i downloaded the old ac3 and the next day i checked the internet and the remastered version is out do you have to get the season pass for odyssey to play it or can you get it seperatly the intro cinematic reminded me why i played these so much now thats all gone this remastered is a joke in vanilla game like this remastered desmond hair in cinematic is high in game play not even is remastered just put some directix 12 illumination and boom resales the copy of game haythem kenways outfit is dopei so badly want one of those meh i like the original better the story that could have been the reallife story in ac went downhill for me after ac3 charles lee seem to be a better man when he his with heytham i think the graphics are worse than the original i really dont see the difference idk great underrated gamethe setting is so awesome cant find it on ps4 store canada ubisoft finally released the game the way it should have look in 2012 its really sad how a franchise with so much potencial became what it is now because a shitty company has the rights to make the games do the npcs still look like gta 3 when youre inside a building talk about detail from what ive seen draw distance is worse dont know i they managed that character models look flat and like theyre made out of wax overall lighting and textures are better and the game has actual color the series died when desmond did looks the same to me wouldve been better to remaster ezio or altair some of these cutscenes look like they were made in gmod the gameplay looks awesome its just the cutscenes are trash might wanna check that description i do not like too much this graphics i prefer the older version 12430 only in 1755 where throwing shit through a walking person will hit the other person on point that makes u question if logic was actually a reality or not can i play it on amd phenom ii x2 b59 processor speak out against arcale 13 tell the eu to stuff it up there asss remastered version looks so terrible hathams face looks horrible dont worry about the copyright u still have the best gameplays still a better combat than assassins creed origin why does haytham look like that all puffyfaced do you play as haytham for so long in the original too i remember playing this game but i dont remember playing as haytham for such a long time is this just a remaster thing or are my memories completely fucked wow its amazing game loved this gameback when you werent overwhelmed with side stuff to do takes a little while to get to connor but gets good when you do this remaster comes with the dlc aw i love ac3 i love the music too time flies so fast im getting so old remastered beautifully the last real assassins creed the ubem might be templars and there might be a secret message there that none of the templars want us to decode that music the 6 minutes that are muted isnt it possible to just mute the music volume while still keeping everything else on or was the music part of the background and separate from the volume setting best ac game imo people dont like this game because its not ezio but people are too dumb to consider that in revelations and after that he would be very old biologically if you are old you are very limited to how you move and your acrobatic skills ezio would be to old to b in another game i love assassins creed 3 it had some of the best menu music up there with the ezio family theme and had good music during the game too also connor was probably the most badass of character from assassins creed along its edward kenway ezio wasnt that badass he just had a lot of character development how did you get that game so early that is not even out yet this is one of my favorite games nice yo mk u should play assassin creed the ezio collection the game that made it look like modern day was gonna be a big thing with juno sadly ubisoft made a big mistake after this rip desmond how did you get this so early i havethe season pass damn i remeber when i played the original i was like 11 they should reboot the series by remaking ac1 with unitys enginegraphics youre not a true assassins creed fan until you kill some random guards that pushes you around still looks better than batman return to arkham facial animation looks terrible now theyre all look like talking mannequins doesnt even match with the voice sync how to get it on pc my fave game of the ac series thank you i have already finished this game this game was so bad i never bought another assassins creed lmao i havent even finished this game still with 30 completion ive been enjoying syndicate and china too much oh damn i remember finished this game with less than 20fps this is way too smooth been waiting so long for this witness the most popularly awful incarnation of desmond miles you love him you missed him hes still as unemotional as a sloth offered a drink by bill cosby connor kenway now in hd regardless of how much i hated this game the graphics are a lot better i honestly might play it just because of that so much remastered games fuck now we need black ops 12 and mw 12 o shit we need every fucken game remastered i love this game do you know what the best thing is we get to hearing northern norths voice just one more time even though we will remember him for playing as nathan drake of the uncharted serious at least we did get to hear his voice one more time playing as desmond miles from assassins creed 2 and 3 am i the only one who thinks rebecca sounds like ash ketchum in 13rds of puberty remastered everyone way better graphics maybe revised missions and updated gameplay mechanics ubisoft yehhloww shaaydur ive been looking forward to this day cant wait to get this game looking forward to playing part 3 again i cant see a chance maybe you change graphics gud video what the heck why wasnt i told it came out well how much is it desmond must be an assassin creed game then the plants arent a mess of pixels anymore hooray the graphic is stable they shouldve remastered brotherhood or black flag instead assassins creed iii remastered pc gtx 750 1gb 1711 what the hell is wrong with that kids eyes like good god it looks like he survived the worst parts of hell in wwi and wwii at the same time desmond miles is back everyone we know what must be done we go down to google hq boycott them till we have given our hero mkfireandice the power to let him play the game the way its supposed to be played cause god dammit this is bullshit for the god dam cutscenes that have words when there is music in them and we miss out on the fucking voice actors giving us these hard worked games of beauty takes a deep breath im sorry for my outburst there mk i really am i will make sure it will never happen again keep giving us great videos though bad remasteredmodel it very funny calm down guys its a remaster not a remake the game no longer looks like an abomination yay ubisoft yep weve been dead since 2012 were already in hell its assassins creed 3 with a yellow tint wow they did great with the lighting and other stuff but they can never make the shadowing perfect on certain parts the grounds looks more fake tho i cant wait to play this game on nintendo switch love ac iii i expected more reeeeeeee im so hyped thanks mk thank you how did you get this games so fucking fast anyway keep up the good work 3 the character model seems to unmastered thou some sort of weird shadowing going on the character face they all look like they are ill or something i wonder if u can throw your tomahawk wait what how did y ah nevermind wonderfull i love assassins creed good video please play evil within and resident evil 7 when is this out still a crappy game though hi want game can i please have it about time remastered the best assassins creed ever made how u playing early an youll always be my go to gaming channel the dislikes are from ezio cocksuckers as a native this is my favorite assassins creed game well well well achilles we meet again please dont cheat in fanorona im trying to get original gamer trophy a number of people like origins and odyssey yes they are good games especially origins but they cannot be compared to 1 2 and 3 they had proper stories they had the wisdoms thats what we seek the two double os are good games but please ubisoft we want a relatable modern character you need to bring back desmond please i dont need to see centuries old pythagoras learning his work to this date is quite enough of him anyone else notice in the description it says release date 29319 i love the theme song and when i listen to it makes me like an assassin and i put my hands out like i got the blades and it makes me cry and say old man i was so hyped for this game when the reveal came out thank you ubisoft for making this great game coming back thank you didnt need to be remastered need to be redid the trophie has a good sense of humour 2021 assassins creed 1 orange edition 101 is that the voice actor for doctor zere from dying light my opinion i hated oddsey because the best combat was rhe old ac were u can counter were their was no damage numbers just fighting ubisoft remastered ezio trilogy rogue ac3 and liberation but no assassins creed 1 whats next assassins creed bloodlines hd is achilles outfit still in the game come on give us far cry 2 remastered hope they remastered black flag why dnt they release spelitercell collections remastered instead of ac games that they have made game on already both ps4 and xbox one my childhood game is back as a sucess why why not assassins creed 2 they should have done this for ac 1 or 2 the real question is out of all the ac games to remaster why this one why the one with desmonds end ubisofts trying to tell us something but what can i buy the game digitally just got assassins creed 3 remastered today cant wait play and liberations that comes with it best assassin creed ever well it would be nice if the game was actually available to download why you make ps4 users suffer can we crouch in this remaster hour is 29 and nothing do i get a yellow crayon when i purchase this i want it now but its not on the playstation store yet i hope it has multipayer i want brotherhood and revelations too ubisoft are you listening assassins creed beauty plus my favorite assassin creed kids play ac odessy origins but legends play acac2brotherhood ac3 ac2 brother hood and ac3 were the best i miss ezio wish theyd remaster the 2nd one scalp some british looks the same with different lighting assassins creed 3 paint edition what is that hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh you said early march and i was here like tf my ps broke or sum if we play an ac games except odyssey and origins we felt like a strongest man in the world the choosen man the greatest we dont need more realistic npcs we dont need strong npcs like the main character we are assassin the choosen human we are stronger than the other thats why i like ac games this game should be able to realize our imagination not make it difficult for us to be creative in this game sorry for my bad english just like the oddysey i hope you are remaking ac1 with remake im not talking about the remastered makeup thing im talking about a new game from the beginning to the end i want assassin creed 2 or brotherhood remastered dont lie to us ubisoft i hope you removed alllthe bugs this game had i remember them as if it was yesterday omg finally i was gonna buy a ps3 for this game i would have a loved a revamp of the game as opposed to slightly better textures antialiasing and distance draw of course lighting as well but this is again a cash grab i will buy it cuz im a sucker for this game i love it they should work on a total remastering of assassins creed and the ezio trilogy perhaps try working on them by keeping what was great and remove and replace what was bad about them this goes for ac3 as well lost opportunity this is my favorite assassins creed game considering its the last onr with desmond so im hoping that this does the original justice the best assassins creed ever where is charles lee will it launch in physical media good to see ubisoft not forgetting the real assassins creed so it comes out the 26th cant wait to get it why cant we preorder this from the playstation store i actually liked ac3 more than ac4 sailing got sooo boring after a while im happy this is getting remastered it is after all the end of the desmond saga this will go perfectly with the ezio trilogy so far the only main ac game to not be on the current gen of consoles is ac1 but i understand that that game didnt age as well as the rest but i believe ubisoft can do it theyre not just remastering the graphics for ac3 theyre also remastering some gameplay mechanics too so i think they can definitely pull off an ac1 remaster this game really sucks say no more heres my money time to find shay patrick cormac an charles lee 2pac voice i see no changes 60 fps pre order of amazon not ubisoft its cheaper in the uk back when the combat system still felt like assassins creed yey assasins screed 3 yes wait so is this the same terrible game or did they only make it yellow do you need the disc if you already have the season pass 2012 memories inbound snap chat wants to know your location i only have one question why honestly who asked for this game what demand is being met by remastering this barely 6 year old title at least make the graphics better smh lol this game isnt even that good like what are they thinking about little kids money the worst assassins creed game damm ubisoft really needs the money huh the real question is will there be multiplayer now we need brotherhood remastered assasin creed 3sunset edition is there gonna be a multiplayer pls it was amazing i want a redo not a remaster this game has so much potential its insane now with modern technology we could have a larger more expansive world and story we could also give connors more room to breathe and develop i felt he was given the short end of the stick worse ac game ever even worse than the first one sorry not sorry it better not be 60 cause im not paying that much for a game i already have on ps3 just to have a version that brighter in color remaster the first one assassins creed 3 yellow and too much godrays the best assassins creed hands down where is imagine dragons i remember the tv trailrr used to bring me chills down my spine i dont trust ubisoft connor is a great and tragic character unfortunately the story doesnt do him justice and we as players couldnt really identify with him especially after three games with ezio i hope that with this remaster also those who werent completely into the story will give it a second chance even with its flaws this game really was the final masterpiece by the original team and it greatly expanded and improved on the mechanics of the previous games while also introduced us to open world hunting crafting and naval missions it was also the last game with full brotherhood system with recruitments and missions everything that came after this has been more or less just partial rehash of this game just a bit yellow wouldnt mind buying the last ac game remastered actually ok but that song still holds up this is charles dad from rdr 2 not to be like everyone else in the comments but why is it so yellow the side by side at 039 gets me the most ik everything else has been improved but it just seems odd why the third assassin did anyone actually play liberation fix the false advertised mission then i would consider is it worth buying never played it plz help they deadass need to make the first assassins creed remastered with new combat controls yo i remember playing ac3 and im experiencing so much nostalgia uwu this is the best assassins creed gamei swear im not saying that because im part of the same tribe as connor best assassins creed ever please not i wish for ac1 remaster this isnt a remaster its a reskin can not wait i remember buying the ps3 super slim bundle with this game ubisoft should finish every history with single assassin like for ezio what about black flag ah yes ac3 the one everyone shat on and rightfully so we need a sequel with ezios son wow this remake is a complete waste of time but also is a trashy graphical update for ac3 one of the best ac soundtracks connor kenway aka charles smith i am so hyped never played it so im extremely excited one of the best if not the best ac game ac3 fan i hate ac odssey real fan so whats your fav ac3 fan of course its ac3 real fan left the server long live the creed there must be another kenway game please ac iv black flag remastered assassin creed brotherhood is my favorite omg this is coming out why am i just hearing of this thank you ubisoft you finally listen this is my favourite assassins creed am i using a blue light filter in my ps4 hahahaha this was my favorite assassins creed game couldnt they have remastered something like ac 2 i mean its already a masterpiece but improved visuals would be nice right i hope it comes out on xbox to assassins creed brotherhood was better these remasters dont even look that good tf white areas became reddish and yellowish ohmah i am playing ac3 liberation right now czech subtitles alexios outlived connor they should remastered assassins creed 2 my 1 favorite assassins creed on consoles and liberation will always be my favorite on the vita finally odyssey fan boys can taste a true ac what about the ezio trilogy actually excited 3 was in my favorite time period and setting for the series assassins creed 3 was the first one i played in the seriesi was around 8 years oldand due to moving problemsnever got to finish iti remember as clear as day the last mission i had was the one where they were at a boxing match and that i was on top of the match looking for someone to eliminatethe game was incredibke back then they better make connor a bit handsomish because old ver connor is a bit dull can you make assassins creed black flag remastered off topic i never played unity but did arno find out shay was the one who killed his father i want this on switch finally release soon can we get this without buying ac oddesy season pass all i need is just splinter cell chaos theory remake this is awesome i really enjoyed 3 hope theyll do the same for black flag i wanna know if theyre bringing multiplayer back as well it was the icing on the cake for me after i finished the story i see they decided to use the lemoyne filter for ac3 remastered looks cool get ready to pay 60 for yellow filter 2 games and all single player dlc youve done it im definitely buying this they should also remaster black flag the best assassins creed game is obviously the 3rd one i wanna get this and the ezio trilogy to have desmonds trilogy did they remake the very first assassins creed does that mean that we will be able to buy ac3 without odyssey ac 3 isnt my favorite ac2 and 4 all time favoritesand maybe unity but i wanna try liberation still not try yes now i can finally play somthing good for once i was stuck on trying to save his mom for like 20 min ill just wait for assassins creed 20 what about the multiplayer that was super fun back in the day this community makes me feel shame these days they every good remastered game they say its bad omg youre all ridiculous they can improve by using the environment as a weapon in ac games in the future like they did in the first game and improve the stealth that would make a lot of difference best dlc there has ever been finally i can do those brutal hidden blade dual kills again the texture of environment is good but the face is bad wow they threw in another game assassins creed liberation im down with that ok i got the odyssey base and ac3 comes with it but like no where online says what i will have to do to unlock it when it comes out personally i prefer assasins creed 2 to be remastered assassins creed i remake please the most important part lootboxes please for the love of god return with the pvp multiplayer connor and aveline are back this is good news no thanks all i want from my remasters is more yellow and im glad this is going to deliver a remaster that no one asked for a game that was heavily despised i didnt know that using a warm filter is called as remastered its released on my birthday date lol now remsater ac4 ubisoft remaster ac 4 or make another assassins creed game on pirates please i need another game with same gameplay as ac4 rpg is not better skulls and bones sucks i like remastered of the game i like the style thats what i waited for this is one of the greatest days of my life ive waited so long for this moment literally since 2016 ive been waiting for this and it has finally come true whats next black flag remaster origins remaster cant you just make an assassins creed game in japan and samurais is it really that hard is it a remaster or the pc ver put on consoles im sold either way at this point assassins creed iii todd howard edition better than odyssey remaster assassin creed revolution plz so cant wait for this game one of my favourite games of the series remake is the best i have been waiting my whole life for this is this a joke ddawg cant wait i recently pulled out my old ps3 because i was in the mood for some ac3 it brought back my love for the ac games then i remembered the ezio trilogy came out for ps4 and i wondered if the same would happen for ac3 and then i stumble upon this my faith in god has been restored is it just what happened in ac 3 to be honest i dont appreciate these new lightnings the story is about a dark world trough the eyes of an native american freedom fighter where its dark bitter and more into the story than if it was brighter anyone else who agree with me the all timelegendary has come back i love assassins creed iii but where is the online mode ac 3 is the worst game because the story is completely ked up worst story ever the twists are awful it was also banned in some country of europe because of its violence so many british were killed which hurted the sentiments of the british the character development is not there like it was in ac rouge which was short game but really immersive dont put your money into it heres my list from worst to best ac 3 ac unity ac revelations ac 1 ac rouge ac syndicate ac 2 ac black flagpersonal fav ive played them and the worst is ac 3 is this only for playstation or will it also be available in xbox the worst ac in 7th gen i want connor and arno to hunt down shay a standalone game i wouldnt care about modern day pls make it happen many loyal fans would be hyped for it blaxk flag is supreme we all should buy it so tht ubisoft knows what we like a real assassin game i need ac2 remastered i remember when first bought this game got to my house and waited hours to install it when i began to play it i just couldnt sleep through the night playing ac iii ubisoft ceo lets remaster ac3 employees what should we do with the graphical improvement ceo while eating a orange make it orange all of it assassins creed 3 was not that good why wil they remastered finally hadi canim sende finally ac3 remastered aka another game my pc cant run how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in maa way the memes came true seeing video in suggestions is this really needed watching video i need this they made it yellow nintendo switch cant wait for the new filter just one wordawesome well guess well see desmond die again in a remastered version im crying i dont know what you think of ac rogue but its too underrated its my favorite where is iv black flag avelines here this is amazing so much fun with this game in 5th grade this is the best of all time i really appreciate this assassina creed black flag os te best i need this i want assassins creed iii remake could be better graffics this game should have been remade not a remaster omg assassins creed 3 remake yesd i love assassins creed 3 it looks so good why not ac 2 i remember playing this but they should make a sequel to ac3 instead of remastering it the water continues bad this is not a filter not a game its history and its assassins creed 3 one of my personal favourites thanks for the remaster playstation assassins creed was done when desmond died everything afterwards was just a moneygrab at least i can play it on next gen will this only be on ps4 or will it also work on pc when ac used to be good its the worst remastered for ever best assassins creed i want a assassins creed revelations remastered that moment when gaming companies have to literally go back to their old games because those are the only types of games people actually enjoy and good work was put into it with a sense of passion yes my favourite assassin creed game why the

1 i would totaly buy that not this best assassin creed ever my guy can remastered black flag the grammar in this comment section is horrendous wow i must assasin all series is like a movie finally in pc this is gonna be brutal next assassins creed ii a remasterization of ac rogue would be very legal should have remastered the ezio trilogy or a continuation of bayeks story i understand though as this was an extremely underrated ac assassins creed ezio remastered 2brotherhoodrevelations best assassin in the game sorrybut who cares about this game anymore ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhssshhhhhhitamuthafuckaremasteredofashitacgamethatilovesonceasakid that music gives me goosebumps finally now once the first assassins creed game is remastered i wont have to buy anymore assassins creed games all i care about is ac ac ii ac brotherhood ac revelations ac iii those are litterally the only good games ever since they killed desmond off the story holding the series together has gotten more and more stale to the point where assassins creed isnt assassins creed anymore i want remake no remaster ac3 with movement system from origins or odissey and with better face animations ac like this a will buy but ac3 remaster no thats the best pre ordered mine today cant wait they should remaster warhawk we whant ac1 remastered hey ubisoft where assassins creed 1 remastered ubisoft x instagram assassin creed iii remastered is it just me or did they just slap a yellow filter on it and did nothing to the graphics i dont know if its been remastered before but i would love an ac 1 ive never gotten to play the first one i dont play 2 times the same game for 60 let us use the tyranny of king george outfit in story it was so beast bold italics that are crossed out and s p a c e d o u t ac fans we loved ac 4 ubisoft i mean it was alright random people play odyssey but legends are still playing ac 2 or brotherhood what does remastered even mean here add more contrast assasin creed 3 yellow edition v i hope my spec can run it yessssssssssss my favorite assassins creed game remastered cant wait im getting this only for 3 liberation sucks ads its official i know what im getting next month why not start in the first game name it assasans creed with warm filters i hope it has online multiplayer i have this for ps3 i dont think im gonna buy it again just nutted on my keyboard assains creed 1 remasterd assassins creed philippine revolution best assassins creed part mi my favorite ac is black flag this is true i play all ac games respect they should remaster ac1 its in playstation europe why not america awesome my faves syndicate or black flag or assassins creed this comes with ac odessy dlc liberation remastered on ps4 or vita if u want to remake some ac game you should remake ac 2 with new ac mechanics but try not to lost the main ac 2 best game that changed the tide of the creed now thats what i call an assassins creed game i wonder when they are going to remaster the first one dont ubisoft please announce the new watch dogs game you guys make the assasins creed a bad game after origins ac3 with orange filter the best ac imo they remastered the wrong one sooooowe finally gonna get an assassins creed 1 or shut up and take my money still waiting for prince of persia yellower does it include the multiplayer get brother hood and black flag remastered and ill be a happy lad x i cant wait perfection assassins creed 2 please i want assassins creed black flag remastered i looks a lot like ac unitys graphics the only assassins creed i actually like my first assassins creed dlc yellow edition 60 im fine as long as we can get his stories end i canot wait all of us want ezios story remastered the most boring ac theres no point in getting it since ubisoft always downgrade their games when they come out splinter cell blacklist remastered or new splinter cell please ubisoft one of my favourite games ever cant wait this would be one of my favorite assassins creed games but the beginning of the game takes so long i feel like really not 2not brotherhood 3 really i hope this assasin will add more benefits just like big ope world fights and other and add new story at after the orginal story who else is waiting on bo2 remastered three do one and twoooooooooo no please no please pc version release assasins creed 2 brotherhood ridcules the game assassinado creed s one this is prime remaker no assassin creed three desnecessries creation for remaker its the bad mt favorite assasin creed this is revelation ive played this its very super adventure i dont need a remaster from this game beat all the assassins creeds up till the newer ones the old ones are by far the best and they need to go back to this style and story type ac 3 is my favourite and i am so happy that they remaster it ac3 remaster pinch me so is this going to be better because this game is the very worst of all the ac games best assassin this is true ac the music in this game is breathtaking so wait when is this coming out assassin creed 3 the game that made me passed history class with b i want assasins creed 1 remastered not thisss one deja vu except it was with ac ii they are rlly milking this game just bring prince of persia back i dont like this yellow filter despite what people are saying this game in my opinion is a bad one i much prefer ones like blag flag odyssey and origins i think this game can save assassins creed now its rockstar all around with the red dead redemption do i have to watch achilles and desmond die again did my connor just yell at achilles will it have multiplayer tho it was already graphic heavy had a ps3but didnt work properelymy parents wasted money on 3 games and one of them was ac3played it for 2 or 3 hours and it didnt work anymorewas so sadand since i became a big fan i might get it for ps4 i want one game just for the haytham loved assassins creed 3 but it will be hard to adapt back to the old system after hundreds of hours of odyssey finally when the natives say and english word in a sentence it sounds so funny it looks like ubisoft is too bad in gaming sells that they need to remaster greatest hits in order to save their asses for the waste of money with the division 2 i m going to die i have the iii original the best story in ac series brotherhood was my favorite with multiplayer my favourite assassins creed releases on billie eilish new album wow they applied an enb graphics mod to assassins creed 3 they should remaster ac u know the one with altair so we can experience glory in ps4 when is 290319 i dont know why this is the most hated assasins creed this is my favorite black flag was the best and where is ac3 remastered remastered please i hope they make connor have at least a proper ending next time assassins creed origins reremastered i only see work and development in lighting only 60fps and a vibrant filter really ubisoft more orange please its just stupidity to give you more money for a graphic change triler start with a glitch when you add a assasin creed game in china like samurai assasin the worst one man what if they just added a special event that involves more founding fathers like meeting mulligan hamilton and burr literally no difference besides a yellow filter aww warm filter dats not remaster ubisoft be ridin the remake train the best assasins creed in my opinion why not assassins creed 2 the one assassins creed game almost everyone liked when youre too lazy to make a new game so you just add filter to the old one plzmake it control better but where is charles lee this is just ac 3 with yellow filter no its not the greatest and most badass assassin is here the first game should have been remade with some gameplay elements of origins the last good assassins creed i need ac black flag remastered my childhood games is getting reborn the assassins creed nobody asked for one of the assassins creed i like the most i want brotherhood do acbrotherhood awwwww yeeee ahhh i csn play this on my ps4 time to make some money with a few gigabyte of texture packs the best ac they should take out a remastered version of blag flag it will be awesome i guess they are finally running out of ideas what if ac 2 got a remaster like this omg pubg will miss me after re 2 they gonna make only remakes omg this amazing music my second favorite assasins creed game my first assassins creed game i dont understand why people dont like ac3 its one of my favourites from the franchise now this is real assassins creed no amount of words can make up how excited i am what if we already own it the best game i love best story best soundtrack best action its free assassin creed 3 was a good game i learnt history playing the game xd i swear every indian character in a game has the smoothest voice like charles from red dead is it official though remaster black flag pretty please i wanna sail the caribbean again lol stop i dont wanna play 1980 game anymore enough with rdr2 gasp an assassins creed game since black flag ac 1 ac 2 ac brotherhood ac revelotion ac liberetion ac chine ac russia ac 4 ac unity ac rogue ac origins ac oddysey enough b o r i n g lol the only assasin creed i couldnt finish is getting remastered win assassins creed 3 the downgrade i love this game so much even though people hate this how times have changed i remember when this was the worst assassins creed and people were glad desmond was dead this was the best game in the series super human damned trailer was boom that time it was crazy i will buy this if it runs better on ps4 than what it used to run on ps3laggy and low contrast of frontier forest etc can on pc so whos the assassin is it ezio kenway oh yeah the second worst assassins creed game remaster assassins creed 1 why would they do that nah fam lets remaster one of the worst ones return of connor trash the thing that i still dislike about the series is that it has the part where you are in the modern day id rather it just be stories about exceptional people in an assasin organization throughout time that fought people if you could make odissey work that would be great ohhhhhh yeesssssss finally a remake worthy of purchase this was my first assassins creed game why is everything orange one of the best games this is ac not like oddysey no rpg only fun and true ac experience they should of remasters assassins creed 2 my favourite assassin creed omfg i love u ubisoft assassins creed 3 graphics ate to many carrots still an amazing game tho why 3 why not ac1 or the ezio saga but why 3 they remastered ac3 over ac2 wtfffff pfff just an yellow ac i prefer a remake finally i dont care what people say this was the best assassin game ever so we get a remaster from the second worst ac game instead of brotherhood okeeeeee my first ac i want assassins creed unity remastered and a time machine so they can make it work on the first try i want play altair story in next gen ac1 pls remake it why original looks better assassin creed 1 remastered plzzzzz hopefully they fix the bugs i hope that legend will be without gays got a bad feeling about this this is the best assassins creed i think im upset theres no wheres charles lee jokes in the comments so everything is yellow now id like to see the remaked ac with altair this look so much better ubisoftwhat are you doingjust stop god ive misses this gamethank you ubisoft i never thought i would say that aw yeah i liked it on ps3 but i switched to ps4 so whats the difference well at least we can play assassins with hidden blade i dont know why every remaster has only few texture update they should focus on combat movement animation and other new aspects that they can put in by learning from their successors pls assassins creed 4 remastered why not the first assassins creed the game that started it all i mean sure ac 2 is what got the avalanche going but we already have some kind of a remaster of that one why not remaster one or 2 it would be a big disappointment if this is the main assassins game game this year i mean its good but doesnt offer many new things wow my favourite assassin creed game is getting remastered im looking forward to it assassins creed brotherhood remake should happen or actually they should have made a remake of ac3 waste of money just a little brightness added wow its the yellow edition of assassins creed lul amongst all assassins connor has the best combat skills and tool usage for me why isit thay apparently this was one of the worst games in thr franchise and recieved so much hate and yet everyone seems hyped for it all sudden black flag its beautiful i want syndicate remastered assassin cread four btw if you are american like me the release date is 032919 remastered asassins creed 1 they were out of ideas i wpuld like to see assassins creed i remastered i want this kind of assassins creed again yes we will also see desmond again how about you guys fix the broken ac4 pc port first ac4 on pc is still unacceptable if you only focus on face that not look like remastered the best assassins creed story ever yay my childhood game love you ubisoft 3 ac3 is one of the my favourite games but this faces 034 in original this scene was night ps sorry for my english plz make a good ac game like this again we want prince of persia how is this a 2019 remastered game still looks weak the faces look straight from a ps3 i wanted a sequel not a remaster ezio is the best ive played and ended this game twice on an integrated gfx laptop haha thats how optimised the original one was this looks nice tho they literally just edited the light textures a little to make it a little brighter are they gonna charge 40 bucks for this one too seriously i love odyssey im currently on my second playthrough and i have 120 hours invested in that game in total but these remastered ac games are just a cheap cash grab for the years where they dont release a main title which is kinda lame i also loved origins and really the only ac ive truly disliked was unity so its not like i hate ubisoft or anything but they need to stop being greedy tbh i only read this as assassins creed remastered and i was psyched make it happen why dont ubisoft make a remastered of assassins creed 1 bro im nerding our so hard rn my assassins favorite this is ac please multiplayer this was amazing ea can you please remaster fight night champion since you refuse to make a new boxing game so not asscreed 1 2 brotherhood or 4 remastered soooo hard pass so r u gonna play as the man or woman or is it not optional we wanted assassins creed 2s remastered version and we got this what loved this game now remaster all the castlevania games and kingdom of amalur amd dead space ok thanks this is gonna be stunning my childhood cool ive been waiting to replay this game wasnt a fan of assassins creed 3 however the visuals were always stunning to me especially in the woods connor the best for me i still want a game based on haytham best assassin creed everconnor yessssssss wait is it official or is it only in europe now i really want a playstation to play my assassins creed game only part of this video that got my hyped was the theme song assassins creed iii wasnt that long ago they should have remastered the first two so when they go to the third the graphics would at least look more drastically different remastering games that came out 5 years ago are we just a different filter thank you so much i havent played the game for years assassin creed rouge was my favorite game man i missed killing templars this is gonna be awsome why cant they remaster black flag the best assassins creed they need to remaster is revelations absolutely amazing storyline with ezio the og of assassins and their multiplayer for it was so much fun imagine releasing that again with the player count and this generation of playersthey would love it it would be so fun with friends and get the credit it deserves better update old games new you can not get its my favorite finally and assasins creed black flag i still play this game in my ps3 hell ye hope the online stays the same noticed how when connor is walking in boston his hood is down toggleable hood lets hope they add crouching button too not gonna buy this one lol trying to make money out of the same game twice a hard pass they should of stopped at 3 im tired of assassins creed games i mean its look pretty and all but this is arguably the worst game in the golden age of the series watch codmw4 remastered and learn something about remastered do not cc only ubisoft yeah assassins creed if you want to save yourself a couple quid you can get the remastered version through upping your brightness on your tvmonitor this is good but id rather have black flag remastered that was the best one imo i mean this game was generally good but who asked for this remaster god of war 2 remake so hes pocahontas will there be multiplayer why is nobody talking about sc 3 liberation i loved that game ubisoft meeting alright people no original ideasso whats nextcome on people think the investors are hounding us everyone else that is out of ideas is just doing lazy remasters or battle royale guys i got it you know what well remaster ac thats a great idea yeah woooo easy profit so whats the plan brown lighting ohh good times i want this game thank you ubi just thank you i dont really think aciii needs an remaster ill tell you which one does though the original this looks bad yes i know that its not a remake but im pretty sure that its standard that when you make a remaster your supposed to make the graphics better not put a filter over it preapere your wallets assassins creed 3 my lave game am i the only one who thinks that they shouldve done ac2 remake awesome i loved this assassin creed remastered in 720p they remade the worst assassins creed my favorite ac is black flag and ac3 where is charles lee remastered conor was by far the most badass assassin best outfit by far strongest and best main weapon axe also ac3 is the best ac in my opinion make a mafia 2 remastered please similar to this game they both share a beautiful storyline mafia 2 is a forever classic that i want to hold on to forever well at least they know whats better an ac with no retarded combat simple and nice story to follow actually enjoyfull combat and an amazing land to run around idc for the instagram filter tbh it us still an og ac and that makes me happy good game i completed it several times but only once went for 100 should remaster brotherhood i loved this hopefully it holds up i remeber at the time people were very dissapointed but this is still a pretty good ac and had nice ratings they shouldve added a new dlc for the remaster where you hunt shay we need ac revalations remastered d but why my favorite assassins creed game boo do the one we all know is the best black flag damnit ubisoft always assassin assassin assassin change a little bit thats suck really desappinted yeah no thanks revive prince of persia series ac is an old man are we going to get this on pc as well we need modern warfare 3 remaster thumps up please the last good assassins creed anyone notice that all remasters look like the guy with a new filter and thats it not better than re2 if they make assassins creed brotherhood i will buy guise we need a improvement to our latest cash grab rehashwhat do we do to improve aciii just turn the godrays to 11 the truly end of ac games my boy connor in my opinion this was the best assassins creed game i will most certainly be playing it again on the ps4 see how the video is not at 60 fps even ubisoft is taking a dig at console peasants the only question can my pc bear this im actually hypeloved 3 played tf outta it when it dropped is this only better graphics or new missions they should have remake it ubisoft suck at remasters looks nice but greedy i mean bioshock released the 3 game in one remastered why couldnt ubisoft do the same give us the battle of bunker hill like the trailer shows the best one in the series lets fuckin goooooooooooo sorry but no is the game better please dont downgrade this time this game is epic now we need his grandfather to be remastered too out come the likewhoring kiddos switch portage please its really so difficult make a good remastered in terms of quality gameplay ubi u made an amazing graphic on origins why dont try this high quality on a good remastered ezios trilogy is almost identical compared to old gen sometimes i really think that ubisoft is too overrated the best ac in the franchise still too this day one of the best assassins creed games that meets a lot of expectations and an amazing game in general i am so getting this game when it comes outi love the assassins creed franchise my first assassins creed game and i will not forget this game still waiting for next gen play stationps5 this are some amazing changes that really look different and remastered 3 worst assassins creed cringe but i really want the battle and gameplay controls of ac odyssey its just so hard to go back the older ac controls where can i buy preorder d black flag and rogue are the best later on uhhhh i mean they did filter it a littlei guess ac1ac unity only games that were good 104 and 108 im with ps1 or what le quieren copiar a resident evil 2 remake they want to copy from resident evil 2 remake what kind of remastered is this is it bad that i couldnt tell the difference between the old version and the new version in the video old but not weak bring black ops 2 remastered out of all acs to remaster why this one the shittest one out of all of them the last good ac game off topic but id like to see the original mass effect trilogy remastered assassins creed 3 yellow edition gos i wish it would have the multiplayer 2012 assasins creedblue 2018 assasins creedyellow they better not add any time savers kids play assassin creed odessey and legends play assassin creed 3 real warrior its just yellow if shay has a trylogy combat and traversal is extremely limited in this game a blind chimp without opposable thumbs could master it i love connors theme i loved this game now we can kill charles lee in 4k resolution great remastered bad game why remastered why pls remake come pls the best ac game of all for me my favorite 3 how about ac4remastered or ac5 looks really good ill buy it black flag is the best assassins creed till date im going to buy this game it was fine it didnt need remastering but whatever im weeeeeeet i still just want to play as haytham instead of connor now i can experience the fall of a franchise with remastered graphics i guess those who already have the previous game will receive this free version no like the mark of the ninja honestly what was wrong with the first ac3 now is like the pc version i dont see a good remake like re2 o cod4 come on ubisoft you are not even trying anymore my first game assassisns creed 3 the best game love you ac3 wtf you have all of ezios games to remaster and black flag and you seriously chose 3 ubisoft are yoi kidding remastered put it on switch why buy it when the gameplay story and animations are the same ubisoft is running out of ideas and decided to remaster the worst game in franchise it would have been milion times better if they would remaster ac2 acbrotherhood or acrevelations literally the worst assassins creed they remaster one of my favorite 3 games assassins creed my favorite its been a while since ive heard the word templars we need a remade assassins creed 1 give us more of altair and the creed lowkey haytham was right the story is great but the gameplay and the world are boring not gonna to double dip on this assassins creed is a good franchise some hdr added just end the series already seriously i mean its a good game but revelations and brotherhood would have been better to remaster watch them charge us 60 to replay a game too lol origins and odyssey were great mercenary simulators cant wait to play an actual assassins game again hope we can put on our hood after we complete the game remastered ac black flag i wished for this last year seems like my wish came true goodbye father someone tomahawk me cause i must be dreaming very cool graphics connor has the best story and deserve a standalone sequel change my mind who asked for this mannn it would be better if they remake 2 lol an ac game worth playing again for the remastered version cant wait for this it would be nice to have a switch port texture upgrade 60 cough it up when youre more excited for ac remasters than new releases in the franchise that awkward moment when game developers cant come up with good original games anymore so they start hoping on the remastered train and do so with laughable graphic upgrades and will probably expect people to buy it as if its a brand new game worth 6099 the worst assasins creed tomahawk chop ac has the best game trailers i want assassins creed odyssey remastered my favorite prince of persia plz make prince of persia game i know that ac is a ubisoft id but when jak 23 remaster is coming out wheres my ac 1 remastered tbh this was my favorite assassins creed game ever ezio story is da best is this a joke what this looks amazing aaaaaaah this was back when i thought assassins creed was a good game no way im so excited wed also love a remaster of the original assassins creed please just different lighting and nothing else if i get it it will be for aveline on ps4 lets go the best one a sequel with connor chasing cormac will be epic and most hyped assassins creed of all time it looks like normal ac3 but on pc lol there is almost no difference between these two games lol this remaster is completely a trash who asked for this it better not cost 60 this game was soooo laaaaaaame when desmond died the series kinda died with him or at least remained in a coma but even so im really looking forward to relieve the series last living moments and 2012s segments of the game with shawn rebbeca william and desmond maaaaan they were aaaaaawesome the last assassins creed created this made me feel good for some reason so the trick is that you add sunshine to the game and it becomes remastered played that game 4 times for a while i thought it was ac 1 remastered awesome who else is waiting for assassins creed 1 to get a remaster xbox one retrocompatibility you play for free ill just pretend hes charles from red dead and then they put a downgrade in it could we play online in the remastered pls make brotherhood i still play ezio trilogy with my pc who else maybe if was assassins creed 12 or brotherhood be greater ac 2 or brotherhood needs to be remastered ok this is fine and all but why not remake ac2 or brotherhood or any of the ezio acs this one is better than these new acs that they keep pumping but its still so bad compared to ezios triology ugh how about new games tomahawk chooooppppp this was the only good one out of them i got so invested i got platinum i think they overdid the lighting wayyy too much im not against it but they overdid it as for the textures you can clearly see it looks a lot better overall im pumped i have waitedso long for this literally screaming but then againuhh i kinda want the first assassins creed gameya know the altair gameyeah uwu is it bad that i got an erection by this is there also the old fighting system or is there the new one unless this comes with the original online game modes honestly dont care is this actually real would rather have ac4 than ac3 remastered wtf assassins creed isnt even assassins creed anymore hmmm im in next up can we get brotherhood remastered my first assassins creed game 400k views yeah the story line will be the same okay ubisoft i just hope not so many problems this is the worst ac game why would they remaster it in my opinion odysseys was better what a icon game remaster thats what ive been waiting for they remastered the wrong one ahhh have to play hide and seek mission in 4k again and why not remaster ac 4 just a yellowish filter honestly this was unexpected the best one finally they remastered 3 not 2 the most definitive ac3 to date change my mind wow ubisoft are releasing a yellow filter on assassins creed wow yeyi missed connor i hope to be dubbed for the arabic language i love assassins creed revelations is it already available for pre order the way assassins creed should be it would have been way better if they would have got a prince of persia remastered warrior within or t2t this is why i stopped going along with ubi why though why not acii cool the only one i actually enjoyed my beloved game id rather an assassins creed 2 remastered but ill take this as well i enjoy this game alot conor is so gay on god so assassins creed with nightshift my favorite ac game but it sucks that theyre doing a remaster cuz that means well never get a remake with the new or better engines and mechanics fml at last a real assasins creed game assasins creed is a good franchise spartan total warrior remastered like if you won this why not for the switch the people would buy it shut up and take my money assassins creed is a good franchise thumbs up prince of persia funs these guys should make a prince of persia 2 remastered it looks terrible somebodys running out of ideas now thats somethin i wanted awesome incredible god save the king from my perspective ac3 is the best and most memorable ac game ever bulit in addition to this connor and haytham should be given oscar if it were a movie i want ac3 to be continued with desmond miles wouldve be better a remastered of brotherhood great so when is demons souls remastered who cares i had finish the game 3 times in the ps3 i was waiting 2 years to come in ps4 finally conor is back my favorite is the second if they remastered the thing with the dual holsters bug too then im sold mi favourite assasin scred is 2 this game was looking good not much of an upgrade they should have remaster the first one with altair after that ac2 fuckin thumbnail 290319 now it look likes the version of e3 omg ea acs are dead make a new game yall need to make an assassins creed set in the war of 1812 connor aveline shay arno all their stories have been left hanging and if games like freedom cry and liberation were ever to lead up to any big comingtoahead moment where assassins creed does the civil war an 1812 game would be the perfect springboard for it the way black flag springboarded rogue unity springboarded syndicate and origins springboarded odyssey you could call it assassins creed overture i bought the ultimate edition of odyssey does that mean when this comes out its just going to download immediately dammit just literally got aciii yesterday the most iconic moment of assassins creed 3 for me was at the final mission where you chase after charles lee but each and every time he escapes by falling through the floor just before you leave the dock area that glitch nearly made me give up on finishing the game who asked for this the game was great i loved it but never expected a remaster they really want that money trash gemme back ezio look at the graphics tho omgg my first ever ac games that i play when i was a boy the remaster we were not waiting for whos excited so this means we are not going to have a new ac game this year the best ac the best ac fighter the best fighting system period if its just a ps4 exclusive that will suck for xbox one gamers and pc gamers sorry but why arent we getting the first one or ezios trilogy why remaster when of the worst entries in the series im waiting for black flag remastered why ac 3 and not ac 2 whats the point of having remastered if ubisoft will downgrade it anyway so no more flat grass the best assassins creed game ever made hands down 3 no brotherhood am sed now why not ezio 4 words how much is it silent hill remake assassins creed i remake plz assassins creed iv would be better iam hyped the best assassins creed ever nice now i can play nearly every game but prince of persia when ubisoftwhen it should have implemented pbr ac 1 please 30fps now we need far cry 3 remastered cant wait someone please make a drake meme where ubisoft dont want to make normal ac game but makes rpgs and remastered version of the icons of the serie i loved assassins creed 3 trailler but i already played so they jus changed the filter ac originsodessy are my favourite to be honest all assassins main weapon its hidden blade with sword except assassins tomohawk this assassins creed 3 remastered will be on ps4 remastered black flag that is all where shaggy at tho no way this cant be omg was waiting for a remaster for like 6years thats cool but brotherhood mother father i am sorry i have failed you both i made a promise to protect our people i thought i thought if i could stop the templars if i could keep the revolution free from their influence that those i supported would do what was right they did i suppose do what was right what was right for them as for you father i thought i might unite us that we would forget the past and forge a better future in time i believed you could be made to see the world as i did to understand but it was just a dream this too i should have known were we not meant to live in piece then is that it are we born to argue to fight so many voices each demanding something else it has been hard at times but never harder than today to see all i worked for perverted discarded forgotten you would say i have described the whole history father are you smiling then hoping i might speak the words you long to hear to validate you to say that all along you were right i wil assassins creed ezio saga gets remastered assassins creed 3 gets remastered assassins creed am i a joke to you such an amazing soundtrack and underrated game i honestly loved assassins creed 3s story parkour and combat and cant wait too replay it again remember when assassins creed still had a good plot line even in the modern day pepperidge farm remembers capcom better than ubisoft i was hoping to reboot or remastered assassins creed 1 changed only the schedule dang i remembered playing this gem back when im still sitting in 11th grader and had my ps3 whats so special about this remaster raytracing maybe okay so you decided to remake the worst assassin ever right how bout remaking one which was actually good first one or 2 or broterhood 2 fillers like this means their next game will be anounced next year they add green filter and call it remaster good job waiting for it i hope there still god i can fightxd i love this asc an am waiting i wish they made a comic about conner after the war and how he and his people try to survive it would be interesting to see if they made a comic about the battle of little big corn and hes the one that killed custer who asked for this ive had it enough with these remastered games assassins creed remastered presenting you today in the new episode of things people never asked for the assassins creed iii remastered assassins creed iii is back and better than ever ac 3 hands down on of the last remastered of the year i wanted to see my life assasins creed by the gods connor is back awesome how many fools can i kill today so they out of ideas huh and glitches are nothing after rhe hundreds of bugs for the example in frontier or davenport when your horse are going through bircheswhere he cant go through its starting bugging and then teleports 3 metres from thereim from europe we are not using ft but m 2022 remake for ezio trilogy 3 please hope they remaster all games from back then or need a graphic upgrade break my cd the ps3 kids in the comment section acting like 3 was a good game 2 needed to be remastered not 3 imo yes the best assassin creed worst assassins creed made hope they remaster black flag yo mama does this mean i will see desmond again i still cant find any point to sooo many ac games its just different dudes in robes and coats killing ppl the first three games were legendary and now they are being extra they speak of liberty and justice but for who finallyubiaoft do something good with ac my favourite part of assassins creed thank you ubisoft next assassins creed ii and brotherhood remastered okconner just kills templars because thare templars but fan boy mode is on we need far cry 3 remastered as well it aint looking no where near that good im sorry please remastered ac black flag my favourite assassins creed connor motherfucking kenway is back theyre doing something right for once this is just ac 3 with a red filter we want assassins creed 1 remastered and prince of persia warming up the game doesnt make it never before experience 60 fps on the pro where charles lee assassins creed iv black flag remastered is what the humanity needs im copying your video best game ever playedgood storyand background music is the best i saw the thumbnail and at first i didnt see the iii numeral i saw it immediately after but that precious indescribable moment when i thought the original assassins creed remaster was coming the enhanced footage is the trailer version and the pre enhanced is the actual game theyre just letting you know right away they added orange oh great i just had an orgasm watching this lol who the hell was even asking for this trash to be remastered imma be hanging woman and losing the game on purpose to have like the good ol days guys i think we should stop making games every year we are losing sales and being the next cod is not an option although almost we already are but we need to keep making money proposals hmmm and what if instead of making new games we sell again those we already have just remastering them but which one of all one that really needs a good polish one that will please our audience currently remastering a game of the current generation which does not need a remastered and choose one of the most hated games by the public wouldve liked remastered ezio collection or black flagwhen ac had good content and was not god of war honestly original looks much better i hope it haves online multiplayer like it used to how are the two versions different best assasins creed i was expecting ac 4 graphics oh well this is good too wtf this is literally the worst assassins creed does that mean the multiplayers coming back ac3 had some of the best multiplayer it got me back to 2013 after watching the trailer it has to be better i just know it welcome to assasins creed 3 yellow tint thats how mafia works did anyone ask for this i know i didnt because i didnt like iii assassins creed revelation remaster or remake please so they made it sepia cool old school ac players odyssey was the worst entry in the series that had nothing to do with assassins templars eden or anything ubisoft we hear you butwe dont wanna spend too much time on a game so heres a remake another game for me to boycott until ubisoft stops this bs trend theyve been doing lately now we need ac1 remastered someone please tell me theres a multiplayer too american so where is the remastered version i didnt know charles smith became an assassin after killing micah fix for honor there are mods that do this far better wheres ac 1 remastered maybe a remaster but its nice to get back to being an assassin when ps4 cant handle backward compatibility with ps now what about xbox one ubisofts dev hey boss what yhe things we need to remaster it for our upcoming remastered game ubisoft easy just add a yellow filter my fav ac game i hope they bring back the online but i doubt they do ac3 was and still is my favourite the combat was spot on and the story was amazing edit also conner is my favourite assassin he watched his mother die his village burned to the ground he had to kill his best friend and his father as well as watch his mentor die and in the end he was betrayed the men he sought to help were the very ones that drove his people away making his journey worth nothing all he did was create a nation he originally wanted no part of i learned american indipendence better through this game than at school man so hyped about this dlc for charles for me assassins creed hasnt been exciting since desmond was killed off im not knocking the people that still like it but it loses some interest from me when you dont have desmonds story involved in assassins creed it feels less interesting to look forward to the next game in the series and get excited to get my hands on the next game with desmond miles no longer involved in the series which was a big reason i got excited for the next game in the series i love the new lighting system and textures but they need to fix the faces thought it was gonna be extensively rework not just minor touch up im not expecting to the level of a remake but this isnt really much at least itll be refreshing to go back to classic ac gameplay and not another generic third person action rpg i miss blending in with a crowd to hide myself and assassinate fool with one hit instead of worrying about their arbitrary level back to the crowded cities and miles of rooftop to run on no need for 100 different type of weapon with special stat this aint diablo what about 2 and the original assassins creed remake assassins creed 1 until syndicate including freedom cry liberation chronicles series if its possible and later4k mods for each assassins creed by the fans just like what they did to gta 5 4k mods they shudve done a remaater for black flag assasins creed black flag plis the multiplayer in this game was the best of the best i would still be playing it online if they had it in the newer games best one is 3 why remaster this garbage game out of all the early ones this was the worst a perfect assassins creed game doesnt exi finnally yes connor is back not black flag but ill take it best assassins creed better not be full price connor the best assassin of all games pure trash best assassins creed is brotherhood the rest is just the rest they better not sell it for 5999 pointless cash grab this isnt even a game that is worth replaying especially not for a slight graphics improvement the theme song is my heart and soul conner is one of th best assassins in history why not remaster the original please remastered assassins creed 1 assassins creed 2 assassins creed brotherhood assassins creed revelation why remake the one with the most numb character ever assasin creed remasteredthis is an awesome comeback with more quality i love this game im curious about what they added to be honest i hope they added ambient themes and connors forsaken speech the ezio altair series was the best in the franchise ill just wait for my assassins creed 1942 game why bring back the worst assassins creed the most boring ac ever two is awesome i cant wait to see remastered bugs so bugs will be remastered too oh hell no waste of money you should have made ac1s remastered edition worst ac ever they should just remake ac unity but better this is just and upgrade in the cimenamatic its about time ubisoft should stop milking that cow its not funny anymore pick a historical period drop a load of items and boringsimple sidequests on the map and repeat the same mechanics and leitmotifs retrieve the bra of eden from the evil templars once more i used to enjoy the saga got a lot of merch and the games from ac1 to oddyssey but ive had enough people are begging for remasters of other chapters rest assure youll have them thats the way things work now instead of making new original games we have everlasting sagas and remasters on top of that cdprojektred is showing how the things should be creating good games and good stories not recycling old formulas with micro transactions wtf back in the day everyone wanted to banish this game to the shadow realm and now everyones like omg my favorite ac game i love it like wtf wait three the assassin 2 was the best game ever i ever played so it would be interesting is the combat going to be the same why though this was the worst of ac1 2 and 3 id probably even play a remastered black flag 100 times over before this one just curious what they based this decision on the best assassin creed of all the friends this is only ea release for me black flag or rouge were the las ac that make sense all the games previous to these were perfect black is still my personal favourite back in 2012 i was so hyped to play this ezio will be back looks like they just put a filter on best ac ever i want ac 2 and 3 remastered i want ezio to be remastered the best ac playstation 4 will now have all the sequels now its just the original that need to get on there im glad they fixed the missing audio in assassins creed 2 sequence 12 sequence 13 for the ezio collection most notably when ezio talks with the irish monk i never played the benedict arnold missions in assassins creed 3 they should stop deleted parts of the game for specific consoles mass effect on ps3 should of had access to pinnacle station another reason to remaster that trilogy just bring back pop the best ac for me but why remaster brotherhood already ac 3 was bored i thought its gonna be ac 2 it was a legendary game but oh well thanx ubisoft i cannot wait this game is too recent to be remastered finally a ac with no rpg ac 3 before farcry they need to remaster brotherhood will it have online sick of ac games want my prince of persia back comparing to the remaster of re2 this ac 3 remaster suck so 1 take old game 2 apply orange filter 3 sell 4 profit oooooh a filter i rather save 60 and buy the old ac3 rather then a filtered remastered one everything about this installment of ac was amazing conor is back again one of the best video games main themes of all time worst assassins creed game this and not assassins creed 1 alright such a cash grab it looks almost the same no remake of assassins creed 1 or 2 and yet my pc still cannot run the old ac3 make a second assassins creed game with connor does the ac 3 remastereds game engine changes to anvilnext 20 much better of a remaster than the ezio collection imo 054 gives me goosebumps till this day so they added dlc in the past to create a new paid version that contains all the dlcs and they put a random color filter everyones favourite assassins creed game great the worst ac game is getting remastered shouldve remade ac1 i never knew i wanted it until now what an amazing game this was the best ac if you ask me awfulcompanies out of ideas so they remaster garbage old gamesvideo game industry is going downhilli dont understand how the younger generation if gamers are accepting of thispay 40 for a remastered game thats literally 5 on the store or even cheaper at a retail chain honestly id love it if they remade ac 4 thar remains the funnest game for me with odyssey season pass is free p now speak bad of odyssey eheh ummm excuse me but which color is the remastered version how about pc the best when the old graphics are better than the new now to get the 1st one remastered i hate the new ac mechanics origins odyssey i hope the new one will bring back the classic ac mechanic cant wait everybady want assassins creed ll ezio collection remastered assassins creed 2 was literally the best i get to play as my favorite assassin all over again assassins creed 4 remaster please tomahawk chop is my death blow nowadays turning the games brightness up ends up making a remaster plz remaster prince of persia im totally gonna buy this once it comes out i also think they should remaster ac 1 aswell sooner or later they will release assassins creed odyssey remastered this is that i waiting for 100 mistake why not remake the ezio collection i need it now back when assassins creed was good can i have the first game please this game had the best multiplayer imo why just remaster rogue at least that character had depth yes one of my favourite assassins been remastered thx playstation the same but with a filter lol finally my has come truuuuuuueee assassin is a stealth man but this game the assasin is a fighter worst remaster you probably increased brightness and saturation thats it i love this game but i see no difference i need ac4 remastered is the color temperature the only thing that changed or are there also resolution graphics framerate and mechanics improvements hope so because aciii is my favorite im buying please make the remaster for prince of persia should totally bring shay cormac back in this would have made things way more badass the remaster no one asked for i dont understand why people hate ac 3 cuz i think that this game is pretty good why dont they just put this as an free update why the best asassins creed i cant see that much of a difference in graphics will they remaster the boredom too why not ac 1 but why assassins creed ii should be remastered that one was the best ac gamers rise up i loved this ac assassins creeds plot died with desmond in this game my boy ezio should be next can we please have a remastered version of every splinter cell game please splinter cell needs to come back get rid of this assassins creed focus ahh the game that made me sick of the ac series ubisoft needs to remake assassins creed unity i hope they add battle royale mode but battle royale is taking over why this why dont assasins creed 2 or assasins creed brotherhood this game actually looks like a remaster cough rouge cough i thought ac3 was the worst i still want ac ezio trilogy remastered this time ac iii golden edition is really going to be golden look at graphics its shining yellow suddenly ac3 is everyones favourite this is a assassine creed3 just bought ac odyssey now that ive seen this someone kill me why 3 wouldnt expect domething like that cant wait to play the alternative history dlc where i can run round with my ghostly wolf pact and kill blue coats the same ac2 was better than the third one in my opinion origins was better than everything since the second one not played odyssey i need save my money now this gonna be so weasome im going to by this gam i hope it isnt just the graphics that is improved they released the e3 version of 2012 ac 3 for remastered quite cheeky i hope this time you will make better remaster version then remaster version of ac ii why not black flag this seems like darks souls remastered guys can someone help me with this so i buyd assassin creed 3 and its not working like not launching when im trying like it gets in the game and the game crash so please im beging you someone help me with this i want to play this game so bad its pc windows 10 really hope they bring back multiplayer in the next installment why didnt they remaster assassins creed 2 and brotherhood instead of ac 3 it doesnt make sense those are the more praised and older games edit nevermind i forgot how good this game was nope yellow fkng creed waiting for it to drop to 70 what was your fav assasins creed mines syndicate how much well it cost in dollars you know the game would be epic when you hear this music please good optymalizatiom this is epic this will be

first one or the ezzio saga first re2 and now this the best assassins creed no lag this time hypehypehypehypehypehype first time ubisoft did something awesome the british are coming they just added some filters and adjusted brightness and contrast best game with story mode this doesnt look that good not gonna lie the faces still are mediocre i just love the theme song after the ezio familys theme back when the fighting in the games was awesome i like that ubisoft love to give us there masterpieces remastered should be an example for other publishers please bring back online it was so fun charles from rdr2 this is the best they can do in terms of graphics what a joke underrated game but with 30fps lock on consoles no thanks 1 assassins creed 2 no questions asked 2 assassins creed brotherhood best spinn off 3 assassins creed 4 black flag amazing atmosphere 4 assassins creed syndicate hail the frye twins 5 assassins creed 1 where it all started 6 assassins creed origins impressive recreation of ancient egypt 7 assassins creed odysee the game is huge introduction into dialogue microtransactions are bad 8 assassins creed 3 fog of war sucks here 9 assassins creed unity had bad launch but overall solid game 10 assassins creed rogue copy pasta of black flag just worse 11 assassins creed revelations tower defense gotta be the worst addition to the franchise 12 assassins creed liberation should have stayed exlusive i realy like ac3 too but i want to know one thing did ubisoft repair ac3 glitches in ac3 remastered please make the remaster for the first assassins creed sorry far cry new dawn i grab assasssins creed iii remastered few days ago i was rewatching all trailers of assassins creed 3 and now we have the remastered version oh boy i thought ubisoft will announce new prince of persia game instead i get this honestly i was planning to buy a xbox one x ac3 360 just to play this game in it but right now changed my mind going to buy a ps4 pro finaly please give me ac 2 remastered i wish it could be the old attack type bored gameplay bored content thats what i feel if play ac games everybody complains about how ac3 was good and it would be remastered in my opinion ac2 needed to deserve this looking forward to playing this one again yesssss finally the original assassins creed hey but rumors were coming for watch dogs 3 we get this but sleep on midnight club 3 so they finally goin to make ac3 trailer real dude that game came out 2012 not even that old yet remake ac unity with less bugs and better optimalization this looks rlly good now all it would take is ac1 remake and removing those fetch quests which was basically the whole game and replacing them with actual missions and i can guarantee you it would sell better i love assassins creed 3 bring back this formula of ac games ya this game is where assassins creed fucked up big time so it will always go down in history as the beginning of the end for ac games with the exception of origins that is 3 black flags rogue unity syndicate and odyssey were some of the worst storylines ive ever played in my life why this one why not ezios story remastered it would be such a lovely idea to make an assassins creed 1 remake for next generation ps5 there is literally no need the best assassins creed finally better curtains when haitham walks inside the theatre how about simpsons hit and run remastered this comes out when the uk leaves the eu pc guys have done it way before i have to admit ubisoft is good at making beautiful open world maps in my opinion do u see the words in my opinion in caps or do have to make them bigger so the people who are too ignorant know what opinions are can see and understand before instead of instantly assuming something and sticking with it any liberals who play this are hypocrites but then again liberals are best at hypocrisy aoc thinks is hypocrite is a type of hippo now this is a master piece they should announce watch dogs 3 instead this made me hard af nah i prefer assassins creed 3 in 360 graphics in my opinion no switch i hope they do the same with black flag or even remake it cause in my opinion black flag is were this series topped wow nice video i am waiting this was my first assassins creed game and i might pick this up because of it but who knows lol connor is back graphics are almost as same as original ac3 i cant see any different who asked for this who was it really the saddest one of all ac games i want desmond miles back in the modern day selling the same game again big con good game bad setting back when it was still assassins creed now it is just rpg garbage filler 3000000 hour games remaster deadly premonition and xenosaga i dont know but im crying childhood memories with some real fun and joy assassins creed 1 plz now we need ac4 sequel or an ac on edward they bringing it on ps4 bro yessss why did they make it yellow mother oh madre they really did it best assassins creed ever nice nows its time for batman arkham origins need for speed most wanted 2005 remastered we need prince of persia connor and charles wouldve been the best of friends who thinks ac 2 should be remastered as well yesfinally ive skip ps3 so this is the best news for me ezio collection have help me playing the assassin creed 2 now 3 is coming ubisoft is stupid remastered the most crappy in the series hahaha i cant wait to play this game on march 29 for free because i have assassins creed odyssey season pass this is assassins game not odyssey up need to realize that dont u get this free if u got ultimate edition of the new assassins creed 23319 what the hell iam worried about the file size of it for my ps4 so good for a 2012 remastered game i hope they wont downgrade this one assassins creed 3 orange

buy this i thought it was just going to be a lazy port im impressed this is free with season pass right i was terrible with that kings dlc this assassins creed made me stop playing the assassins creed games just another cash grab before making new game gotcha what i wanted for years now lets get a gaming pc for this rather have 4 remastered remastering the worse ac game yikes though those who enjoyed it hope you enjoy this the last good assassin creed they made who else watched it more than 23 times make great assassins creed again and stop macking remastered and other assassins creed like odissey and origins you know remastering ezios trilogy especially brotherhood wouldve been a better choice do i have to walk and run strange again now i hope they remake assassins creedaltair welcome to assassins creed 3 gold ray edition when was this they just added enb that it that is it i had high expectations bring black flag remaster i know you all want a remake remasters are cheaper to do for lots of reasons so they made the game yellow finally a real assassins creed from ubisoft wait will this be available for online purchase only or can you get it on disk as well the frame rate is good on console im sorry but this doesnt look like an upgrade so far all it looks like is an upgrade to the lighting thats all i get from this trailer the worst assassins creed game ever thanks ubisoft man i swear connor is so dam cool they need to make another assassins creed game with him yo did good ubisoft but what te hell with odyssey the templars i loved this game every bit of it from gameplay to sounds we all love the ac franchise but i like how each of us has at least one ac game with the most fond memories which makes said ac game our favourite i loved all assassins creed games but this one has made a lot of good memories for me remastered o rema yeeeeees rmastered this was the start of the downfall for the ac series man i hope they keep the same cover art the best game in the series filters and rescaled textures the game hell yeah lets go who asked for this probably the worst ac game i played one of the best assassins creed games the other being black flag uhhhh looks the same just yellow lighting lol where is charles lee nah assassins creed black flag will all the bugs be also remastered best assassins creed so far i was like more a ac4 remaster but ok they choose the wrong ac they need to make assassins creed unity part 2 when arno and shay meet arno still hasnt avenged his father that real connors back unnecesary if you want a huge job do ezio remake like reevil 2 if only they remastered ac rogue like this but the gameplay is the same or not i wish ubisoft make assassins creed revelation remastered im more of an ac4 guy is this going to be 60fps on the consoles or no i have xbox but love ps4 black flag next please just in nostalgia i will need get this man we got a lot of remasters for the ps4 why not ac3 remake assassins creed 4 remake please god of war 1 the 2 ac revelations remastered when how about assasins creed ii finally im so excited now they should remake the 1st one or put it as dlc i would love that i havent played the 3rd so ill get it on ps4 assassins creed iii the yellow filter like if you like assassin creed iii trailer the only ac game i beat wast of time what about black flag one of the worst ac to date nobody needs this is this game free for those who bought ac odyssey digital gold edition i have no idea why so many hate on ac3 i think the story was much more interesting than 2 dunkey is not gonna be happy about this i thought remastered editions was for good games the remastered era remaster ac 1 goddamnit big microsoft big i hope they have a physical release lorne balfes score was just incredible in aciii the voice acting writing direction were impeccable in aciii underrated gem of an action adventure game of last gen im not impressed at all this was the only assassin creed game i actually completed so i can dig it if you have good pc and played ac 3 on pc dont buy this we want ac ezio series ubisoft not ac3 finally liberation is on console in my opinion this ac was ahead of its time just didnt have the tech at the time to make it to the true masterpiece it was supposed to be completely the last assassins creed i actually liked does this mean that this assassins creed is the best because it got remastered yoooo the multiplayer for this game was dope do we still get that again as long as its the old kind of assassin creed i am down hope its better than rogue remastered cant wait love ac 3 looking forward to playing again assassins iii for me is the best assassins game finally the final game from the desmond miles trilogy being remastered pls ps we want mgs 123 po pw remastered plz no more assassin screed btw i like all the assassin screed games pls dont hate we want all the mgs games for ps4 plz definitely getting this i love the redcoats 40 bucks okay more nope should remaster assassins creed 2 or a remake my 13 year old me its screaming my favirite ac was assassins creed 2 andmy second favorite ac3 i hopr they make it good assassins ideology is a mess freedom of everything begs chaos if it means to be free as oneself thats fair but if it means to be free in every context is wrong templar begs order and control which in itself sound megalomaniac but relevant actually ac3 and black flag was my favourite yellow hueremaster who else wants a modern day assassins creed the best ac game ever made they shouldve just made a remake on ac1 ezios trilogy ac3 calm down fellas it is ubisoft we are talking about this is just a trailer lets expect a downgrade or not i hope im wrong because i love this game assassins creed 1 is the game that deserves a real remaster the game had a glitch in the cutscenes when you changed your outfits color i believe its fixed this time right they should remaster altair not this boring lame aciii black flag was way better i dont like ac3 altair was the most dutiful ezio the most fraternal conner was the most noble but will they ad a unicorn to this one as well for people who dont own odyssey will it still be 40 dollars i know they get it with the season pass this was the last ac that made any sense i had this on the xbox 360 years ago and i completed it and it was great what about an ac 1 remaster no need to remaster it everyone has played it guys u gotta try this on next gen why ac3 and not ac2 ok nice ubisoft finished gameplay will look exactly the original if not worse they should of given connor a sequel and continued desmonds story ac died after this game imo aside from black flag shut up and take my money i never got to play ac1 i would like to get that remastered or remade i platinumed the ezio trilogy but i dont like feeling like i missed out of story i do have any attactment to the previous assassin like the games intend for me to an actual remaster not just a hd resident evil 2 is just like this and it was a success i cant wait for this ine who asked for this well its about time probably the best assassins creed game ever made actually it is the best assassins creed game ever made before they change the combat to rpg combat when assassins creed games were good and you really felt like an assassin now its all about fighting with brute force and thats not the assassin way so with that being said this is the best assassins creed game ever made and i should know i have every single assassins creed game even the 3 2d sidescrollersno i do realize everybody has their own opinion but in this case your opinion does not matter cuz this game is the best hands down im glad i can drop some knowledge on everybody well now you know i was playing ac unity today now that game is fixed great change after playing ac origins i dont know why but i think ac unity is best looking ac game after comparing it to origins i liked unity much better maybe cause its nostalgia i would rather get assassins creed 1 remastered it needs it the most a remaster is better frame rate better lighting improving gameplay and colouring and mabye improve the graphics a little a remake is a total change of the game with graphics gameplay colors and everything so for everyone crying about how the lighting is the only thing changed then google the difference between remake and remaster remaster assassins creed 2 the great assassin creed game ever this is a graphics mod why this game why not assassins creed 2 was it really necesary to remaster liberation too i couldnt buy the dlc and its suits looked so cool back then too costly for me it was definitely getting this game i am speaking like yoda do not know why this game was my favorite hella underated what a bad remaster look at halo 2 for a proper remaster you just changed a few colors and lights and dare to call it a remaster assasins creed iii remastered take my money right now i cant wait for it had an amazing reaction when i saw this another reason to keep on living ughmy first acwhat memoriesi want to play this right now oh the combat cant wait to kill some red coats im curious how gameplay is going to look heard tweaksnew mechanics were being addedchanged you peeps should completely reboot the series ezios storyline is the best imo where is charles lee remember when assassins creed used to be good i member the most one dimensional and annoying lead character everi will passwaiting for the first one to be remastered they already made a comparison by there own so nobody have to do it now do they remastered bugs too god i loved this game this was the last assasins creed i ever played best assassins creed ever made l anyone that disagree is a filthy red coat for nintendo switch too connor the worst character ever the start of ac downfall i hope they will fix the bad optimization on pc this is assasin not odyssey or origin volumetric god rays ftw why is ea the worst company in america because ubisoft is in france segn yo el mejor assassins creed the british are coming 0 there are 12 months in a year its not a bad game but doesnt ac 2 deserves a remaster more than 3 remastered really i mean it looks the same except the yellow tint which is added will wait for further reveal assassins creed died after black flag with this ill have nearly all the ac games on ps4 just need ac1 now hint hint now all we need is assassins creed 1 to be remastered looking forward to it will this be on pc only for me they had change only the color graduation yay cant wait to play as some guy more boring than james milner with a performance upgrade to locked 30 fps i pray for prince of persia warrior within remake every then and now why are the colors so warm and yellow this was the worst game you could have thought of to remaster why exactly do we need a remaster of the worst assassins creed but is there multiplayer tho no body ask for this l tomahawk chop is my best blow capcom i mean ubisoft i was just asking for this thank you ubisoft remember playing this game on xbox 360 imagine they downgrade it to look like the og ac3 they should remaster black flag next worst ac ever game a masterpiece that useto be like 20 or something that same game but remastered a copy cat with some additional content costs 5999 game devs but its remastered i still have my ps3 so im not really sure i actually need this lol plus i cant import my saves so yea but if the price is reasonable i might consider it was happy they didnt charge 60 for rouge remastered plus the theme song is epic but can we see the remastered gameplay cuz we now ubisoft loves to downgrade best assassin creed why the remastered so much orange desmond will die again but now in 4k pretty much a must buy new games are springing up like mushrooms still same i expect some unity graphics assassins creed 1 remaster please remake prince of persia not this sht wtf guys pls open the all eyes d this video ac3 enb or sweetfxac3 remastered basically the sunset version of the game now ac 1 remake i need a black flag remaster wasnt this out with the gold edition already i thought it was the first ac it would have been better resistance 3 remastered wait this is not remaster this is filter on screen with effect assassins creed 2 brotherhood and revelation remastered the best thing that ubisoft could ever do i hope the next they remaster will be assassin creed 4 black flag can they remaster the writing as well we need remakes looks almost the same i dont usually buy the idea of remastered games but this this is something to look forward to oh and haytham is my fav my favorite assassins creed honestly why bother worse game in the series they should have dan 2 or brotherhood best ac game of them all so who else hates this guy and his mentor and wants to see more templars in action specifically shay who want ubisoft to make an assasin creed 1 ac1 remake drop a like am i the only one whos hype for this is there gonna be multiplayer or nah make ac 4 remastered will it be downgraded tho the theme song makes me cry every time who got odyssey gold edition so this is included lol who else tried to turn off the captions but found out you cant pretty sure this wasnt needed ohh come onthe graphics are uglier then the original lets do ac 3 more shinny and saturated ok now lets call it remastered i love connor as a character but you call this a remastered thanks ubi this is good graphics loved the score unlike most i love ac3 its what got me into ac originally i bought ac3 when it came out ezios family and the ac 3 theme two of the most iconic themes of the ac series dead space saga remastered coming out for my birthday perfect i want a remake for ac1 the 3 is the best sold ac thats why made a remastered version of it 1 origins 2 brotherhood 3 assassins creed 3 4 odyssey 5 black flag those are my favorite top 5 i hope it comes out too on pc later a year this is the time ive been waiting for omg i love this game i liked this game back in the day the story and missions are pretty good connor is a badass but the world is no worth exploring and side missions like hunting were useless and dull heard that ubisoft the people wanted assassin creed 1 remake the remaster no one asked for this may be a beautiful assassins creed but am i the only one who thinks this was not necessary right now if they want to do something i think they need to remake the desmond saga good very good now just make new ones that are like this one and with old combat system and my money is yours ubisoft remaster assassins creed 2 plz and even brotherhood ac iii yellow version love game assassins creed 3 my childhood game is coming back and i honestly cant wait i dont want to get hate but cant you remaster assassins creed 2 that one was a million times better do a black flag remasteredplssssss my favorite theme song after origins assassins creed 4 aka black flag for next gen imo best assassins creed made after ezio story imagine those beautiful landscapes on next gen hardware sephia filter waiting for red dead redemption original game to remake hold up this is real tell me its real please comming to assassins creed 2 remastered anyone wanna give a free ps4 to me they love it just because its usa history lol i just hope they let us keep the hood on after the game ends xd what the hell is this did they upgrade only lighting in this gamee somethings wet in my pants so its getting remastered again deserve a good remake but ubisoft cant see potential games need some foresight like capcom unfortunately ubisoft will always make average games division 2 seems like dlc btw yees i have waited so long loved the old one my favorite ac game my favorite assassin my favorite theme is this even 60fps this game destroyed the franchise for me never played another ac again applying an instagram filter on the entire game is now considered a remaster i want 2 remastered how many dudes can i kill today you can still experience remastered graphix by using reshade best assassins creed game im crying now awwwwww ubisfot listen to me we want look like ac3 game are u understand i bought the ezio collection and got platinum on all now its time for this one cant wait tell me its better than the last gen consoles one can we bring back desmond either they are gonna be generous with this game or its gonna be really expensive a remake of assassins creed 1 would be lit pc version please remake assassins creed1 looks great on trailer already looks better than odyssey wow now i can roam around an empty map in 4k assassins creed iii is back just textures guys not worth 40 euros and this is not hate towards the game i love ac3 and this makes me love it even more but this is just not worth 40 euros not at all at least make it cheaper for ac3 owners it should be free for all the players seems like ubisoft doesnt care about their best assassin ezios origin game give me a prince of persia sands of time remake ubisoft this was my favorite ac game the light effect so beautifull i hope they would make templar games im really bored being the good guy all the time i think they should remaster ac 2 did they also fix the terrible screenplay uninteresting side characters and lazy writing cant wait to play this on xbox one x yay now i cant wait to pause the game just to change my weapons i loved assasins creed 3 and its theme songbut i was except ing a ac1 or ac2 remastered how many fools can i kill today to may to count dont get in my way why did they remaster the worst ac game ever why did people hate this ac never understood why it definitely looks more vibrant and saturated than the bluish hue atmosphere that the original sported why 3 worst ac where is charles leeeeeeeee you should remake assassins creed 1 the altair storyits better than just remastered this thing best ac story more godrays is not a remaster man origins even unity look miles better than this i cant believe people are gonna buy the same game for another 60 for having a yellow tint and bit more shadows the original game itself was a work of art meh i remember i was trying to get the platinum of this game but the game was so broken that i never make it was a problem with the collectables im not buying this game again for me that best ac is the black flag how about ac1 bring back price of persia fate never changes conor hands down best assassin o m g i a m h y p e d love it will def buy revelations pls pls my favorite one to this day ac3 is still my favouritei think they should make more games with connor such an interesting characterac3 and ac4 werein my opinionthe best acubisoft could release more games with connor and edward kenway there is so much more to explore with those characters we could have a kinda of an ac black flag 2 and a ac3 2 that would be amazing and i guess im not the only one with this opinion and that is why the confederates lost the war because they didnt have an assassin for them selves remastered games of pass generation is easy we want remasters game of playstation 2 xbox2001 and nintendo game cube nice gaming video waiting assassins creed series has had 2 good games thats it this isnt 1 of them looks the same for me the boat gameplay should be change into the superior black flag ships we want assassination creed 4 i will get this game for free since i have purchased ac oddysey digital deluxe edition last december man what a bad game again the very first game i evered played heytham kenway is the best after our great ezio auditorre da firenze we want prince of persia remake they release the same stuff over and over again without any new idea or improvement and you can even buy them twice yay will the loading screen take less time now will the loading screen take less time hopefully it is for pc cuz consoles are just nothing we want assassin creed 2 old is gold ac needs to get back to stealth and t leave the rpg gameplay what a waste of time i hated this game should have redone the og id buy this in a heartbeat if they fixed more things rather than just remastering the graphics also if they fixed the ending so it didnt end so abruptly waiting for the ac 3 remastered downgrade trailer now why the hell someone did this remembered playing this on 360 now i cnt wait to play the remaster on ps4 favorite ac of all my favorite ac game do they really upgrade its graphicengine or just add some post process effects such as blooms can we have brotherhood remastered this is how ac games should be not an rpg like origin or odyssey cant wait when your more hyped for a remastered last gen game then any other game coming in the year ive waiting so long for this i love the combat on this one along with black flag this is how the game shouldve looked like or close to at launch it was my favorite assassins creed game and it is and it will be the last ac game that needs a remaster ac3 really remake ac1 or ezio collection who wants to play ac3 again mode play as haytham please same game 40 box i already got it in my wii u make an remaster of assassin creed 1 and 2 second was better finally we get a proper assassins creed if you get my joke one of ma favourite so thats how ubi will sell one game second time or its a big update patch for ac3 what a hackwork all i want is new ac with ezio why ubisoft not remake ac 1 if they do it will be awesome i used to like this game dispite the haters increased contrast sharpness darkness and lighting ubisoft remaster capcom ubisoft did they fix the outfit in the cutscenes yet assasin creed 1 remaster the best ac for me chills the best assassins creed imo my fine this one in my favorite must buy its not remastered version its more yellow version finally please be 60fps on ps4 im so excited never get play ac3 my first playing assassins creed on pcnow i will play on ps4 yes my favorite assassins creed game nice job finally i could play it i never got the chance to play 3 but im ready why are they remastering the worst game of the franchise assassins greed ohhh ubisoft u r the worst gaming company after ea wow it looks amazing bravo ubi they should reboot ac 1 and 2 series has gone in wrong direction now if they want to make another game like ac origin or odeyssey then make a new ip out of them odeyssey is good but not an ac game another pointless ubisoft game volumetric fog done ship the game i think ac3 was the most brutal and the story is good after thisremake the first assassins creed this is the first ac where we can climb the trees cmiiw just the color effect shouldve remastered assassins creed 2 shouldve released it on 4th of july xd ubisoft is king of the lazy remaster look at resident evil 2 and shadow of the colosus this is remaster imagine what if assassins are in games of thrones it was real assassins creed till the end of ezio all i have to say is can we please get a physical copy over to the us please when i saw dlc written i remember this game to be the most boring thing ever did anyone just nut themselves cmon ubisoft you are a company i know but no new game or remaster of splinter cell or prince of persia in many years you have an important sector of abandoned gamers lol it still dont look all that amazing like re2 remake the character models look a lil fake still they should remaster first game instead one of the worst game in this franchise now all we need is brotherhood remastered finally a real ac game again not poor the witcher clones fav assassins creed all the timecant wait to buy it if they make a black flag remake ill cry black flag is super one combat this game the true assasins creed game i feel like the character models look chalky like what they looked like in 2 and brotherhood i hope its not as grindy as ac odyssey they should remake it now this is what i been waiting for and liberations looking forward to this gane lighting remaster if you have the assassins creed odyssey ultimate edition this is free right assassin creed 3 2012 baby yesss the best ac assassins creed is a good franchise videogamedunkey best assassins creed remove the bugs pls xd coolest assassins is back thanks sony and ubisoft ubisoft trailer remastered downgraded release just give them the old version now you must have to remaster the first assassins creed or at least have a digital download on the ps4xbox one 200 hate are from pussys that plays fortnite lets go bois cant wait to play this game man i am gonna cry ac 3 remastered i want assasins creed blackflag remake the way that resident evil 2 did it it will be a hit or even asc 1 or 2 even would be awesome would be awesome to return to them now assassins creed 3 remastered instagram warm filter go remastered dead space i needed this game great game music is very nostalgic wish the new ones were more like this game imagine not worth it too good to be true but why 3 why not 1 or 2 or something i want to play assassins creed iii sounds interesting i was really hoping they remastered it like halo 2 instead of adding an instagram filter but its still an awesome game now remaster red dead redemption but are the horses fixed they just upgraded the worst ac finally when it was actually the true assassins creed so the worst one shouldve done a full remake like resident evil 6 but this is good too one of my favourite all time games game filter is not a remastered booooh ubisoft booooh when is ps4 gonna get the option to change psn names what would you have me do i would love to see assassins creed 1 remastered only ps4 or all consuls welcome back to assassins creed im hoping that they updated the hud please for the love of god and all holy that is on earth and being one of my favorite assassins creed games make this remaster good now th graphics will finally be as good as th originals trailer i truly wonder if they didnt leave anything extra you know shay cormac ac iii remastered baby best assassins creed game ubisoft i forgive you for uplay whats the chance they will put microtransactions in it man it looks beautiful i miss this style of gameplay when you dont knw wht to with assassins creed nextjust remake old ones this was literally the worst oneconnor is such an unlikable character ok if im being honest here i couldnt really tell if they were showing the remastered version or not during the trailer thats how little of a difference theyve done remake the 1st with ac 3 gameplay mechanics assassins creed 2 remastered remastered best assassins creed am i the only person who wishes hamilton is there alexander hamilton fighting against monarchy and finally assassinated his best friend burr and washington his old boss well this is unnecessary better than assassins creed odyssey this is great for me one it will give me huge nostalgia and it was the first ever assassins creed game ive played ive played this one up to syndicate working on odyessy now missed origins i hope the next assassins creed is more like the older ones and lesser like the recent ones this real maybe the game will be less buggy now xd this was my favorite assassin creed game and its coming out on my birthday back when assassins creed was actually good rip ezio now with never before seen stable frame rate in boston three and four were my favorites out of the franchise sorry ill have my hands busy with sekiro i been waiting for this ac3 isnt my favourite for the gameplay but i do freaking love the story is this a dream who else wants black flag remastered is this a setup for ac5civil war who wants to see the remastered version of altar this could work i really liked this game i can remember how i played it on my ps3 for the first time assassin creed brotherhood is better i kinda liked the original colours assassins creed 3 is the best in the series why would they remaster the worse ac game come at ill fight ya all now we all know haytham is a templar wont be such a suprise give him a option to wear a altair outfit or shay they fixed the combat sounds yes where is lee ubisoft should bring prince of persia back now its enough with assassins creed this is assassins creed hypeddddd i loved this game back when i played it on old gen cant wait to see desmond dies again to save the year 2012 cant wait to get back to the modern world new comers are you prepare to save 2012 of ending this was the last legit ac game in series with good story telling between modern and history sad to think it went from desmond to layla finding spartans and calling it assassins creed just revive desmond so you can get a face to the series and actually make a good story line again thank you thank you so much why everyone like this game now yall were a bunch of haters when it first came out doesnt make any sense i love this game ever since i first played it yet its one of my favorite assassins creed games in the world lawd have mercy really good story butit literally looks the same even after 6 years cannot wait for this definitely gonna buy this game wow it should have been part one not three like for real this one is where the franchise should of ended and made black flag a new ip we just need some more time goodness now pls do a remaster for black flag altair seems my students dont know how to wield a blade perhaps you can show them what you know this is my all time favorite game im so excited for this sniff sniff you smell that smells like layoffs are coming for team assassinrinse and repeat lol so its basically going to be an update of sepia playmode dlc this assassins creed has the best soundtrack good to hear that theme again the most overrated ac ever made just remember its ubisoft khm ezio collection khm welp my 2nd best ac game best combat in the series 2012 ac 3 sucks 2019 we want ac 3 remaster can we buy this like a copy or we can get it only with odyssey season pass they remastered the 3rd but not the first but still this is decently good my favorite setting out of all the ac games i may get this if the price is reasonable where is charles lee but where is charles lee we need assasins creed black flag remastered wait are remasters subject to typical ubisoft downgrades so basically theyre going to crank settings to pc max and give it to ps4 why did they do iii they shouldve started with the first one idc what people say this was one of the best assassins creed games for me worse one in the series rather play 1 why are my eyes shedding tears of joy why see id love to get this rogue and the ezio trilogy to play what i missed out on back when these games came out but i feel id struggle to get through them due to the old gameplay mechanics i need mgs4 remastered i hope that theyll not downgrade this remaster u can get this for free if u buy assasings creed odyssey season pack for me this is much better than odyssey well they made it more golden so ac3 remastered is just the older ac3 with hotter colors i think youre right larry joe nothing so special really liked ac2 then revelations got platinum on both then i got this back on the ps3 and i can say i really liked it got the platinum on this great game too so with a good price would like to see it on my ps4 pro again definitely enjoyed this one faces are modded we need ac2 in unity graphics then it will for sure be the best game that has ever been made please make the 3 like ezios you know 3 game same protagonist it helps you to understand your character moream really interested in conors storypls is it going to be full price pls remastet assassins creed 2 i buy assasins creed 3 a day later they release this wait ac liberation is also remastered that looks so good than ps vita one i played what else thats it i hope its not console only 2019 year of remake we havent even seen this on 4k resolution since its just youtube i wonder what it looks like in the actual 4k graphics might be like unitys hell yeah please tell me theyll be a physical copy of this being shipped to other countries upon release they should do remake instead remastrted pls dont remove the infinite enemy glitch im more excited about this than i was about ac origins and ac odyssey good everyone hating on origins and odyssey can go play this finally there also must be assassins creed ll awesome now i must buy if now thanks to ubisoft for making a remastered for assassins creed 3 because i missed this game on the ps3 what about assassins creed 2 that was the best one make the smackdown pain remastered where is charles lee all i want is crouch i would like a remake or sequel to ac1 with altair please remaster 2 assassins creed iii has the worst gameplay and story of u r naking a reamake so u have to make of brotherhood officially hyped i have been waiting years for this the story is so beautiful and sad this is assassins creed im so glad they made this remaster it was my first one from the saga and i loved it link to the music plz i always thought this game was under its full capability maybe this remaster can save it they done a poor job at remastering ac2 but this looks good but why cant they make a good ac game nowadays like the ac23 and 4 ok they remaster assassins 3 but not 4 i thought 4 was better then 3 just my opinion then i m not interested to purchase itif ubisoft make the remastered of ac 4 black flag then i ll probably purchase it why not revelation the best assassins creed where is the multplayer winter become summer i would love it if they did a full on remake of the first assassins creed hope on disc sick of no digital rights protection hardly changed frontier looks sexy though but thats about it shut up and take my money been waiting so long for this my favourite ac game do black flag next i always wanted to play it america there are more episodes of assassins creed than the whole games of others software houses that theme just wow can they fix the hood problem after the game connor isnt wearing his hood anymore i had to wear achilles outfit for him to have one ps4 console of remakes not for the players now make a remake for ac1 and add new features to it or probably a remastered ac black flag with odyssey graphics can we make another dlc where connor meets arno that would be great degradation is here movies remake games remastered seem s like no one actually can make something new and interesting i still got it on ps3 and i wouldnt pay money to have better visuals on the same exact game they rather should remastered ac1 and add more content to it so its not too repetetive remake assassin creed altair version please all i see from this trailer is warmer tone color added to the old versioni dont know maybe it might look different in the game are those new voice lines connor says at the beginning of the trailer what im praying is that they made connors character have more development in this to the particle effects and bloom is nice but it seems like they mostly just changed the color balance either way it looks good best ac game ever except for liberation that was kinda lame remaster revelations i cant play it on windows 10 this good but mostly just an orange filter but why didnt they remaster ac12 or ac4 ac3 was a bore no black flag 2 or a remastered prince of persia beat that game and it was so much fun was this where they started using the trees as part of the parkour got the season pass so im getting it why this one is it just me or are the older assassins creed video games better there are far better ac games that could have been remastered like ac black flag ezio trilogy ac 1 or ac unity since that one was a mess when i launched ac black flag and ac 1 were the best and deserve that upgrade treatment the only ac that i liked is getting a remaster oh yeah yeah that theme song it will be nice to see connor again to me best assassins creed love the character story setting and that was the first time of anvil next those new acs why do they even call that assassins creed when you are nowhere near of a assassin we know and love just give us remaster of ac2 you could already put a filter on with reshade and what not this is nothing the game lighting more yellowbrown in the new one looks like that filter from far cry 2 has returned when assassins creed was about assassins and not about greek lesbians assassins creed 1 totally needs a remake i hear tahiti is nice well he has slightly a bit more personality than arno that was a nice surprise bravo ubi how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in my way ill shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow tomahawk chop is my death blow i love that song till this day too bad there isnt going to be a disc version of this for both the assassins creed 3 remastered and assassins creed 3 liberation remastered thats very smart from ubisoft they dont realese a new assasins creed in 2019 but they realese a remasterd version of an old assasins creed so they can still earn money without lots of efford i know they develop at the moment the new assasins creed for 2020 but still please assassins creed 1 remastered please this reminds me of the batman return to arkham collection we need altair remastered the reason for the creation of ac this actually looks pretty good doing a good thing ubisoft cash grab why would they remake the beginning of the end the franchise please ubisoft gamers really want remake of altair thank you for the subtitles playstation very cool will this have multiplayer too this is the best news ive heard in years it is my favorite assassins creed of all time and now its happening will the multiplayer be included too i lost months of life playing that back in the day who the heck asked for this its definitely the worst ac in the series and they remaster it smh this one is actually looking good the ezio collection especially brotherhood isnt i prefer the old image filter it had a good charm to it the storyline was fucked at this point 1 and 2 remain the defining titles of the franchise please remastered tom clancys splinter cell blacklist one of the listed upgrade was new character models but you can clearly see the same assets just with hd textures theme songs so nostalgic ready to see desmond miles die again ac3 yellow tint edition what a minute so everything is the same only graphically change i wont waste my time playing the same thing over again i will buy it ubisoft is the best back when assassinss creed was still assassinss creed is this a standalone or you have to buy ac odyssey to have that i dont want to buy the latest ac to have ac3 uhmmm so it still will be dipping sub 20 fps on boston because even with an overclocked core i7 2600k at 45ghz you barely maintain 30fps in that area finally the remastering that i was waiting for finally arrived now to fight the american prairies again in the name of freedom best assisans soundtrack for my best favorite assissans game 3 this was my favourite assassins creed for sure stop remastered please i want a remake of series or reboot ubi should remaster the first assassins creed game the old one is better so glad theyre doing this ac3 is my fave one its just a color change i dont c any details added not worth the money try remaking ezio we will accept it why the game has more orange now or is just for me soooo switch or what assassin ceed 3 liberation ps vita wow and desmond im hyped asf for this why not ac2 obvs the best one the worst one smh but 29 march been available only disk version digital version must be avialable sooner they should of remaster this in the unity engine instead of just lightning splinter cell this is the only reason i bought the odyssey season pass no splinter cell blacklist remake howay ubisoft oh god finally the right remastered game if only ezio collection got this treatment that remaster aint a remaster the graphics are definitely better but why so brown now the best ac game ever believe me if you remade first assassins creed completly it will be more successful than any of you latest ac games it might be even on of the greatest in the history of your company when altair came out there was no enough tech to make the characters or the game exciting like the newer ones but if you but some money and made ac1 from zero oh god the ac series will have it strongest come back this will still be my dream anyway wow they remastered the worst one nobody asked for this just remake brotherhood with engine that had unity yeah unity was glitchy af but thry fixed it later but ubisoft if u ever think of making remake dont use originsodyssey engine that would be garbage why was i the only one to love this game assassins creed 3 was my fav assassins creed game before ac origins came out a remaster no1 asked for heads up this is what they show you but dont forget ubisoft like to try show off graphics then water them down for release product wow looks awesome hope they fix the bugs im not crying its just my allergies i miss this game im definitely buying this im glad ubisoft is playing this carefully odyssey was a good not great ac game but you can detect the dullness that was emerging from annual releases im glad that they are taking another year off to focus on the next one they did that with origins and look how it turned out opinion revived the series from its dull descend i think remastering aciii is a smart move popular ac title including all dlc and liberation and it would allow ubisoft to really try to come out with another good quality ac title in 2020 i remember this game getting a lukewarm reception when it came out last good assassin hype a thousand pardons remake the ezio collection gotta milk that money ubisoftgotta milk it the best idea what about altayer remake please ac1 needs to be remastered playstation missed out on that one for trophy support can we keep the hood on after we beat the game this time is this what we get instead of a an original ac good best musical score out of all the ac series assassins creed yellow filter thats my favorite assassins creed can we drown connor please say we can drown him to be honest it still looks like a ps3 game could do better especially when you look at a game like ac4 i loved this game from ac franchise i still dont understand why people say its the worst ac game will there be online multiplayer i miss simple death matches my favourite assassins creed remaster price of persia plz so a lighter filter is all they did jesus christ assassins creed 1 remake please add desmond miles as a unlockable skin in the game and you have my money ac3 desmond too not ac2 or brotherhood desmond i never played the game but can we play online because ia very excited no one asked for this who asked for this boring pile of garbage to be remastered finally the masterpiece remaster ac brotherhood the last true assassins creed now you can repeatedly ask where charles lee is in 4k resolution been waiting so long to this would only play this to see haytham again ac 3 and liberation remastered so happy i got season pass love the sound track cant wait to play this again thank you so much this is my favorite assassin creed game the game wasnt bad but i wont play it again i hope that it will not have the same problems on pc wow its coming out the day after my birthdaywhat a great present another remaster great underrated game and severely underrated version of the theme still listen to it to this day dont like it dont buy it like anything else leave it for the ones who asked for it go play fortnite the assassins creed game ever bought 2019 is going through my pocket hard man my favourite assassins creed thats game is good lol realy i cant believe the i was witting for it assassins creed is a good franchise so ac3 remastered is just the older ac3 with hotter colors any mission of another aaa psvr port please eg cod blops1 its going to feel great playing with the original combat system im not a big fan of the new combat system effects and textures look great but characters models look like they could use a upgrade not just redoing in a new engine but remaking then but is it still 30fps on console ac odyssey season pass owners release date this was the best assassins creed in my opinion i miss the old ac battle system the new ones with rpg floaty number damage counter made it unrealistic yay the most boring ac returns eh i love both games and i really wanna play them again connor in 4kstill boring shame cos i was really looking forward to this when it first came out instead of remastering stuff for which there was no need and nobody asked alsoplease give us the next prince of persiaor atleast remake the original triology greedy fucks assassins creed 3repairedmaster they should remaster altair but with multiplayer really nibba they remaster the worst one and not brotherhoodreally who else just loves the theme song of assassins creed 3 am i the only one who would prefer a heritage remastered collection i cant wait the remaster nobody asked for wow they actually upgraded it nice job ubisoft hehe boi im getting my switch this month im exicted for it was gonna get a pc but nah i wanted the switch idk why but seeing a nintendo switch with 2 blu joycons hurts my brain why did i not realize that when i got this game throws also assassins creed liberation i thought it was only assassins creed 3 im very dumb are the graphics bad i got it for 3 we want ezio collection ac1 combo this was one of the best assasin game ever made i played it on my old ps3 actually the first ever ship battle in ac was brotherhood i remember this game to well to buy again for my switch finally its on nintendo switch thank god plss pm me if you have a dvd of a game assasin creed identity in odssey in nintendo switch fb carlo jay salonskie i am in love with nintendo switch what should i buy nintendo switch or ps4 gta 5 on switch i really like and enjoy watching your videos thank you what micro sd do you use on the switch is battery drain so fast how many gb does it requiered on physical version 1339 what on earth did just happen to henway middle age anxiety attack does anyone know how to save your game progress on ps4 seriously im desperate if you buy the game on the eshop do you also get liberation 915 did anyone hear that pc sound if fortnite why not gta is this offline or online game its a shit waiting for black flag then i will buy switch i love this game i bought it like 1 week ago and i play it almost everyday i wish ubisoft releases the ezio trilogy on the switch and black flag and rogue how price this of usd bro how you buy resident evil 4 pls tell me only nostalgia wtf ac iii remastered on nintendo ubisoft i think they were really drunk to release a remastered game on small console why that big box for small card can u review igaimer app i want to by the psvita same in the video how many rs in india currency all i want is far cry 3 wow performance is better than i expected i want skate 3 ported to the switch sooooooo bad id literally pay 100 for it ubisoft sucks when it comes to nintendothey shitted on us on the wiiu and i owned a wii u why doesnt ubisoft release the ac ezio collection for the switch 30fps im gonna buy it eventually i already played it on my pc so when it goes down in price ill buy it again assassins creed 3 on the go sing me up looks boring especially reloading and enemys ai enemies are just waiting for you kill them love ur gameplay sir rip joycon sick i got it on release to 2025 fps is it my swich because the audio on mine sucks i already have it enjoy it its a good game run pretty well on nintendo switch it should have been the assassins creed demastered just give us far cry 4 or even 3 and gta v the can switch can run them perfectly ok lets be honest in far cry 4 the switch will run it just decently just started this game on my switch best php1695 3260 ever spent lol switch is more powerful than my laptop am trying to pick between this game and monster hunter generations ultimate really struggling with the decision ive never been so close to just totally disregarding metacritic im enjoying this game a great deal and simply cannot understand the hate this games is getting from some critics two games in 1 cart how big is that game please give review on ashes cricket 19 game also this game is great was hesitant to get it but havent put it down since slow start but it gets addictive quick its weird to think the switch uses a mobile processor which makes you wonder what our phones are capable of assassins creed docked 30 fps sucks just portable is great swithps3 version i remember when your review for liberation on the vita good times hey guys its mardegain cant just aim the weapon cant just get into the gameplay im probably going to get it in like 2 months loving the blue remote look the white transition is annoying why doesnt he die when they shoot him never played assassins creed before game looks good will buy once done with dragons dogma cant play 2 games at a time i like your videos but you just babble on sometimes needlessly it looks like the vanilla version for pc i thought its remastered i was hoping it would look better than this quite disappointing as i never bothered with it originally and was looking to maybe pick it up just looks like a pretty poor port job along with the resident evil releases it looks like some publishers are just palming the switch off with a thatll do attitude among the sleep good but i get thumb down because nintendo switch can not afford naruto utimate ninja storm 4 gta 5 and red dead redemption if you get the digital version of this game do you still get liberiations remastered dont buy this on the switch it aint remastered and it sucks on the switch i even cannceled my pre order because how bad it looks lmao how are the visual effects is it still better than the ps3 even if its remastered i hope we get black flag next i got near the end on 360 then bought an xbox one and never really went back to it better optimised than saint row on switch i cant justify spending that amount of money when you have to do a mandatory download even with a physical copy it isnt worth it when the xbox 360 verson is going for like 5 on disc with no download needed this is the switchs major failure imo just ordered it on amazon cant frecken wait wouldnt this look better on ps3 ah before you start let me guess you hope there is no huge update just kidding assassins creed 3 use ships in combat like assassins creed 4 black flag and rogue can you please make a video named thing to do offline on nintendo switch i remembered buying this on wii u was gonna buy ninja gaiden 3 on wii u but then my friend told me to buy assassins creed instead didnt know its out already hlw long can you play on switch with fully battery charged from comparisons the game is literally ps3 version with slapped remastered title not even close to the new version its kinda bad move from ubisoft plus ac3 is one of the worst in the series such a powerful device nice game play if they just add just cause 3 i really appreciate the convenience of consoles immediately as you inserted the game it popped up in the menu the visuals looks stunning my favorite game of all time the fucced up thing is that you cant crouch pretty dumb 3999 for this old ass game this game shoulda in my opinion be at least 29 at most love your videos bro keep up the great work bro you are awesome 21stsysbestsysresleasesysetciesysakasys hey i wanna ask if it is worth buying nscoz its games are very expensive finally a mainline assassin creed game on portable i wanna grab this one but im currently grinding on dragons dogma looks good im gonna pick it up tomorrow kinda miss my switch getting me another soon though go on my channel to see me playing pubg mobile on my nintendo switch this is currently one of my favourite switch games hey marc i think for a portable device the graphics are pretty nice but is the control a bit hard to use on the switch because usually for portable consoles its abit difficult to press buttons since they are so small but great review overall this is best assassins creed game ever i play it which state is that game released in i like this dlc tired of killing my own countrymen all the bloody time king washington killed haytham and ziio when he went mad probably charles lee too connor is pissed af i think this is the worst dlc ive ever played thanks now i can finish the dlc wow ratohnhaketon can survive three shots and a stab in the same place the faces in this remastered are just awefulthey suposted to make this game better that originalthey have ruined this remastered in some ways guys i bought assassins creed odyssey gold edition and i get assassins creed iii remastered for free but i didnt get tyranny of king washington when does it appear after finishing the game maybe the beaver at 3855 is like sorry guys just passing through wtf is wrong with the face textures why are they so plastic why are the textures so bad so was haythan a assassin in this the sad part for this remastered dlc story is that you still cannot use your animal powers all the time it will drain your health damn it ubisoft wish we couldve seen haytham in this alternate reality it wouldve been even more awesome if they were together as a family 1935 im assuming my mans connors gonna drink that tea and get those super super powers can someone tell me how connor arrived in this alternate reality does anybody know y the dlc isnt showing up for me why does king washingtons like dc because of washington dc everyone that pronounce connor atcually cant said his real name this mision is not in as c 3 why do they speak english instead of their native language in remastered and if its just the dlc than in the dlc they shouldve had the thing were it rates if your incognito or not i think its kinda bs your instantly on radar hey friend why you dont have any ost music i have that errorbug too and i dont know how to fix it if someone can help me please lemme know 1347 you just got caught lacking can someone help me at almost the end i am stock at 35100 why pistol changes look after the eagle journey 12943 you cant even replace it its a joke after watching this i remember how united states fought against british colonials thank god he said i did not defeat george the 3rd to become george the 1st 22730 vaas impression peekaboo mother fucker stab i had to i seriously just had to it was too good of a opportunity not to do that and it fit so well they killed his mothertwiceinfront of himi know people hate him cause he killed his father but god damn to think he lost his mother twice poor thing 2600 the way he says mother made me feel like it was my mom i felt that in my soul 33828 what the frik how do you do that im stuck on that part i like the new remastered who else saw the flying rifle at 33059 wish they could fix the words stuck on the screen bug connor in the dlc is way more different compared the main campaign lmao i wish they went more in depth for this dlc yknow what year does it take place in what happened to haytham and the rest of the templars what happened to the british empire and what happened to achilles how come is his mom alive is this real in the timeline or no 2755 my game always freezes on connor waking up i cant even play this dlc i dont care right now i need the gawd dang teaaaa from that willow it on the assasins creed 3 go on the screen theres the main story and go down you dont want to go to main story per se but after you press the start button and just go to the bottom use your left analog and press it down youre uhhh not very good at this game are you mr ice and fire its free on the playstation 4 and xbox one its a dlc for playstation 3 but its free on the playstation 4 it bothers me so much when he doesnt use the free running routes i cant wait to get my hands on this game free the future connor is the dlc free now honest to god i think the only reason they made this dlc is because a native beliefs are a fantastic resources for supernatural game mechanics and b that conversation between washington and a random delegate at the end was a real legit conversation that was held in history which is probably the origin for the whole king washington dlc idea bird on snow why the hell does connors voice sound different in this dlc how to download the dlc please make a video i like the idea but it fucked up the whole original story is this a dlc pack is this like an alternate universe and also i dont give a shit that its not the best remaster i just wanted to beable to play this game on ps4 connor youre the chosen your supposed to destroy the british not join them what sucks is you cant use the powers in the main game they come in handy too many assassin creed games lmao when you realize that if this series lives on 2019 will have its own assassins creed game this game is looking awesome i really need to play the ac series dam glad u included this portion seeing that thumbnail i always see the face of donald trump as the tyranny king is this canon did he wake up 300 to do this first assassins creed iii remastered gameplay with shay cormac assassins creed rogue outfit when young connor realized that looting chests in forts give much more money that hard work as assassin he want to take achilles house sell it and go to mexico to start new life but he woldnt kill him in his father chest he find his father diary along with his money there was mentioned haythams recrutit name shay cormac his father also mention that was hunting achilles with shay but finally didnt kill him shoot only his knee connor inflitrate templars headauerters and found shays photo and went to tailor to make that outfit for him then he went to achilles he said im coming for you when only old man saw that outfit he get heart attack and his mainsion was connor now shay cormac is back im really addicted to assasin creed 3 remastered fighting is not as hard as you make it look is there anyway to remove the mask really nice maybe 4k but not 60fps what made you stay your hand your outfit achilles heart attack omg it suits connor so good but i think i stick with his default outfit since it classic 220 do you not know how to escape lol sour grapes does taste good ya know outfit looks awesome but they fucked up the physics from the waist down imagine achilles saw that xd try rope dart during fight it will make easier to take down heavy god connor is so big in that outfit we can see how big this dude is shays outfit is my favourite outfit imagine if connor meets shay cormache would kill him and take his templar suit this suit fits him well connor i make my own luck achilles what was that connor nothing im still annoyed this outfit didnt have a hood like in the cinematic for rogue which turned out to just be symbolism would have been cool if they added a cutscene or a new mission of connor meeting shay i wish that the maskbandanna wasnt over his face and just hanging around his neck that way there wouldnt be that strange gap in cut scenes where they removed it all together why are my outfit used by assassin ac rogue remastered that we all wanted shay templar or asassins glad that the remastered actually shows the outfit connor wore instead to reverting back to the default white and blue outfit in cutscenes that was so annoying in the original release plus an updated minimap updated gameplay to be more akin to later games in the kenway saga all dlcs and new legacy outfits and also with ac liberation remastered included i would recommend the remastered version for those whos interested in ac3 but best to wait for a discount for now as there have been technical issues especially in liberation while not game breaking its still buggy once again especially in liberation and while i havent encounter it yet i heard there have been reports of the game crashing and probably because im using a logitech controller instead of an xbox or ps4 controller for pc the game has been switching me back and forth between controller and mouse keyboard while the environment is definitely looks more beautiful and not just a yellow filter like ever little did he know that haytham kenways father is an assassin achilles sees outfit i asked you whered you get it connor who gives a shit achilles alright just get outta here get outta my house connor why achilles the owner of the outfit d did you kill him connor no sure as hell fucked up his dog tho lol achilles punches connor imagine he meets achilles dressed like this boy you do know who was once wearing this same outfit right yea i know the man who betrayed you and killed all your assassins but his outfit is cool isnt it achilles facepalm connor hey achilles i achilles internal screaming i feel like they could have done the relationship between these two a little better achillesgood luck with your mission connor connori make my own luck achilleswhat was that connornothing while putting on shay outfit achillesheart attack i make my own charles lee i want a reference to shay please it would be cool too bad that bandana dissapears after cutscenesdamn you ubisoft upon seeing connor achilles suffers ptsd and eventually a heart attack wearing that outfit in front of achilles i bet it must be haunting for the poor guy wear shay suit go to achilles achilles why in the hell u are wearing that cursed suit connor why its cool achilles ask ur father connor you mean the man who have this suit the man who save you from my father achilles faceplam im really not a fan of that bandana they should have remmoved it just like it is gone in the cutscenes the outfit looks better without it please tell me you can take that mask off some truly excellent dialogue in cinematics this is the most underrated assassins creed game of all time it is in the top 5 assassins creed games release today date next assassins creed 2 haytham what did you do to shay connor i killed him and took his outfit haytham it suits you this is true assassins creed who would buy this i mean i realy like assassins creed i playing it since high school but ubisoft realy put your workforce into this i will never understand mind of game developers all of themthey become stinky at last ten years when will be realese to the store connor i make my own luck haytham what was that connor nothing im so glad they added the outfit but why add the mask too though its the combat still as brutal as the original ac3 i dont want this to be dowgraded like aciv are your hdr setting standard or can you tell me because mines are a bit whack to say the least its good haytham shay connor cormack this game was and is boring af i dont know what the hell ubishiet is doing and i think they dont know what theyre doing too connor killed shay and took his outfit if it wasnt for these ugly ass characters it would have been fine but hey lets be honest high settings and 60 fps for consoles would have been all we needed there was no need to rework everything to ugly some times the remastered version is better but i think that it have more bugs than original not every moment that remastered is better remaster looks good but the faces are crap most of the guys are angry cause they dont want to buy it again like at least you dont have to switch to ur 360 to play the game now plus there are lots of things they changed in detail and viewing tbh it does look more vibrant the original visual changes orange filter at all ubisoft ooh shit we need money hmmmm too ubisoft ac iii remaster guysss gogog got this game for 16 today im downloading it cant wait to have a go if it one of my favourites it fucking removes the snow wtf original one is betterhaytham n connor were tanned in original one why this is one of the few remasters ive seen which actually looks better i like the more saturated colors the more dynamic lighting the textures seem to be the same but overall i really enjoy the look of this this remastered is suck i can change the settings on my pc to make the og remastered same old shit pass a remaster no one wanted remastered sucks this feels more like a recolored than a remastered i wouldve loved an improved remake its because the difference weather i really dont care abput the graphics what i really care is the game on ps4 and xbox one thats perfect because the original only on ps3 and xbox360 and pc and we need this perfect game on ps4 and xbox one hope ubisoft doesnt pull a nintendo and decide to remake all of its games for the new consoles song please no game can still win unitys graphics pretty good for a free game original still the best one downloaded the remastered after finishing originsodyssey i forgot how bad it looked even the remastered version they changed the filter like it was some kind of instagram post and then resold the game atrocity the original looks a bit better if you ask me they just set a different lighting the only thing i like about the new on is that it is more colorful better remaster then gta sa and silent hill collection hd because i dont see anything lost nice shader mod this isnt even a remaster its just a trash reshade with no ambient occlusion 256 that moonwalk tho its all a lie i have no hdr and my grass textures are in 2d 010 the name of music in this video please instead of ac 3 ubisoft should have remastered ac 1 or brotherhood to me ac3 is still the best of the saga change my mind the remaster looks so bad at 236 the character models look like sht imagine if they remade creed ezio trilogy and black flag with all the mechanics of originsodyssey would be so dope i have played call of duty mw remastered because it was my favourite game and then i realised i am wasting my time on a expected results gamers will never be fucking satisfied will they will be better if ubisoft make ac1 remaster or black flag but more i want see ac1 seven years awaitingand then we got a sit thank you ubisoft i am very enjoy that original is still fine cutscenes looks terrible didnt even know it got a remaster lol what was the name of the music thanks for useful video why the original is still good but remember original is original the game itself is the same fucking thing my only favorite assasin creed is 3 i love the original one coz it has a beautiful screen i have only one question what music are you using name please original wins orange color is really demanding apparently its the opposite of what the thumbnail says what a lazy remaster it looks like absolute trash you cant just put an enb on the game make the fps worse and call it a remaster cant believe nostalgia made me buy that remaster it was only 40 bucks but still lmaoo it really doesnt look better it just looks different cant you do the same thing with nvidia settings the original always had this black and white look that made the game look dull but the remastered fixed almost everything cosmetically so yeah good on that original has better graphics old times i think they are only adding redyelloworange in remaster so for those who had buy the original ver dont buy remaster its a money waste you walk like a zombie in the remastered one the graphics arent even improved all they did were up the light and made it darker people looks better in the original somebody knows the name of the music that they put in the video pls this song reminds me when ubisoft was actually good 1 apply filter 2 call it remaster 3 4 profit they remastered the wrong game ac2 was the one that shuld be remade it actually had a story that was good is in the remastered version has a new story i checked the size and holy sht its 45gb storage must available i saw the graphic and it just enhance the saturation and contrast and adding small effect like volumetric fog i see no difference in texture and detail the remaster version has a better colorthe problem is fps i like the old version for obvious reasons like it being just memories about graphics like that when they dont have ideas for new games not worth it tbh i never played this game but the first one looks better its more gray and natural the remaster has points in a lot of regards except for character models and subtitle size too reedish and honestly shadows looks hella dark i will keep og lmao the view distance rflection were great earlier all things in remastered are made perfect but the faces are aweful remastered looks much better but my pc couldnt handle it and if i lower the quality it just looks like the original the bad thing in the remastered is that the face models are not at the same details as the game itself it looks weird and they have too much contrast it is better in the original imho even shadows have a better res 2080ti cant keep 60fps at 4k in this game never realised how good the original looked until now i just got the remaster and i was like wtf happened to the faces honestly the lightning in the remaster makes it look a lot more vibrant because the old one looks white in color and not a lot of saturation it looks well but it could look better well the original one looks better than the remastered one like who agrees with me wow 6 months goes by fast the environments on the remaster look better but the characters on the original look better which i must buy original or remastered i do prefer the original one it gives me that nostalgia i love ac3 the most i remember first time playing it was the first really violent game that i played still remember when i started shaking after killing guards in this game good times ubisoft we added a color filter and made everything else shittier now give me my money original or remake it doesnt make any difference for the brave man who continues walk backward original 257 remake 300 i dont care about the differences its still a great game and its nice to play again for separate achievements how ubisoft remaster their games 1 add some contrast saturation sweetfx reshade 2 add some lighting improvement 3 add remastered in the title 4 reell it honestly the only visual thing i like about remastered is how they did the objectives 126 if you want this game here is link to amazon httpswwwamazoncomgpproductb07nqg61k8refaslitlieutf8camp1789creative9325creativeasinb07nqg61k8linkcodeas2tagharunayarcom20linkiddfa545166a60062903d89f7be25c7676 this is amazing remastered because ubisoft made this so every game with reshade is remaster 238 looks way better i mean u cant even see his face played both but the remaster doesnt give the dark filmsy vibe ac3 should be giving for once i actually think the original looks better i feel like the teams that were put in charge of origins and odyssey werent cued in here both of those games are stunning this is just fucking ugly as hell who else thought the physics of ac3 where better than ac4 i feel like the original was better even in the fighting there seems to be alot of clipping and the contact between the enemies and the player seems to be off i would wait for another decade to get remake game itself was not good before so why only remaster you called this remastered so disappointed call of duty modern warfare team done best remastered than this joke dont believe me watch call of duty modern warfare vs remastered music in conclusion if you own the original dont bother buying the remaster if you dont own the original buy the remaster unless you can find the original for an absolute steal of a price music they should remaster the first one the remaster character detailing sucks graphics look soooooooo much washed off in the original version the original version looks like ac1 i prefer graphics of assasin creed 3 remastered because you know its better 156 rip remastered it looks like they made some sacrifices in the remaster like character detailenvironment detail for color and lighting what a joke just put a sweetfx on original and he become remastered or better what happened dog in 019 that guy isnt even a assassin hes a pirate why remaster this and no remaster the 4 why ubisoft why surely i cant be the only one that thinks character detail in the remaster looks horrendous not worth all the extra gb even activision remastered call of duty modern warfare way better then this and suckers still buy this the same thing even uglier original ac iii was one of the best games of the series the original version of assassins creed 3 is way better than remastered remastered warmer tone fx it is better and vibrant like how samsung phones oversaturate all their images lul original is better then remaster the original ac 3 is not optimized for quad core cpus i did use msi afterburner and sadly i saw only two cores were used even thought i am still using a fermi nvidia card the gpu usage only amps up to 38 50 in most cases in hd resolution at high settings i think remaster is really a thing for this game but honestly the graphics are getting too bright even thought the loading is actually blindingly white every cutscenes ubisoft should learn something from activision you can never please people it looks badass to me and i think they did a great job only thing that annoyed me about ac3 was the bug of conors outfit still appearing as the default blue and white in cutscenes even if he wasnt wearing that i hope they fixed it this is bullshit look at the other comparison videos and people will notice this video is bullshit notice how they avoid showing cutscenes thats because the characters look awful ezio collection look better it chapter 2 money grabs at its finest why ubisoft remasters always have only visible changes made to lightning it almost feels like theyre doing this on purpose release game to look more bland at first and later change lightning saturation and add more vibrant colors and then they slap in the remaster tag and price it at 50 i think is the worst ac of all desmond saga a part some renewal in the fighting system the game sucks texture and enviroments are poorly designed poor story maybe just indipendence history fans may have liked it flat caracthers poor passion and love with ezio you felt into the game being part of something bigger part of the brotherhood here you just feel playing with a spoiled kid just looking for his mother revenge nothing else the ac brotherhood ends with ezio auditore after that are just some cool dudes really good in killing and jumping to make an exemple after steve job died the brand still have an apple on the back but is not the apple anymore i didnt see any difference who else thinks they should make a ac 2 remake with ac origins graphics idk but i think cod mw remastered have done better in remastered not worth it i guess there is indeed something wrong even in this video httpsyoutubekdgfaq8svwg remastered ac3 i knew this bullshit is called the so called remaster just improved shadows and reflection rest of the game looks shit in remaster original looks better than this what a shame everyone complainingdudes if i put my ps3 ac3 in and then the remaster in my ps4holy shit its not even close of course the pc versions look extremely close other than color palate i dont think the remaster was made for pc folks but rather with consoles and nintendo switch in mind if you have the original for pc then no it makes zero sense looking at the 720p version stretched across a 4k screen with the ps3 its absolute ass the remaster looks decent with the ps4 though not this gen decent but still very passable ubisoft should put ray tracing into the remastered version use dlss to improve fps how could you have gotten rid of the snow biggest fail ever i cranked up the color setting to 100 and turned up the contrast on my modern tv then i ran this game on xbox 360 at 1080p hd and it looks just like the apparent remaster on my friends xbox one how to make your own remastered game step 1 open chrome step 2 download shaders and sweetfx step 3 put it in your game folder stpep 4 launch the game and enjoy done the only difference i see is being black is a problem v you have that much good pc and barelly getting 60fps why i think its only worth getting the remaster on pc because i have the ps4 version and it looks like absolute shit aliasing everywhere and poor performance i thought the story will change ghosh such good old memories cant express with mah potato lap if ppl say orginal is better thats a joke why did they change the hud though im fine with backwards compatible on xbox one and i got it for free with gold no need to spend 40 they just need games to be backwards compatible no more remasters ac rogue on xbox one x boost the game from 30fps to 60fps but then they decided to do a remaster of that waste of money imagine the people who spend 60 on a game that was released years ago and already played it all because it received a new instagram filter to make it look better rdr2 can see a city from over 10 miles ac 3 house from 80 ft away gets muddy its sad that this game looked better in the original man they seemed so proud of this remaster too what a shame lol while the world looks beautiful i think the real problem here is how they light the characters or something original characters looks better while the remastered ones lookoff honestly thought there was something wrong with my copy of the game before i watched this hah wish they couldve just combined the two or something also while the original looks cold the remastered feels warm which is somehow better for the game i dunno again world looks right but the characters arent but thats just me there is difference in the two but not enough to be worth buying a remake would be better than a remaster and here i am finding the original better which music is used in this video cant find any difference quality is always quality they screwed on the faces in the remastered agree many people seem to dislike the remaster but you have to be completely blind if you dont see the difference for me the assassins creed 1 needs remaster not 3 mods can do it better than devs did i think ubisoft did a way better job with ac rogue remastered cmon let s be honest it s look amaizing sorry i would never buys the remastered versioni own the original that is better is there any difference yes which one would i prefer original i played ac3 for its cold foggy atmosphere and they changed that remastered version is colorful worth a buy theres a remastered this is literally like taking the atmosphere in assassins creed brotherhood when the borgia towers are still under control and replacing it with the atmosphere after you take down the towers this remastered is only available if only take the season pass 237 how do you make a remaster that looks worse than the original this makes me hate the original more whats the point to remaster games that are already okish i dont get it just remaster us ssx or skate 3 for fuck sake remastered games are just old games with better graphics so i download fucking remaster onewith decreses fpsim using gt 1030 and i3 potato pc are u seriously getting 60 frames on a 2080ti nvm 4k idiotic people in the comment section dont realize that the improvements extend pass just making the game look better there are legitimate qol gameplay improvements that drastically alleviate a lot of the quirks present in 3 but yes lets ignore all that and continue to leave hate comments about ubisoft so you can get 1k likes along with the delusions of grandeur that come with it man the texture is way more better than the original i like to play it again and i think the in all the assassin creed games lll has the best fighting system and i really like the plot as well this is my favorite assassins creed game somehow they went backwards and lost the magic that made me like the 3rd one to begin with no foggy weather in remastered looks like winter is going on in original and summer in remastered i feel that original feels more realistic than the remaster ok the remaster is good but the gameplay still the worst honestly i kinda prefer the old one ubisoft sucks at remasters and should stop trying the remaster looks so bad imho great game awful remaster i wont support the cash grab watching how shiny and saturated remastered version looks i get the ivern quote vibes bump up the lighting darkin the shadow remaster better than assassins creed rogue remastered i like this game honestly no matter what fans say 257 so that dude on the left corner was reincarnated as michael jackson i wish i could kill every redcoat in that game they just released the e3 version of the game lol 227 yeah because not being able to see shit on character faces is a good idea i like the first one better the old one is better for those of you hating the remastered version they actually used the engine they used on black flag and brought it to ac3 it uses the same engine yes but the black flags engine is better than the one used in ac3 and rogue youll notice this pretty easily if you have played the three games also they upped the resolution abit more obviously just play this game on 4k hd and use filter the remastered version looks great but i am halfway through my first run still on the original should i still get the remastered on pc this is what it should have looked in the first place never played eitherbut while remaster certainly is much cleaner looking due to dramatic increase in resolutionthe old artwork looks much more atmosfericbased on this comparison anyway idk for othersbut i really wanna see ac 1 remaster everything looks good except the character detail part doesnt look as good as the original or is that just me even the brightness is too bright lets hope what they show on this video is on the highest setting so us as the players can have it darker color correction for 500 usd pewdiepie 2019 now this is called remastered rogue remastered was really shitty they are remastering games now within 5 years crazy stuff it looks good overall but why the hell do the characters look like wax mannequins worse remaster in the history of gaming i played both and the remaster is stunning these videos somehow show it as worse but if you play them the remaster is much better looking ubisoft remaster fast food healthy ac iii didnt need a remaster the graphics of theoriginal game are still correct we barely see the difference in this comparison if they wanted to do a remaster the sould have done it with the first game i think it could be interesting but not only the graphics some of the old animation and sounds could be reworked and it could attract some new people who never played to an assassins creed and want to try whit the first one omg i increase the colors and i say its redone one minute was enough for me i prefer left ive played the remaster for a few weeks now its a terrible remaster aside the fantastic new graphics within the game generally the game cant handle itself on xboxonex i have constant freezes which at times will crash my console and completely turn it off this is not good as a hard crash like this can result in my console being bricked remaster looks better unless youre blind that is is this a joke shit this looks amazing the kenway trilogy original is better was this remaster made by a 14 year old whats with the super contrasted lightning and colors with no grading basically they put on a reshade mod that anyone can get online for free and resold it as a remaster good job ubishit thank you tbh not worth buying unless youre rich then yeahhhhhh song age of man jo wandrini album dawn of civilization de nada i want the background music anyone know what that is i actually like the remaster the new reflections look great and you can see them in other surfaces not just the water textures also look a lot better in person and the lighting really improved the architecture details the only problem l have is the look of the faces sometimes they look like wax sculptures but in certain lighting conditions they look good it also comes with the dlc extra legacy costumes arno jacob ezio etc and ac liberation with an art gallery for both games l got it basically for free with the odyssey season pass so im very happy with it okay this was a better remaster than the ezio trilogy i like the original one ubisoft what do u want more light high price nothing els ubisoft il take al of it jokes on ubisoft they gave us original assassins creed 3 on uplay for free 2 months ago now they release this no way im buying what a joke massive downgrade with no replay value where is the multiplayer these current remastered games died cause they had multiplayer previously now removed it after platinuming the game it will be dead like the ezio collection and uncharted the nathan drake collection witch also had multiplayer on the ps3 so pls ubisoft if you do a remastered for black flag on pc do a damn remastered not this shit for consoles this will be enough but the pccommunity will just laught at you character detail was better with the original if i have both to choose i would pick the original graphics are better nobody is talking about the missing blood splatter on the ground they completely removed blood splatter and the pool of blood on the ground that is one of the biggest downgrades ever i like the originals colder atmosphere the blueish look just feels right to me the rest is nice tho extra detail is always nice and i cant wait to pick this up on switch pls dont be a shit port ubisoft needs to have the option to change the saturation to make it feel like the original assassins creed iii was goodbut assassins creed 2 was a memorable game ubisoft should remastere it this is another color but same shit turn the brightness all the way down in the options menu it made it much better we need ac 1 remaster people are being ridiculous saying this is just the original with a different filter the remaster looks a lot better and more detailed and realistic enhance the saturation dont make it more realistic if any of the old games deserved a good remaster it would be 2 or 4 i dont see the point of getting it if you own the original already unless you want it on a current gen console im sure new players will enjoy the remaster what is the background instrumental called pls someone tell me the characters looks way worse than original i mean wtf for someone who has never played this game before would you recommend this version wait what did they remaster how to make it new well add some sun light they really fucked up the character detail part reading comments from know it all people cracks me up just another point proven that like i always say gamers are never happy and its true whatever game is released these days people just cant help but bitch about it take cod for example people were pissed off the way it was going all futuristic moaned they wanted change boots on the ground go back to world war era they did all you got was complaint after complaint its shit its boring its gash the maps are wrong spawn points wrong kill streaks are crap then bo4 came out more bitching bitching about weapons specialists maps the same with bf even when they did mw remastered the game everyone was hoping for i remember when that came out everyone complained its not the same its ruined its got too bright looks odd doesnt play the same then people complained about the weaponry that was added same with assassins creed christ i remember when unity came out it was not as bad as this seems to just add lighting and extend lodrender distance without adding materials for how the light reacts not gonna lie i love the warm colours hahaha ubisoft well know for their downgrades thats what remaster was needed what a downgrade a bad trend to sale new graphics card for gamers no change in story even theres change of stories no charm left behind do you want to play remastered games ok download call of duty remastered and see the difference ac3 remastered is shit pretty ez wat to make money i guess how to remaster a game just turn the brightness to 10 156 wtf ubisoft look at the detail on the houses in the original now look at the remaster wtf resident evil 2 now thats how you do a remaster how do you mess up a remaster even the original has better fps it would be better with the brightness lower thankfully you can choose to do that how to get remaster for free 1 download nvidia geforce experience 2 open it and press altf3 to open freestyle 3 select a filter 4 play the game anyone know the badass music in this vid the original looks better lmao lets be honnest everything looks better except for character face details that was creepy i hope they fix it with a patch if not my trust and excitement for the game will be utterly destroyed ac 3 is one of my favorite ac games and to see them downgrade the faces reflections and the shades makes me very disappointed and that my money was misplaced i also saw the dark filter to be perfect for the setting and was a perfect way to express tge atmosphere more also have you seen connors hair yikes how to remaster a game lets add more detailed textures lets see oh increase brightness add a warm tint and boost a little saturation so it looks like a painting all the exposure the sun needs to make your skin blinding light but dont forget contrast contrast it up bitch hmm yes now weve lost all the detail in the new textures we just added from he blinding light of the exposure they look like a slapped on snapchat filter good good this logic makes sense right sell it theyll love it ssr looks great on the water but i miss water ripples and specular lights some seems are also overbright haytham kenwayson of edward kenway yo wtf is this they just put sweetfx mod lmao thank you ubisoft what a remaster why does everyone complain about this it looks way better with the remaster the remaster no one asked for anyone knows how to fix the lag when we arrive at boston the only part of the remastered i like were scenes like 325 everything else was crap like the water and faces idc the remaster looks bad the original somehow looks better jesus christ what are they thinking im not gonna buy that shit its like the original should be sold as remasterd and remasterd version is the original in that order it would make sense well wont be buying this thank god i seen this before i bought it left how the world really looked like in the late 1700s right cartoony filter whats the music cant believe people buy the same fucking game twice anyone know the name of the orchestral song that plays throughout the video crap remastered this could be improved far more than which have done one of the worst remastered more like ac3 recolored just add more contrast to colors and here you go a remastered ac3 who your kidding peoples wont fall for that trick nowdays the old character models looked so much better 230 lol wtf looks like they are standing near a nuclear explosion what is the name of the background music i wonder if i should bother pirating this again i mean oh boy updated graphics great game just set the contrast high and now u can make your own remaster could have kept the original weather instead of making it always sunny if they call this as a remastred then cod4 remastered should have called a fucking remake in the original its winter thats why the fog they managed to make the perfectly stellar graphics more shitty i have played the game it was like yesterday yet it was 20142013 oh my goodness how can the remaster look even worse what a shame oh god the title was scary the original was better than this shit and they put the arno suit and the suit is brown wtf ubisoft you dont know yours games the arnos suit was goddamnit blue whats wrong with those numbers have ubisoft totally forgot to optimize games the landscape is better in the remaster but the water and character lighting is better in the old game lol people complaining again like a bunch of bitches i think it looks great tho not that ill play it but still i do like the parts where the saturation is increased of course i could have done that myself by adjusting the card settings but im not crazy about the blurry sepiatone or reduction in environment quality honestly i dont know why they didnt make a remastered version of black flag how does the remastered version manage to look worse the environments look good but the people look fake at least change the shitty controls this wasnt a remaster good thing its free because if i bought that socalled remastered version just for it to be a lot brighter but with the same shitty controls and graphics that look the same id be pissed its my opinion so dont get all triggered i wanted assassins creed ii or brotherhood remastered aciii good enough for now is it an impression or faces look like as gummy can anyone confirm ps4 looks like add some little more spice and changing the lighting effects and by the way some thing looks more awful this is a joke games that are 10 or even more years old deserve a remastered version this only looks like a improved shader back in the days this would be a fan made mod and not a reason to sell the game again when i think about it the original game compared to the remastered version made you thing you were living in a dull grey world and then with the remastered version the game finally got some life to it i wish the originally did that for the ps3 and xbox 360 because i have the original for the 360 and now im upset what a shit franchise whats the music from anyone else think some of these looked better in the original lol honestly as much as the remastered looks bad and the gameplay wasnt altered as much or at all the lighting was exaggerated a lot i felt though some of the lighting was necessary back in the original i had to keep increasing the brightness to see certain parts the remastered on the other hand i have to decrease the brightness 236 is an example of too much brightness and the original looked better but some of the other clips showed how fake the original is and the remastered looks a mannequin or plastic as it is everything looks alot better except the character models faces why are the faces so bad remastered my asscrack why does the original look better than the remaster at 218 i like the original one new lighting technology has made character models look like mannequins they shouldve been remastered too they just literally put lights while also bringing in more low quality details lack of ambient occlusion for some reason unbalanced amount of contrast what they did good aside from lighting is vibrance they made colors more lively than the old one that has a grayish tone to everything which made surrondings boring on the original lol there was no need are my eyes tricking me or are some of the textures worse in the remake for example the characters faces look worse this woulda been perfect if they had updated the models too but they look to out of place to be in the remastered version the original is still better how do you fuck up such an amazing game at least it is actually remastered unlike assassins creed 2 assassins creed 3 brought to you by oppo the best way to play is on xbox ones backwards compability is it me or do ac players only bitch i honestly dont like ac that much only like 3 black flag syndicit but the new lighting even if the texters of the models did not change to fully accommodate the new lighting is way better and brings more life to the game than the original the original looked like it was over cast 247 and just lifeless dull boring as a huge ac fan of the series imo remastered version over graphics visuals is better original the facesmodels is better this remaster looks so ugly i like the removal of the depression filter in the remastered version looks much better without it it just looks like they used a snapchat filter for the whole game 256 a wild moonwalker appears assassins creed yellow everybody ubisoft youve scammed people yet again i wanted a remake but i get a half assed remaster why are we remastering games that came out last gen is it a solid 60 fps on s4 pro becasue ac 2 witch is less graphicly runs only at 30 fps not enough footage in the frontier honestly for such an old game they made it look almost as good as odyssey its beautiful trash am i the only one that thinks the remaster looks better also never realized ubisoft changed the haytham first boston mission from winter to spring hey ubisoft im sticking with my original ac3 original looks more natural remaster looks like a movie not in a good way i see the thrill a minute pulse pounding extremely exciting follow the guy who talks while nothing happens missions havent been altered great 1 take a 2012 game 2 change the lighting so it has more vivid colors 3 upscale to 1080p 4 sell it again as if it was new so you can win a bunch of money damn ubisoft is just spitting in their loyal fans faces for money i hope ubisoft and call of duty all fall down out of existence to show future gaming companies to quit being money hungry sluty golddiggers how to remaster make game shittier go from 720p60 to 1080pbarely60 dont forget saturation and filter the original looks so much worse than i remember so you make it brighter and call it a remaster hmmm we get a remaster of the shittiest game of the saga ubisoft you really suck the characters look like action figures came to life i was really hoping the game would look amazing oh no its ac2 remastered all over again you could just play the original with high settings it looks very good ur thumbnail why u going to lie like that how ubisoft remaster a game increase saturation and brightness add remaster after the game name promote the game again sell it again 110 looks much more realistic on remaster the original feels more 18th century am i the only one who needs a few moments to see the differences between 2012 and 2019 wheres pink flowers shit not remaster i always thought remastering a game means mastering the original in the first place why your original game looks dark as compared to my original game wait character detail is worse yeaah original is better can please someone help me out that how to craft arrows poison darts in assassins creed 3 remastered pc what are the shortcuts for crafting menu on pc am i the only one who like original just play the original poor goat on remaster at 019 im a pc gamer but id like to see the 1080p comparison one day ill get 2k or 4k but 1080 compared to consoles is still so beautiful to me am i the only one who prefers the orignal the remaster nobody asked for lol stop buying remasters to force companies to innovate how to make remaster turn up brightness turn up colors change font and stuff make characters skin as they made from plastic remove that sweet snowy weather sell the shit again i am the only one who thinks original is still better than remaster whats the name of the music anyone plz this could have been an epic remaster but nope talk all you want but this is easily one of the best assassins creed games out their why would they remaster the worst game of the series all i really want is a ac1 remake that game is so outdated so i think a remake will be good remaster be nice as well ig only cause it from a console gen ago not like 2 console cycles but that game needs some love also this remaster is nice has its pros and cons i see where people are complaining and getting at what we need is a remaster of a battlefield gameespecially bc2 lol the originals textures and lighting are waaay better you can get the remastered for free by just buying the season pass for ac odyssey wow i am pretty disappointed with this remaster maybe halo 2 anniversary set the bar way up imo i prefer the colors as its not such a depressing mess as the original but then again it dosent justify the pricetag i would rather prefer if they added some modding tools for the game like bethesda did with skyrim saves them money couse the community does it for free and also draws more players in that just want to have new challenges and a game that always looks up to date this should be winter vs fall wtf this remastered kind of ruin the melancolic tone the original had not gonna read the comments cause of pisses me off i hate this game but it looks good now there was no reason to remaster this game the original still looks good not bad enough to warrant a remaster yet shouldve remasteredremade the 1st one perhaps they should have increased the texture detail cause it looks bad they could use some more time maybe an old game with new fx preforming 5060 fps with rtx 2080ti typical ubisoft optimization the original looks better just save your 60 bucks and buy the og at your local gamestore for 3 bucks cringeworthy remaster lul so glsd i have the original this looks bad i cant say i like the remaster no significant changes you suck ubisoft not a good remaster ill just crack this game not worth 40 bucks i have to say that the original actually looks much better to me too much red happening in the remaster he walked over a dog what the heck man price should definitely be 20 maybe 30 not 40 no one wants to pay 40 for a game theyve already played and all they did was add a yellow filter and ruin the facial textures on why is it so sunny is it me or did they make the characters look wayyyyy worse than the original their skin looks like sandpaper or maybe more like rubber what the actual fuck i was so godamn excited for this and they shit out a remastered version of the game but all they did was made the streets that looked snowy and ominous to happy plus wtf is 236 that is so annoying and then they have the audacity to charge 40 when you can pick the original up for ten at gamestop ubisoft does a lot of thing right but this isnt one of them i remember paying the old one on my shitty old laptop the nostalgia title of music used on the video anyone knows its a remaster not a remake i dont get why everyones so ticked off if you dont want it dont buy it havent bothered to look it up but does this remaster come with the multiplayer because i used to play the shit out of this and revaltions multiplayer ubisoft lets remaster ac3 developer naaaah just give it a redish tint ubisoft great idea remember the first halo and its remastered that was a huge enhance while this well it uuh who asked for it hahaha taking away certain effects ie the water ocean tide effect doesnt make it prettier it just makes it look unfinished i think ubisoft used a new engine graphic is awful and have to much bugs the remaster has some good visuals added to it but i dontlike the color grading its like a redish warm filter on the remaster and i dont think it fits well to the dark tone of assassins creed wish they didnt remaster it this way i dont really like the warm colors i always felt like the use of cool colors in assassins creed iii really captured the asethic of the climate of the colonial world fuck man i was looking forward to this looks alright but the lod and vd is pretty fucking disgusting cant decide which is better i have original version and i think its best developer dude i found a setting that its not turn on inside the game enggine lets try it game 2 different ubisoft take the original one from store and place it with this one call it remastered and end it as a day wewanttoseeconnorandsnowcomparison come on guys it came for the ps4 and xbox 1 and pc the revolution is rebegun its the same just a little bit different i think the original is better in some way the most expensive enb mod ever whats that music it feels like ive heard it before but cant put my finger on it 019 nobody commenting how the picture on the right the guy just stepped on an animalll so the original needs a flashlight thats all one is g r a y and the other one i s n t ubisoft youre drunk a remaster is supposed to make the game look better why music is so tragic i literally wanted to cry while watching it ubisoft remasters are garbage how can anyone support this borderlands remasters are hdr 4k60 thats how you do it remaster lost like 23 fps or more its kinda sad its reminds me of a enb for skyrim or fallout nv whats music play in video fuck me do gamers these days complain a lot some people love ac3 some people dont for the people that love it theyll welcome a remaster for the people who didnt love it then dont buy it its not like youre not forced to buy it it really couldnt be any more simple than that i fucking hate the gaming community and how overly critical they are nothing is ever fucking good enough a company could release a literal flawless game and the gaming community would be like saturation is 4 higher than needed scumbag company shite game get over yourselves its pretty bad when you have a game that was perfect they way it was and you go and change the atmosphere of the game entirely and it just turns out worse i do like what they did with the water and the updated graphics looks good but i cant get over the lighting its just not the same as the original i liked all the fog in the original because it felt like a nice crisp fresh morning but the remastered is just lacking in that the remastered still looks great and i would definitely play it but ill miss that slightly darker colder feel of the original niggas talkin all that shit about them just retexturing the game acting like skyrim didnt do the same shit i like how the remaster is more colorful and lively but those faces look awful they fucked it up lol need a patch i dont even wanna play no more xd i dont care bout remastered ac 3 is still lagging on my pc the remaster has a lot more than just graphics changes bought the edition with the season pass felt the first regret after seeing that they took away your choice on the dlcs felt the second regret when saw the remastered versions first time i ever preordered an ubisoft game but after this never again hahahahahathat view distanceoh mannni laufhed so hard feels like comparing fallout 4 with fallout 76 it almost looks better in the original lets give some props to the original though it just needed a saturation boost with slight vibrance but it looked great the remaster is literally the fucking graphics from ac3 e3 reveal im all for it it looks worse i mean giving more details in terms of less optimized game and bringing brightness a bit up well i liked dark and cold atmosphere of original more remastered just looks like one of those ultra realistic gta v mods ps ac3 is my favorite part and i was willing to play remastered to get that nostalgia but id rather play original pss dear ubisoft stop selling shit and dont try to make money on fans it was the most promising franchise of the century but after ac3 it became an extortion give it a time make a fresh start or kill it because you only make it worse well atleast the original doesnt step over a dog i have the backwards comparable ac3 and like hell if im getting the remastered most of the lighting looks like your inside a lightbulb can you see me if ubi did the exact same thing what iw did with cod 4 it wouldve good because so far the remastered ac weve keep on getting is just the same shit but different shades but with cod 4 remastered everything is completely different and much more detailed and also the graphics looks waaaay better than the original cod 4 high key didnt realize how darkgrey the original was until now original is better remastered too much lighting ugh sucks polish out the bright light 40 for whistling in a bush i thought nothing changed memory makes everything look better they dont have the creepy eyes anymore couldnt you just put sime time in it and show the remastered frames with connor i hope rockstar do a remasterd version of red dead redemption 1 reshade edition well this is just embarrassing its not just me right the original looks way better granted the city environment does have a warm arguably more natural look but that is basically a filter and shading the characters look fake and it can be argued that the colder appearance was more thematically appropriate when the distance is shrouded in mist it felt like there was something we could explore right over the horizon the grayness of the city contrasted with the vibrance of the country forest and sea fitting quite well for how welcome our character would feel being an outsider to the former but a natural to the latter nights were scary there days were lively dawn in concord after the midnight run was serene and dusk was foreboding especially with the howling of wolves the environment could reflect the mood thats good environmental storytelling now the sunsets look more vibrant and inviting in the cities but the characters the water and everything else seems a lot duller i think original is best i mean really ubi it looks like all they did was install a halfassed skyrim lighting mod they put instagram warm filter in remastered only lighting vegetation and some object modeltexture are changed the details and quality of the character faces are lost seems to be reskinned with a worse quality copy texture remastered is uglyier only buying this so i can own the dlc on physical form other than that this remaster is shit and ill keep my original ps3 copy assassins creed 3 relit the remastered version smell like a shit i cant wait to play this game again on ps4 looks like plastic wrap was out over everything in the remastered version i mean its a definite improvement with the lighting but back in the days when the game first came out it was one of the best looking games on ps3 meh i gave up with the ac games honestly the original looked far more atmospheric imo i have no intention of playing the game again but the thumbnail image caught me bc the remaster just looked so much worse idk but to me the older games are just unplayable due to the color pallet alone resident evil 2 remake is great awesome a huge improvement over the original but this this is a disgraced over saturated lightning no improvement on performance texture of character model terrain and items and look at the lod just another pathetic attempt at cash grab they didnt even improve the cut scene animation seriously there is no visual upgrade to it at all this looks like a down grade increase the brightness so you could play remastered i actually like the original better 245 the candle stand doesnt have a shadow on the remastered ugh good thing i got it for free and didnt want it to begin with i seriously want to know if even one employee looked at this shit before deciding it was ready was ubisoft that lazy or are they that fucking stupid if its the latter i almost feel bad about yelling at them for feeling so proud of themselves but just look at those faces what the actual fuck whats song in the video jesus its really awesome please tell me a name of the songthank you assassins creed 3 instagram filter edition assassins creed 3 instagram remastered can we please make skyrim backwards compatible ffs its too amazing add new weapons animations improved fighting crouched stealth and currentgen free running the issue with so many remastered games is visually they look much better but outdated gameplay mechanics ruin the newgen look how can you have a new gen looking game with outdated mechanics it defeats the purpose its like having a 2019 m3 with the engine of an e46 the games still a glitch filled broken game with some bs missions best gameplay no faggotry like ac odyssey all acs must be like that but ubisoft remastered just has better lighting thats it well hey i dont usually care too much but having been the last numbered assassins creed i played i remember this game vividly and it looks worlds better thank you for the comparison it was genuinely neat to see the jump in quality is this a remastered or more colored hahahaha wtf is this since when they doing remaster hahaha ubisoft only do downgrades this how they get their popularity fk this original is better well they kind of fucked it up all they did was turn up the brightness lmao yall r never satisfied by remasters smh i fkn love this game more detailed texture is good but they totally destroy the atmosphere with the new colour tone hey guys stop hating on ubisoft at least they arent as bad as bethesda all of bethesdas remastered games are basically the same exact thing as the previous ones i mean they did improve on the shadows a lot details and textures are cool on the remaster but i prefer the originals color palette by far ive never been a fan of bright sunny looking environments in games caused by all that excess of lighting and color that seem to have been upped to 100 another shitty remaster from ubisoft after ac2 i cant say im surprised graphics and lighting may be enhanced but everything else is just wack on the remaster ruined my favourite game it would seem that people still dont know the differnce between remake and remastered are we really on that point where we need a remaster of a already great looking game i think ubisoft waste its time to remaster this both are same not a big difference does anyone know the name of the background soundtrack of this video to everyone saying all they did was add a filter is either hating just because they have nothing better to do or are blind shouldve remastered interactions between npcs well screw it i got the game with the odyssey season pass and ac3 is my favourite so i might as well have some fun replaying it for the 3rd time with cool new graphics and the awesome dlc and liberation that i never played 237 wtf there is no way thats the remaster haytham is a chinese people now nothing beats the original borderlands remastered is wayyyyy better they did great for some areas but they fucked up indoor lighting and the cutscene lighting on the characters which for me ruins almost the entire game same problem that bioshock remastered did there peoples npc models look unnaturally illuminated as if they themselves are almost glowing sometimes look at the drunk guy on the ground at 040 especially bad in close up cutscenes like 240 i really dont like how so many remastered editions of games have completely different teams come in and make the sunlight more realistic while ignoring the very obvious artistic tone that was being used they made the sun of the town at the docks more realistic and ignored that the story purposefully used a dreary dark green fog of london type of atmosphere that wasnt because of technical limitations that was a god damn artistic choice and they botched it up for the sake of flexing their realism hilariously the interior lighting has the opposite problem they made things ac there is better weather in the remaster yay also characters are made of wax candles inside burn much brighter than they actually should and they put extra leaves on trees etc nobody asked for this ubisoft you delivered it though its thew equivalent to putting and enb on skyrim with realistic lighting why does the remaster genuinely look a lot worse im so confused the original actually looks better hahaha ubisoft should really hire pros i honestly prefer the cooler colors of the original more versus the warmer tones in the remaster honestly liked the gray felling of the original it fit the time period so well i would say its how its capped at 60 fps but its not that bad lets just hope they dont want 60 bucks or its going to bomb sales for ubisoft thing isid still buy it even if it just had a filter on all right the original was better the remastered version just turned up the brightness and the skin is made out of plastics its assassins creed 3 without all those annoying extra frames to be completely honest i prefer the original its set in the past right so its best to keep the filter that way when the original looks better than the remastered i think remestrad is more beautiful than orginal im glad i still have a dvd copy of the original knew it you cant make the best more better in my opinion the remaster looks worse than the original but at other times it looks better and why not to remaster the original bad ass ac1 with altair huh put bloody work in it the remaster looks great but im i the only one who prefers the gray atmosphere of the original ie 017 320 imo the original feelartistic vision in certain areas is ruined with exaggerated sunlight not worth the money ubi shouldve remastered ac2 tbh my only complaint is how stupid everyone looks i mean the original looked better this kinda takes away the original dark atmosphere completely messed up the winter atmosphere it would be much better if they remastered first assassins creed not this one tbh most of the time it just looks like a different time of day they shoulda gone the halo route and just do a complete overhaul cutscenes too 256well i still can see the ai walking backwards so naturally in remastered partjust like ubisoft telling me this is a world created by usas same as before nice job bugsoft i think too much red light only 90 and 60 fps for ac3 how yeah there is definitely some ambient occlusion and a few shadows that are lacking in the remaster ahh yes ubisoft really has outdone themselves with the graphics every year the graphics look shittier so i guess they wanted ac3 to look shitty too i like the remastered one more colorful more lightning more detail more gameplay but they shouldnt change the atmosphere character detail was terrible in my opinion and was better in the original makes it too bright and the original kinda becomes the better one on this and makes it easier to see the character details woould be better if they remaster assassins creed 1 or 2 just remake not remaster acii and ill be happy man this remastered is crap it all looks the same though over all i prefer the original to me the remaster seems to only have changed the lighting which makes everything look a but better though this seems the same way as what they did with eso i collection remaster dont fix whats not broken ubisoft 256 americas 1800s michael jackson how in fuck could they manage to downgrade an upgrade ubisoft r u ok so in the remaster he has washed himself as they say old is gold in remastered version all colors are much warmer this is my favorite assasins creed the story even is not nothing super original is good i love it i would call it remastered if ps1 game remastered at ps3 or 4 original needed shadows and lighting to be tweaked but not the saturation or colour remastering could have avoided the saturation i find it kinda pointless why theyd make a remaster i think its too soon to be honest also despite this being a remaster character models and view distance arent as good as the original also also whats this background music its amazing sigh i prefer the original original is better it brings the olden days vibe to it assassins creed 3 demaster remaster disadvantages 30fps plastic faces bad lightning in some places original disadvantages some mechanics that appear in remaster but not in original is it just me or is the original better then the remaster sure the remaster is more colorful but it feels less realistic and everything else is almost a downgrade does anyone else feel this way 302 the ropes remastered mostly these days mean slightly better textures and lighting you need to master a game before you can remaster it tho the original actually looked better multiple times the remaster just made it look more like a game in some areas this isnt it chief the game feels so empty and stiff and the pc is the master of fps drop ubisoft lets put a sweetfx shader and sell it again i bet a single lighting mod couldve done the same improvements lmfao if they didnt change a cutscenes quality and models of characters its possibly can be good remaster the original is better this remaster is a piece of straight shit honestly the original looks better to me the original looks better to me you cant just throw money at something to make it better ubisoft i am a game artist not a renowned one and this is a classic case of the artist or director of photography going over the concept art stablished on the original just to make it feel like they made something better if they were less arrogant they could have raised the model quality texture resolution and shadow ssr and others but keeping the original mood of the game that was such a success that inspired a remaster its nice and all but im not buying it again just for the minor upgrade goes to show you how good the ps3 and xbox 360 era was i think the remaster looks better in most ways look at 327 am i really the only one the original was more detailed more like assasins creed 3 summer edition i dont think there is any major difference between original and remastered assassin creed e3 edition so no ones actually noticed the doggo in 019 facial animations look worse on the remaster idk why but i like the origional look they have lost source code of these games honestly the original looks better i just liked to go in the woods and hunt in this game remasters should not be like this remasters should be huge differences in graphics lets hope they dont do the same for black flag assassins creed 3 recolored well the lighting really makes a huge difference in how it all looks huge improvement there the original looks better to me the original is much more darker am i the only one that kinda likes the desaturated look they make the characters look worse than the original music looks like a skyrim enb mod showcase great video could you do some of the weather changes too im curious about the detail in that sort of scenario how remastering games work slightly increase graphic performance release on nintendo switch with old graphic gets dolla ubisoft this is a ac 3 remastere capcom hold my beer the thumbnail does this game little justice the term remaster needs to be used very lightly in this case looks almost worse imho ubisoft give us assassins creed 2 with the graphic of ac unity already am i asking too much great time period for a game but this game was ass back then and itll still be ass no matter how much they turn up the brightness they could have done alot better they rushed the hell out of this i really like thisits surely better and new players gonna enjoy betterhowever i believe ac1 should have been a must first remaster project meeting graphics designer how much sunlight do we need project lead yes i wished that in this game the templars won and builded the usa since it feels like is ruled by templars in actual real life and in the france game would be fun if the assasins go and win the revolution to defeat the templars at their own ground their remasters are always worse its a graphics mod is it me or the thumbnail is just remastered black to white skin color racism detected lol 010 i see no dog in the remaster version 010 now remaster ac4 black flag with ac odessy graphics and im sold ill buy that game in a heart beat wtf happen whit faces in remaster lose in all the facts i like the old one better the fog is a experience luckily you specify original and remastered sorry of my english im french and le remastered me fait dgueuler how to remaster a game add more sunlightshadows and improve the graphics just a lil bit ubisoft logics the controls are still shit this is more like a shading update than a remaster im disappointed the thumb is literally the same image only one darker than the other the first assassins creed on the ps3 looks like ubi shit i dnot know why but i really preferred the original palecolored tone the faces in the remaster cutscenes were horrible and putting a high contrast and a few more lights doesnt mean its a remaster but the fps counter sure says it the remaster looks nice but they cant fix ac3s terrible writing and boring gameplay ive tried the remaster for 8 hours and im uninstalling it water wtf faces what a downgrade say word ac 3 original is like the winter and ac3 remaster is summer what about desmond face roses are red violets are blue its april fools so go get the lube i wanted gta san andreas remastered and got ac3 which is unnecessary do you expect anything other than halfassed bullshit from ubisoft the scenery for the remastered version is better but the original version of the character looks better both look good but i think they couldve pushed the remaster more to really take advantage of the given opportunities now i mean for some of that stuff you could simply use reshade to be honest well i bought it anyway so im gonna enjoy playing it again be it original or remaster have a great day people seriously this comments are cancerous as hell it is fucking remaster not remake also the textures was very good and yoh cant deny that it is well msde remaster like look at textures statues boat water it became better i think they only want more money ubisoft we need more money nobodys buying our microtransactions lets remake ac3 worker huh ubisoft just shut up and start working on the remaster worker ok boss after 1 hour worker so i turned up the brightness a little and ubisoft its done no time for all the details just put it on sale for 40 and add some microtransactions on it aciii didnt needed a remaster it was already good aci needed one remaster in ac 1 please this game shouldve been remade not remastered given that sweet new engine the animations are buggy af sometimes in the remaster all in all its disappointing to everyone complaining about how the remaster is just a reskin they have actually added many map and gameplay changes they were probably like you see what capcom did we gotta do that too if theyre not too lazy and remake ac 1 and not just upgrade a few stuff from ac 3 they wouldve had a bigger release than this seriously though it looks like they only added a few mods here and there but i dont have the game so anyone else who have bought the game please clarify this steps of making a whiny youtube comment 1 only mention one aspect of the remaster 2 done does it run 1080p 60fps on the normal ps4 they make the game trash soo sad mate i think old one better than now 150 looks horrible ubisoft tell me this is oart of april fools why is it so colorful and why is everything under such a hue or filter the original looks more realistic while the remaster looks cartoonish the realistic look is much better suited for ac because its a game that takes itself seriously 019 ok that dog is powerful sad the old versions look better just leave the games where they are meant to be bro whats the name of soundtrack wont be suprised if they make origins remaster at least the ai still looks retardedthats the assassins creed i know im sorry but this just looks like they upped the sharpness and added sunlight im a sucker for graphics and grand scale and beautiful colors in video games so i watch a lot of videos like these and this is just a joke compare this to something like the shadow of the colossus remaster which was a game from 2005 so much older than ac3 and was remastered a year earlier than this so theoretically with less powerful software and engines and it looks 100x better than this garbage ubisofts just been taking ls across the bored recently imo and this is a perfect example of them simply not really caring about their fans and the love of making games seems like they just always want a quick cash in now its sad that they went from ac2 which was a masterpiece of a game to so many people to then jump to this smh this remaster is more unnecessary than the are you over 18 question in porn sites 018 pity dog wants pet but ignored by mr kenway rofl i mean it does look better at the environment aspect but i think the characters just dont look nice still for that prize with all the dlcs if you dont have why not go for it from black to white whats the goddamn epic music i need to know please this really isnt that impressive to me then again its just a remaster so changes arent really supposed to be over the top they legit barely did anything fallout 4 modders put more efforts rather than just fixing fucking lighting so just that instagram sepia filter then the original seems way better what were you expecting guys its ubisoft they were killing games with their new games now they are killing games with their remastered versions well even i thought that the remaster mean them will use ac unity engine for it but no but hey its still nice especially the lighting and the color correction good job ubisoft too bad they didnt fix some of the same bugs from the original so basically the remastered version is just the same with high saturation so brighter i prefer the original wow they it looks like they remastered it with youcam let there be light ubisoft was there even a need of a remaster for a already answered game 256 michael jacksons great grandfather trying to create moonwalking 1700s colorized 234 i literally lold no turn those lights off i will not go brightness100saturation100leaves on tree 100ac3 remastered good remaster overall except view distance and that the remaster doesnt come free for owners of ac3 honestly who fucking cares about the remaster graphics being terrible they brought the game i always loved to next gen consoles and im happy in 2019 no steam achievements fcking ubisoft 019 what happened to that poor dog wtf is this remastered in a nutshel pale to saturated view vegetation looked way better in the original sad i wish they did actual remasters like toys for bob did with crash bandicoot to be fair i like the character models of the original and the sunlight of the remaster but to be fair the original is better with its colder coloration nothing feels better than this yeah the remaster could have been better but i look at it this way im getting a slight graphical improvement of course the facial features could have been better but im also getting assassins creed 3 with all the dlc and assassins creed liberation upgraded which looks a hell of a lot better all for 40 bucks so i think its a damn good deal emm please dont touch ac1 why not fucking remake it ac3 has aged like fine wine still looks great community we need ac3 remaster ubisoft ok lets increce the brightness to 100 the original assassins creed 3 was better crynation is far way more better lol saturation 100 basically a scam is the remastered version available for xbox 360 greetings from italy the rtx2080 can only get 60fps out of this no way i think you deliberately limted the the frames with nvidia control panel in order to drive afew people to your sponsors site lol and they charge money for this crap this couldve easily been a free update but they they gotta get that green why so orange stop buying this crap we need to send a signal to ubisoft to stop this is it just me or do all games graphics ok kinda trashy after playing red dead 2 how to get assassins creed 3 remasterd for free turn red hue on in monitor add more sunlight more money kinda feel like atmosphere is lost in remaster version so he became chinese plastic look alike faces less detail n shit go use unreal engine pl0x this is so unnecessary good job ubisoft yesslets cap the framerate thanks ubisoft not not gonna lie the remastered is pretty shit this game didnt need a remastered version all we asked for is to remaster assassins creed brotherhood thats all i see no difference except lighting put a little bit of warmth and there u go its remastered is haytham looking fairer also 3 is a good game well if they added the cut content from connor lines 053 how can ppl say left is better idk why but i prefer the remaster my eyes hurt when i watch the original coloration everything looks great in the remastered version up to the facial features at 228 i want to believe the user had his brightness up to high or maybe it was just this one shot where the sub was shining at its brightest and thats not how facially lacking the whole game is conclusion i need more back to back ogremastered videos before i make any purchasing decisions which i advise everyone too dont go off just one source 324 i like brick textures in the original more this was a bad game n boring af i prefer the old faces a polished turd is still a turd nice remaster but the faces look terrible and the lighting on the faces looks sometimes completely messed up nothings changed ubisoft for the first time theyve upgraded their game instead of downgrading it well put a warmer effect on it and decrease 20 fps then sell it as a new game also the character details suks the remaster isnt as good as the original i only saw the color more warm the only diffence i saw was of colours from blue orange and of lightening thats all assasian credd remastered lightened and liven up colours this game sucks its story line is so poor its gameplag was good but this game just sucks ubisoft ran out of the ideas thats why they need to remaster this shit game honestly the best remaster was probably halo although it had a rocky start it had complete graphical and audio enhancements and revised gameplay this is more of a lazy method to resale a game by upscaling it and adding minor visual enhancements i always hated the blueish color of the original glad they changed it its the same shit a dont see the diference everyone is criticizing the new ambience but imo its really nice and kinda adds up the whole new world setting all bright and full of hope etc if they had stuck to the same level of detail in the characters it wouldve honestly been perfect other things are pretty minimal but damn the characters look bad 147 7 years later and they cant even add a better loslod andthe fact that they basically reduced dof by like 4050 just kills it for me lets just put an instagram filter on it his cloak looks better in the original lmao they didnt remove the fucking white loading screen honestly just going to play my ps3 version i picked up for around 2 lol same game dislike for that shitty ass clickbait thumbnail i dont understand why they didnt remaster ac2 thats the only assassins creed game to win game of the year its supposed to have that grayish pallet it honest looks like he turned up the brightness along with the contrast 237 texture is better in original oh bugisoft what happened to you original rtx off remaster rtx on they shouldve remastered ac2 ive beaten the original on pc theres lieterally no reason to buy or even play the remaster it just the same shit with mods and for console the textures are nice but the contrast between light and dark often seems much too strong look at haythams face at 238 it looks great in the original and you can even seem to make out some emotion in his eyes but in the remaster the harsh lighting just obscures most of his face and draws the players focus to the awfullooking sideburns and ear these remasters almost never get anything like the care and attention and playtesting the original releases receive and it often shows i love assassin creed 3 remaster but when character meet another character quality skin its really bad than assassin creed original you know what needs a remaster the price this should be cheaper edit thanks for the likes i want the name of the soundtrack please 236 what no sorry i go i think the original is better reshitered anyone else notice that haythams eyebrows come and go as they please likethey do im not crazy now the game doesnt look depressing 247 there were always grey clouds l all they did was add a bright lamp behind the camera prefer the original tbh if your going to remaster a game do it right ubisoft original remastered they need to remaster ac1ac2 i wish they could have upgraded the naval side such as in black flag it would have been nice to control the aquila just like the jackdaw the morrigan worst remaster ive ever seen id rather play the original it looks better other than the lighting looks like unity with shitty faces scenery looks good in the remaster the faces look really fake and plastic when exposed to any lighting original ac3 was grey and a bit grim now its gta 5 with bad character textures this is awesome broo is very very awesome all they did was up the saturation lmao water does look nicer though and capcom still are number one remaster dev in the world example resident evil 2 as with every remaster thats come out recently the environments and lighting look better in this case barely so and the characters look like theyre made out of chewed bubble gum seriously game developers need to realize that it is not worth a remaster if your characters wind up looking like shit looking at you return to arkham lol not enough of a difference and the original looks better in some areas weve been swindled yet again boys think we can safely say that remastered could mean anything from downgrading to xbox original graphics to nintendo gamecube graphics man i miss my gamecube name of the song wtf did they do lighting congrats is it changed ripping the games texture and models the textures are darker than the original but that could be the ripping software also polygon count is a little bit higher making some things look rounder they should make a remake of assassins creed 1 with their new engine drop these remaster projects change the saturation boom there you go u got a remaster i hope if they ever remaster black flag they actually put in some effort besides just turning on sweetfx why original was better vegetation in the original looks better when will ubisoft learn from r best assassin creed on par with black flag the original looks way better what happened here everything looks great but the faces look like wax the pc versions dont do this remaster justice honestly you could mod the original and have it look better than this the console version is a much larger difference shoulda remastered the first game not the 3rd paying the colorsbugs seems like people hate it just for the sake of it make everything yellow then sell it as a remastered version profit i really hate how skins look anything el se is cool sorry removing the ominous fog in the remaster for richard kenway kills the tone they did it again lol turning a assasins creed game worst in a remasterd version that should improve it the original version is enogh to me i hope gaming companies dont take this as lets save or make more money from remastering old games nothing against this and future titles but with the industry in all forms music gaming tv etc everything gets gimmicky if they go for classics thatd be nice mgs2 socom bring that back gta titles before iv fallout vegas needs to happen theres an orgy of a list of games worthy for the time and money i always wished this would happen best game in the franchise in my opinion overall this is a good remaster stop complaining one of the few remasters that actually look better than the original game now its time for an ezio trilogy remake original v remaster except you cant see the original for the first 10 seconds hate the new orangebrownish filter over everything definitely prefer original lighting is the framerate locked in the remastered version whats the song in video mod community trying to make a game look good adds water everywhere ubisoft trying to make a game look good adds red everywhere i see you just brightened the screen there the original has a better looking character good game btw is there any different or new missions with the remastered story should of remastered 2 why 3 we all know that a remaster of ac2 is what we all need i was hyped when i heard but cautious from the outcome of the ezio collection looks like things have sadly gone down the same route in batman arkham asylum remastered batman have a fish mouth where are the forest comparisons at does seem to give it some more life the remastered version looksdisgusting killer queen has already touched this game its literally just gammabrightness this game is shit main character is a jerk dog wantad to chit chat with him i n remastered version but he just walked over nope no gameplay of this game tes v skyrim wins again and forever they just put vivid dream filter on graphics are still looking bad what a joke of a remaster jesus wow this actually sucks really poor upgrade in my opinion literally nobody cares for this remaster why this one everything was better except for the character details the clothes look better in the remastered one but the faces ugh i dont want to play assassins creed3 anymore this is not the best part of the ac series after ezios story assassins creed is not at all that assassins creed3 ac assassins creed it was a joke not a remastered remastered should be like cod mw 1 does this look better or worse i honestly cant tell pity there is no ray tracing but anyways pretty nice work we need a ac2 remastered how is this a remaster when the original looks better nobody ubisoft if you say so releases ac3 remastered to many add pop ups cant even watch the video lol the original is better wow on the thumbnail haythem looks kinda chinese xd assassins creed iii super bright i never saw a good remaster and never exspected it too because i learned that trailers are liars like there companies only good remaster ive ever had seen is resident evil 2 remastered title of the song its fire you have to agree with one thing the character models in the original game look much better sooooooo they made it worse original looks better i love the desturated kind of blue tone to it makes it feel cinematic and dreary like times were in the 1700s pretty much nothing looks better apart from some minor shadow stuff i call bullshit on ubisoft trying to get a bump in sales for a game that needed pretty much nothing visually changed ubisoft downgrade lighting 1010 faces1010 that corn vegetation looks way better in original d also whats with the shiny face d but ok if its for free i would maybe try it d apparently you can polish a turd ac3 is still shit tho remaster more like recolored dayz xbox benchmark please xbox one vs x vs pc or something i want to see it this game still has bad characters conner is boring hyphen is kinda cool i guess should of done ac 4 this is one of my favorite ac games i do t know why but i just love it and when thatspoilers old man died i almost cried ive never played an ac game and thought the graphics were bad they are probably one of the only games that dont need to be remastered now give me a remastered knights of the old republic i wish ubisoft would remaster ac unity i love that game i think its the ac with the best graphics ever and i would love to play it again with even more enhanced graphics and more importantly fixes for every issue encountered in the og ac unity ubisoft out here throwing ig filters on it we need a ac4 blackflag remaster solosing 30 fps for this difference music its sad that everybody is just complaining about the negatives of the ac3 remaster god damnit just be happy that we got ac3 back for ps4 i dont give a fuck if the game has a few lacks of details this is my opinion do what you want but the fans are hard to please ubisoft only wants money it doesnt care about fans anymore hope they go bankruped i just think its funny how they keep messing up the faces in every game lmao you see i like the orginal more but the orginal is more buggy i have yet to run into a gamebreaking bug on the remaster but with the orginal they happen every 5 seconds they seem to have realized colors are a good thing ubisoft literally cant do nothing right now there is no ubisoft only lazysoft the remaster adds alot of minor things that makes it look better like more grass better shading and textures of course some things will look worse on the remastered version they have other games to work on instagram filtreremaster for ubisoft the original looks 20x better cheap ubishit how the og look better lol way to go ubi they could have improved the character models since thats what we stare at most in an ac game 3s story was good but storytelling was awful thats why people say 3s story sucks original had more detail just play original and turn on night light whlaaa you got the remastered for free i think it looks okay but alot of the new effects just look rushed and not well developed so they think this game is ganna sale because they added some lighting ha end of the day its still ac3 just with better lighting haha in case anyone wants to know the name of the soundtrack used it is age of men by jo wandrini cant ubisoft actually remaster games with a little more effort like capcom they could have used the acunity engine i think they should of did what mwr did the original is still a banger the visuals look good kinda like a prequel for ac unity now what about loading screens i remember everyone hating this game when it came out and now people love it for some reason i guess boring characters and tedious gameplay have become accepted standards for assassin creed players i prefer the original it just looks more like it was in that time period i still like the original style of the game lol make the same game with better lights and steal some mods from fans and sell the game again becouse makes a pat ch with better graph is to expensive in the thumbnail it looks like the remaster made him asian this remaster wasnt necessery people did you change the graphics ubisoft yes people but it looks the s ubisoftyesssssss such an unnecessary remaster yall really complain about everything huh lmao we get it they just added saturation they didnt even have to remaster it in the first place though 258 6 years later that guy is still walking backwards eles tentaram deixar parecido com the witcher 3 wild hunt kkkkk only stupid people want to buy this shit remastered thought it was gonna be like modern warfare the original feels better than the remastered ubisoft way to make a remaster add a orange filter done looking at this i discover the original is blue asf music this game almost left me blind because of the damn lights that put you on a mission basically they selling the same game they just recolored the whole things no improvement easy cash grab when ac 2 have remaster this remaster looks like trashwont be getting it unless its free yeah its not the graphics im worried about its the way smoke grenades dont bother the guards during the charles lee chase or the conversation ring when you get too far away in nyc the game breaking bugs can a mod do this they should do a complete remake of ac2 with a modernized game design minus the rpg crap then build the series back up as a stealth game resident evil is doing this going back to what its supposed to be and its doing very well the intro for this game is so fucking long fuck that bugisoft the only company that can downgrade even a remaster wow thats what they call a remaster pathetic what can i say old graphic is better all simple with old graphic all game looks like a film from old cinematography and with remastered like low budget anime trash old color set makes you feel atmosphere of the game stealth shadows political mood in the societynew remastered colors just burn your eayes to hell with no balance of light and dark just get off your eayes and play but is the game still a glitch mess didnt like the game in 2012 dont think some minor visual and gameplay improvements will change it unfortunately i remember being so hyped for this game seven years ago and being unbelievably let down after finally playing it changes hue and saturation characters turn into playdoh the charakter detail is better in the original or only atmosphere changed im getting emotional because i played ac3 in 2012 and the remastered makes me finish the game again the faces look better in original quality instead of remaster the faces are hit and miss but the environment is definitely better on consile of course the original looks better on pc imagine buying this actually the original ac3 looks better in some aspects thats remastered never ever it looks seriously bad its just for the money guys dont buy this shit i hate how people think all they did was change the lighting the saturation part is debatable but all the extra texture and detail are spot on 157 how did they manage to make the view distance closer awful job by ubisoft zero effort put into remastering this game the thumbnail was the opposite of the video the og is left while the re is on the right on the video old game foggy remaster maximum brightness achieved looks like an amateur graphic mod instead of a remaster pay for instagram filter on the game 019 any one notice the pig i love that they added better and detailed textures but hate that they changed the saturation to more warm colors kinda love the old and cool color palettes i want an ac game with all characters in itput things in an order ubisoft should release the first trilogy as remastered i personally liked it but i thought it was a flop for a ac game suprising it got a remaster you know they could have added the legacy suits and just be dont with it we still play it its looks like they change the water and preinstalled sweetfx 031 fruit does not have shadow failed remastered looks like crap not worth 40 bucks damn ubisoft the original should have been the remastered one and the remasteredthe original name should be ac3 recolored edition some parts i like about the original and some about the remaster saturation is good but the lighting from the sun down on the character is not good at all downgrade in fps which isnt to awfully bad considered its above 60 imo they shouldve remastered ac black flag so instead of making remaster of ac or ac2 even ac brotherhood they took ac3 rly nigga the original looks better mostlyoh my god did they fuck up mr ubisoft what if we just made that shit bright and called it a day everyone in the board room claps i think original is better i just want a fully remastered version of assassins creed 1 not this kind of bullshit a fully remastered version take the graphics of origins and make as1 from the bottom up remastered face visuals look like shit tired of all these sad halfassed remasters they keep coming out with theres only a handful of good ones like halo 2 halo combat evolved call of duty 4 crash bandicoot and spyro you know actually remastered ac3 is trash give us 1 with the fucking subtitles xd this remaster is a peace of shit this thumbnail is sooooo fake theres on way the remaster looks worse than original the level design for the remaster looks ok but the character designs look really bad it would have been even better if they changed the combat to odysseys which i was hoping ambient occlusion isnt really used anymore in aaa and the view distance thing is mainly just due to how we now favour more detail up close compared to before regardless i expected better the moment when you really ask yourself if the old one is better than the remaster remaster is shit why didnt ubisoft remaster whole ezio story from the beginning a remaster should be a high better version of the old game in every aspect that is not happening because original games still look better in some ways i guess it is not worth the money i like the atmosphere of the original one better looks okay but who asked for this does every game need a remaster nowadays ac3 remaster instagram warm filter the living things look better in the original it may look betterish the game is still crap though heres why the game is shit terrible shadowslighting its just an upscaled version of the original game wait a sec is this the same story only graphics improvement i actually prefer the original this proves graphics aint everything when you try to change the resolution on both it crashes the game still nobody fixed it good remaster original was darker and snowy it had a better feeling i dont know i think i like the graphics in the remaster but thats just me i have two versions and this video its a fucking lie remaster graphic mod nothing more ubisoft trying to be capcom ac is a decent series but not worth a remaster they removed the waves from the water wake me up when they remaster ac 4 which is way more deserving i wish they did a proper remake of ac13 both do not let you use right thumb stick for look on pc using xbox one x controller recognizes xbox one x controller as xinput making game unplayable for me this is mod this is not remastered steps of making the remaster step 1 change filter step 2 profit remastered sucks thats disappointing i was hoping for a better 40 graphics mod than this looks like im gonna pirate it so you want to say that the original one is the batter remaster only background graphic good but not long distance not character design just lighting good and nothing else the faces in the remaster look awful where am i must to look to see the difference they could of colour graded it much better without moving the atmospheric fog in todays time such remasters are worthless name of the song nice remastered my ass have you seen halo 2 now thats a remaster this is shit the remaster looks too colorful this scam from ubisoft is this a joke it just looks like another one of those heavy handed improvements that random people make with sweetfx wasted efforts nobody asked for this the original is already good as it is at least we get to see connor wear alexioss skirt downgrade in remaster lol i know its not a very good remaster but the colours in the old one looked so dull and grey when going into nature it felt much more vibrant and alive with the variations of colours in the new version a remaster from a loot box studio cmon guys did you honestly expect an actual remaster cool i love this remastared game ac3 graphics and tone goes from zack snyder to russo bros ftw i like the remaster more because of the lightning the color and all it looks more cozy the other one was way to blue and white why the hell would they choose to remaster the worst assasins creed gamethey didnt even do a very good job at it pff i can make my ac3 look better with reshade and sweetfx tweaks xd shame ubisoft shame rtx off vs rtx on man i remember being blown away by the e3 demo of this game back in like 2010 and it still doesnt look as good p this remaster is the biggest joke ive ever seen dumbasses keep confusing a remake vs a remaster remasters dont completely overhaul the game they just add visual and minor mechanical enhancements still a shit game ac3 was probably the worst its the new generation of botox those faces doesnt scream america anymore america in this game was gritty dirty and gloomy some scenes the remaster looks better but i think the first is good only if they remade the eliot collection instead of these shit remastered then we wouldnt of gotten odyssey and i would be 1099990000090090090 fine with that i cant believe theyre charging 40 bucks for this garbage aside from the textures the only other change i noticed was the aim system they implemented i thought theyd at least update the parkour system call of duty knows how to remaster a game any other remaster i see is just lighting and color change and it ends up looking worse than before the game didnt even change is this a joke i think all the remaster games should have the original and remaster mode turn it on or of that will be cool as hell like the halo game is the only one that you can do that but holy shit this game has a real difference it character detail looked better in original cutscene looks like shit just see the faces the eyebrows they just improve some coloure and its done do only i think that ac3 is best of series and new acs are totally shit becausse of levels op skills and shitty storyline and the final question whats a price which song plays in the background it sounds very nice remaster recolour wow all they did was do was add a enb not going to lie i think they did a better job remastering ac rogue ffs you could literally just install an enb for a better effect xd i dont blame the uploader i blame ubisoft are you enjoying the game tho why do they did to the light fuck this is on the sun so i guess everythings a bit more summery the remaster looks worse basically just an enb your grass got pubg style xd hey candy wanna make a comparison between rdr 2 original vs updated 90 of comments here are so dumbdont know what the meaning between remaster and remake legit just a copy and paste but then they accidentally pressed backspace a couple of time thumbnail is like cosmetics product ads for fair skin it feels so racist 229 character detail hahahahaha it looks worse on the remaster who cares though the game sucks anyways assassins creed 3 was the best assassins creed game change my mind come on a skyrim mod can easily make more changes than this remaster good environment but awful cutscenes assassins creed 3 reshaded buy now why is the viewing distance worse in the remastered version imagine buying an old game again because of different lighting damn ill find out tomorrow but it looks significantly better are you sure this is a remaster this comment section lmaoo iv never seen so many graphics pros in my life the guys who run ubisoft should just take a hidden blade to the throat already 049 how to make a remaster make the water seem even less realistic just now it reflects light i would be lying if i said id prefer the new one what a beautiful texture pack hah on pc 4k ultra setting is the best of all this game should cost 10 it does look alot better in some places but in others its trash they turned the brightness up huh what kind of graphics card gpu are you usingwhen comparing these two versions why do i feel like this is a downgrade i like the foggyness it looks nice background music is a fucking 1 whether it looks perfect or not im just glad they go through the trouble to actually remaster there games another shitty virtous remaster watches video aw man this looks so much better reads commentsuhhhh yeah this sucks eat shit ubisoft assassin creed is a trash in front of prince of persia ubisoft is shit with remasters original is better than remastered hahaha too much color in remastered that why remastered sucks sorry but origin looks more nicely 111 more details on reflections illuminations shadowsbut bug fixes hell no just keep it that way no one is gonna notice npcs bugged with their bodies and equipments for a game that came out 7 years ago not that bad i dont like the new large font for the subtitles its like they do the bare minimum to make sure its considered a remaster fking comments its a great remaster hats off ubisoft peoples hobby is to bash ubisoft and others to like their comments forgetting tht ac fc alltc pop etc etc would not exist without ubi i dont think this game needed a remaster the original is in many ways better as the new version lightning in my opinion the textures look better ac3s textures looked a little washed out and pixelated lighting seems to be significantly better almost movie quality this is a remaster not a remake people in the comments remasters change fuck all just lighting and textures theres a reason this was given away free a remake is something like spyro reignighted takes a lot of time and work 019 not a minute passed and a dog fucking died in the remastered version f assassins creed 3 high saturation version well its ubisoft what do you expect it will look different on different tvs comparison videos are kind of pointless its looks like shit ac remasteredac 3 original more better than a ac 3 remasteredfor exampleu guys see haytham face hahaha funny and look like ps3 graphic ive never wanted to be sick until today the one in the left looks like it got a scary theme into it cuz of the colors the remaster looks like some rainbow shit its just look brighter wtf 2012 this game is sht 2019 i loved this game so many memories is it me or the original looks better fucked up the subtleness of america what it suddenly became less foggy now i still like the old one it match with winter the remastered is not bad its not perfect tho i like it what they had done to it ive only played up to sequence 4 at the time of this comment the only thing i have a problem with is how the faces look the original ones look better i say for haythams face for example i cant put my finger on it but there is something off about it i like how his face looked in the original game a new type of release relighting the remaster looks like the original i feel like the weather in the original is more closer to england than the remaster haytham actually looks white like hes suppose to and not tanned 238 why is he so white hes supposed to have left england came to america and had connor and connors like 20 you think hed have a decent tan but in the remaster hes still as white as if he never left england to meet a native american lady and have a child with her i dont know what kind of specs youre using but i highly doubt the rtx 2080 ti in the description is it that card could easily squeeze more than 60 fps out of a remaster of a 7 year old game the lightning at some areas is bad on the remastered i like the darker look of the original better why is it so orange looking somehow the original is the best who cares who even asked for this no one ubisoft should just die i dont why they didnt use the engine of origins and odyssey to make this remastered is really good engine for the most part the original looks better the faces in the original are better though but everything else i can see an improvement the lighting seems to be better but then at times it seems to be worse it was better if they were making another assassins creed with the same system combat i like origins and odyssey but i preffer a lot more the old ones in my opinion they were better why does nobody notice that the textures are updated they just lower the gamma haha og seems to be like the dc universe in dark themes whereas the remastered seems to be marvel movies both of these terms are about the lighting if you disagree idc nobody ubisoft releases assassins creed 3 remastered i honestly cant see the complaints for the most part it looks substantially better and realistic give or take some scenes with exaggerated saturation the original was far too washed out so a little saturation is nice to see paired with the increased texture detail and far superior lighting this is a pretty solid remaster people are just too picky the snapshot of character detail the original looks like a remaster of the remaster i think the remaster looks better the guy in the thumbnail gained weight it turned out to be disappointing remastered as always from ubisoft i confused that the original looks like a remastered title and so the remastered edition looks like old version in the thumbnail on the right kenway looks like an asian obs two pc version max settings why dont they fix the fucking uniforms weaponry and historical inaccuracies original has more detail and color i play it on ps3 but still looks good on remaster but with so problems doesnt blow me away but it is improved certain scenes dont look spectacular but its pretty good am i blind or does the original look better they have done not a bad job tbh guy at 256 and 301 practicing moonwalk it looks like they changed a tiny bit the vegetation and added an instagram filter and thats about it they should write assassin creed 3 fucked this is not remaster this is a god damn crime should be called redux instead of remastered 203 its ubisofrtofcourse its a bug anyone know the song title well its not that great lol fuck ubisoftthey ruined such a great game series they should have stopped after ac revelations and worked on ac 3 for for like 4 years before putting it out they are just milking it each game gets worse now poor character development boring story plots cartoonish looking enemies sloppy physics horrible combat system poor animation ughassassins creed died with desmond miles why is it always when a remasterd games comes the cutsecnes is worse but in game it looks better it is like the batman series original looks like a better experience i just want a black flag remaster that has actually had somewhat more work put into it and ill be happy am i the only one prefering the original game its just a joke for 70 its kinda 50 50 w me some parts look decent and others look awful imma save my money and stick to the original at least those cutscenes didnt look like some mega early alpha concept render ac3 wax recolour these remaster look worse than the original people complaining about the graphics while im just glad i can play it ive never played assassins creed 3 but i hear its the best out of them right next to brotherhood is it just me or does every remaster make everything waaaay to bright why remaster 3 instead of say 2 yeah its not a big deal isnt worth the money the original looks better sometimes this is the opposite of kingdom hearths brightness has overtaked it this is actually a remaster what exactly did they improve on everything looks significantly worse anyone know what music they used for this the environment looks really nice but the people in cutscenes look like plastic dolls assassins creed 3 remaster 069 cents characters look better in the original remastered has more lightning dem faces tho so if we mess with the saturation and color temperature well have a free remaster name of song used why is everyone such a bitch about this game 229 is that dutch from rdr2 how to buy this game on steam without odysseys season pass this looks really good am i the only one who finds remaster better looking am i the only one who thinks that the original looks better than the remastered not worth to buy again original view distance and vegetations are better than the remaster is it bad if i prefer the original one whats up with this music i almost cried original vs downgrade its idiot to remaster the 3 but not the first like remastering dark souls but not demons souls idk why but ac3 always ran like shit in my pc the remaster runs fine tho you know a channel is cancerous when the thumbnail is showing the same photo but darkened the left side of it and write original and the right side is so brightso its remastered u know lol wow am i the only who doesnt care about graphic i took this remastered as a chance to play again it and to play dlc because i didnt have the opportunity to buy them ps stop saying they only add yellow filter111 what have they done to the faces looks worse than the originals 020 the dog on the remaster tho lol these faces look like an avocado had sex with an older avocado you kiddin me i mean look at this 230 how is that might be better then original all games should be made from scratch and not adding more light 20 i will consider since i havent played this one im surprised theres actually a market for ac3 one of my least favourite in the series they cant remaster how horribly tedious the story and characters are even reshade can make this game look better than this sorry excuse of a remaster that fps drop is really unjustified shame but where is charles lee clicks on video gets an ac3 remaster ad bruh its not really a new game more like a graphics mod tbh a remaster isnt supposed to be in any way a downgrade what a petty excuse for a remaster very good texture upgrades almost a remake why is it that every remaster is just more orange or put in more flowers is there nothing else they can come up with why did they whitewash edward i think the lack of warmth in the original added to the mood for faces i prefer the original colors didnt exist at the time the original one was released they didnt enhance the ambient occlusion it seems that is been removed all together actually what a downgrade and yes is more colorful now more saturated and they added light bounce wich is cool in compare to the original fifty shades of gray appearance so basically more yellow so they open the lights i honestly love both versions the remaster does have some minor shortcomings though but that will probably change quickly after a month patch what the song is this remaster lost that winter feeling its like difference between pubg mobiles realstic and colorful graphics ill take the original ubisoft makes colors brighter also ubisoft assasins creed 3 remastered the 2013 version looks better bruh yall are stupid this looks way better 307 pls notice that the man in the left screen transforms into a woman characters look much worse in remastered whoa now pay us the orginal is better no different for facial constructionhmmm some nostagiabiased dumbass the original is far better remaster seems like a good way to play it first time 048 is this a fucking joke how much is this 236 whaaat thats actually pretty bad a remaster version shouldnt look worse than the original welp i was gonna buy this but how much they botched this remaster which im not surprised its ubisoft ubisoft downgrades i aint giving them shit original is just better in my opinion calling this shit the assassins creed lll demastered i know this look bad they refurbished the texture thats good lod seems to be degraded but the lighting and saturation looks better but too much i like what they did with volumetric lights but as an artist myself i understand that try imperfect something that you made years ago doesnt always end right and yeah i wont fix my grammar right there bigger upgrade than i expected original winter remaster spring thats all is it weird that i prefer the original textures just do not match well with the new lighting system back when the games where good with so great story driven narrative now its just rpg shit thats pushed out to early i love how ac3 original looks with his fog and gray colors remaster is over colored wtf the original looks better lol they should spend their time more wisely just make a quality assassins creed like the old days looking at you desmond ezio and altar i love assassins creed ive played them all beside the newest one why does ubisoft always fuck up the faces when they remaster the ac series like wtf are those faces man way better lighting the old one was extremely grey damn the game actually looks way better thats awesome environments original 1800s america remaster mars ive played the remaster and it is one of the better remastered but the lighting needs to not be so intense good remaster if it was remastered 8 years ago cmon ubisoft ive actually been playing it and i think it looks great and the faces dont look as stupid as they did in the trailers plus they improved the gameplay as well dont judge it based on youtube videos its a good remaster ubisoft add more luminosity and they call this remaster its downgrade instead of remaster lol no thanks i can still happily play original ac 3 how did they manage to downgrade a game so i must to buy again the game v view distance hasnt changed much also the lighting on the skin seems worse but overall the game looks significantly better assassins creed iii reshaded i would say that they have wasted their time by making a remaster of ac iii they could have been good if they would have made remaster of ac iiac revelations and the first ac its kinda sad that this remaster is still leagues ahead of skyrim question am i the only one that thinks that the original looks better in many of the comparisons edit the colors look more beautiful and a few of the details but other than that it doesent seem worth it to spend 40 bucks welp time to download the original again gray color looks even better for playing in those times mastering a new worldremastered looks worse to me music in principle the graphics are similar to the graphics in rouge they shouldve actually made it look more current gen ubisoft should learn how to remaster game from activision song name 45 second mark wowww way to butcher a remaster i wonder if ac2 will ever be remdade in a modern ge id love to see it in their the division 2s engine all i see was ac 3 in winter and summer thats the different i like the color temperature of the original far more than the remasters i dont like the faces in cutscenes definitely less detail looks good to me its a remaster not a remake rockstar knows how to do a master piece ubisoft no what is the music its beautiful the best remaster ive seen some different filter and a little different reflections how ac3 turns bioshock 3 graphics lolol i mean its not a bad remaster for sure they have done a lot better lod better shadows better lighting in general better textures but instead of a remaster it just feels like a better graphics mod so its kind of a bummer in that sense though i can tell they worked on it well props to them on that but it shouldve been a mod orginal is still best noting is changed with remastered version beside interior places especially lighting quality just like mod specktras true color fxaa in resident evil 5 the fps has a bigger change than the graphics facepalm lmao seriously the original looks more realistic than this so called remastered i think capcom is the true winner of remastering games textures were improved a tiny bit and they slapped some color correction on it i was really hyped about this they added colour oh my i think i unintentionally remastered the game myself years ago its called using reshade why do most of this remasters mess up the original atmosphere so much ubisoft is too bad at remastering why does the water look better on the original i dont want to be that guy but the original looks wayy better for real ubisoft remastered up gamma 500 peopleoriginal looks better same peopledont realise this game also includes features the original didnt have i cant believe you guys are refusing to get this just because of the lighting the new in game featuresfixes trump everything that the graphics have to do with it there was more work put in the cover than the actual game i liked details in remaster but dont change the fxxking saturation i need sweetfx we just want assassins creed 1 and brotherhood remastered why the hell youre giving us assassins creed 3 remaster idk why but i still prefer the originalmaybe cos its dark i mean you can feel the tone of the game its dark both of the games have outdated graphics 344 that tearing in the soldier remasters of ubisoft better i create my own reshade and then its a real remaster wtf is this just more colour thats all were is the remaster i like the grey misty look in the original console peasants paying for a enb lmao england in the morning vs england in the afternoon the lighting and lamps looks light years better but the face texture dont react well to the new changes and ao is missing in some places overall its better the old one looks really awful imo its just grey everywhere download another reshade mod for the original assassins creed 3 and there you have your free remaster of the game d i am sure u can get an enb and thats free all i see in the remastered version is assassins creed 3 in summer ac3 downgrade original looka better then the remaster name of the song they just added more yellow 55 fps on 2080ti this is a joke by ubisoft im not disappointed becuz i know ubisoft cant remaster games rogue ezio trilogy at least i can play the dlcs which i couldnt play when i had the original game fuunny thing is if i change my displayy colourr to 75 then my game looks like remastered version why dont you guys try this stick to originality ubisoft that was the only time that assassins creed was at its best this remaster sucks lmao another way of ubisoft just wanting money this is literally just an xbox one x enhanced version for the 360 title it is like a reshade not remaster look like assassins creed with enb mod icehancer the water is much improved in the remaster but the overall tone and atmosphere has shifted due to the warmer palette like many other remasters the visual identity was lost in translation and like many other remasters ill avoid it in favor of the original i will wait for a summer sale in xbox to grab it for now i wait for borderlands 1 next week for more fun and achievements did not know that they had plastic surgery in the 1800s i always hear how many fools can i kill today playing in background what about the snow assassin creed game has too much parts with better graphics then why they need to make remaster remasters are so pointless unless the game is a paragon like the last of us they should have remade ac3 giving it a second shot they just need to remake ac 4 black flag the fps on remaster is acting as though its running metro exodus on ultra wtf they should have remade ac1 and 2 not 3 thank fuck i got it for free its a remaster and not a remake i really dont know wich version i like more now but i want my colours back and my render distance what happened to 255 that guy just walk backward lol its ubisoft what do you expect from themthey well known for downgrade graphics and glitch in each game they produced except for 2d25d game like rayman did anyone ask for a ac3 remaster if they really wanted to remaster it should have been black flag how to make remaster add it yellow filter grass animation fucking view distance done ac 3 is one of the best ac ever the original has a much more cold and washed out feel to it which i like feels more fitting for a game set back so long ago this should be a patch instead of a remastered version looks a lil better in color but to be honest most of these developers have not used the real potential of the xbox oneps4 cause look at red dead 2 spiderman god of war they look great but other developers are not trying anymore basically they just dialed the colors to 11 and removed the old west tone the original game had the true remaster wouldve been to make the game like origins and odyssey not change the colors and call it a remaster what a joke i think they kinda ruined the intended art style by making all very saturated blue sunny sky and warmer colours every where it was supposed to be grayish and overcast too bad i really like ac3 so i may have bought the remaster but i liked that cold winter morning vibe of the original better the only comparison that looks good to me is the merchant store but its mostly due to the fire plus the fps on the remaster are just not acceptable ill still keep an eye on it tho 201 thats remastered right so i think this may go for all remastered games or just this one but ac3 was not a big project the main goal was to bring the game to nextgen consoles ps4 xbox one pc so even if they graphics dont look as good as they should its still an improvement so for those who either have the ac odyseey season pass have never played ac3 before and want to play all the assassins creed games like me or want a relatively good remaster this game is worthwhile this is the most unnecessary remaster ever who gives a shit about ac3 if anything the original game needs the update it had a decent story and started it all still not enough to milk our money big work thx for video color correction better textures and shadows better ilumination with theses changes the game seems much better i think water in original look better for me at least it looks better than the original i bought it and it looks nice the gameplay is dope the fighting free running exploring even the blood animations are still in the game anyone know the music in this video ac3 graphics are outstanding reshadesweetfx but it costs 40 bucks jesus fucking christ wait wtf to get ac3 now you need odyssey season pass why somehow why do i like the original one i wouldnt buy the game tbh i found the game ok at best but nothing compared to others like the ezio trilogy im gonna play it anyways because i already have it because of the season pass i like history but connor should be a fckin assassin not an one man army like he is when he fights in the war 256 did anyone see the dudes that are walking backwards in the original xd at the same time its a remastered not a remake and neither a reboot i do not expect a gameplay game like odyssey sorry to disappoint you remastered relative to a document a video etc a digital version of which was made from the original in order to obtain a better quality remake new version of a film a literary work their eyes are creepy af people have to understand that this is a remaster and not a remake 257 micheal jackson all they did was mess with the lighting and saturation looks better than the original but ill just wait on a sale probably how is it that most remasters these days manage to improve half of the game make the other half somehow worse and almost always throw out the artistic design of certain things i love how foggy and dreary the city looks in the original it feels very atmospheric and fits so well but in the remaster its just clear and orange adding yellow screen filter in old games and call it remaster remaster looks worse great job ubisoft did remaster looks better well yes but actually no if yall lower the brightness of the remaster it lowkey helps with the shitty character models and higher frames all remasters should learn from the modern warfare remaster that was just perfect this remaster is just not that good and basically just a color change sigh environment looks better in remaster character models look better in the original old is gold has the remastered will got hungarian subtitles because the original got there were slight improvements in environment but they need to work on the character details to be honest i like the detail of the characters in the original better they look more realistic now they just look more cartoonish like a wax figure or something they should have used ac unitys graphics or syndicates graphics the remasted faces looks like assassins creed 2 on xbox i miss the walking by jamming the stick all the way sometimes walking around a small town and admire the view is great but when am force to half way the damn stick its a pain why didnt just put the run on l3 and you auto move faster and auto run in combat etc why you dont show a face into the theatre they face was a plastics sorry my english im from russia cuka blyat well original have better fps so remaster sucks at least it works on ps4 now d original is more realistic what the fuck is this wtaf is wrong with their faces this is what mods did to skyrim even far better both look great its assassins creed iii sweetfx remaster xd new games make gpu look likes a trash just new gpu with more n more hbm or gddr n as much as possible cuda core what will the difference between the switch version and the ps3 and ps4 version be i prefer remaster i seriously looks damn beautiful assassins creed 3 remastered recolored lol original the best illumination ssr and more accurate fog are decent improvements the rest is dull i play original on xbox 360 i dont know why but i prefer the gloomy atmosphere of the original i always liked the gloomy and dark atmosphere of the previous acs but thanks anyway for including it in the season pass of odyssey ubilol just adding some reshade preset and calling it a remaster looool ubilool never changes ubisoft cant do remasters better the original 229 what the hell is that the best remastered is resident evil 2 the worst ac el peor assassins creed im just happy to be able to play this game again and are you seriously suggesting that the original played at 86fps lol its a remaster for the consoles not a damn 1000 dollar gaming computer 142 this looks like syndicate graphicsdid they use the same engine from syndicate try going on the snow lol holy fuck is it bad idk but 40 is so not worth it for this walking in the snow being able to see through half of the snow not just little glitchy i mean holy fuck the amount of glitching in the frontier is insane it seems like they forgot about that worked on the cities more then anything shitty remaster good job ubisoft nobody asked for this remaster remaster for a current console i get that but for pc why couldnt theyve just add some additional graphic settingsoptions through an update wait you didnt check the water effects on pc yes i had assasins creed of trilogy ezio got remastered why the hell npcs walking backwardss xd i kinda liked the blueish tone in the op ac3 long story short ubi accidently just gave us the e3 version back in 2012 and they remastered the one that was supposed to be out and it still looks bad can i run remastered on 1050 ti nice enb series for my gta san andreas guys dont waste your money by buying this just buy the original and install graphic mods like enb or something like that with the right mod it will look better than remastered all this remaster did was get rid of the gray blue font for a orange font and some things a bit sharper at the cost of other things aint no damn nintendo switch running this shit even at 30fps more yellow to remaster remaster looks good but the colors are garbage at this point they should just do a remake instead of remaster you are already showing a remaster of a console game when showing a pc version pc games dont need a remaster that yellow tint all over the place this game fucking shit back to the past xd good remaster steps of making the remaster step 1 add saturation step 2 add fog done so pretty much same game with saturation and more npcs in the background and maybe a few extra props around the place i mean ill still play it since i never have played iii imagine if ubisoft went and remastered all their games and made them look like what they did in the trailers tho aka give people the games they where shown wait why is the original getting up to 95fps wasnt it locked to 60 like all the ac games on pc i got this for free from oddesey never played it before and so far its really cool and story driven game less is more in these kinda games dunno how i missed this title why people complain so muchthe remaster looks just fineits a fucking remaster not a remakeso all they did was just some minor changes and upgrade the lightning and saturation and it looks beautifulas i said before its a remaster and not a remake so it makes sense for some things to be left the way it wasits worth playing the remaster once you get used to the new graphicsi cant imagine how it looks on pc or x box one x what was the music you used the differenc is notable ilumination is much better and texture too its a damn good remaster this video doesnt do it justice remaster is a fck joke performance sucks in pc play original asc 3 with fx shaders and tadaaaa you have remaster this game is a port for ps4 and xbox one no more awaiting the remaster of the ezio trilogy assassins creed 3 yellow version the remaster that nobody asked for then need to learn from capcom i m wondering whether original ver is more beautiful than r e m a s t e r ver the original is more artistic and better ubisoft remaster team its easy just increase overall lighting so its really bright the remaster looks good but it looks like it lacks character the pale colors were immersive and established the setting now it just looks generic overall an improvement but there are some baffling changes here a lot of the objects in the environment have completely lost ambient occlusion of any kind in the scene in the theater the floor standing lamps have none at their base while in the original they do this leads to the lamps looking oddly flat and out of place the sacks of flourgrain in the dock scene outright lack ambient occlusion so i dont think the grass lacking it is a mistake lastly whatever quality setting theyre using for the fog volumes and shadows is absolutely murdering the performance of the game volumetric lighting looks great and greatly increases the depth and scale of locations but that seems to have come at a cost cool improvement on the brick and cobblestone work though many of those shots had what appeared to be parallax occlusion mapping at work or just tesellation the only thing i dont like about the remaster is the faces i think ill stick to the original one if you did not play the game ok you can play it but if you play it already is just lose time if you can play other game that you did not so good for the people that the people did not play it and enjoy the game but like me i play it no play to play it again 228 listen i like the tweaks they did with the the remaster but when i see this type of stuff 7 years after the original product and it looks like thisyeah ima stick to the original everyone hates life on youtube is what i learned reading these comments i guess everyone wants a new story line my opinion i love this game then its even better now i cant spot any difference they just worked on the shadow a bit and over saturated i was expecting more and this costs me 40 in germany demn i got two ac3 original for free i was planning on buying this but not anytime soon the remaster may not look too good but i got it for free from odyssey so i wont complain ac combat changed so much i honestly dont think i can go back to the older games the original one look a lot nicer ubisofts way of scaming i dont see much graphical improvement 257 theres people moonwalking in both games i love buggysoft and ac3 is my fave in the saga the only improvement i see is slightly more detail ubisoft stop it make a remake no one gives a shit about the terrible assassins creed 3 remake that changes little too nothing do a remake of idk beyond good and evil its been like 1516 years since that came out no one has asked for assassins creed desmond finally gone 3 remaster and also fix the the og game i have too play at 4k ultra to keep the framerate at 60 because if the framerate is more than 60 the game starts glitching like mad i wanna play ac3 at 120 fps but cant is the point edit they did change the grass to be honest the remastered looks way better than the original original or remaster in my opinion this is the second best assassins creeds and one of the best games ever made dont buy it far too many people are sucking ubisofts dick saying theyre impressed with this remaster i would kill myself if i had a job with them why dont they just remake assassins creed 1 why would anyone remaster game thats not even 10 years old only ubisoft manages to downgrade a remaster 020 haytham walked over a dog remastered looks very bad in many scenesoccasions bad lightning no proper ao no physics etc faces also looks like characters from gtasan andreas only improvement so far in my 4h its just candles light and some global illuminationalso they reveal trailer seems they use total different visuals cos ingame theres big downgrade in visualsbut waitubisoft famous for downgrades i know itd be a lot of work but they need to remaster it with odyssey graphics like i wouldnt mind paying 40 if they did thay disappointing no real improvements to most of the textures all in all im just glad i can play this game in better graphics cause back then on xbox 360 it looked total ass with a frame rate of at least only 30 sometimes i personally love ac3 they ruined the faces i like the water and the water reflections and the better shade the better textures when it comes to grass and bushes and rooftops the only thing thats really fucking with me is in the cutscenes their faces look downgraded the sun shines on them too much way too reflective ubisoft needs to take some notes from raven software because they have completely different visions of what a remaster should be as it stands ubisofts remasters are nothing short of redux mods except you pay for it and they still make the skin look worse they clearly didnt learn after their mistakes with ac2s remaster they dont know how to find a happy medium with the faces and skin they only go all the way this way or that way neither look good but the original character models still look better in both cases ignoring the improvements to some of the clothes clearly they remaster these games out of greed rather than passion sure activision may have had modern warfare remastered for more money but at least they let raven update the graphics instead of simply having them change the textures and lighting who wants this fucking remaster i want some ezio and uncle altair nobody wants remaster of 3 i dont even remember the name of that fucking assassins it doesnt bother me at all screw you ubisoft you selfish prick only one word ubisoftplease do not buy it the team from nexsusmod makes such modifications available for free nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti palit gamingpro oc 60 fps upgrade your pc to downgrade your game no face details some minor changes lock your fps 302 dat swapping though i think i like the nightime sequence on the original better since it gives it a more haunting look love this game and i believe i have it for free too download after getting the season pass for ac odyssey game play is everything but if you read the history portion its amazing none of that coloring book bull shii america reads in school whats it called awwwe american history lmao 229 awwww you poor thing the only remaster so far is call of duty modern warfare all this dudes should do the same if they remaster somethingi would buy it if you dudes just would remaster it like cod but not like this we had this like years ago with texture patches and sweet fx d now is the time to ac 1 remake you just stepped on that dog you monster to anyone who owns an xbox you can just use the backward compatible version and it looks a million times better than this crap the cutscenes dont just look terrible but they sound terrible the audio ends up a mile ahead of the cutscene well this was unnecessary this game didnt need a remaster yet hope they fix the faces and the blinding orange i sometimes get i played the original game but i dont see a big deffrent ubishit is a big thief so dont be stupid and buy it just download the cracked game upishit have a low security program and it is already cracked before opinning on the stores good work ubisoft assassins creed 3 black flag textures edition that game sucked ass the first time around why do people mix remaster with remake remaster is when you bump the graphics and lighting up a bit to put a game imto next gen consoles there is no other difference since its the same game remakes are when you take an aged game and recreate everything while staying true to the original this while a few things look weird is a good remaster difference brightness and filter bluestop theres a lot of fog in the original anyone noticed that pointless remaster your forever say upgrate your pc my pc from 2001 year price 650 consider inflation and gets 2700 create please a build price about 27002400 euro ps for kids you do not cry when the price of cars grows and then do not cry xd pps main differences your pc from pc for 27002400euro 1tb ssd m2 8tb hdd 32gb ddr4 you started to feel old when they are doing remaster of the game you bought right after its realise they just change the light bulbs and sun from white to yellow the remaster is better ac 3 white version vs ac 3 orange version looks so much better than it use to cant wait lowkey orginal looked better to be honest i think that the old one looks more realistic there was nothing remastered except for lighting and reflection does ubisoft thinks gamers are fool anyone know the song used in the video i doubt this will give connor balls i would pay 10 for this upgrade but not 40 when i already own the original game same character models and stuff looks like reshade to me only colors and shaders the original is better i think i like the looks of the original better to be honest how to remaster ac3 add sunlight thats it lets cash in i love this game is one of my favorite assassin i like everything but they could have kept the old faces its remastered and cod 4 was remadeit was ported to new engineits far better than any remaster i have seenyeahbetter than bioshock and even other ubisoft remasterslighting is fantasticexcept for too much bloomhaze effectambient occlusion missingmay very well be a bugonly thing i feel thats bad is the character re work amp the fuck out of the saturation add more light done 240 wtf thats not an upgrade thats an downgrade xd original win is no one noticing that the game isnt hitting 60 hz on a 2080 ti what a joke of a remaster 40 for this there are reshades that do a better job than this sad excuse of a remaster why do i like the original one more than the remastered one original looks like a black and white movie slightly disappointed the real upgrade is lighting a bit sad that they decreased de fog i kinda liked it hold up hold up youre only getting 60 fps on a remastered version of a 7 year old game using a 2080 titan and 32 gbs of ram with a 8 core 16 thread processor wtf is going on with that anyone else think thats super low even at 4k ubisoft congratulations you made the worst remaster in the world the game began to look really worse and even the system requirements soared to the skies and you removed the original from steam what the heck burn in hell remastered shit eh modders couldve done that for free this is a piece of shit not remastered just changes some textures and okay some light is changed but its a joke if somebody buy this i think heshe is stupid what was the point haha they butchered the game it just doesnt compare why do i remember original game like remastered version its different but is it better sometimes maybe changed too much ehh nothing special original is way bether guys its a remastered not remake its not like resident evil 2 so dont expect massive changes from what i see in the remaster has a very clean look to itdoesnt look like the city will have any sort of diseases which completely removes the point of a broken burnt down city thats dirty seems to be alot orangy which totally removes the atmosphere of the game shown in the videothe free roam footage also takes place after the city gets destroyed which means dust and ash should still be in the air causing abit of grey look but in the remasterall orange the roads and harbour are very clean and not muddy and dirty foliage seems to be more dense the sails have been improved draw distancelod has decreasedeven the xbox 360 version has better draw distancelod wtf is up with the character modelare they made from clay or plastic textures seem to have better quality but less detail water seems to be improved with proper reflections but yet againseems dead because there is barely any ripple effects hate to say this but i prefer the originalthe remaster just makes eve ahhahaha what the fuck is this ubisoft remastered downgrade xdddd this is a remaster not a remake 2 totally different things you dont play assassin creed games for the graphics you play it for the lore this is personally my favorite ac game and ive never played it just watched walkthroughs 40 for this game with all dlcs and liberation is great deal some things look worse some things look better too soon for a remaster perhaps so basically the original had a foggy atmosphere and the remastered version has a sunny atmosphere black flag deserves a remaster more than anything the best part about this remaster there a portable version on switch its a remaster not a remake yup ubisoft does it again not gonna even bother playing this one should have just continued the story from where rogue ended and incorporate their new found mechanics or technology without straying away from what made old acs good that was the last good ac game socould you do the remaster with reshade or sweetfx that feeling when the original is better i hope yall know the left of fully maxed out pc they arent comparing old gen graphics on consoles to new gen original onelove remaster looks soo unfinished they only changed the bright just to damage your eyes original is better thank god i didnt get the new one out of excitement this game had minimum graphic adjustment settings in the original version it was frustrating to play it on the pc well its a remaster not a remake and so they just increase resolution add minimal lighting and change the overall color scheme obviously just a way to cash in much like activision did with mwr it always looks subjectively better the open world looks much better but they somehow made the cutscenes and character models look uglier uhhh where did the ambient occlusion go did they touch the character models or not cos all i see is different color tones and lighting or lightning idk i hope the game assassins creed will make a theme about asian countries for example like in indonesia why indonesia because indonesia has a unique history and an archipelagic country making maps more widespread and can add war on the sea and other things for those who already have the ac3 original the ac3 remaster is for free lol i love the comments for these videos this remaster has way more effort put into it than most games and theyll still call the original beyyer everything is yellow now thats ac3 remasteredit could be called ac3 a little be more warm xd original cold and blue remastered warm and gold rtx on 20fps rtx off 20fps this remaster was good so we raised the red levels and the resolution 40 a good price perfect an example of a true remaster just look at either resident evil 2 remake or tombraider 2 fan remake remaster is not worth it on pc what happened to the faces so judging by the thumbnail haytham became an asian wow the lod is terrible and texture qualitylighting it is funny how grayish games from the beggining of the decade look what a cash grab stupid french idiots what you thought would happen after upgrading from ps4 to ps4 pro v after re2 all these remasters look the same meh they basically just made the lightning different sky and ground o character detail looks funny to me but other things look so much awesome ppfff i prefer the original water lighting textures and fog looks good but the shadow in the character faces 230 looks fucking weird ill wait for the 20 bucks version it looks more real in general ac unity remastered please because that game look so bad when released fucking plastic faces what they doing with faces textures they fucked it up again completely destroyed that gray cyan drab unique atmosphere from the original its ok for me got it for free cant complain lmao the original game looks way better that is disappointing i kinda liked the greyish look from the original this one is too colorfull less realistic how can you get ac3 if you have the season pass this remaster is so unnecesary and dumb this is a waste of money and time could be working on a game to release then a remaster witch i think would own good for youtubers that play the game and maybe new people maybe few that have not played the game not me im not buying a game remastered wait thats a mod not a remaster 226 original textures are literally better than the remaster just look at those coats that thumbnail though ew fuckin yellow shit dont know what to say i hate the saturation on remastered version though remaster wtf ubisoft i dont know if it worth buying because it is just a remastered of a few details in graphics department i mean this is not like resident evil games remastered which are huge steps from the original game that already 20 years old and this game is just less than 5 years old which is already been good the bottom line is the game is not too old to remastered only the fucking lighting original looks better how the hell did they mess that up the remaster is little disappointed at the lightning for some stages im not a fan of assassins creed anymore but my god this comment section ungreatful fuckers not worth it a simple enbgraphics mod would suffice or even better 228 look we put a filter in our game pay for it the remaster version use a snapchat filter lod can be improved 421 wheres the frame rate test i hardly see any difference between em the lighting and textures bit improved i think assains creed 3 bright addition am i the only one who doesnt care about the remastered and still play the normal one i never buy games twice good but seriously ubi ac3 i could even buy if at least was ac2 or black flag did they forget it was winter and not autumn the remastered looks abit more better than pubg standard graphics remastered is good but i prefer the original everyone in the comment section is suddenly a veteran game developer this game didnt need a remaster its still looking ok nowadays cause in its day was graphically awesome about the remaster its a pretty bad one did it with low effort the lighting and illumination looks quite good but everything else is similar to the original game its only that the remaster has better light effects and reflects and its more colorful its crazy to think that they are charging money for this joke id take the original version with the higher frame rate not sure why they locked it at 60 in the remaster lighting system is problem in this game it is a shame i think so the enviroment looks a bit better but the characters absoultely horrbile for how much are they selling this haha they just used reshade i guess they wanted to remake brotherhood because its the third game but someone switched the memos this is mcable i download it and its an amazing game well at least some things look better i see that it now has changed into some eyecandy this looks like one of them skyrim graphic mods hose models look horrible too dark too bright disappointed broken fps lock and cpu utilization graphics are ok for 2014 2015 even now it looks not like a modern game world is still quite empty a lot of problems with framedrops and stutters when there are a lot of npc on screen due to 1 core use when vsync is off and even without any npc it stutters a lot giving 62 fps obviously locked when vsync is on it uses 2 cores no stutters but in game it drops to 40 from time to time poor settings i can change postprocessing only which is bad when i ask for i remaster this is what i mean better graphics better audio better shadows better everything colour added anything could be better than that its cool but there is too much light is the remaster capped at 60 fps so how many of you think ac3 didnt need to be remastered yet i know i do the colors ara too mich warm i dont like that ubisoft have the habit to put too much warm color in this assassins creed series nowadays the cutscenes are awful and lighting is too strong not a very good job by ubisoft but better than rocksteadys attempt with batman for now good remasters are quite rare good remaster for my switch what i call a real remaster is resident evil 2 and this they just changed blue to orange thats it wow look they have being working on this for 1 year and it is nice 40 mod xd i think the only reason is they did is for console it was 30fps on 720p lowmedium settings for pc its not that amazing just improved lighting a few tweaks here there with slightlyimprovedtextures the character textures seems like they are made of plastic i have only two words to say what a fck i dont like this remaster because this game make me think about edward kenway im not having any of these lighting issues on my ps4 pro it looks crisp remaster has too much orange filter while the original has too much blue filter ubisoft logic this game has poor optimation i think orginal way a better where is scene from video preview i am unable to find it and remaster looked much worse in there ac unity is 5 years old just keep that in mind old is fucking gold this is the only ac game that i finishedthe other ac i played is just simply boring this game is trash though anyone know where this is on ps store cant find it 40 for saturation change jesus christ lol they just made it brighter as they did with the ezio collection the original looks much better much more details at a distance 102 the rats like dont mnd me just passng through lazy dont support this behavior wheres charles lee is the remaster framerate capped at 62 like black flag so they adden enb rofl am i the only one who prefers the orginal one i find that version way better still using the first core at 100 40 can anyone please explain me what difference does the remastered version of a game have than the original one does the story and gameplay changes or remains the same enb series for buy u can do more than this ubisoft i think that assassins creed 2 deserves remastered version much more than ac3 i dont get why everyone else is complaining 3 was a good game im just happy to play it in high graphics but i guess im the only longtime fan here or something oh yeah thats definitely what i want less fps in a already shit optimized game of all the ones to remaster why 3 in short remastered makes more lively you morons dont really seem to understand the difference between a remaster and a remake this is the former not the latter ubisoftburn in hell just use reshade over the original lmao modern warfare still best remaster for me they change and improve model not just reshade i think they should remake it not remastered ac 3 remasterd human eyes cant see tooo many far you idiot the original still looks better to me this not look very better just ok theres a decent amount that i actually prefer the original to the remaster remastered or bad remake ubisoft wtf omg all you shit cry babies get a life and stop to whine about this good work as if you could do it betteryou guys are a joke its clear to see that it is improved and remastered vs the originalwhen will you idiots get enough if you get a whole new ac3 game just lol the colers are better more color and not that greyish frosted textured in the original better shadows as in the original very much better ilumanation as in the original view distance is more then enough dont know why you freakscomplain about it even the vegataion without ambient oc looks better vegetation quality is also much better charakter detail looks far better as in the original so stop you shit fanboy talk and realize that this is good work you noobs downgrade it to ust 1 thing as if they didnt done anything on it if you dont like to give your money for it understandable but if not no reason to talk shit about it they did a good job and its nice to see don the original is blue the remastered is brown and thats it just like return to arkham better lightning and details but faces as a pice of soap wow ubi guys did a good job ac3 its a awesome game maybe is only me but i think the remaster looks like ac syndicate may the father of understanding guide us its doesnt worth a 80 price ubisoft makes me want to kill myself assassins creed iii remastered increased saturation and exposure the name of music please i hope therell be a day one patch the ezio collection looks better i wanna to know that the name of background music its really nice assassins creed 3 clayface edition how to remaster a game adjust the brightness do the same but on a nintendo switch so it looks worse and runs worse should honestly fire the guys that made this trash immediately after the resident evil remaster i kinda expect more from studios now when they say theyre remastering a game i loved ac3 im gunna still play it lol shitty remaster the game looks better when it comes to lighting shadows and colors graphics post processing and view distance are still the same but i would still buy the game because this is one of the greatest assassins creed games i have ever played oh look they added an enb for those who disappointed it is fuckin ubishit what do you expect better lighting but bad graphics a lazy remastered i feel like the only noticeable difference other than the extreme lighting is shadows being a lot darker i still like to play the original one lol only ubisoft can try this bullshit this is basically an assassins creed enb mod caracters detail seem unnatural in the rm version you have a 2080ti and have framedrops fuck that shit id stick to the original this is nothing more than reshade applied to the game whats wrong with their faces in the remastered is this remaster of assassins creed 3 out for playstation 4 237 the remaster looks so much better than the original looks at the top left corner of the screen damn i only now see how bland the original game looked in terms of lightning i dont see a big differenceactuallythe original is really good even knowing its a 2012 game too bright v haytham looks like hes chinese are you blind to saying they only added saturation this bad remaster it look like graphics mod to the game i can say assassins creed 3 has good graphics some textures deitails look worst on the remaster look at the man on the right his shoulder 227 we need waiting for ps5 because it gonna look huge remaster like a remake for assassins creed 1 2 brotherhood revelations 3 liberation 4 rouge wrong game to remaster bugisoft nothing new all they did a piss filter all over the place how to remaster a game 1 turn up the brightness 2 turn up the saturation step 1 disable some graphics function step 2 wait 7 years release to remaster version with little tinkering step 3 profit the original was just fine it looked so ugly last gen like a washed out paper cutout looks good on ps4 practically unity syndicate level seems fair as long as its name is remastered not remake thanks capcom for clarifying the difference this remaster is proof that lighting is everything the game looks identical with resolutions and detail but the new lighting makes the game look new its brillaint why dont they remaster the games so they play and feel like the new games instead of slightly changing the graphics like i wanna play as ezio and look as cool as arno when i parkour and as badass as jacob when i fight i think all they did was slap a new dynamic lighting system onto the game and called it a remaster ubisoft you never change is it weird to prefer the old one idk but the colors and overall atmosphere seem more on point although i do hope the switch version will come with some of these improvements like ambient occlusion texture quality shading improvements ect whenever they remaster the assassins creed games theyre either just a port or overdone to the point that they look bad if you play ac because of the graphics then you shouldnt play them is its defense we cant see the hdr ac brotherhood remasterd now4 is it meor does kenway look a bit fatter in the remaster the original was and still is incredibly visually impressive shame about that ending tho this is a remaster guys not remake lets hope they make first ac remake i like that its more brighter put reshade on the original its better if i preordered it i will get it tomorow too much color saturation same bug more fps animation are buggy see flag how the hell do you approve of this oh yeah lets just add some saturation and somehow fuck up the character models im really excited for the game but how fucking lazy do you have to be ubisoft stop shooting yourself in the foot so many times so pitiful as i said i am excited to dive back into one of my favorite games from my childhood but please grow the fuck up ubisoft god damn it should have improved on everything lightning lod volumetric fog skin shaders etc instead it just improved on certain parts of the game but as a whole i dont think it looks like a proper remaster its still sucks i have a feeling this remaster is going to turn out like silent hill remastered a shit stain ps3 graphics mod please make assassins creed liberation ps vita ps3 e ps4 comparison original looks better in the thumbnail cooli thought i was the only one who loved the original morei should play that again definitely looks better than original distance aside but unless they do it properly like unity onwards im just not really fussed because i know its still not as good as it could be the remaster is not as good as i thought it would be this minimal effort by ubi with ridiculous framerate should be given away for free really seems like a pretty decent improvement remember guys this is a remaster not a remake not really a fan of how the character models look though ubisoft is shit some ambient occlusion missing in remaster i think that the remaster loses a lot of the identity manthe music is so good assassins creed 3 was the only assassins game i liked no matter how long it took them to remaster this it wasnt worthwhile its dutch plan wow the old version looks better they shouldve redone the combat system that view distance is still trash lol my reshades are better then remaster this is one of the laziest remasters i have ever seen ubisoft is getting really desperate now we all can tell pretty decent remaster until you see the characters faces and expressionsthey look horrible like they were made of plastici was hyped about the remaster not so sure now reduced draw distance and lod is this a joke i think pc won on this one 019 still buggy as ever well done ubisoft why couldnt the smart men and women of ubisoft remaster ac unity they couldve made it a masterpiece a bit of the details are sharper and overall its brighter butyeah the character models are better in the original take a look a haythems jacketit looks like completely different material now indoor lighting is cool at least in my humble opinionoriginal characters seem betterthan remaster i wanna see how the switch version compares it kinda looks like ssao is missing not just from grass but everywhere its either missing or they toned it down to bare minimum am i the only one who prefers the look of the original it looks far more atmospheric has a dreary feel to it its literally downgraded faces ambient occlusion textures dont look better too assassins creed 3 e3 version old is gold original is much better than remastered wouldve liked to seen sea battles tho its same maybe orignal is better everything except the faces looks good i prefer the original one still enjoy it till this day given its age this kind of shows how impressive the original was this may be the shittiest remaster now ubisoft started using reshade and name them as a remastered these should be called enhanced not remastered ok wait who even gives a single fuck about ac3 at this point wasnt it the least liked out of all of them ubisoft we are the kings of remasters rockstar hold my beer people stop complaining this is a 2012 game at its core and its an remastred not a remake another ubisoft cash grab just like far cry 3 ac rogue one and others better ilumination but i prefer the old grayish tonemap also i miss the distant fog effects in the old version wow so i could just raise the contrast on my tv and use a sepia picture mode to get the remaster cool if this is a free upgrade for people who already have the game then i call this a bonus otherwise it looks like a small upgrade it just seems like a developer did this remastered as a hobby lighting is too high in remaster cutscenes in the remastered version is a fucking joke resident evil 2 that is what i call a remastered this is more of a mod pretty shit not gonna lie cod mwr and re 2 is better when ubisoft finally releases e3 version original character details better than remastered well when youre playing the missions it looks good but in cutsceness everything looks so washed off indeed im glad ubisoft remastered this all in all this make fandom rise again ehi ubisoft what about ac2 remake now did they remaster the story by making you be haytham throughout the entire game thats the real question within seconds im already seeing the bleak atmosphere stripped right the hell away bright colors are great generally but left just looks like the better game here been watching console run throughs and ubi seems to have taken out all walking npcs cats dogs pigs and people no randomized walking npcs in console versions edit pc versions of the game look lively and good tho original looks better especially the character models still looks better and ill buy it does this remaster fix the boring ass ganeplay character detail fucking ubisoft always doing a mediocre job original looks like water color remastered looks like water color without water 7 years later where is charles lee character detail looks better in the original nice work from ubiis my fav ac is the fps changed because ac3 fps was kind of bad to me this is beautiful also what music is this it sounds vaguely like the prince of egypt this is a joke that which we have seen too disputable result check out the halo2 remastered or call of duty 4 remastered or even the last of us remastered thats what truly called remastered and these games are 60 fps on console not a graphic mod with only 30 fps on console shame on you ubi such a shame guess ill just go play unity again in the connor outfit ive already seen mods for gta 4 and 5 that have improved the game more than this remaster nice music only buy remastered if you never played its basically a version of the game with more saturation and with better lightingnot on the characters though original is fps is able to go up to fps and the remastered is able to go up to 5060 fps thats sad asf why the actual gameplay looks so awesome while the cutscene just looks like shit steps of making the remaster step 1 add saturation step 2 done ps plus free game for november of this year i know it this remastered is worstyou make of joke of ac series very disappointed by ubisoft slightly better textures better water better lightning in interiors and exteriors worse lightning in cutscenes worse view distance better grass model with worse ambient occlusion maybe bug more decent animus effect in social stealthgood change its quite standard remaster remastered very good but only character skin is original better what the heck is wrong with the character models less foggy for the new one thumbs u if u find the orignal verson is better some parts looks better in the remaster and some parts look better in the original still better than batman return to arkham what music did you use for this if dont mind me asking it would be better if they improving the texture quality actually prefer the old style for somewhat reason beside the vegetation 103 npc moves backward instantly as always ubisoft downgrades even remastered games lol ubisoft be downgrading remasters now for me now its similar to unity i like it put a new cc in the game call it remaster winter in the original autumn in the remaster as much as i agree the story is good in this game gameplay mechanics sucks in this game i would rather pay 60 for complete remake of assassins creed 4 black flag with the anvilnext 20 engine or whichever engine was used for unity syndicate mostly improvements but whats up with character detail and lighting at 226 it looks awful 202 in fact remaster itself lacking the ambient occlusion especially on the characters during cutscenes thats why many cutscenes when theres not many light sourcescharacters in shadowwindy weather fight scene on the ship interior cutscenes even theater chat with reginald birch etc looks much worse than original overall new light system looks more modern but that lack of ambient occlusion almost ruins everything so many people are confusing a remaster with remake lol in most parts the original looks better sometimes the remaster we need to uncap the frame rate how can u have 90 fps in that game d lol i have used enbs that look better this is a remaster not a new game on a new engine you people are blind and full of shit it looks great how can i get it on pc black face vs white face the remaster completely destroys the atmosphere in the scenes from the original even the draw distance is somehow made worse and places where it actually improves technically its done very sloppily i think its an obvious win for the original does this run 60fps on base ps4 they gave the original for free uplay i got it because was free i wont buy this remastered because its worthless httpsyoutuberlvwyybhymu gameplay assassins creed 3 remaster very interesting to see in the comments saying that they like the remastered more it clearly is a downgrade overall like it was with all the other ones the game was basically optimized for amd consoles of this generation so they added effects that run well on amd arch people are so dominated that they dont even know how to judge things by themselfs what a joke to call it remaster isnt this the worst assassins creed game according to most people remastered its a rip off because the gameplay is the same only the game looks a bit brighter the cheek of it and devs will say thats it is just artistic choice can someone tell me why they remastered this one instead of the first ac game what a beuatiful song in this video poor and needless remaster baliz go to my jam and about honestlycan someone please tell me if there any remasters not remakes that looks upgraded and better the original seriously most these so called remasters are just plain cash grabs and looks worse than the original this is why i prefer sticking with remakes like yakuza kiwami resident evil 12they deserve every money they get i think assassins creed 3 remastered looks more realistic why didnt they remaster ac i or even ac ii why this tbh i dont care that the graphics werent changed too much i plan on buying the switch release anyways and im sure its not going to be anything special in terms of graphics its crazy they even added hdr but why in the hell they did this all for ac3 btw ubisoft is known for downgrades lol people are expecting a remake from an advertised remaster idiots still a shit game ubisoft doesnt know the meaning of remaster every single game they remaster resulted in over saturated lighting wax skin effect i will definately upload gameplay of this remastered version on my channel toowhen this game was launchedoriginal i had a potato pcso was unable to playnow i have a good laptopso will not miss the chancewill play this 226 look at the shadow on their faces and the texture on that guys shirt on the right original looks better wtf i have the samesetup except i have a rtx 2080 and ur ti version is getting sometimes less than 60fps omg i need to get more gpu power some better but i prefer the originals colour grade assassins creed 3 now with reshade lol remaster capcom would like to have a word with ubisoft about that word textures look better in the original game i dont know why but i prefer the original so they changed the weather lowered the brightness and upped the contrast did they change the season from winterautumn to springsummer how to remaster add more orange okay guys we need to make an ac3 remastered what should we do what if we put it to anvilnext 20 what we used in unity naah dude thats hell of a work i think we should just change the blue to orange turning off ambient occlusion change some very minor stuff and its done yeah its a better plan well make it assassins creed 3 remastered original easy winslol this remaster lookin more like a recolor if someone wanna know the name of background music is age of men jo wandrini dosent worth it nice 40 graphics mod that thumbnail helllllllla ugly in a way the original looks way better just another move by ubisoft to cash grab really embarrassing to publish something like that it looks more like a mod than a remaster it should look at least as good as origins or odyssey such a big company like ubisoft could do a lot more but that would cost money i also do not understand why they remastered assassins creed 3 would part 1 not make much more sense because it is much older assassins creed 3 came out in 2012 echt peinlich sowas zu verffentlichen es sieht mehr aus wie eine mod als ein remaster es sollte mindestens genauso gut aussehen wie origins oder odyssey so eine groe firma wie ubisoft knnte viel mehr machen aber das wrde ja geld kosten ich verstehe auch nicht warum sie assassins creed 3 remasteren wrde teil 1 nicht viel mehr sinn machen weil es deutlich lter ist assassins creed 3 ist 2012 rausgekommen the optomization is so bad omg ac unity runs better lol ok view distance is worse other than that good remaster id say but man they picked the worst game to do it on smh view distance is a joke better lightiling better textures better saturationbetter water water have reflection this is a proper remaster but you guys dont agree because you gotta hate ubisoft red dead redemption 2 better then assasins creed they should rather have spend the time and money to improve the godawful gameplay not bad and not good improved colouring is a difference and improvements in lighting well its not worth the price like for the new game all i can see is new vibrant color filter and some lightning textures 99 the same maybe slightly sharpen i will stick with original which i have this would have been a good remaster if the lighting wasnt so exagerated and the character skins looked as if they were made of plastic its so so definately worth checking out its a solid improvement the lighting changes so the game isnt just grey is a very welcome change disappointed view distance lod arent improved but it looks much better otherwise its more of a mod rather than being a proper remaster it looks much better but by todays standards i dont think it looks good not really a big difference but its certainly an improvement to the original updated version has very nice colours compared to the sad and gloomy original so only better lighting and every thing else is the same if not even worse than the origional ubisoft actually outdid themselves with this remaster most game remasters are just bad but this one is actually amazing not bad not bad at all shitty remaster for shitty game so its the same damn thing better then original the only difference is the remastered version is brighter first fuck this is one of those times where the remaster somehow looks worse than the original this game barely works pretty much unplayable finally i am enjoying to be in boston with 60 fps everything high in full hd thank you if you want to bring the prince of persia franchise back to its former glory then why dont you remaster the sands of time trilogy with it being capped at 60 frames per second then use the profits from the remastered trilogy and invest in making a new prince of persia game that is unique and has an epic story to it this remaster is a joke the other part of meis the outsider i know remastered was not that big deal but seriously it fills a special energy inside my body as i see connor and that song connor really have faced so much suffocations but he still gets back on his feet nowadays assassin like bayek alexios and that jacub didnt got that potential how do you use ubisoft club points for this on switch i cant find it ac black flag ac rogue ac3 and ac unity i prefer this saga over the first 4 games they just changed the light they called that remastered ubisoft didnt has magic spear and game graphic sucks this the revolution ubisoft ubisoft we made the assasin creed 3 and earn millions we remastered the assasin creed 3 and game dont be good but we do bad bullshit remastergo suck gays dick and lesbians pussy fucking ubisoft i remember when i had to hold rightclick and space to run now all i need to do is press shiftthings have changed but i think that the controls are way easier since my mouse has gotten demolished from holding right click to long from ac 1 to revelations damn my favorite ac games 1 ac3 2 ac2 3 ac revelations 4 ac unity 5 ac brotherhood 6 ac1 really one of the most boring games which i have ever seen played its not yellow yall just got night shift on i really think black flag needs to be remastered i want it to look good as it did in the trailer we need another game about connor not remastered so ubisoft why dont my graphics look this good hmmmm its rwby no its ac3r good game ubisoft is cool lil be able to play on ps4 you guys have downgraded the game ubisoft a sincere fan of the series they need to remaster assassin creed 1 alot of negative comments on steam about this is it rly that bad the worst remastered game of this year ac3 was pretty good done when it came out now you just destroyed with this graphics long live the greed ahh creed it would be nice a remaster to assassins creed 4 black flag or assassins creed revelations or brotherhood next sepia remastered this is worst remaster orignial ac 3 trailer is better for me still bad remaster something we like black flack update the guifreerunning ac 2 on odyssey engine of course without making it rpg game and making eagle vision truly eagle 030 before noticing that they just added a yellow filter i swear i couldnt tell which was the original game like they are both ugly ass low res texture footages its way worse theb it looks guys best part of ac its 3 good animation and variations of moves remasters suck and they are pretty useless a remake does give the the gold old game a new makeup nah its make it a whole ing new game remasters are generally boring and are no advancement in gameplay at all if they could remake all previous games before unity with unitys awesome movement parkour its graphics jesus that would be a preorder and a ing insta buy ac3 remastered is boring and stale it does not give new life to the game it does feel like a cheap mod if ubi even allowed moders to make advancement remake ac 14 with unity animations movement graphics ta da youve got ing must play games you may call that assassins creed desmond collection would ing love to replay such a gorgeous real remake not a boring mediocre remaster for comparison resident evil 2 remake is what it is about to replay a old game i see no remaster here all i see is that they add yellow colourand they wan money for this i can do that remaster by myself all i need to do is turn on night mode and there you have it nice cheap remaster i wont fall for this ubisoft no sir 20 gb day one patch idiots wow it actually looks alot nicer i was skeptical but now im sold nice work but i dont have 30 bucks to spend on a game i already have wow charles beard and hair looks so good ac4 come on its such a good game okay guys we need to make an ac3 remastered what should we do what if we put it to anvilnext 20 what we used in unity naah dude thats hell of a work i think we should just change the blue to orange turning off ambient occlusion change some very minor stuff and its done yeah its a better plan well make it ubisoft i need remastered ac 1 ac 2 ac brotherhood prince of persia sot ww ttt ac 3 offical launch trailer was better how is it the games graphics look way better in the trailer than the original game that i just started playing thought there will be no glitches in this one but i thought wrong i was just in the first sequence fixing the mast ropes and helping a friend whos hanging on the top i was sitting on the mast while suddenly haytham seemed to fly to the sky right before the cutscene happens where the fool falls down holding a rope and we got 30 seconds to help him and the second one was when the assasins creed scout reveals himself and fights haytham i countered his strikes while standing in front of a barrel to smash his face in and it just spawned us a bit to the left before the smashing happened almost like haytham had the power of teleportation wow ubisoft you really wont change your trademark glitches ever right i wish ubisoft would do a complete graphical overhaul and start from scratch on a new engine on their remasters like 343 did with the anniversary halo games imo slightly sharper textures and a different saturation level arent worth rebuying the game for kinda disappointing lol so we should pay for the texture update what 60 go fuck yourself ubisoft looks the same but with better lighting this gave me hella goosebumps plzz make a mobile version of it mobiles are becoming fast id buy if the unity parkour mechanics were integrated good old times this looks and sounds like a 90s movietrailer xdd i really hated the greek assassins creed so glad its back now i finally have a reason to buy a ps4 yo this game plot and protagonist fuckin sucks looks just like a bit different light to me so what about multiplayer 11years for tiny improved shame assassins creed iii enb edition this remaster is a joke looks like ubisoft is running out of ideas i just want this but with black flag so they remastered the worst game in the franchise are you serious ubi lmfao same shit with different smell add sepia tones everywere and some light rays what about characters leave as is yeay desmond remastered the best ac game and its remastered i will definitely buy new pc free download httpsyoutubehqg6whuahns assassins creed 3 human revolution next remaster 2 i hope they managed to remaster connors bland character who ask for this assassins creed 3 remas no wait its recolored assassins creed 3 now avaible in yellow rediscover assassins creed 3 more yellow than ever before and i am back to playing assassins creed odyssey this is cracked today but seriously why ac3 and not ac1 first it was too cold now its too damn hot ok y would they remaster the worst ever ac game in the history of ac games they shouldve remastered ac 2 ubisoft is gonna sell an ac reshade this game has a pretty good story but not the best presentation of said story and i feel like the game is buried beneath mediocre mechanics and very often awful mission design but i think thats trademark of this series ac4 was the same this game needed a remake imo not a remaster a remaster for almost full price might as well play the pc version with a reshade instead remastered and downgraded prior to release lol pointless remake many other games out there deserves remaking which would be perfect like assassins creed 1 and 2 not 3 call of duty 2 delta force black hawk down rainbow siege vegas 2 resident evil 3 and 4 dead space 1 battlefield 3 and many epic other games lol modders could do a way better job xd ac3orange edition so fucking excited for this this has always been and will always be my favourite ac game and im happy to see it get remastered and hopefully introduced to people who never got the chance to play it back then so i purchased season pass for ac odyssey with i get ac 3 and liberation but do i get the dlc make ubisoft great again why in the fuck do you remaster assassins creed 3 but not brotherhood or assassins creed 2 do we need to have ac odyssey to have this omfg im so excited bloom and motion blur gonna have to turn that last one off anyway this game had me hooked i couldnt stop playing it i really hope i get the same feeling this time again nowadays days a lot games is not realistic i hate this connor is definitely the most lethal and coolest combatant out of the series protagonists hey ubisoft heres an idea for your ac team stop using the witchers combat system and go back to what you had in these games i love your combat system and while witcher style or dark souls roll and slash play is ok its nothing to what you guys had you made the character feel epic now he just feels boring and generic i love the archery system youve developed but please lose the hitpoints system it really detracts from the games ac3 remaster with multiplayer mode only people who played ac 3 on ps 3 knows tha t tha t the grafic from remastered edition is normal like i played it i remember how it was loking they just low the grafic on ac 3 on low and compare it with same game but with hight grafic gj ubisift now you losed 1 good fan black flag remaster optimize it better and remove the fps cap ty will it launch in physical media please return to do games like this enough to do rpgs like the actual assassins creed why is it so yellow we need ac1 remake not remastred they remastered my favorite assassins creed thanks ubisoft still a better ac game than origins and odyssey wait which one is the remastered version this game came out when i was 8 years old cant wait to play it again nintendo switch why charles smith best assassins creed game was ac4 and ac3 literally no one asked for give ac2 a remaster so exited i loved this game it was by far my favourite would love to spar with my son i am sorry ezio please dont cry everythings gonna be alright we need ac1 remastered plz ubisoft i know its a 10 yrs old game but its worth it because its the best assassins creed game in the whole series in my opinion one of the worst ac games and they remaster it xd gj ubi nice now we need is assassins creed 1 i wonder how good the present day missions will look with these graphics well this game will make ac fans happy now is there also multiplayer it seems they use the light system from the early days of rainbow six in 57 looking forward to this in my opinion assassins creed 3 was the best from the old assassin ls creed games cant wait to play it i miss the brawler fighting style an my hidden blade the soundtrack is one of the best ever created magnificent the story was my favourite one too definitely going to play it so many good memories coming up again thank you ubisoft at least make desmond outfit great now can we get watch dogs remaster far cry 4 remaster rainbow six siege remaster tom clancys division remaster thatd be great umm what about ac1 what about the ezio trilogy why the fucking fuck are you remastering this one its such a cheap remaster intead of these bell and whistle graphical updates how about u give us actual gameplay improvements give a crouch button free aimok i know its there make those blinding white loading and transitions black colour and improve the brain dead enemy ai whistle anywhere not just from cover these are what the game needs not yellow sunlight and more orange clothes why cant people in the comments ever be happy 3 was the best 60fps on ps4 yeah the iii the best i really dont like how they under advertised rogue remastered and it left alot of people saying the graphics look exactly the same but i watched a comparison vid and it looks so much better do they still have the op block and kill gameplay why not add the new horse model also the old one looks derp that was one of the worst games of the franchise ubisofti hope ac 1 ac revelation remake the parkour style now with orange light all this can be yours for just 4 easy payments of 2999 why not ac2 it was far more loved than ac3 ac2 and ac1 deserve the remake first when the fuq are you going to give us a good gameplay footage to those who are excited you forget this is where the desmond story line ended with all due respect ubisoft not quite a successful choice remastering this game plus not much added detial that meets the eye after playing odyssey and experiencing a very real ai in movement socializing horse riding and fighting also enjoying exhilarating graphics you want us to plunge into the past and play this all over again i sighed man the moment ive completed the campaign of this game and wished id never play it again it is very boring redundant filled with bugs and glitches plus the whole main story is just dull plus this games ai and graphics compared to odyssey would look rather cartoonish foolish i couldnt play this game twice after ive finished it back in 2012 not much to look at in both cities at that time of the century boston was nice to walk in and enjoy its atmosphere but nyc was horrible if you wanted us to be blasted into the past for a very unique experience why dont you consider remastering ac ii brotherhood revelations or uni im more excited about this than the new games makeassassinscreedstealthagain unpopular opinion but this is my favourite ac game from his ancestry to his personality i was able to relate to connor more than any other protagonist from this series one of the better ones this is loved it will it run 10fps this is awesome and ive been a assassins creed fan since i was 45 and i love this game also it would be awesome if you could remake or remaster the ezio games the worst ac protagonist fuck yess i need this still play this to this day i cant freaking wait you just made an ac fan finally happy ubisoft do you know if there will be online just download sweetfx lmao i watched my friend play ac as a kid but never played it the first acs myself will i enjoy the game or is it more nostalgia for old players ps recently made a gaming comeback after 8 years and bought ps4 and ac odyssey and loved it but i realize that they are not the same type of games kinda do damm exited this is my favourite assassins creed i hope they fixed the countless glitches and bugs wow ac3 is getting an enb but this time you can have it on consoles assassins creed iii color grading remastered ubisoft love money too much the only time when ubisoft did a good thing i really miss the multiplayer the best ac so it just worse graphics we only assassins creed the firstremastered then we got them all in this trailer we can see that this gane includes assassins creed liberation remastered ok on season pass of assassins creed odyssey assassins creed 3 remaster is included if i buy season pass of odyssey will i receive liberations remaster why not remake this look ugly i was just talking about brotherhood remastered i hope thats comming soon graphics 2x better bugs and glitches 10x more i hate the graphices preordered this shit straight away best story line is ezios remaster that shit ubisoft 012 016 say that now as a white male and the left will call you xenophobic and try to completely ruin your life maybe even try to lynch you will i get remastered version if i have assassins creed 3 buyed from steam on the switch its probably gonna look like the original tho will there be also a remastered version of assassins creed 1 2 nice you made it yellow what about the online please say online is back as well the good old assassins creed i stopped playing after syndicate hope one day ubisoft goes back to its roots i better play witcher 3 than the new wannabes what was the point for making a remaster of ac3 wow do all firts 4 ac remasterd plz please remake assassins creed 1 with same story or different story or backstory on different universe also remaster assassins creed 2 they picked a strange one to remaster they did an amazing job tbh it looks really good this part of my life its called happinness i would love to see full remake of original and first assassins creed game thx ubi this is my favorite parts of assassins creed first assassins creed game i played best assassins creed game i ever played this game is the game i will remember till my death they should make another sequel for connor they could of developed his character more many people say that conner wasnt a good character well fuck them having a native american assassin really made me happy and they also say that he was too bland too monotone but your talking about a native who witnessed the cruelty of the white man they burned down his community and killed his mother so if you were expecting an ezio or an altiar well too bad theyre gone and thats final also conner is one of the most badass assassins id say one below ezio yeah it better include the aztec temple mission this isnt a remaster they just fucking made it more yellow and bloomed everything xd that series died with desmond the only assassins creed i couldnt stop playing they remastered the worst old gen assassins creed lmao is it too much to ask fucking ac 2 remastered why dont they show gameplay for it my first assassins creed this was my favourite ac maybe you did remember on developing this remaster what you forget these days is this coming to pc do you really call that remastered ha it only color changes i promise when they do assassins creed 4 remaster i will instant preolder it because in my option is it best ac game i ever play thanks ubisoft now well be able to play ac iii with instagram filters and remastered bugs already have it in my library im waiting ubisoft you can do it better tbh i could never go back to the counter gameplay one button assassin 29 3 i will be there the best assassins creed remastered this and black flash for me was the best assassins crees but iv completes them both and have them both and i dont think remasters is much different all they do is just bloom the game so everything looks brighter and a bit more colourful no graphics improvement at all imo some of that good clean golden hour action going on here what a fucking bitch ubisoft releasing this shit remastered version fora2012 game that has game every year and no new splinter cell since 2013 or a new pop since 2010 what ajoke this was my favorite game on the ps3 cant wait to play it on ps4 witch better graphics ty ubisoft the game isnt that old yet i missed by connor and haythem please add photo mode and option to change the time of the day i got a qustion those who got assassins creed 3 in steam will enjoy the remastred without buying a new one right like rougue whats next assassins creed ww1 the games i would like to see remastered 1assassin creed iv black flag 2prince of persia the two thrones remake and i would also like to see the ending of the prince of persia2008 story the remaster is only for graphics if the fighting is still a piece of shit the tomahawk looked cool in the trailer but you had to hit the enemy 6 times to kill him and the economoy how you getting money is still shit too than no need to play withthis game was so much waste black flag made it perfect what they started with this game shit l brought 2 two versions of the game pc because my mum took the first one then she just give it back after 3 years life and now theres this come on good lord my favorite just found out it came with my copy of odyssey thank you for bringing back 3 ubi highly underrated does this mean theyre bringing back the old controls okay remaster number 1 or the ezio collection but this one why its rubbish its the worst of the lot i cant see this doing well at all omg this is my favourite episode please add connors speech at the end that you deleted we are still waiting a far cry 3 remastered sorry for my english ac 3 a beautiful mess of a game that couldnt decide what it wanted to be jheeez this my favourite game me and my homie used to play hours on hours on this at his house the old xbox 360 this is true memories wow a orange filter great remastered edition this part the best connor kenway is the best assassin of assassin cred waiting for remastered bar fight with haytam and connor im so glad this will be on switch pre order already open too for everyone acii have a remastered in the ezio collection stop ask i hope this ac3 lets us choose to keep connors hood up assasins creedbluelight filter edition release day is the election day in turkey lol ubisoft i bring you a remaster its called god rays slow clap clap anyone know what the price will be thank you so much ubisoft for this remastered the real question is when will i be able to pre order 034 look at this dude its going to be downgraded to the original real ac start 2007 but end 2011 this is not ac origin and od are fkin rpg not ac assassins creed ezio collection remastered 20 ubi do you can make such games is now not like odessy my favourite ac games 1 ac 4 black flag 2 ac 3 3 ac revelations 4 ac brotherhood 5 ac 2 6 ac 1 can you remake black flag great a remastered game which looks worse than the original the only pro to this is they havent charged 40 but im still thinking if a new game is in the 40s then how does a remastered get close to that they havent had to do much to it and its great they added the dlcs for free but its clear they are running out of ideas so they are now remastering games because they need time i brought origins gold edition and found it to be a pile of crap i felt like i was playing street fighter some simulator game and another thing added in for the sake of it i didnt even bother getting the new one and before i got my xbox 1 i did go back trying to complete the game but i dont understand why they couldnt just join all the places together instead of the stupid travelling and the loading screens after everything if you guys want to play ac 3 remastered now then simply tun on the blue light filter i hope after odyssey ubisoft comes back with the left over story with connor trkler her yerdeyiz burdayiz beyler el sallayin i got mixed opinions of this i know for sure it will be like the ezio collection only change is a filter it has the same bugs same glitches and ubisoft basically forces you to make a uplay account if you want the dlc i would only consider in buying it if it is cheap this is one of my favorite assassins creed games despite people saying connor was boring at least he was an assassin black flag was fun in gameplay but you were more of a pirate then an assassin in that game also this was last game to have desmond and an actual modern day with missions where you play as desmond in the modern day instead of a cave with emails in origins which is really disappointing should have remastered ac2 instead but most importantly will it have that encyclopaedia trophyachievement this time the good days of assassins creed i would love black flag to be remastered for anyone thats truly interested they just ported the pc version to the latest generation of consoles and added a yellow tint thanks i love assassins creed 3 out of all the old assassins creed games why this one why not the second one they should make a origin game about achilles davenport that would be interesting brotherhood para cuando assassins creed games went downhill after black flag tbh especially the last 2 games werent assassins creed in my oppinion i think 13 and in games like brotherhood were the stuff assassins creed ii is better i hope that ubisoft finally let us see connors differently dyed robes in cutscenes now i see far cry primal graphics i miss time when ac games had unique and awesome soundtracks best assassins creed ever being assassins creed odyssey onto nintendo switch aswell btw assassins creed 3 is coming out on nintendo switch in may why not first game you can develope it mechanics better fight better speed run better graphics for best game ever after black flag assasins creed became ass other than the graphics it just went downhill like if u agree 2012ac3 e3 trailer most reastic 2012 actual gameplay grey color 2019yellow colour you guys are wasting time instead of ac3 u can do for asssins creed ezio story full in one game or separatly remaster ac 3 is vvv dope honestly ac ezio chronical is best so i suggest ubisoft to remaster alls favourate ac ezio story finally its coming once upon a time we had a great sequel called assassins creed then desmond miles died and took the assassins with him my question is whats the price how i know ubisoft it will cost around 50 euros i wonder if the pc version is gonna be on epic or steam getting this on the switch iframe width964 height542 srchttpswwwyoutubecomembed9iupdcucfk4 frameborder0 allowaccelerometer autoplay encryptedmedia gyroscope pictureinpicture allowfullscreeniframe httpsyoutube9iupdcucfk4t12 whats the song pleaaase 3 i finished the game 6 years ago is there any reason to play it again even if its in 4k make assassin creed 2 and 4 remastered released in steam or uplay i hate conor is that wrong its probably cuz i read haythams diaries and loved him and was kinda mad when he killed him it isnt remastered it is graphic assassins creed 3 for playstation 3 i have ac 3 can i play remastered for free will this be at least native 4k or what this game brings some good memories rip ac funny how this old game is still a much better game than crackdown 3 in 2019 now if only it was any good as a game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdzimxbb3guq yo is there multiplayer when ea needs money remaster a game and the dumb community shall follow just why i hope the interface does not screw up i need to buy it again goodbyee odyssey hellooow my old love assian creed 1 pls davenport homestead 3 please let us choose to put the hood in the endgame i love ubisoft for this long time fan of ac i screamed got yelled at and well now cant wait absolutely buzzing well done ubisoft im pretty curious on how ac3 liberation remastered is gonna look on ps4 pro to be honest it never really looked that good for me so im having high hopes its gonna reach a graphical level similar to ac3 whos getting this on switch graphics look a bit off on switch getting this for the nintendo switch ty ubisoft now i will rerun the game 100 times we an assassins creed 1 open world and a quest to the grail or something related to the crusades that would be just waw it was impossible playing dlc on pc what about that ubisoft rediscover assassins creed iii as never before am colour blind bro leave the good shit where it belongs i didnt even like this game when it first came out until i played it properly why dont you guys remastered ac ii remake ac i with good story only americans like this game no switch ratonhnhakton is back where is charles lee nothing is gray everything is yellow good ok well but a big but with one t obviously you should have given an earlier access to people who bought ac odyssey ultimate edition thats all a little bit exclusive it should be we need ac 2 remastered not this yellow crap wtf ubisoft i want a remake of assassins creed with altair check my tribute to him httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9vqwzfrzbhy we really need black flag remastered we need remaster of ac 3 ubi just make it yellow lol finally a right coihce with ac series 333 not the f rpg ones like origins and odysey witch take me a lot of hacking cause is no way in hell im gonna grind that much i have a lifeand when we are talking about ac the truth is all i want i a nice gameplay like the ones before origins and more important than that is a story a story what i will remember all my life and i will look back and think how great ac are why remaster the game with the badest story better grafics dont compensate bad storycharakters why remastered looks worse than original i wait remastered with add all new things because ac 3 was not end project and now we see ugly scenes in original ac3 was real atmosphere and what we have now only new yellow color its must have name recolored not remasterd so now the sun is everywhere nice what the hell i just bought unity ok now remaster the ezio collection and give arno a sequel and well forgive you for far cry 6 which side is remastered one left or right and wil the requirements stays the same cuz i have a potato pc now ac1 please thank you ubisoft just fix the bugs please this will be cool what have you smoked ubisoft i respect you but we asked for upgrades not downgrades remaster prince of persia next omg this is my favourite game of the franchise reeeeeeee i like how they make assassins creed rogue remastered shit and assassins creed 3 looks like a new fucking game one of the most boring acs for sure 6 chapters to start playing as conor but btw i love the war against england i want assassins creed 2 remarstered not 3 i bought rdr2 hitman2 alot of fkn games i should have waited this is the best game ever this is low even for ubisoft really is that a joke there is no difference just yellow or orange screen filter why dont ubisoft dont do just like resident evil 2 remake or atleast make it like ac odyssey style im still waiting for a prince of persia and a japan ac as for now thank you ubisoft ill gladly play this till then anyone else also craving for the remastered aciii coming home tv spot its very fucking yellow where is the subject of all seeries assassins creed a new game is so bad without topic but have a goot graffics i am dissapointed for you remastered yellow will there be a multiplayer mode in my opinion this was and will always be the best assassins creed game ever made the story the upgraded engine from ubisoft more variety of things to do in freeroam the multiplayer was pretty fun aswell soundtrack is amazing this will always be my favourite ac game of all time day one buy on nintendo switch the direct needs to happen already still the best creed to date please bring these kind of games back drop that rpg shit can assassin creed be done with that animus and abstergo thing let it be a franchise dedicated to solely the history part not modern and past mixed together thats why ac series never appealed to me ive played 2 4 and rogue the modern day sequences are the worst parts for me it just doesnt seem fitting in a game with setting in the 1500s having a high tech looking game menu coming from the 2100s this is why i like the recent origins and odyssey more than the classic ones ubisoft cut out a huge modern day bullshit and get me straight into the past if future ac titles are still going with the animus abstergo thing then fine but at least dont make it look like a futuristic game design the ui and the game menu appropriate with the time period the game sets in no loading screen with a historical character running in a endless computer field thingy it kills the fuckin atmosphere i love it my favorite ac game getting the love it deserves but i really hope they will do like bethesta and give us collectors we who have the game and all other ac games with dlc and in my case statues the game for free please dont make us buy the game for full price that would just be a moneygrab man im so happy that so many people agree that this how assassinscreed shouldve stayed and not the new history rpg simulators garbage we re getting since ac odyssey like doesnt ubisoft listen to its fanbase first you kill of desmond ok breath then first person working in film industry ok cuz gameplay was still assassins type but odyssey gtfo ubisoft this game was so damn good except the distance to get to a mission a real assassins creed game not this gladiator bullshit origins cool game this is so awesome this is one of my favorite assassins creed game i cant choose between 3 and 4 btw this was also my very first assassins creed game i remembered back in the days that i was so happy to own this game for the wii u many many many years later i rebuy it for the pc i am definitely going to buy this again for the pc i only wish that this game will get a nintendo switch port to wont run on my potato pc unfortunately anyone have any idea how much is it going to cost on playstation store when released thanks in advance this game is gold i played the game 5 times and still i want to play it we want ezios trilogy remaster on pc this is not hard to understand ubisoft lmao everything is orange i love you you are my bae heres an idea ubisoft why dont you actually finish connors story with a releasedevelopment of ac v instead of making these mediocre rpg rip offs how about you finish what you started connor is probably the best and most realistic character you have created that you dropped just because of a bunch of uneducated loud mouths who werent happy they didnt get to suck edzios dick again the lighting does look better but the hair and faces left alot to be desired thank you ubisoft my favorite game so more yellow is it just me who only has the old games and will never buy the new ones because the ones are a tad bit shit one of my favorite games shame that the main character was so shit he went from a nice indian guy to some selfish prick who hates everyone and doesnt really know what he wants to achieve instead of the graphics he should be remastered still no switch version please assassins creed mobile please i hope black flag gets a remaster one dayi thoroughly enjoyed the time period and thatthe weirdness of the newer acs i enjoy but think it doesnt often fit welli enjoy the newer combat system more though which i think would work well in black flag my fave route game in the world being remastered im tearing up its better dyssey justice77777777harmonica elect israel assassinos d terre vivit 7777777 i hope that they will fix that fucg black edge of map xd please make indian history related ac there you have many stories just better lighting and high res textures is not remastered this is madness dammit another game i have to buy rip bank do assassins creed assassins creed 2 assassins creed brotherhood and revelations next please finally i loved this on ps3 so much the hunting the climbing trees everything thank you so much ubisoft thank you thanks you ubisoft for the whole assassins creed the best game hands down please remaster odyssey so the gfx are comparable to wildlands improved mechanics well im definitely interested so you remaster 3 but you dont remaster assassins creed 2 wtf are you doing ubisoft my favourite ac by far cant wait to play it again ea should follow ubisoft and do this with need for speed most wanted still think ac2 was the best one though i had the most fun with brotherhood and revelations since you had an improved fighting system and more stuff to use dunno why we get a remastered of 3 though it wasnt a bad game for 4 i didnt like it at all when i wanted a ac game but when i one year later or so played it again and tried to not see it as an ac game it was truly awesome even 100 it original has better graphics why ac3 that game flopped listen ubi we want ac4 remastered this is ubisofts best game ever made they needed to do it long time ago making a autumn sphere into a spring climate with that lighting best ac game ever im so happy this is comming and also can you add a chrouch button i passed my history test thanks to this game open case is coming why not remasted ac 2 what the fuck this remastered ac iii have the same graphics this is actually the most excited ive been for an assassins creed game since ac unity ubisoft really underestimate how loved connor is by the old school fans of the series we need a sequel to his story we want a sequel to connors story the same way we got a complete ezio story hmm im sorry but that color is just so horrible i can see the little details you put in but why change so drasticaly the color grading big pass for me because the remaster is not gonna change the stupid story and ending nice work ubisoft 126 liberation remastered looks nice d ooooooooooo yeah give 1000 likes for that now you can do one of then with a native brasilian or various caracthers in diferent times of history like the last battlefields with one descendant of then in present and put people from the places where the history is passing to dub we wouldnt like if a nordestino speak as a southeastern i hated how connor survives musket shots in this game as if hes hit by a paintball when will they realize ac needs a hardcore difficulty mode i want to see if the npcs are still an issues if you dont recall they pop in and out of the game freeze for a second then start there animations or worse change into a different npc model just look httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvoppzgawc2c optional objectives werent that hard people is just too dumb and lazy naval warfare was truly epic and it felt like a real battle ai sucked thats true most awesome and badass combat moves ever best soundtrack ever made good story questions about morality and righteousness has a lot of flaws and bugs but tell me what game hasnt personally it felt that it was unfinished but truly one of the best of the series i wish they would upgrade the textures but ill settle for the lighting bought the gold edition for odyssey on lunar sale just for this assassin creed 3 navel combat was the best in the series change my mind and switch who playing assasin creed 3 in 2019 this soundtrack guyslegendary assassins cras death rip 20072013 when you dont have a game and ideas for this year remastered or not connor is still a rude jerk this game is not old enough for a remaster is still looks good on pc they should have remastered splinter cell chaos theory instead counterfeit 104 plz tell me thats the original version at 109 it sounds like charles from rdr2 when he says no lmao anyone else remember holding a button just to move smoothly through a crowd without knocking a pot out of someones hands miss the old assassins creed games honestly not a big differenceat certain points the original is bettera remake would do the trick not a remastered ac 4 black flag remaster better come out soon im getting this shit as soon as it comes out at the

liberation is my favorite ac game and now we need assassins creed 1 remasterd a remastered altair xx guys i need to ask a question about speding my time at ac rogueits free at xbox live is the game worth my time we need to view desmonds death on 2 time c remastered for assassin creed 1 ever read the comments and feel like they are paid accounts or ubisofts own employees i think this might better in grey instead of total orange i waited years for this so mutch thanks ubisoft whats with the yellow filter nah fuq it ill pass same bullst with better graphics very nice tactic for earning easy and quick money eh no thanks bugisoft where is the dislike button hmm ubisoft let me give you some ideas if you want money remake the 1st and ezio trillogy with some new mechanics that origins and odyssey have look at how much money capcom made with re2 remake even i preorder re 2 remake and im not the kind of guy that usually preorder games thanks for making a good game to a jondis infected game yeallow ac3 so fricken excited to play this one of the greatest games remastered nice game now ac 3 where is lee edition is coming out does anyone know in the remaster if we will be able to put the hood back on will there be fps drop in boston connor seriously altair would have been a better idea i miss connor so much i hope they really fixed a major problems dyed outfits who do not appears in cutscene the best assassins 1 desmond 2 altar 3 connor best assassins creed games 1 assassins creed iii 2 assassins creed 3 assassins creed revelations if ubisoft is reading this comment then please make assassins creed remake or an assassins creed game that includes all assassins creed games and a new one in it why not a remake ubisoft learn from re2 odessey left the chat i cant understand why people hate connor i know ezio was truly amazing and it was hard to switch from him to connor but players must do the seperation of their characteristics and difference connors story is heartbreaking and full of sadness i dont know about you but i feel some strange connection with him and his personality good to see him again with better graphics i dont really understand why did they add this weird orange tint to the game graphics i liked the more natural way the original game looked can somebody explain to me the rationale behind it this game was my first ps3 game looking forward to getting the platinum ubisoft ur my favorite studio for games ur amazing wow this is so cool they are remastering this game because they really ran out of ideas for a new assassins creed game milking the franchise more and more and making money by anyway possible so we have acrogue acezio trilogy and ac3 remasters would be a big middle finger if they didnt remaster ac1 dont you think yesyesyesyes ubi youre doing it right adds shader calls it remastered why ac3 and not ac2 because murica well it would be better if you would make new missions and what happened to connor re2 remake is the best i cant wait to play the alternative history dlc where i get to run around with my ghostly wolf pack and kill blue coats do so to brotherhood aswell while youre at it unisoft we want remake for assassins creed 1 please im from algeria btw thanks ubisoft for offering a masterpiece i would have preferred ac4 remastered tbh why did u not make assassins creed 2 remastered fool ubisoft assassins creed 3 was the worst of all and u are making a remastered version of it assassins creed 2 was the best assassins creed game ever why dont u make assassins creed 2 remastered why dont remaster ac2 unpopular opinion but this is my favourite ac good things are comming to this franchise and aciiir is a step in that direction so assassins creed us back in old style so am i when you run out of new ideas i love you ubisoft my life is back daammmn yeaahh finally a real ac game not new but i am sure its better than fuckin origins and odessey unassassin creed assassin creed 3 is the best assassin creed ubisoft 2007 we must delete crossbow because of historical precision 2019 ac oddysey here you go pegasus fire swords electric swords sad but true assassins creed 3 is one of my favorite games but i dont think a remaster was necessary not now at least finally assassins creed has come to ps4 thanks ubisoft for just fucking changing gamma in game assassins creed iii remastered play the same game again but with cpu at 100 usage all the time removedenuvo could just download an enb sweetfx and could get better results and more free space will it have a battle royale mp mode cant wait for the tetris remaster as for this game i remember it as being decent at the time i also remember that the opening act of the game was better than everything that followed as the baddie that you briefly initially play as was much much more charismatic and engaging than the dull as dishwater character you ended up stuck with thank you for this game do it for ac2 ac odyssey is better you should make one for ac 1 in the future yellow filter ac 1 should be remastered yellow remastered please remaster ac 2 and brotherhood are we going to play the same missions xd make trilogy ezio remastered here we go another bad optimizated assasins creed which you will not have 4k 60 fps even with rtx remake ac 1 when wil assaassins creed 3 remastered release what happened to the shadows and face textures during the cutscenes o a true a remaster is resident evil 2 who remembers rogues remaster absolutely shi looks a bit yellowish to me cant wait who else loves the way connor runs it would be better for 2 part made remaster its the same game with a different graphic assassins creed 2 remasterno they should make a stalin dlc best fighting in ac history is back also remaster far cry 3 so the kenneway series should be played like this ac blackflag ac freedomcry ac rouge ac 3 ac liberation ac unity not worth the money another unoptimised ubisoft shit is coming can he wear other outfits like the ubisoft club with coins i will buy this game again because no one els will a random guyall is so yellow now i dont like it much better then rogue remastered throws away odessy and buys ac 3 remastered now this is a game thank its wellwell game thank assassins creed 1 remake will be a god choice i dont get it this game already looks good to begin with why make a remaster of this i believe assassins creed 1 needs a remaster better have the ezio trilogy as remake not remastered remastered assassins creed 2 assassins creed 3 instagram yellow filter finally its coming what a time to be alive altair deserves a remaster for his greatness remastered for 6 years old game srsly maybe rockstar needs to create gta v remastered pepelaugh now all we need is an ac 1 with just upgraded graphics similar to that of unity and id be a happy man assassins creed battle royal mmorpg super fps game give players remaster of craping 1st assassin creed lets be real tho who is going to play liberation i hope you also fix all the fucking bugs from the original version my father left those for me mother father i am sorry i have failed you both i made a promise to protect our people i thoughti thought if i could stop the templarsif i could keep the revolution free from their influencethat those i supported would do what was right they didi supposedo what was right what was right for them as for you father i thought i might unite us that we would forget the past and forge a better future in time i believed you could be made to see the world as i did to understandbut it was just a dream this too i should have known were we not meant to live in peace then is that it are we born to argue to fight so many voices each demanding something else it has been hard at times but never harder than today to see all i worked for perverted discarded forgotten you would say i have described the whole of history father are you smiling then hoping i might speak the words you long t best combat game in this series i knew this was coming why ac 3 and not ac 2 whose idea was this i hope they so black flag next so its practicly the same game but better graphic lets just say i didnt play ac 3 so i should wait for this or play the old one ubisoft needs remastered not its games ac 3 with ac unity graphics yess yess this game deserved so much more than the hate it received i absolutely love this game must be the ac that i most played besides black flag ubisoft please for the love of god please fix the bug in that mission in washingtons dlc first episode the one where you have to bait the dogs but it wont let you finish and you get stuck in the bushes please fix it i need to play this remaster entirely with the love it deserves lol whats the point kinda hoping ubisoft do ac3 similar to the re2 remake change lil bits of storygameplay here and there and make the game that little bit better than the original nothing is grey everything is yellow im very happy when i knew that i can play ac iii in my computer and then there is a remastered version im sad now my computer doesnt compatible again yo theyre fucking doing it im so hyped yayyy this game was the end of the assassins creed franchise in a good way prove me wrong higher resolution textures heck yeah the brown filter no thanks the scene in harbour looks infinitely better in the original this should be an update to the original and not a remastered oh fuck yeah dude my favourite game of all time is going to be back can i finally fight the redcoat army on the battlefield like in the trailer or will i still get desynced sorry that im whining but why not ac 2 or brotherhood these 2 games were the best of the entire series think im gonna cry miss you ac i had 3 on xbox 360 gave it away but im definitely getting this thanks ubisoft thank god they did this man this was the real ac series btw if u make remastered of the ezio ones i am going to give my soul to the fucking devil ubisoft you are beautiful you have made a repairman from my best part well that is not rpg why not ac 2 i like ac iii but why dont you remake ac ii oh man this is suck and dont tell me yll add this microtransactions new graphics but old bugs its still look much better than odyssey next fix unity please the new title of this remastered is assassins creed iii yellow shader i dont see any point to remaster ac 3 since the original looks good even today it would have made more sense to remasterremake ac1 or 2 assasins creed 1 remastered assassins creed iii yes thank you so much hmm is cool but l want see remastered assassins creed 2 the best part of this franchises i think i am not alone notice how they dont compare close up cutscenes and suddenly a wild yellow filter appears thank god for reshade pls add some cameo of shay patrick cormac can somebody say whats the name of the track while connor is having his monologue about being an outsider this was the last as i played and i think it was 5 years ago im definitely gonna buy this for the nostalgia cant wait for it the best assassins creed game ever assassins creed iii in sepia the original version looks better than the remastered version what how many fools can i kill todaaayyyy i need assassins creed 2 remastered xd best assassins creed ever so a new yellow assassins creed 7 years achilles let me tell you connor life is not a fairytale and there are no happy endings and the soundtrack stops playing connorno not when men like are left in charge and the inspiring soundtrack starts playing once more damn its been 7 years but still its one of the most inspiring games it maybe boring a bit but connors story is very inspiring from its soundtrack to its ending it teaches us to never lose hope even in the darkest depressing times one of the most underrated games ever made i remember playing aciii till morning one of the best why why why idiots why again my first ac game oh long time has passed the golden age of assassins creed melikey please do a assassins creed 1 remastered version really assasins creed comeback please make a brotherhood remaster can we expect the same for brotherhood maybe im not in another game but i will always stay in your hearts how i wish it had the multiplayer please ubisoft it was alot of fun with friends i think the unity need a remastered it can be awesome without bugs and nice graphics change the color scheme change some clothes and remastered game is ready yes yes yess finally i wanted this after read dead 2 i think i might enjoy this more as connor reminds me of charles a little remastered then downgraded on launch now can you go back and update ezio collection with better graphics or just do full remake of the collection as the remaster version was shocking i know this was not the best of the franchise but its the first i touched and it brought me places im so happy thanks ubisoft i love you guys is multiplayer included ubisoft guys dont fuck up this time please this look pretty good am i the only one not noticing the differences cool ubi can you then release ac4 on the pc but the actuall good version all i want is the lighting of the wii u version and the performance and detail of the ps4 version on the pc yaassssssssssssssss give me it all hey look its that one assassins creed that pandered to americans by a fuck ton took place in the us why ac iii and not ii or i or something else as example now this is asssasins creed game 2020 assassins creed 2 orange 2021 assassins creed brotherhood red 2022 assassins creed revelations pink omg this looks amazing yey connor its innecessary a remaster pf this game you know what fuck all the whining babies that are never satisfied with what they get even before i go down in the comments section i can already tell that someone will complain to the others and try and prove them wrong in some way fuck that ill just enjoy the game and not listen to anyone on it year of the remasters assassins creed 3 original runs in a potato assassins creed 3 remastered minimum rtx 2080ti water coolded with graphics improvements and removal glitches this is now in my favourite ac im so happy i skipped ac odyssey now i get to play a real assassin creed game im so excited the graphics look good i really cant wait do we get an online mode like the classic one so the colour tone became a bit more warm is that it where is fucking white screen i hope that you will fix it now i dont get the obsession with the orange filter same as skyrim se it looks like the same old shit garbage remaster the ezio luckily i have the xbox one and i do not need to buy the remastered cool added better antialiasing wow remaster thanks ubi its time to ac1 remake remaster ac 1 pls finally ubisoft did something right i cant wait after 4 years we will finally get a normal ac game even if its just a remake still a game and not a witcher 3 ripoff would be playing this again glad to have the dlcs this time this game will always have a special place in my heart do the same with ezio and altair we need the ezio trilogy remastered finally my dream came true will this be free for us that already own ac iii like upgrade or probably not so itsorange how come everybody love ac3 now i seem to remember it got alot of hate back then did the same thing with a mod i think i will even crack this game and play it too cuz im a fan of assassins creed series psezio i love u 3 i hope the animation remake too this is the game that when it came out everyone complained id prefer ac brotherhood one of the best games in the whole franchise dont get me wrong tho ac3 was good but the ship battles kinda felt a little shit and pointless imo and the story was confusing this is one of the best in the franchise so its definitely worth getting but i know wed all like to see ac 1 with modern day graphics boi would i have some nostalgia from that you should start making ac games again and not some shit rpgs called assassinss creed i know not everyone will like this comment but the true assassins creed for me will always be ac 1 2 brotherhood revelations 3 4 black flag and even unity but origins and odyssey just doesnt give me the assassins creed feel i grown to love and im craving to go back to these bad boys thanks ubisoft im so hyped this has been my favorite game for years only thing is is that i prob wont be able to run it but oh well i still have gotten the original ac3 from a giveaway u guys did a couple of years back ty for i have now played ac3 on all consoles and pc make a remarstered version of the ezio collection literally just finished ac3 like a few days ago so where is the remastered version of ac1 cant wait to play this game i already have got this from ac odyssey season pass who knows if the arrows will stick in the bodies of the enemies not like in the original game that they bounced when assassins creed was assassins creed and not a witcher game doesnt look much better i hope you tweak the gameplay at least why it isnt on the swich where is the new splinter cell ubii remember those hypocrite cunts who used to shit on this game now theyre all like ohhh this game was my favorite assassins creed gameyall can suck a dick did anyone notice the weird oldgen pixelshadows in 048 and 052 below washingtons hat and on connors face how can this still be in a remaster werent better shadows part of the lightimprovements finally i loved ac3 its problably my 3 fav ac game i am so hyped what about the price please pleaseee add music during freeroaming in boston new york in the frontier and in the homestead please ubisoft this will make the game 1000000 times better you can still add this in the game theres enough time hell yes ive been waiting for this for a long time wow remaster means a little bit sunshine go fuck yourself ubishit xbox 360 leaves the chat how many fools can i kill today can we please get an assassins creed black flag 2 that was the best assassins game i ever played and probably one of the best games in the assassins creed franchise in my opinion i have it in uplay but its no good to resmaster the game if it still has bugs and there are many ok but you guys said some gameplay features are gonna be improved too what did you mean is it combat is it better parkour maybe a stealth button for sneaking naval combat from black flag improved side missions what is it you said it yourselves that some improvements are coming so i expect something real if its just a tweak of crafting system or some shit like that im gonna be mad is mel gibson enhanced as well good thing i never finished it last true ac in a sense there were good games since like black flag and origins but the modern day story and the intrigue died along with desmond in 2012 how many fools can i kill today this is bullshit the first ac3 was better how much the game will cost why not black flag still coming with the odyssey dlc i wish there was an assassins creed 1 remaster that would be great who cares about the downgrade been waiting for this to be playable on my xbox one ah yes rope dart for dayz in frontier nostalgia hits me so hard now wheres charles lee my favorite game in ac underrated assassins creed game what about ac1 doesnt that get a remaster at some point ubisoft you guys need to come back prince pf persia ac is my favourite warrior video game series do somebody kbow if they revamped the combat system in my opinion he has ond the most cool assassin robes please let it be with mulitplayer it was great but so underrated spent hours playing it 3 my favorite assassins cred am i the only one who wanted ac2 it looks better than odyssey not much of a difference just a ubisoft cashgrab nice in 2014 i didnt understand this game i have been running through all ac games after revolations i was tired some days ago my friend tell me that ac3 is better than second part and now i have a motivation to play it again and ofcourse i will pick up everything ubisoft like your players like they like you o i played it on xbox 360 its one of the best games assassins creed 3 and me share a love story i am a longtime fan but my heart was stolen by ac3 the period the voice acting and characters of the time naval combat and brutal hand to hand combat and to top it all a region just for hunting the way you want to the only game i completed 100 ill be glad to return to the homestead to raise my community once more to see it prosper while i train my assasssins in the shadows ps i couldnt tell the graphical difference at first because the game still looks stunning either way 3 i hope this game can drive boat anywhere i wish you remastered assassins creed 2 whats being remade the graphics looks the same it just got yellower wow increble i hope gameplay had rework as well dammit good old time will be loved again nice please remastered assassin creed black flag yessss my favourite assassins creed is getting a remake woooo pls give new dlc not the old one but how did they improve combat finally a real ac game again not bad the witcher rip offs that lost the identity of the franchise origins odyssey ac3 was always underrated the last game before the main story went to shit still bitter about how they did desmond dirty remastered more yellow i never understood when ppl gave this game shit for its bugs in 2012 i never encountered anything originally im still playing assassins creed iv black flag after completing odyssey want black flag to be remastered imagine jackdaw with graphics like adrestia and water simulation of odyssey love this game great story ac3 love you connor finally the beast is out no one asked for this hope this remaster is better than rogue remaster my favorite game of asc saga 3 bioware could learn something from ubisoft remastered is good cant wait to put blue overlay on it hope you put in all the glitches like you did last time mi cat name is connor yes is for this game we will see desmond again in 2019 d the worst ac gets remastered i think most people want a remake of ac 1 or 2 or even brotherhood ac3 was boring asf nice remaster only sun shining added apply screen overlay call it a remaster ok ubi ok assassins creed brohterhood remake im so sad that ubisoft didnt make another game about connor as a protagonist he was the second best assasssin tell anything you want but ac 3 didnt deserve so much hate it got and he was a really interesting and great character why because it takes the strongest man in the world to fight something he gains nothing and loses everything from for the greater good of everyone else just an assassins creed iii fan he seminds me of jahseh are game will be upgraded if i have game on uplay or not is it going to support ray tracing we want ezio trilogy remastered i was really hoping they remastered it like halo 2 instead of adding an instagram filter but its still an awesome game ac3 offered something new with its choice of protagonist the whole aspect of being native american son of a templar the conflict of being in the middle of 2 different sides much more connors personality was justified through his childhood genocide racism shaped him a lot ezio actually had the chance to grow up with his family in a loving home before the bad stuff happened connor had to grow up as man when being a little boy all of this made him angry at the world thats why hes one of the most brutal assassins we have played as it was surely not a perfect game but i feel it was a very ambitious approach most of it payed off assassins creed 3 had such an epic theme song i never understood these previous gen remaster cashgrabs original ac iii is as playable as it was at day 1 after completing it multiple times and getting each and every achievement it has i see absolutely no reason to buy this unless ubi gives a free copy to everyone who already has the original one with season pass like bethesda did with skyrim im passing on this it is weird no more ac3 is the worst one comments i guess the hate train has had a change of heart assassins creed 3 with a saturation increase holy sh back at the game awards in december i joked how i would love an ac 3 remastered edition and then today you guys drop this sometimes dreams come true omg awesome i love this game so much this type of assassins creed is my favorite not like odyssey and origins assassins creed 3 is the masterpiece from ubisoft the storymindblowing i am glad that everyone is feeling the samegood work ubi best assassin the best origin and odessy are garbage like ubis servers ha good luck with that the backround music ruins me where is our black flag at least its better than odyseey odyssey is not assassins creed this is assassins creed ive nvr got a chance to play liberation i need this im so exited im so exited when u released odysseyi was sadand nowu had made me go crazyi was waiting for this my whole lifei love you ubisoft ive bought ac4 5 times and 100 it 3 times lord please just remaster it so i can play it with some sexy new graphics i cant wait do download this game from piratebaygreetings from balkan the thing is can i get one remasterd version if i already had the original ac3 ubisoft is listening to its fans finally whats next a watch dogs 3 assassins creed 20072012 rip lol just a sepia effect or what omg this song give me haythams figurine now also you can remaster connors figurine to make them look like him i mean at least make its skin color light brown not white you played assassins creed iii in winter now here is you chance to play it on spring give us 60 bucks time to double counter kills boy that soundtrack brings back so many memories 3 did they just change the lighting and called it a day it would be so cool if they include multiplayer to these remastered assassin creed games i spent so much time secretly poisoning people it was so much fun oh my god fantastic oh i see they added a yellowish post processing filter d d d seriously tho this trailer doesnt do a great job of showing what is improved exactly assassins creed 3 remastered instagram filters and god rays they should have started a remake on ac1 and then move up the chain pls ubisoft make ur games great again dont produce this shit like odyssey and origins cant wait is the lag in boston fixed though i dont mean do be rude it looks good after all but why havent they still changed charles lees forehead hair come on i was just playing dying light why assassins creed 3 sweetfx ac3 remaster regardless i never played it so im going to get itfrom codex of course will there be a multiplayer what the fuck is this recolor almost nothing is changed in new version what a trash amazing hope we will get the ezio stories with new engine for pc hey ubisoft im looking forward to playing assassins creed 3 remastered and one of my biggest expectations is to improve the animation of connors hidden blade by showing it performing the traditional function and maybe make that choice instead of always using knife form i am so hyped ac3 was assassins creed being at the peak of the series oh is this with the dumb engine that almost needs a nasa computer to run because ubisoft doesnt give a damn about optimization no thanks id like to keep my kidney in todays episode of games that dont need a remaster this is what i want from ubisoft someone from uplay is definately deusex fan this game is too orange make assassins creed great again ubi i know can do it go old formula please im so glad that they remastered it i still cant make myself play that rpg with assassins creed name on it thank you ubisoft finally my wish is granted switch port port plz my favorite assassinss creed how good i buy season pass for odyssey the downfall of assassin creed series begin with this no offense but only people who have played all trilogy of ezio n have watched the cinematic trailer of assasin creed revelation will understand and when will the new graphics be shown hahahahahaha is this a joke in the name of liberty this is being released on 29th march the day were meant to leave the eu at least ill have a great game to play while my country implodes imagine if assassin creed 2 brotherhood and revelations gets remastered that would be amazing make it a 32bit game please most badass outfit most badass assassin in ac series waiting for crack i cant wait to see people getting frustrated by another downgrade made by ubisoft i played ac3 and it was awesome now remastered is coming and i will play it and hope its awesome too i wish they would just make a working game for once and not remaster stupid boring shite 60 for an enb shader fuck you remakeremaster warrior within ubi youre are the best cant wait and how will buying it work can we buy it from a store or is it only available online on ps4 xbox one and pc please remake black flag y no nintendo switch really the shittyest ac game and it got a remaster dont worth even the band lost with the torrent that would be the first and second part of the remaster released it just has a new tint seems a great remaster improved lightning field resolution god aciii is so underrated hope this remaster will put it on a different lift yellow maybe ok it was an awful joke plus we will get all dlc wich are a new campaign andac liberation too great job ubisoft this game cops a load of hate but i actually really enjoyed it remake please not remaster make a remake of prince of persia warrior within and assassins creed 1 best assassin world soundtrack and systems loved ac3 and cant wait to replay it wow will be available on pc not really worth that graphic leap isnt that huge the game isnt old enough also 3 is one of my least favourite ac games just dont like the mc i want to play assassins creed 3 again but i remember the 1015 hour of hand holding before the game allows me to freely play and explore the world remember boys the game truly starts after connors prison sequence and execution remastered version will not remedy the first 10 boring hours true fans dont skip the third one we need a ac2 remastered for pc those who agree hit like i hope they fix bugs too clothes and weapons visual bugs and clothes color bugs etc wtf crisis of the genre and the trailer is so awesome in 4k worlds best 4k spectacle game its a very action story and best narrative game i have ever knownbetter than gta v those graphics actually look pretty decent and is there any word on a physical release my only question is will it have multiplayer that for me was what made ac 3 great wasnt the last scene of the heroine in ac liberation anyone wish they would bring back the multiplayer from ac3 ac4 etc holy shiiiit the forests look more atmospheric the graphics look so much cleaner i hope they added ambient songs into the background when you explore the cities and forest please make all the assassins creed with ezio better ezio stories remastered those epic soundtracks wait who came up with the idea to put assassins in assassins creed thats unexpected thanks ubisoft where is charles lee remaster yellow filter thank you plz ubisoft ac2 remastered even if its just a colour change it still looks good yayyyyy finally what i wanted for a long time is coming day one buy damn ubisoft ac2 ac origins ac lll those are my favorite ones thanks ubi for this remastered about time do i get both ac3 liberation for free if i bought the gold edition for odyssey i noticed somethingat the end of the video connor says that i will fight the enemy regardless of their allegianceis he gonna fight aveline in a customized ps4 dlc this was my first assassins creed game and i loved it i cannot understand why it was criticized so much haha the only noticeable change is the lighting what why not the ac2 im sorry but the only thing i see here is that the remastered is more orange if the final price is 60 is totally worthless best ac game full stop not need origins yellow filter ac3 2012 look good and this remaster more seem to community modification but i done preorder and i hope for a good product so i guess the templars are using global warming as their new weapon now and the switch this is when ubisoft cared about the story now ac is just the name the old spirit is long time dead the remaster just looks the way i remember the game looking oh yeahhh i still play that game on ps3 ac3 the browning this remaster actually looks decent ubisoft i hope you have fixed boston fps drop how much this remastered im excited for this truly i am but wheres watch dogs 3 d so they made it brighter and yellower i hope they fixed benedict arnold missions being available in the campaign before connors feud with washington having one of 3 caravans becoming bugged if you dont save it the very first time the popup happens daggers have the same animations as tomahawks whyyyyy thats about it why 3 why not 1 and 2 then 3 oh and how much i hope you have corrected the errors that is the most important thing assassins creed

shay arno and connor having a final confrontationarno and connor teams up and gangs up on shaythey could make a plot where connor and the colonial assassins discover that there is still one more templar alive his name is shay patrick cormac he found a mysterious book down the manor of homestead where it showed all the history of assassins there he saw a letter the letter stated connor by the time you are reading this i want you to go find the templar shay patrick cormac if he is still alive put him silence in forever for he is bound to cause more trouble with the brotherhood for as long as he lives achilles connor heard news of a templar assaulting the egyptian brotherhood to steal the artifact that was given to almualim so connor travels to egypt in search for the artifact and the templar meanwhile in paris arno rece ac ezio collection fansthis not looks good ac 3 remastered ubisofthave i ever told you the definition of remastered thats some really noce anti aliazing mmmmmmm now do a proper job remastering ac1 and a outstanding job remasteringremake the ezio collection connor is back candylands showtime oh look an actual assassins creed game the last chapter of assassins creed series as for me hope it will as cool as the original version we need more yellows on pc it looks like that cinematict trailer totally love it i think that this was needed i think that there is more than this and i think that there are some changes to the hud and some mechanichs animatons are the same though one of the best games ever and surely one of the best ac guys i have to anounce this it was me that got ubi to remaster this masterpiece just saying love u ubisoft let me guess it will be downgraded as always why ac3 ac 12brothrevel4rogue was be better then 3 will there be a multiplayer mode d remake ac1 not remaster thank you ac 3 2012 warm poster color cold ingame graphics ac 3 2019 cold poster color warm ingame graphics remake assassins creed 1 now this is what i call a remaster unlike ac2 this one has better or more detailed graphics it has unitys graphics or probably something close to that it doesnt have odysseys graphics but damn the game is good i am satisfiedand its not just the graphics is it just me but i notice a slight change in audioconnor haytham achilles voice looks so sharp as if they restated the lines again in green screen imo im ok with the direction they took with odyssey but god i miss the combat in ac3 they were at their prime now the comabt is justboring and mostly uncreative you know it would have been pretty easy for them to just patch the original game but no buguisoft why not on switch would you still play this will any of future assassins creed remastered games or new games be available for ps3 in any form like solo game or in collection i dont think but i rlyrlyrlyrlyrlyrlyrly hopeeeee its just beautifulthe best story of the seriesi just love itnice job guys the remaster got better illumination anything more i hope ubisoft is not gonna fuck us again with the sse instruction set at this remaster like at the previous two games thank you for this i did expect a bit more still looks great but i hoped for target render type of gameplay as it is powerful enough now to run it like that oh damn i never got this game im so excited now this is what you call a remastered the remastered part is the microtransaction shop by far one of the best in the saga ac now with this remastered i get a game worthy of being played again with these graphics improved ubisoft is you congratulations at least one ac to save this year i am so hyped of this game couse i just love this game and it was a big part of my childhood i was 12 years old back then when this game was relesead and this was my first ac game will it be 60 fps nice move ubi milking money from connors fans give those crybabies a sequel nonono better improve saturation a bit and those idiots will pay like for full new game fucking genius ac3 was such a big dissapoinment that this remaster should be giving out for free as a reward for those which bought a game on premiere which was unfinished and had to force theirseves through it if i buy the game before remaster stay with the same graphics or change that i can not wait until i change if the owners of the original wont be getting this for free i will plug your toilets with a massive dump assassins creed remake you cant just add a sepia filter and call it remastered not bad but how about a prince of persia remastered like warrior within wow an actual remaster ac 2 has to be remastered no question about it but are you going to let us charge into an army of 500 men while defending bunker hill come on the graphics are nice but you no longer have the limitations of the 360 give us the gameplay we need i was never so hypt to a game like this i love you ubisoft and this cover lookes so awesome assassinscreed4ever i really hope theyve added the scrapped speech that connor was supposed to do in the end of the story that would really change connor as a character for the better warrior creed whatever if you already own ac iii on uplay will you get this for free thank you so much for this this is amazing new and better graphics all the dlc s ac liberation this is how you make ac fans happy good job best soundtrack best combat best setting best characters best assassins creed i am ready 3 so its not a remastered its a remake with better shadowing and textures the engine overall did not change as expected from ubisoft physics of a character or moves did not changed as well and fighting techniques the same and to be honest i bet there will be no multiplayer because why would they bothered with such an important shit as most playable thing so in general thanks again ubisoft you screwed up again finally some good news from ubisoft what the fuck please add some ambient music and hood for the recruits now its yellow i like it because the displays blue light hurt my eyes ac 3 brighter version where is the nintendo switch version omg finnally this is pure love so basically they put a sepia filter over the entire game this is the best assassins love connor if you have the season pass in ac odyssey do you get ac3 all dlcs and liberation ac 3 is my favourite assassins creed im so happy because now i can play again if i have assasin creed 3 i need to pay for remastered ubisoft did something right in the last years yes aciii remaster dudeee looks nice i started to play the franchise with black flag ive never played any ac game before cause i hate stealth games like metal gear series even though i know it has amazing story and characters but damn i liked black flag and played the shit out of it d than i bought origins and i damn it i liked it too i made it 100 and i get my first platinum trophy now i think i should get every ac game start with the first one d shit im so dumb i missed this franchise not to mention i like historical games and ancient cities thats the main reason i bought origins egypt looks better than ever the price will it be available on steam you didnt do much change i liked the cold view more gave a feel of a harsh time when i have 13 years old i got this game as a gift and it was amazing game and now after 7 years i can play that on remastered on ps4 at age 19 come back connor come on not trying to be pessimistic but it looks like they only changed the lighting and a few textures but where is charles lee ubisoft remastering the game finally please ubisoft i hope to play in future assassins creed 1 remastered why the piss filter you retards ac1 remaster you must love the game at least for the setting and story it is more yellow for sure who ever says that this is the most underrated ac game i will found you and i will beat you ass ac 1 remastered next year mark my words how much will it cost ezio deserves more than conor we too remaster ac ii brotherhood and revelations not this or at least brotherhood im disappointed meh only reason im buying it because ive never played ac 3 anf ive been waiting a year to try it out wheres switch version ac revelations remastered would be nice they should name it assassins creed iii relight cause thats all theyve done a look assassins creed games used to have assassins and werent shitty fake rpgs b once again ubisoft turning the saturation to max doesnt equal a remaster why not assassins creed 1 im not a big fan of assassins creed iii but the music thats top shit have multiplayer 2012 everything is gray please fix this 2019 everything is yellow please fix this the only thing i dont like about this game is the 1st 2 sequences its so boring ubisoft made thanos bleed only some post processing call it remastered really ubi ubi i bet this will be a full priced game dont lie ubisoft this remaster will be downgraded like other ubisoft games the real gameplay is on right side im totally buying this remaster this story is worth it to return in it again king washington dlcs and aveline story are unexpectedly awesome bonus if there will be multiplayer it might be perfect lol old one looks better fucking way too bright now this game didnt even need a remaster yet wtf are you thinking ubisoft finally a real remaster more games with connor we need more this not even remastered not its time for ac2 with this games mechanics the last of the mohican assassins im going to play this to the lotm soundtrack especially promentory the last of the mohican assassins im going to play this to the lotm soundtrack especially promentory the character models have to be updated a little bit finally omgggf these graphics the hype is real bois ac 3 was the game ac 4 was a good game too but i have not seen nothing what makes story go further it was like a spinnoff and same with other games such as syndicate origins but odyssey was really stupid why because we are in animus and cant change characters or story and always saying that hey its animus glitch and at all game was s cking feminists puy non realistic garbage ubisoft we are clients make games for us not for fagts make it for us and rpg elements with hours of grind where is ac give it back to us ac3 yellow tint edition remaking a game that is so buggy i cant even play it nice one ubisoft assassins creed lllyellow edition the horse model is still shit this is remastered 028 thats not the original game is it it looks really good that feeling when waiting for the remaster of stronger than expected odyssey ubisoft is great but thear games fps not that much i just cammed pant i just realized that this trailer contains a huge spoiler compared to this what has ac become literally the main reason i brought the odyssey season pass remaster all the assassins creed wasnt liberation already remastered is this a remaster of a remaster whos here before the 100k views i woild definitely buy thisof i had a ps4 i think i gotta stick with my old ps3 version looking foward to revisit conor make more remasters please altair next with openworld like odyseey pretty please thank you best ac of the year i find this hard to believe because this is ubisoft they always find a way to downgrade their games i love the online battle mode in this game does that mode also come out as a remaster version this game deserves that remastered i wouldnt call making the game brighter a remaster an actual remaster would be like modern warfare remastered or resident evil 2 remastered one of the worst assassins creed games but still wanting to replay it it would be nice if they fixed any of the numerous bugs and poor game design choices like the atrocious horse traversal but i doubt it more excited for liberation remastered although probably just a port of the ps3 version im so pumped for this fell in love with this game when it first came out and was even more in love with the soundtrack the main theme is so good please leave the mechanics basically like they were orginally i dont want to see one of my favourite games in all time ruined by fighting single enemies for half an hour or the need to farm xp or weapons for decades just to actually be able to progress in the game without buying xp boosts or sht like that what you do with your games series in future is your thing and some people are actually liking those time costing and boring imo mechanics but i loved seeing bodies pile up through to superior tactical movements and atttack choosing cool finishers every now and then aswell as the urge to try to get a triple or quadrouple counter kill the past is sacred and should not be ruined by the attempt to make it better does anyone know if the multiplayer mode will come back tbh it was my favorite part about the older games i loved the ps3 version so this must be good it needs remake not remaster well thats how assassins work the ac series was the first one i actually did effort to play to story completion for lore thanks ubisoft even their remastered version will get a downgrade my favourite ac game best characters and atmosphere cant see a difference in graphics tbh just different light hell yess d all dlcs wwooaahh o when i first played ac 3 i havent finished it on full 100 and with no dlc completed now its time to change that 3 fuck yeah and i was gonna pirate the regular version now im gonnna wait 2 months to pirate the remaster thank you ubisoft it looks worse in some places una joyita caaant waiit now be disappointed with remastered graphics connor will always be my favorite assassin character but im just sad ac3 storytelling didnt exploit his full potential now thats a remaster i would buy id crying ubi pls take all my money i want it now literally no one asked for this ok so what about switch hmmmm wow lightning changed everything i wonder what about textures i waiting on this game more than ac fucng odyssey another remastered lie from ubisoftdamn manwhy all these ac games are yellow loved ac3 and i cant wait to buy this finally some fucking good game im crying we need new games no remasters ac 3 one of the best games ever i want this on pc too one of the best ac games just behind ac origins anyway its better than odyssey even in yellow dont make a remaster of ac1 make a remake of it imagin if they do the same thing with ac2 as well im so hyped ac3 is and always was my favorite game instead of remasting ac 2 or brotherhood they remaster this shit last ac with desmond rip ac3 was brilliant but dissapointing at the same time because they promised we would take part in the battles but we never did bunker hill battle mission was a dissapointment wild life is button pressing dissapointing the foggy map doesnt clear completly and there are never more than 100 npcs together when they promised the engine could hold 1000 but the story was phenomenal and it includes liberation im in im fucking in probably the most disliked game in the series because of how depressing it is and connor is a bit boring to somelook what hes been through he has every right lol anyway cant wait for this if they only included his real captains outfit captain connor kenway as a unlockable outfit during the single player campaign i would buy this httpsiytimgcomvivkiwty6owzymaxresdefaultjpgv56d16725 httpimg4wikianocookienetcb20120813213428assassinscreedimages558ac3connorascaptainpng best ac ever made for me better then 2 and i am italian i preordered ac odyssey just to get free ac3 remastered omg this is like a remake not remaster no new assasin creed no prob ill get this ubisoft is the best nonono not buying this i think remastering should have a minimum of ten years on the shelf stop being such greedy cunts you frogs finally finally so what you did is just making the game yellowish with some volumetric lighting gotcha thank you by far my favourite ac combat and costume connor looks dope would be happy if they had the side missions and story reworked the game was so empty of sensible stuff to do how much can ubisoft milk the franchise no one knows f u ck ubishit their games are worse than eas i am crying return of one of the best ac ever yeah nah wouldve liked ac2 better but oh well 7 years later we finally get what weve been advertised at e3 nice ive been waiting for a game like you to come in to my life imo ac3 is a pretty good game the best thing about it is haytham ac 4 remastered please d i love the story in this game but most i love the epic music this is free on the season pass holder for ac odyssey yahoo next ac bf back when assassins creed was a a masterpiece and had a story assassins creed yellow edition miss old ac do this with ac 4 please ubisoft nice i really liked ac3 even though it had its problems i feel like if it was expanded upon and they took 4 years too make itd defently be in the running for game of the year no switch uuu this one is on pc too great why not bring the ezio collection as welld i get to play as desmond again cant wait assassins creed 4 black flag i need a remaster version wtf is this remaster it doesnt even look good the ezio trilogy deserves it much more of all the ac games they remaster the shittest one btw it doesnt even look like a remaster more like a very shitty recycle if ur gonna remaster a game do ac 1 conor is back ill play more of this game than odyssey i miss the old ac didnt see much difference his running style is the best lmao ubisoft please remastered tom clancys splinter cell blacklist this could have been such a good game but i still like it hope the remaster is good but i wont get my hopes up assassins creed iii sienna filter edition finally assassins creed is back after a waiting of 4 years and i always knew itll be ultimately worth it to wait soooooo long the absolutely important resurrection everything is just more vibrant wtf dude this game wasis a masterpiece its the last good game i have played from the story to the dlc its just amazing even watching this makes me a emotional bitch i love you connor press e will be downgrade i am from the future ac 3 is literally the worst ac wtf why would u remaster it lol what about the first ac lol not a fan of remastered games i prefer a new one with new experience my opinion just do black flag and stop butchering the franchise the way ips are treated these days is so depressingtake 1 good idea and absolutely annihilate everything that made it good to begin with 1010 aciiiyellow filteraciii remastered piss filter everywhere lol it looks better than odyssey in graphics lmao same ia please no cant you just use reshade for this shit im impressed my favorite ac game is getting a remaster going to get it day one finally a proper ac game please return the franchise to what it was wtf is wrong with you people everybody hated ac3 on release why are you happy now hope is not burn my graphic card no one asked for this right so glad i got the season pass for odyssey get ac3 free and now liberations plus dlc free too man i love this i can never get enough ac3 wow yellow piss filter sure made it look great ubisoft really you said 2019 not gonna realease assasin creed and gonna make another watch dog game ugh looks like a new light engine fix and sharper textures and thats all finallyfinally its here and the good news so its moreorange is it the same story tho daaamn i loved this game only few weeks to go thank god so strange to remaster this one in my opinion one of the worst desmond ac games but still a relatively good game remaster looks good ac3 was my first ac game ac3 is my favorite ac game i love connor i just dont have the money now this looks like a proper ac game ac i and iv being my favorites hoping to see more remasters all games looks better with god rays jaja xdd what soundtrack was it at 028 this was the worst assassins creed i played awful in every way only cool thing to come out of this was ship battles please tell me that the muskets are no longer so glitchy ubisoft lets make remaster of assassins creed game and maybe a game for switch too ubisoft1 assassins creed 4 black flag was very good game many ppl liked it sooo ubisoft2 no assassins creed 3 will be a good idea ubisoft3 that is a good idea many ppl like as 3 because it is in usa everyone likes usa world except usa fu ac 3 fu usa so you do get this in odyssey season pass is this a remaster or a remakelooks like a 1000 times better so hyped thanks ubisoft if you really think im gonna pay for a game that looks a little better thank before youd be absolutely correct ac 1 remake please why remaster a game when you can just try to remake the game that started it all ac1 tbh i would really love the see the game that started it all with updated engine and added gameplay mechanics cough take a look at re2 remake its a lot of work but i guess ubisoft will keep doing this remasters thing i need an remastered of the first ac please and make altar can swing too he deserved all the glory i want ac 4 remastered please can youubisoft update ac3 on uplay so that i can play it remastered no shit god bless you ubisoft its my birthday next week and im going on a full assassins creed rebuy i have loved the assassins creed games for ages and now all the assassins creed games except 1 will be on the ps4 so im gonna re buy them all and go on a marathon the reason i boughs the ac odyssey dlc ohwawanother remake looks pretty well done but im not sure if i like the change of color great game so nostalgic wish ac had developed with it being like this instead of what it is now they really need to remake assassins creed 1 including scenes from ac revelations and all that makes a weird noise its rewind time why not the assassins creed ii are you kidding me i bought the game the exact minute this trailer was released a remake would have been way better than a remaster but of ac 1we need altair back man ac iii yellower edition ok ubisoft do remaster on ac i or ii or just make ac placed in japan for next ac just plzzzzzz this game remastered but bugs wont be remastered hopefully theyve fixed all the shit wrong with this game instead of just adding better lighting and textures what what when did they annouce thise i want it on the switch where is the remastered stuff not seeing much of a difference tbh everything seems to be yellow but that doesnt qualify as a remaster as far as im convinced thanks alot one of the best ac so far it was so revolutionary at the time it came out loved it so much my best assassins creed game this is the happiest day of my life well i probably would have prefered ac 1 2 and brotherhood remastered over time but my brother absolutely loved ac3 so im definitely getting this i didnt really play it so this time i will how do we deserve this my favourite game is back love you connor this game ruined the franchise thanks for no nintendo switch version ubi why do remastered the game was terrible and the dls is also crap it would be better to remake the game from scratch and you just updated the schedule and thats it the next move to make more money ubisoft i thought you were not like that this is what ac really was not the shitty ass games that follow after unity you can even noticed the difference just by their quotes its time for montereal to come back quebec just ruined completely this saga and assassins cred 4 remastered not for nintendo switch same graphics but yellow disgusting shit as always ubisoft and thanks again for killing the main plot of the franchise no lucy no desmond well at least we can watch as you guys are trying to make some money through the bots in the comments and this piece of shit game fake laugh at fans good luck with that we laugh at you sincerely the best ac game ever created same gameplay i thought it will be totally new you cant compare this to ac ezio collection this is actually well done you got me at liberation this isnt remasterd its just added some collour filters i was hoping for more than just a graphics overhaul tho was hoping for a good game still got a lot of work to do ubi they should add bokeh depth of field on cutscenes and proper per object motion blur i cant forget connor 3 i love assassins creed get assassins creed right again no rpg no fire swords no magic not godness abilitys fucking no wtf you know after playing re2 remake i dont think im ever going to excited about any remastered game really although i love ac3 but i want remake just like resident evil and if you can assassin creed 1 remakeand not remastered upgrade worth it the best remastered of ubisoft assassins creed threemastered they phoned todd howard and he told them to add godrays i want shay patrick cormac from rouge on game why not 1 why not 2 why not good ones ac3 is like only 6 years old wtf where remaster for the first assassins creed common guys its been 12 years just hoping that my savegame dont get corrupted in this version the best story in the series im so hyped pc version with just an warm filter lol wow this looks amazing thank you ubisofti love this game hah im actually laughing at myself for truly believing that ubisoft would remaster this game with the level of quality that capcom provided with re2 not only did they remastered the graphics but they also reinvented the entire game while staying true to the iconic original in ac3s case the game was not very iconic so when i heard about them remastering this game along with rumours that they were going to fix the boring ass story i was expecting quality remaster not just lighting basically the laziest way to remaster a game after all the crap ubisoft has been releasing over the past years im ready to say with confidence that i dont actually want a new splinter cell or prince of persia how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in my way i shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow tomahawk chop is my death blow instead of remastering 3 they should have gone with 2 or brotherhood not a remaster really tho is it looks the same with some added light ac1 remaster is due well they still not say they doing upgrade just remastered play the same experience with the different weather for liberty for freedomfor the creed wait what now im waiting for assassins creed v black flag 2 i love this game and i love ubi but due to the overall good quality of the nonremastered ac3 on pc i feel like its not going to change much for us pc gamers but still looks good wait what now im waiting for assassins creed v black flag 2 wait what now im waiting for assassins creed v black flag 2 i love this game and i love ubi but due to the overall good quality of the nonremastered ac3 on pc i feel like its not going to change much for us pc gamers but still looks good still looks oldgen to me but difinitely an improvement i hope theres a standalone release on steam too ive been looking forward to this can anyone help me out does anyone know how much will it cost if i buy it separately and if i do so when i later buy odyssey and its season pass will i get a second copy of the remaster in my uplay library or how does it work because im planning to buy odyssey sooner or later what if i already have original assassins creed 3 when i buy that remaster old version will be updated or its gone be other game on my account its yellow is it just me or does it look like it used to be gray and they just decided to slap a yellow filter on it and call it a remaster remaster assassins creed 1 and its all set barely any difference rdr2 still looks lightyears ahead heck the xbox one x port of rdr1 looks better than this plus ac3 was never a good game to begin with so this is a hard pass here i am waiting that far cry blood dragon gets a ps4 release and a sequel i might get this just for the tyranny thanks to ubisoft for remastering this awesome game it still has the best combat system in the series so they put a warm filter and some god rays into the game is the remastered version on the same game engine or new one anvilnext or anvilnext 20 i would actually buy that ac3 was one of my favourites i just hope the price is right and not overpriced as usual hope this will not be a mmorpg game d sins i buyed the ultimate edition of ac odyssey i has been waiting for this one day we will see assassins creed odyssey remastered will be available on 29th march 2029 on pc ps5 and xbox two dlc contents are included preorder the signature edition now httpubiligyms8 i love the classic assassins creed games create a ac 1 remake on the level like res 2 does but nice vid hey i just played this game hahaha its a downgrade with that fucking yellow yooo dude what is this sweetfx edition i cant see the difference 2019 hd textures what a joke put the arno dorian costume of assassins creed unity in the game please i love that costume so many morons in these comments ready to bend over and take in the a from this cesspool of a company wow this was the badest part everyone on here wants an ac 1 remaster i say go further rebuild the game from the ground up they will most likely have to get new people for voice actors but it would prove they care as theyll be going a great distance just mod for a pc version on max settings in 2012 i dont see any difference not half bad ill totally buy it if i get a discount for owning the old version on steam or uplay one of my absolute favorites in the series easily had the best narrative why connor use stone tomahawk same visual technique from skyrim special edition assassins creed iii yellow edition i see they pulled a skyrim special edition gotta love that yellow tint that being said i like it all the money in the world would not make me play this bloody game again god damn thats amazing finally i get to enjoy aciii to the limit i cant wait to play my favorite ac game again in his full glory so only ac 1fault to come to new gen not remaster ac1 but remake it plis ubi remasters are so lazy should have remastered ac2 but this works aswell my 1st assassins creed 33333 that music omg what a nostalgia awesome work ubisoft we waited to long for this i hope they will increase lod distance ac3 is better than odyssey in my opinion focus on new games wish the series would go back to this multiple choice rpg isnt ac wow look an actual remaster does it include the multiplayer thats the real question you basically just made the game more yellow and added god rays british and scotish people against british is fighting for their freedom and all the americans oh yeah they were all killed so honor this story is kind of fucked up lol funny thing the fucked up stuff is the real stuff remasters the shittest ac sequel more light is ubisofts remastered money grab next assassins creed iv black flag remastered please make it real is my favourite ac game just add a yellow tint and increase contrast and call it a remaster i guess remaster revelations damn finally i will play in the world full of my lovely snow as assassin in white outfit while traveling through the beautiful winter forest at the sunrise again with the better quality thank you ubisoft you took my next 40 hours of my life who was begging for liberation to be remastered lol brilliant now do the ezio games properly i already own ac3 why should i buy it again why cant they make a good assassins creed like this why do they have to make a shit one like orgins or that new shit one im still a little doubtful as they only showed scenery in the remastered version i will admit though the remastered scenery did look beautiful i wanted ac 3 on ps4 soo bad and i cant belive its back as remastered oh so you put an instagram filter on it i cant wait to dowload this with utorrent ffs i only bought it a three days ago i sense a very high price than the original game maybe 5 times more expensive would of liked it if they rebooted it instead of remastered funny thing is assassin support washington who clearly a freemason and freemason is templar ac4 remaster i hope the gameplay and story flow is improved as well just incredible lol they literally just gave it a different color scheme theres nothing remastered about this this alone is better than the last 6 games theyve released imo assassins creed 1 remastered now prince of persia remaster ah yes back when assassins creed was assassins creed and not greek simulator yeah but why though looks the same just a yellow tint and less jaggies ahahahaahahahah ubisoft made this video not available in my country cant handle the truth huh finally do not change the fighting mechanisms to those of origins or odyssey ffs in ubisoft color blind people u now remastered on lighting damn damn damn best combat hands down i can see the number of sales tripling day by day for this amazing game woah they changed the lighting a bit so assassins creed black flag the ezio trilogy now iii are available for ps4 does anyone know if the first ac game rouge will be remastered as well if they remove the optional objectives from the original 3rd game then ill get this otherwise i dont want to go through that crap again the second last good one after black flag you went down hill an brought yourself back with origins and odyssey i might pick it up i really hate the rpg style in the latest ac games are you planning to remaster ezio story related games too i feel like theyre going to make a remakeretelling of the first game where is the switch port looks like unity but i am happy because unity is my favorite assassins creed and i have one question if i have the original game i will get this remastered version altair deserves a remastered version too i always like altairs character its full of mysteriesand his deep cool voicenot in revelations i mean in the first game they should remake black flag this is my favorite ac game thank u ubisoft remaster brotherhood then ill buy downgrades back to original looks like theyve improved their lighting and character modeling makes it look better than the original good work ubisoft and still no ac odyssey cgi trailer ac1 ac odyssey ac3 is the best of the saga in my opinion why no nintendo switch port if assasins creed 3 is on xbox 360 then why not the switch finally a good ac for a momentjust for a secondi though this was a new game with connor as protagonist uu soadding a sephia filter make this game remastered nice work ubisoftfor fools ofcourse worst ac cant u just remaster ezio trilogies when assassins creed was still assassins creed will this be 4k hdr on playstation pro im not crying finally no switch remaster hope u remastered quest and add new feactures this game and black flag definitely changed ac series as in terms of freerunning combat and introducing naval combat one of my top 5 ac games in the series hope it still has the same bug where you endlessly fighting the soldiers how remastered it is dont care got this masterpiece on pc so it basically has a slightly higher lod and a sepia filter why didnt they just remaster ac 1 2 and 3 and make it as one 60 dollar game yellow is the new grayblue wtf this will be the first assassins creed i will have bought since assassins creed 3 they added a bronze filter basically i love you ubisoft 3 and now please remaster ac ii the most physically op assassin getting a remaster fuck yes assassins creed iii yellow edition i dont see a lot of differencies i expected better barkour animations but oh shit desmond is back bitches can i pre order it digital too on ps store i was sooo hyped for this now im not oh god i will

useless remaster clearly ub is making a comeback pure nostalgia here dont tell me ubioft will sell this for 60 just because of brightening assassins creed 1 remake please please please fix his hair in the cutscene where he puts his hood on after killing haytam and i just finished my runthrough of all the proper acsac3 is truly underrated nothing seems different to me apart from the color grading tbh you guys want money right just remake the game it needs time ill give like 30 for this one lol just brightening and thats all ok good work but pls dont do 60 045 058 102 the best changes in my opinion not bad ubisoft i dont know why did i expect a new combat for the game when ac games used to be actual ac games i am gonna play it again yeyeyey thank you ubisoft thank you ubisoft what about gameplay changes something this game is in need of all i ask for aciii remastered is the parkour system similar to acunity please long live ubisoft u have made 1011 ac games for this gen now only assassins creed 1 is left ohh yeah thats what im waiting for now this is a remaster not going to consider this a full remaster dont get me wrong it looks a lot better but i wouldnt consider it a remastered resident evil 2 gears of war call of duty modern warfareand ratchet and clank those were true remasters i truly enjoyed all the ac games but would really like to see a real remastered ac game i think the series deserves some real love from its developers that look alit better cant wait for this ubisoft theres a good part within you but he is wrestling with a giant greed a lovable company in a body of a greedy monster thats the way it is looks good but i prefer that ubisoft remaster the ezio collection steam or epic oh yeah now i will have a oportunnity of play this game assassins creed iii yellow filtered good my oldest dream come true on ps4 finally old is gold 6 year ago when ac 3 comeout everyone said its boring and ugly character and now when ubi remastered it everyone happy cause of it too 3 conor is back miss the original assassins creed like si les gustarian que agan assassins creed 1 remasterizado i noticed some color correction bloom and the ground texture in the first scene was changed oddly enough the original scenes were at a lower resolution which makes me think you were comparing a ps360 version and not the original pc version which would have the same resolution as this remaster its so good to hear that theme again i love ac3 yes my fav ac game finally getting the right treatment honestly assassins creed 3 was never that fun to me black flag was definitely better well there is a hope for unity remaster prince of persia remastered version please ubisoft i think im gonna buy aciii again xd nice graphics the original was on wii uwtf doyou hate the switch ubisofti can kinda understand more rescent entries that might not run on switchbut ac 3 wtf actually i think the cutscenes could be cinematic like halo 2 at best or a remake now ubi need to make a crusademedival era ac would be awesome i liked assassins creed 3 i might pay 40 i will pay 30 and i definitely wont pay 60 also adored the aciii soundtrack it really pumped me up and immersed me in the 18th century would love to replay this leaving nothing out to get the full connor kenway story once again oh god i just replayed this game i luv it seriously you call this a remaster i call it colour grading ok now remaster ac2 and while youre at it graphically remaster battlefield 2 this is the real assassins creed without magic rpgsystemslesbian and gays assassnscreed v black flag remasterd i wonder if theyll fix all the bugs my favourite game of all time remastered ahh i cant wait why not remaster the ezio trilogy why did they have to remaster one of the shitest entries in the series why not any of the previous entries that had infinitely more interesting characters and better story also i hardly consider it to be a remaster seeing how theyre only putting a filter and fixing bugs too bad connor is a fucking puss so the switch version was a lie holy crap is this really remaster not remake remaster ghost recon future soldier and youll have my attention and we will see haytham death with a better graphic xd ac revelations remake pls this is perfect is the mechanics same as the old version or is it like now in odyssey hopefully its like in odyssey p it looks better than ac rogue remastered im literally crying right now this game made me a diehard fan of the series im emotionally attached to this game thank you ubisoft for doing this and making the 10yearold in me jump in excitement ps dont hate on me but this is probably one of the best ac games of all timeprobably up there with ac2 with the downgrade itll still be the same just get the ps3 game ps the rhyming wasnt on purpose make ubisoft great again thanks ubisoft i have wait this so long do a remaster of ac1 you lazy fucks thank you ubisoft black flag next please wait a remaster that actually includes the dlc take notes activision ive been replaying the trailer for 22nd times shout out to lazerzz he loves this game i want this game af this leaked before but were is nintendo switch logo not sure how making it so bright you cant see enemies 2 metres in front of you is a good thing it looks more colerful and now i realize dont need ac2 remastered i need ezio trilogy remake with new engine jesus anvil next 20 is way too old looks awesome to bad while playing we have to deal with desmonds story that means absolutely nothing to me this isnt worth it to repurchase the game i have a lot of problems with this game wish it was a remake like re 2 remake the game to make it a different and better experience im tried of these remasters that just makes the game more polished than before even though it should of been like that at release i used to play this game a lot back then still dont know why people hate this game smh i do know it has the best mp out of all four versions that i can tell you for sure now i want mp back plz shame its ac3 and not any of the other good ones what why would they remaster a game thats not too old why not remaster ac 1 and 2 because the controller support for pc sucks and desperately needs it omg i cant wait i am trying to complete all the achievements on ezio collection now even though the quality is not the best its still an amazing game is ubisoft going to give this to people who already bought the original or am i going to have to buy it for a 3rd time someone should just mod the original ac3 and add god rays and itll be the same product more than likely but i guess we will see this looks amazing though if assassins creed ii remastered in todays tech i would buy that in a heartbeat when assasin creed at his prime is it bad that im more pumped for this than i was for odyssey you and your alligators you just put bloom and a piss filter on everything they need to transfer ac black flag naval gameplay mechanics with this remaster hope there is new hud like in blackflag wow adding a warm filter is considered remastering these days d i wish that next ac game would be in japan as shaw yunif im not mistaken and the ending would be introducing ezio auditore and the following ac game will be a remake of ezios trilogy pls what about nintendo switch shut up and take my money cool it drops a couple days before my birthday i hope it works with 60 frames on xbox one x omg thank you ubi my favorite assassins creed game haters gonna hate i love this game the best assassins creed to date i cant believe all you did was apply a fucking yellow filter and call that a remaster are you fucking serious 30fps no thanks i cant wait for this assassins creed iii was the first ac game that i have ever played and it truly impressed me i still love the free roam in this game even nowalmost 7 years later as bad as ac3 is this is a definite buy add yellow filter call it a remaster good job ubisoft sheeit i just bought ac3 because of the discount the worst ac game will it have the multiplayer lucky me that got the season pass from ac odyssey hardly a remaster if all thats different is the lighting lmao just play it on backward compatibility because this shit is a ripoff after seeing what capcom did with resident evil this is disappointing honestly i highly doubt the combat and movement will be any different either rip switch the only thing i know is that connor kenway have the best combos of all saga it even comes with the dlc alrighty then man i wanted this in fc3 for blood dragon but then again it was stand alone ok im ready to empty bank account again man one of my favorites assassins the main theme of this game is epic as hell cant wait to get it wtf exactly the same game mw1 was a true remaster jesus i was so hyped its good but i thought it would be something like resident evil 2 remake man one of my favorites assassins the main theme of this game is epic as hell cant wait to get it i loved connors story but i hated the ending with desmond because it was a waste what the hell is remaster a joke to you only changed the lighting and wont probably cross 60fps doesnt look like a 2019 games nice yellow tint you got there ubi better than ac2 remaster anyway the horse animation looks so much better than the shitty one from odyssey lol surprised this is happening oh and also best not be 60 oh and also please dont just change lighting oh and also have you seen any of these current remakes why dont you just redo this game cause people had major problems with this game and it deserves more love and time put into it the setting is great and if re written a little it could be such an amazing game so remasterd means a new enb or other enb settings or is there also better texturequality wish it was a standalone purchase i didnt like it when mwr was locked behind the infinite warfare special editions and i dont like it for ac3 remastered hope they re did the uicuz that shit was horrendous go look at resident evil 2 and then come back to me if you actually think this is a remaster thia is sppp sick cant wait to playubisoft am i blind i cant tell which is the before and after because nothing looks like it really improved the colors are different big fucking deal now this is what you call a real assassins creed game finally the most badass assassin is coming my favorite assassins creed thank you ubisoft dafuck they only added a sun filter lmao if possible remaster ac revelations still cant change the fact that connor is the most boring assassin in the franchise pre order the game know xd i love the game ready for crack it ubisoft change only the color of the game in yellow pls make a remastered for ac1 at least i can spend my money well they should make new cutscenes cant wait to be disappointed its just orange and yellow now i love youubisofti so so so so so happy and excited for it wtf only graphical improvements i want new and better gameplay that ac3 soundtrack gives me goosebumps im crying how much is it not gonna lie i didnt really like ac 3 bastards do justice to the ezio trilogy and remaster it itll probably sell more than this and odyssey combined should include black flag and rouge i hope they dont make us pay 60 dollars for yellow filter and foliage patch this game was so sick remake the first ac you get iii and liberation remastered if you buy odyssey gold or ultimate i love the soundtrack make a new ac brotherhood so i can have my multiplayer back i guess theres no multi again remaster ac brotherhood 1010 ubisoft first thing they made nice since far cry 3 yes now ac 4 black flag signature edition exclusive to the us ubistore that doesnt ship outside the us at all well im feeling like shit now thanks ubi for not caring for anyone but the us for limited stuff yet again smh 028 i can swear that the original one looks better and more athmospheric i love ac games more than anything in this world now if a certain someone would remaster battlefront 2 now please ac1 remakewith subtitlev hi ubisoft i want ask i have game on uplay and i must buy this remaster or i get free first game i played on my pc still gives me chills there is nothing changed please do it on ps3 finally waiting for ac 4 remastered so what i have to buy it again fuck that god this is far beyond my expectation i still say the desmond ending was cheap and halfassed the most brutal assassin of all time is back xd im honestly quite disappointed by this this isnt really a remaster but merely just a reshade the character models and environments still look exactly the same with no real improvements or anything ubisoft you gotta make an actual remaster next time around with like new models new environments new lighting etc not just a simple reshade there are pc graphics mods for this game that do a much better job at remastering these games from ac1 to odyssey if you have odyssey season pass then this is frew right ac3 is by far my favorite ac game oo im so excited thanks for the support to switch bugisoft i never thought this day would come my dark horse favorite ac game gets remastered im like a proud father like the one connor didnt have xd now its time to play a true ac game this is an assasins creed no like the fucking origins or odyssie niice i love assassins 3 btw his voice is from one of the indian folk from red dead redemption 2 a true assassins creed game release after unity will the online pvp be back if not i dont care can i get this free because i had the original looks the same do a remake of ac 1 or 2 a good remake like re2 hahayahah you should remaster ac1 and this is remastered only some litle graphic changes i think and all is only lighting changes hahaha learn from re2 how to remake games hahahaha also this should be only a update not new game nope you dont get money from me you should have made the release date on before march 28 ill be busy playing mk11 beta by then whuuuutti was playing that while the notification camei cant believe that this is the most misleading comparison ive ever seen the outside shots arent even in the same weather or time of day they purposefully try to make ac3 look worse to get you to buy it even though all they did was increase the contrast and brightness ubisoft ac iii remastered me ac iii the hd port damn no switch version ac odyssey season pass owners release date woah looks beautiful hopefully they have fixed the cart bug and it runs a lot better i am way more excited for this than i should be ahhhhh im so fucking hype us wow the trailer looks amazing cant wait to buy this ubisoft its time for a downgradeboys wow the music on this game i remember i played this game when it was free on pc ubisoft anniversary on my laptop fps was less than probably 5 it was very bad experience now as i have ultimate edition for ac odyssey i get this for free looking forward to it ohfinally thank you ubisoft and the box art for nintendoswitch why i am always crying while a watch a assassins creed trailer thank you a true ac this new ones are cool and all but they should have just been another franchise just my opinion what about remake looks like resident evil 2 using your new engine from ac origins odyssey i think it will be better you guys still hyped cause im off the hype train now why not remaster the first ac i am so happy that i have season pass for odyssey waiting for the game so hyped i love you ubi im trying to play all your games 3 hands down best gaming studio of 2019 remake assassins creed 1 please my favorite assassins creed game after assassins creed 2 thank you ubisoft remake or remastered ac 1 expand altair story with others extra dlc yassss ive been waiting for this let ac1 remastered trailer now i bought this together with odyssey and another remaster i was hoping for a true remake like resident evil 2 im very very disappointed one of the best assassins creed dont me i still think this is the best in the series like itit is so cool any far cry 2 remaster to spread the word of the apex far cry game why isnt this coming to switch connor is back a most buy btw the remaster it looks great why not remaster some good ac games like the ezio trilogy gonna buy this shit so hard they added a yellow filter awesome ok so they changed the color temperature from cold to warmnice put a instagram filter over it and you have a new game friendly tip to newcomers to the series that havent played this game and are trying it out with this remastered version play the connor homestead missions seriously those missions have so much to them that i wonder why ubisoft left them as optional quests if you dont play them youll miss out on a ton of memorable moments and character development for connor ive seen so many people complain about connors supposed lack of personality when the game first came out just because they missed these missions that i thought id take my time to write this why remaster one of the worst ac games lol especially when ac2 needs a remaster man they better not charge 60 for brightening up the game why was far cry 3s remaster so bad compared to this now we need ac2 and brotherhood remade i might have restored my faith in ubi looks the same as the original sorryubi maybe actually make a true remaster next time i love the ac series but when will they actually finish some of the characters storys like desmond oh my god this all i wanted and more thank you the best assassins creed o ever played and brotherhood was great to please ubisoft make videogame with less sidequests thank you out of nowhere hope my wallet is not ready we still nedd ac1 remake im so happy for this trailer finally ubisoft come back again alright people who wants a resident evil 2

odyssey season pass ultimate assassin deadpan experience now remastered relive the mc with as much charisma as a leather couch with a frowny face scribbled on it now enhanced up to modern standards but does it have the old combat system or the new one this game the soundtrack were everything to me just bumped up the saturation and rest u can get with max settings on pc so no switch release

love you ubisoft boiii i hv waiting for this looks at rope not today old friend any new mechanics or just updated visuals i might going to buy it only for the dlc although i have my ps3 set up and

the story of ac3 remsatered has been changed or no assassin creed 3 is my favorite assassin creed game in history im so happy its getting remastered nice now bring back sam fisher hell yeaaaa i will preorder it so everything is yellow now ok now its time to remaster ac 1 top glad i bought season pass now its good see connor again my wallet ready boy oh yeah yeah im not crying you are thank you so much ubisoft please release android beta please finally give us libertyor give us death hands down best ac game released assasin creed 3 remaster man i wished these new ac games odyssey and origins wouldnt have had those stupid levels i love the fact that they remastered ac 3 btw nice vid i wish ubisoft did there homework on the soldiers uniforms they are so inaccurate if they made a patch that would put the original lighting on it would be perfect maybe selecting it from the options menu it kills me to watch such phenomenal gameplay while i dont have the equipment to play but what sweetness to watch i love all the new ideas the rpg and traveling big maps but if origins and odyssey would have kept the same combat as past ac games with those new ideas that would have been the best im creating a petition as a way to pressure ubisoft to fix the issues in assassins creed iii remastered httpchngitgr8n4fgqkc with the release of assassins creed iii remastered there was a huge disappointment and many of the expectations that the remastered version had were not met and those who did not like the original game of 2012 but who decided to give a second chance were also deeply disappointed and much if not most of the disappointment is due to these factors the exaggeration of attention in the redefinition of the illumination the horrible redesign of the faces of the characters and the absence of shading of the faces the lack of synchrony of the lips with the speeches of the characters the clear evidence that the old unresolved insects i send this petition as a request as a humble and faithful fan for ubisoft to correct the issues mentioned above believing that assassins creed iii actually received when it was released in 2012 a deserving audien it has better graphics than black flag this was remastered already 121 love stealthily killing these guards he is like cant touch this 248 i dont know where he thought he was going should i get this or ac unity wonderful gameplay 456 he survived but when i kick a blighter off a boat to another boat he dies kinda wish the music didnt totally overtake the sound effects for example the voices from the soldiers and the bombs but other than that good stuff especially fighting the jgers at the end well i really loved all of the video i never knew you could use a toolpistol in a chain kill animation up until today lolso i went ahead and tried doing it a few times in this video hope you enjoy they should have removed the modern day trash from ac3 lol my dad bought this for me for xmas youtube is spying on me was going to try it on the switch but cant find myself playing ac3 if its not on playstation i hav assaasins creed black flag an aassins ceed 3 this was my favorite game and i had a lot of childhood memories with this game im so happy they remastered it i was playing the tyranny of king washington dlc for the remaster on ps4 and i was experiencing some glitches where the game was in a cutscene in the betrayal episode and a blue coat plus benjamin franklin were not speaking between the frames of the dialogue of the subtitles could you please fix this glitch i still like playing assassin creed 3 this is low key the best ac in terms of controls and story line ubsoft thank you very much for your attention to brazil you are a respected company here when are you guys remastering the first assassins creed game could be pretty sick playing it in xbox one playstation 4 i was excited about the graphics for remastered but theres barely a difference in the faces and environments am i just tripping its the 21st century and youre still running around with only a tiny knife for protection cuts to triple kill with hidden blade i always believe that i was the only one who loved this game and still do i like how he mentions and says when assassins creed creed 3 remastered comes out for xbox ps4 and pc players and then pauses for a solid 3 seconds and then mentions twitch like i dont think he wanted assassins creed remastered for twitch lmao 4 is still the best the idea of pirate itself is giving the feelings of freedom from the tyranny of the greedy governments and i have a fuckin ship looks like a different game from xbox version of 3 tru or untrue i was literally waiting for this game to be remastered is it coming in ps vita you should be play it ok just send me location conor knowing what kind of man washington was the concept of the tyranny of king washington is really dumb lol sometimes i think of my high moral conscience as a road block to the point where i dont wanna kill the blue coats should i ac died after ac3 black flag is acceptable what is the difference about remarstard and normal the only thing i hate about this game is that red coats are british every time i kill one sorry my great great great great great grandfather never played ac3 back when it first released but i am loving nearly every moment so far on the switch couple missions were just incredibly frustrating for a short minute bunker hill defending the bridge before or afterwards to name them hopefully ubisoft will port over black flag or the ezio collection to the switch in the thumbnail connor looks like shay patrick cormac i think its cool if they make assassins creed in horror zombie game ezio collection please great game i really like the story but some times i used to fail to sleep while playing it gets a little boring sometimes hello why the game is still not available even in predownload on the nintendo eshop ive played al of thoose on xbox 360 and im really excited ac 3 is my favourite ac hopefully ubisoft will bring black flag rogue to the switch to go along with this bring prince of persia back please anyone has the r2 sprinting problem with the ps4 version it doesnt allow me to run no matter how many times i hit the r2 button looks shitty shadows textures etc but can i play the multiplayer mode 7 years later and still dont like this game mainly because of its ending i miss desmond 0049 ive finished main story but ive never seen that woman there is no shortcut on my desktop or in games section of uplay for acliberation how should i start to play liberation i dont get it the next remastered should be ac4 black flag dont buy it at full price all ubisoft have done is turned up the saturation brightness and contrast i am absolutely disgusted with the laziness how come the remasterd version looks worse you guys should do the same to the first and second game plz ubisoft please give us multiplayer in this game just give us the old one update this game and doing it please help me is multiplayer available in this remastered edition make a ac game with ac unitys parkour and movement good story and ac odysseys graphics and ac 3s optimisationfor pc the visuals are garbage still feels like im playing on 360 who all want assassins creed 2 remastered sadly this game does no justice for the assassins tomahawk so much so that id rather use the bubble shaped replica in the game instead at least i might get more out of it lol but seriously ive learned to throw and use tomahawks throwing knives kunai and multiple machete blades and spears even but i only prefer 1 or 2 of them the tomahawks first and kukri second being how this tomahawk is in the game is a bit less weight than other types it could do less damage but no at the same time possibly cause lighter handle kinda like a kukri in a way meaning at least 1 point for faster speed in game and funny enough stronger than they make it out to be by sequence 8 sadly the only thing worth using in new york by then in game that i got are the assassins blades and flint lock pistol worst part is guards wont be even close enough to notice but upon getting the hit on the first tax collector you have less than 34 a second till 20 or 30 guards are all on top of you and t i can wait to work with george washington again my pc have intel i7 8th gen nvidia geforce gtx 1050 8gb ram but playing this game still lagging can someone help me i have too much game is it making lag you added manual aiming but couldnt fix the atrocious horse controls ubisoft some cutscenes dont look as good lighting still needs to be fixed my boy haytham aintlooking so good no more theater scene needs improvements too character faces need to be improved had one cutscene shoot me outtave the outfit i was wearing and back into the assassin one think it was the cutscene before you go steal the guard outfit as connor also textures in some spots still need fixing so does characters randomly appearing outta nowhere random but what if ubisoft d8d a ac game where you could sail from egypt to greece to italy and even masyaf so many games take place near eachother the easter eggs would be off the charts have it take place after ezios life idk sorry for the no ac3 related comment lol loved this game and cant believe its been almost 7 years excited to go back i honestly liked liberation better than 3 better story better game mechanics better characters better etc funny how if you buy the game pass in ac odyssey it said youd get ac 3 remastered for free still says i have to pay for it like ill ever fall for that again thanks ubisoft you should of just payed your taxes the part about the cannon actually sounded a bit misleading to me you ony get to use it for like half a mission beautiful lets hope ac 2 ii brotherhood revelation full remake not just remastering damn the remastered version looks so good great game and i think the graphics are greatly improved not a fan of the lighting and texturing on faces though it makes them look like plastic so theres only light reflecting off the skin and no color gradation but thats easy with a patch fix down the road prince of persia return please please please please please please please i cant be the only one who thought it said assassins creed emastered in the thumbnail this was the worst ac game where is imagine dragon radioactive trailer remastered there is a lot of improvements but character models are a joke i dont recommend until they fix that and looking at the material they are showing its noticeble how they are avoiding cutscenes they know its that bad im an ac fanboy but dont love the last few renditions theyre too big and the settings too far back but like i said they did a great job i think liberation remastered are better then assassins creed 3 remastered i teu both of them and it was not what i expect they did a really nice work to try to bring the game back das not enough like graphics are ok but the mechanism should be better like origina and odissey the react of bayek and alexios are better faster agility etc on the pc its framerate is 60 63 fps cappedpc gamers with 144hz or higher monitors are screwed by this remaster yeah yeah yeah but can we have brotherhoods multiplayer back well done ubisoftu made me buy it i missed this game so much thank you guys halfassins cred but we already know all that you know it is nolan north doing the narrative this is one of the best features where you call a group of assasins hope i see it in then next game from the franchase this is one of the best game series ever started in 2008 and still one of the best memorable games best assassin creed series remaster ac black flag cool i never got to play it ac3 was the best one nathan drake telling me about ac iii did that guy just say that on may this will be released on the switch well what am i suppsoed to choose now between pc and switch ok all i see is the same game the graphics doesnt even improve that much is it a remastered or just a new colour filter i played the game musket and gun sounds didnt changed im so disappointed the multiplayer will be available as well i love assassins creed saga but i think there is 2 problem with it first they come out to fast and too many they should wait a bit to release the next one in order to improve en previous one much more second they all are kind of the same that will kill the franchise couldve at least made some accurate uniforms the franchise peaked with ac3 imo how did they manage to do a remaster thats not as pretty as the lastest games in the series connor edward and ezio where easily one of the best assassins in the ac series in my opinion not to mention assassins creed unity was the last actual assassins creed game if you people in the comments section know what i mean oh how i miss crowd blending ill try to pick it up cant wait assassins creed 4 remake aswell who knew more about the revolution war in this game just finished the game can we have the ac 3 controls back for newer games odyssey sucks next assassin creed game takes place in stone age now remastrer ac1 time to redownload assassins creed 4 and the ezio collection i have the ezio collection and assassins creed 4 and no assassins creed 3 wheres that assassins creed 1 remastered the game looks the same just give us a damn new prince of persia im just tired of ac we need achievements on steam guys pls a remaster noone asked for ac 3 looks decent at current standarts the game that would appreciate a remaster is ac 1 ok but what about black flag if i got the ac3 already will i got automatically the remastered or i need to buy it ac3 is one of my favorite games of all time and when i saw this in my reccomended i was h y p e s why not remaster ac 2 the best assassins creed ever made 258 jesus christ they gave connor the michael jackson treatment homestead missions were awesome it felt like i was the part of it i enjoyed them more than main story please do assassins creed 2 remastered ubisoft has it got coop or multyplayer if they can recreate the magic that was ac black flag thats all i want odyssey was amazing but i feel like they tried to merge black flag an orgins into one game the new ac is not meant for old school creed players that want stale asssasination animations and parkour gameplay i loved building the village it was so much fun anf they evolved over time shame connors story wasnt contuined he was such a kind character and the love and respect he had for the animals was beautiful and tbh he could of used humour at times but thata okay i loved playing connor either way just disappointed we never got to see where the rest of his story went he had so much more room to grown into a much wiser and better perosn glad the dlcs are free though only issue is some of the graphics to the faces just need a tweek but other than that epic game well done amazing such a good game thank you 143 got me all excited again to see desmond those missions were really fun great now put a battle royal mode in it and your game will even sell better wow water effects didnt change totally worth it to waste money ubisoft deffiniting remaster is so boring this is where the ac story truly ended along with its amazingly fun multiplayer there are famous hideandseek multiplayer games nowadays that ac brotherhoodac4 would have as a small gamemode and it was by far my favorite out of any multiplayer games gonna admit wasnt expecting thisreally ever wheres splinter cell disappointing lazy remastering low polygonality a strange choice of color filter the game is not like the modern game of 2019 this is shame i miss ac pvp multiplayer the real assessing is back hopefully they fix all the bugs and give us the option to skip the beginning cash app me 40 dollars please i wanna buy this game so bad but my parents dont have the means to give me the money for it my cashapp kennyslacks if your feeling generous i cant say that im not excited but im also pretty realistic the remaster looks a little bit pathetic graphically and with no new additional content itll be a bit difficult to decide whether or not this will be of interest i loved assassins creed 3 and i think its a great game out of the series my problems from the series are the lack of variety when it comes to side missions the present day missions for the most part are pretty lame and ezio is one of the only charismatic or loveable characters even though i enjoy connor as a protagonist he is a bit naive and as a side note on the side missions seriously who wants to play the same tailing mission and bounty mission 30 times over i dont think this remaster is a bad idea but at least add some sort of new content who knows maybe the graphics do look really good and im just trash but im probably going to buy it and enjoy it so i hope anybody who picks this up will enjoy it as much as i did well at least the fires look better wow seeing this you can tell how gaming went a few steps back look at all this mechanics god did i have fun with the brotherhood thing and just free roaming and killing red coats this was the revolution in the mechanics then the black flag came another masterpiece of a game new mechanics original story characters and worlds and what do we get in these years reskinned hack and slash grind fest games ac had its charm its secrecy its creepy reallife story that you were actually interested in we lost all that to compulsive buy or to not compulsive buysmh perfect timing i just started playing old games again nice game got it yesterday 8 in glad to see a lot of people have come around to ac3 now that years have passed the death of ac i really want desmond back but at the same time i guess theres no way to bring him back again since he is gone in this one im heartbroken i loved the ideas ac3 tried to bring i just wish the missions were better and that they didnt take so many liberties with the history especially since unlike the other ac games a lot was known about this era and easy to look into i didnt like connor being the spark for the revolutionary war and desmonds ending left a bitter taste in my mouth and left the series in shambles that took them like 8 years to get back on track not counting ac4 thats really its own thing one of my all time favorite games spent a lot of money on the special edition on ps3 and a lot of hours in this game the weopons the fighting system is really great i remember picking up fights with redcoats and killing them endlessly it would have been better if they remade ac1 or ac2 they are older games and actually need refurbishing unlike ac3 thats relatively ok when it comes to graphics of now days they are just lazythey didnt change much anywaybesides imo except for ac black flag every ac game from 3 and afterwards sucks sry but anyone who thinks this is the best ac game is just retarded conor was strong yes but he was a blank person with no character with his only emotional behavior being a whiny bith while oddysey and origins have a lot of grinding the gameplay is superior in every way yes even the combat sure its not really ac game anymore but i prefer that instead of a retarded ac game anyone who says conor had the sickest fighting of all is simply blind because there are like exactly 10 kill moves and thats it when you kill entire armies its simply repetetive and boring assassins creed japan please did they fix the ridiculous optional objectives i remember one mission where you had to dump tea in the ocean from a ship and it had you do 3 air assassinations with a musket even though you couldnt because you were in conflict and there was no way of getting a musket i miss the instant kill and actually planning your move days now its just darksouls i almost forgot that liberation did exist too completed it again already very fun despite a few bugs what do you mean by black flag and odysey i cant spell that what about rouge please add multiplayer i am so fucking happy that thus happens xp stealth was not good in ac3 after the 10th time of replaying the ship sabotage mission for 100 i just stopped those enemy ai could see me shoot a bow from the boat everything looks fantastic except the damn character models uggh such a shame you had one job ubisoft the game itself is amazing the environments are amazing the characters models ehhhhhhhh the face like plastic that game was a glitched mess when it was released and the main character was borderline unbearable the combat was exceptional unlike the pile that is odyssey and assassin creed odyssey is not assassin game anymore started with syndicate looked forward to this after 1st mission im done models look atrocious controls are clunky everything looks awful 2012 wasnt that long ago to warrant the its old excuse dishonored the walking dead both had their own recent ps4 remaster and look phenomenal mass effect 3 etc etc were also released that year and still look great this just ugh this was my first ac game i dont care about good frame rates i care about good assasins creed game all this game is is an example of how whiny native americans are about their land i wonder the switch could run black flag or unity why couldnt they do this to black flag instead god damnit can we have odyssey 2 to be made i love spartan kinda stuff and its thrilling gameplay great cutscenes look awful the big question here is if im now able to put on the hoodie after connor gets his mohawk that always bugged me in the original game they need ac 2 remastered or brotherhood please update the sea mecanics to the one used in blackflag its great to see the game that got me into ac god damnit i just bought ac 4 for my ps4only if i knew they were remastering this i hope they keep the all the funny rag doll glitchs new connors face looks horrible you shouldve remastered rogue too tho the original is way better please start doing the old combat in assassins creed games again no one liked 3 and if they said they did they either didnt play it or they are lying lets keep a moment of silence for those who died saving the world desmondlivesinourhearts are we gonna get online play i miss online please have multiplayer i was number one ranked in artifact assault in the world middle school memories nintendo switch can they remaster black flag thats my favorite and my xbox 360 doesnt work anymore i wanna enjoy king washington but its hard to when i actively prevented people from taking absolute control this game was lame and stupid af when it was out on 360 and ps3 remastered still looks stupid the only assassins creed game i ever played im playing assassins creed rouge remastered now when this come out im going to get it on my obox and my nintendo switch so is this game made in canada or merica og assassins creed more than 30 bucks isnt fair for this game it ll be awesome ahh i miss pressing the same attack buttons over and over anyone remember this 343 assassins creed 4 black flag please oh boy the assassins creed game that made me stop playing until odyssey how do you run faster when i keep pressing r2 connor runs kinda slow i wish you reremastered assassins creed rogue the point where we can actually dive deeper into each characters story like how hope and shay had a thing more sequences and most of all the hooded templar costume how to make it look like a remaster and call it a day piss filter ay heres an idea just make a brand new classic ac game ezio said it himself in ac 2 choose your own way do not follow anyone else and yet yall just rebranded witcher and abandoned the classic stabby boys we grew up with the only way id play this was if pulled an edward and committed piracy im wanted to share something about this game i remember first started playing i was 14 i had this girlfriend at the time and we use to sit down at my place she would play pokemon on her device while i was on my xbox playing this game every single night we would just play games till 7 clock in the morning and go get breakfest so as i was wondering through this game like it was something i could only dream of it had everything the wild life the people at the farms living their lifes and sometimes it was just something powerful meaning to it its real simple but this game and all other ac games are just absolute medicine for the soul beautiful peaceful and fun so as i eventually learned how the game works or how to get gold and so on i figured out out of a map in the game there was a spot where these wild bears would just spawn endlessly and yall who know what im talking about know that the bears were rare and could be worth alot of gold so there i am waiting and waiting ti this game was fan but killing his own father was sad if you have the gold edition for assassins creed odyssey then youll get both remasters installed for free right ac 2 remastered no ok assassin creed 1 remaster still waiting they are starting to make ac games for nintendo switch or just ac 3 remastered im still waiting for ac 4 remastered my favorite ac time to take my tomahawk out this game is sweet pls do asassins creed philippines its all about spanish and americans yeah man thats dope not the ac1 or full remaster ac 2 brotherhood revolutions but ac 3 really 30 bucks for some extra ray tracing might actually buy this game for the switch wait connor isnt english hes welsh right edward kenway was from swansea which is the city of wales which would make haytham kenway welsh therefore connor is half native american half welsh 15trumps ubi thankyou really want it but 7999 is a little step for a remaster just cant afford it fs man red dead redemption 2 has truly spoiled me yeah still doesnt look good tbh damm i used to love this i was 7 or8 but i loved this why would washington become a king this is the same as ac32012 but the guy explaining as if it is a new concept is marvelous another remaster to exploit peoples love of the older games to get that sweet cash cause theyre too uncreative to make a new intresting one boring game go play ac4black flag instead ac3 ending was crazy almost everything connor did was for nothing his allies screwed him over and proved to be hypocrites why not remaster the first ac the graphics assassins creed vikings i want assassins creed black flag remastered as a returning fan im still waiting for my update to finish im so hyped to be playing as my favorite assassin connor again im also looking forward to the dlcs too has the remastered will get hungarian subtitles because the original got the end is near 4k addon content for back flag ubisoft needs to take a good look at the naval combat in this game 10times better than acbf or rogue what a damn shame cause naval combat was a huge part of bf but it was boring and grindy i love whole ac series except odyssey though it has all those great graphics stuff but has very dull storyline and boring in gameplay how is it the games graphics look way better in the trailer than the original game that i just started playing thought there will be no glitches in this one but i thought wrong i was just in the first sequence fixing the mast ropes and helping a friend whos hanging on the top i was sitting on the mast while suddenly haytham seemed to fly to the sky right before the cutscene happens where the fool falls down holding a rope and we got 30 seconds to help him and the second one was when the assasins creed scout reveals himself and fights haytham i countered his strikes while standing in front of a barrel to smash his face in and it just spawned us a bit to the left before the smashing happened almost like haytham had the power of teleportation wow ubisoft you really wont change your trademark glitches ever right the assassins creed woke remastered bundle enjoy cool hopefully they fixed that mission where ur having a vision when u visit the old lady it used to get make my screen go completely white and i wasnt able to get 100 sycn its a cool game but 40 euros for this game ill pass maybe next time it doesnt even look that improved i like ac 3 more than most people do but this doesnt even offer anything new what is wrong with modern days developers they started remaster every single game today yes this is not for the fans but for the money that way they ruined the original ac3 dont get me wrong i like ac3 but whyyy remastered version original should stay original imagine that someone remaster a victor igo book les miserables jesus that excessive brown filter makes it look dated though i really miss the combat systems from ac3 and the other old games the one we have today is so unrealistic enemies are just gliding around like they are wearing rollerblades and all this special effects when blocking sword traces etc sucks yeah awesome literally this game was my childhood fixed the ac odyssey parkour please best assasin creed i feel like people gonna hate but ac3 was my fav ac game ever who agrees we need a black flag remaster too the lighting looks truly beautiful couldnt you have brought ship mechanics from black flag actually its a lot better after releasing these mechanics in rogue and ac4 you return to the old one what did you actually change in this game i mean did you even work at it we all love money even most easy some but still if you have fans and ppl wholl buy this game you cant just spit into their faces with the same old game which includes some changes you could have brought something best from other games what ppl liked in this game series i miss recruiting assassins and leveling them up what have you done to connors face please tell me its just xbox or px4 ugly graphics remaster black flag please ubi watered down red dead redemption 2 back when assassins creed was good how many fools can i kill today who killed that kids in this game black flag remastered please can we get another black flag is this remastered footage my first and favorite ac game if only i could run the game definitely buying this this is the assassin creed i love i dont like the new fighting system it makes it like a rpg with all those customize i hope splinter cell black list is next on the list for a remastered 4k experience make watch dogs 3 on e3 2019 i cant wait to play this on nintendo switch now where wheres black flag i think they could have done better with the some physics and other stuff instead just remastering the graphics thats what i call assassins creed i dont like the face texture its the 21st century and you re still running around with only a tiny knife for protection yeah assassins creed iii demastered man they really ruined this great series this fir me is true creed im loving the new games also despite then being lengthy but brotherhood was king also good to see it get the remaster so younger folks can get the chance to me this was pre witcher not that i didnt like assassins creed 3 in fact i played it over 18 time back when i only had 2 games and it was what got me invested in de assassins creed series however i fell that remastering the ezio colection specially brotherhood and revalations would be much more rewarding since they were and still are very popular or even the black flag story love ubis games though they are the company which created my most played games apart from bungie it looks so plasticy i had no idea desmond had a option to use a gun cause it doesnt tell you his fighting style i love this game thankyou youll bring alot of nostalgia back yall better remaster black flag too that was the best ac hands down im sure it took a lot of hard work but essentially all this is is added hdr better framerate optimization and slightly cleaner 4k than the original pc version i was really hoping for more of what 343i did to halo 2 anniversary new higher resolution character models richer audio and stunning cg cutscenes i think they couldve saved time money by not bothering to work on this or just made this a silent passion project only released it when it would be ready to contend with something like h2a i think if ac3 had the gameplay and graphics of unity the game would be perfect if anyone knows do you get ac3 remastered if u allready bought it thank god the only good assassin creed in years is finally getting a remastered this is the original assassin not like odyssey no fucking way i played and beat the original and thought that was it for the 3rd but no they remastered it definitely im buying it dear developers please make a continuation of assassins creed 1 we dont have enough altair please return it we dont have enough of our predatory eagle and i hope you create it please make it continue i cant live without it you can make a game where it is still young or in old age how he killed al mualim and make pieces of assassins creed revelations create a game i beg you i love the whole franchise of your games but i dont have enough continuations about altair when the combat system was actually enjoyable orgins combat is not good seriously replay a gamecome on just make better games im sorry but 40 dollars is a bit too expensive for this wow nice the lighting better this is not a remaster this a lighting update assassin creed 3 are now not available on steam yes my favorite game to parkour in is back i used to run around the frontier for hours just jumping from treetotree and killing whatever i happen to see move xd 334 u know what i will play now i wish they brought back the multiplayer modes that was on of the other good things i liked bout the old assassins creed games the real question is will we continually be forced to use that festival of awful that is uplay wish it was black flag instead the music sounds epic whats going on with skull bones maybe this time running in cities doesnt cause the game to run in 40fps no matter what the settingspc remaster black flag next because it was hands down the greatest is it free this was the best assassins creed game thank you ubisoft why not 1 or 2 wow ubisoft take the concept of dlc to next level rebuying for replace the texture pack it should be like workshop mods like skyrim has or enb of gta increasing the resolution or frame rate isnt a remaster one of the best stuff is that you can assassinate from a horse wonder why origins does not have such a thing im glad that i bought ac odyssey gold edition so i can play ac 3 remastered now just remaster blackflag and sit back while the money comes in ubisoft imagine they made my trilogy with ac odysseys graphics the modern day died with desmond but no multiplayer xd ubisoft nobody asked for this game to get a remasterway did you guys do it there are tons of ps3 and xbox 360 copies of this game at your local game store there giving them away for next to nothing so away way did you guys remastered assassin creed 3 i love this game and i cant wait for this remastered version to go on sale no way imma buy the same game that i already have but slightly better at a full game price we need ac1 with unity mecanism how do i access it i have the season pass but i cant get it please help actually one of my favorite ubisoft games the combat and soundtrack are astonishing and so is the colonial america setting glad this is being rereleased blown awayby ac3r thanks ubisoft connors attacks look so deadly and precise compared to most assassins hes a beast probably inherited the brutality of his grandfather and the precision of his father when my teacher ask me how i passed apus did you remaster the optimization too because i remember it as being quite bad at the time any chance for steam achievements in an update connor is such a stubborn he thinks that he can solve any problem with a blade does the remastered game have any new features awe hell yeah ac3 liberation was the first video game i ever played time to revisit 7 year old mes favorite past time okay its ubisoft so im guessing theyre making us pay for the game again instead of it being a free upgrade ill just wait for the switch version man the ship combat was so dope it made black flag my favorite i miss this so much looks the same they needed to bring in the scalping because that is a native american tradition is this even remastered it looks so similar but im pretty hyped for it its not on the us psn i got shooters dressed in all red sir archduke savage brandy of charleston and 21st in line for the royal throne wow why even bother 3 sucked and connor was boring i want assassins creed black flag remastered 3 will always be my favorite never finished ac3 it was the first trash ac hey my favourite assassins creed is getting remastered my download needs to hurry up assassins creed iii orange edition i just wish they had changed the combat to make it more difficult i didnt like you could kill up to 100 enemies with just 2 buttons with no effort ahmm hei ubisoft remember a trailer assassin creed 3 that connor just 1 v army like a badass i want that that broad u guys added should be a character for kitchen game modes not a assassin we want discovery tour best ac game hands down ezio is overrated change my mind i wish i could get it but my parents arent gonna get me it i could already tell minimal graphics change boy do i feel an april fools prank switch is my go to for this then pc they always mess up on the faces with the remasters syndicate the new combat system doesnt feel like ac man heck even the new ac games dont feel like ac pls bring back all the good old stuff so many filthy casuals the day desmond died i thought they would have a replacement but we never got that so i accepted the game would die and now we aint even an assassin anymore were a mercenary we dont do stealth no more but for some reason we got super powers o and templars arent are worries at the moment however its just my honest opinion tho this was my first and favorite ac it might seem all nice with better lighting but if you compare the character textures and details its weirdly a clear downgrade you can find some comparison videos that show the differences before you buy do i have to buy the game again assassins creed remastered 1 they need a civil war era assassins creed ya kno when ac was still ac would have been better if you made a remastered ezio trilogy connor kenway its the best assassin of assassin cred would be cool if they included that aveline bonus mission from ac4 this was like the shittiest ac games with the shittiest protagonists whyd they reboot this damn those outlines they should have hud fully customizable remastered version should have no fucking loading screens and have more destructible environments havent played this so im really interested theres so much content omg that axe spinnin was it in the original i have never seen it really wanted them to take away that slomo when youre in combat really really hated it for me this was the first ac i ever played and i loved it now seeing that its getting remastered makes me so happy since i switched from my old playstation 3 to an xbox one and not being able to play it anymore long things short i want this motherflippin piece of art second third and fourth assassin s is best i really love this tipe of fight i payed for the seasons pass but it wont let me download the game wtf and this is only for ac odyssay season pass yay back to when assassins creed games were actually about assassination not fighting mythical creatures when will the game be available on the the us playstation store because as of now its not on there man i loved ac3 i played the assassins creed in this order ac2ac3ac1ac black flagac originsand ac odyssey the modern day is still the worst part just remaster brotherhood and ac2 already 300 great now i want assassins creed black flag remastered assassins creed with assassins its funny to say but its truenow is assassins souls look at the face its like mass effect andromeda where the face and eyes looks lifeless who wanted remaster ac3 from what i saw on forums and more stuff everyone wanted remake of ac12 and brotherhood noone listen to players it looks the same xd 037 nice face you got their connor is it out for xbox one already as if it wasnt enough releasing yearly ac they decided to remaster it ubisoft bring back splinter cell and prince of persia back please stop being lazy probably a cannon u can use that was like in 1 mission lol also included is the drm that will lower your performance and cause constant lag spikes all free of charge i cant find ac3 in the store oh my goodness how do we statt ac3 ubisoft shouldve remastered black flag no multiplayer no purchase get a cheaper better version on steam the older version has all the content this was my favorite on the 360 i loved this game worst game in the series still waiting for it people in eastern time arnt able to get it yet i have the season pass not cool ubisoft black flag would have been cooler quebec studio made the dlc no wonder it was a broke mess more like assassins creed iii not downgraded versiom sucks steam version dont unlock for another 4 n a half hours would love to play assassins creed 3 remastered if i can get past the loading screen i didnt get it where do i find it i have the season pass i love the parkour and how brutal conor can be half mohawk you mean half native american half english is the framerate still capped at 62 fps on pc because if so that is super disappointing im soooo fucking happy i remember this game came out when i graduated high school and has been my fav assassins creed game to this day i love this game i even bought washington dlc at the time when they were releasing different parts separately connor design is the best i just hope they keep the online multiplayer that way more people will play how do i download on ps4 cant find it hey march 29th is my birthday black flag remaster please um yea its 5 am here in the usa on march 29 where is the game on playstation store is it just me or do the graphics look really bad the last time ubisoft cared about the lore present time 1776 will commence again man im so happy they did ac3 remastered its the only one i never played thats they should have gone with black flag this is the ac we want go back to the tight townscities where we can parkour across rooftops and not have to rely on horses to get around everywhere upgrade the textures jesus theyre so flat and bleh and same with the models too ok your website says game was supposed to be available 3 hours ago on ps4 wheres the dam game i really want an assassins creed 1 remastered cant wait to play these and to think i got them as part of a season pass definitely the best season pass ever ubisoft has really started out doing themselves the division 2 and its nonaggressive microtransactions meaning you can earn everything the by grinding and playing and free games with a season pass for a new game definitely becoming one of my favorite game companies aciii ultra setttings in master race xd id love to see an assassins creed like game set in world war one tried to download at midnight but its not there ive waited so long wish they made a coop freeroam ac 335 hello friend gets stabbed all i did was wave at you its 1 am the 29th have the gold edition of oddessy where my ac ubisoft can we pre order it before launch or no because i dont see it on the playstation store how to history exam once nailed all the answers from playing assassins creed hey ubisoft are yall going to make another brother in arms what time does it come out im not getting anything yet man bro they shouldve added multiplayer i cant wait till it floppes and is put on ps now cause free trials are easy to do over and over again i love gaming for free can we finally perform the trailer shot in the game will you please patch the faces ubisoft can we get rtx with this please im not gonna complain cause i am happy i loved this game best one imo keep it up 2020 remaster the assassins creed 1 and bloodlines please ubi 3 the remastered version looks great never cared for the present day missions in any of the games my thoughts are more time should be spent in the animus less time out of it graphics look exactly the same so whats the point of buying the remastered version if u have the original looking forward to playing this game again for me the absolute best game in the franchise outside of origins cant wait for tomorrow thats hot all i want is connors king washington outfit available in the main game that never happened on the original version and i was super disappointed are u fck kidding me remastered this is the worst remastered game i ever saw is basically the same even way worse then the original in some parts its just a reshade pack basically textures are the same and most of the things are exaclty the same remastered my i need brotherhood remaster those animations ac3 was my favorite by far two questions one will it look like the game play youre showing us or better two whats the price is multiplayer included i miss the old ac with its more linear story and emphasis on stealth too bad my digital ps4 version has a black screen right after the intro screen please fix this asap ubisoft wheres charles lee great nowwe just need the remaster of the first one this game was garbage and ubi decided to remaster this oh dude i cant even get 20 fps on low in original ac 3 how much is it gonna be love this game so very much man i wish i could work for ubisoft i have so much nostalgia from this game just recently visited it for the first time in a while and not gonna lie i got a little teary eyed from how amazing this story was and the soundtrack was great when you out of ideas for assassins creed games ive personally wanted to see the samurai or ninja period tbh odyssey is better than ac3 ma boys back unlike other large devs and publishers like ea ubisoft has really gotten their act together and really listen to feedback and are very active with their community while still not perfect what studio is ubisoft has really gained back my respect and trust since origins odyssey and r6 sieges revival bravo ubi i look forward to the remaster my opinion this is the one where they fucked up the story in these games gone was the intrigue and insanely good mysterious scifi vibe the past 4 games had set up and this one fucked it all up why one achievementlist for both games on xbox so excited thank you guys walking through the fronteir at night is pretty relaxing ngl stop tryna church it up ubisoft all yuh had to say is we changed the filter on the whole game lml but it would have been cool if they added a new dlc with connor shay and arno in it i would lose it if they did please in the future make that happen theyre really running out of ideas aciii american history test who was responsible for paul reveres ride connor the boston tea party connor washingtons surprise attack after crossing the delaware connor the battle of yorktown a combination of strategy and the colonists commitmentlol jkconnor sure hopeful the game doesnt look that bad when it gets remastered i love the american native language i played ac3 on xbox 360 but i loved the story and the side missions so much i might just get it i didnt even play the dlc missions so its definitely a steal seriously can not wait just a few more hours okay a few more days with my south african internet but i am so excited rebuilding the davenport homestead using the rope dart surviving that section of the frontier where there seems to be no end to the wolves and challenging that crazy lady to a fist fight do the people who bought the og get it for free we need black flag remake i mean new engine and graphics not remastered ac 3 is already cracked xd did they remaster connors personality too its amazing how companies can remake old games and sell it for full price im still buying tho because this was my childhood and in 4k i cant say no ubi take note because this game had good detail and mechanics not everything was open world god the multiplayer is hella fun when a season pass content game is more assassins creed than the actual purchased game please tell me youre gonna remaster all the assassin games please boston tea party here i come p wonder if they sell it for 5999 even though i got the assassins creed americas pack for 1999 disappointed already game still looks bland a little brighter and sharper thats really all yes 3 was my fav one this is exciting im sad theres no multiplayer though it was so much fun assassins creed 3 was my first and favorite of the series i would love to play this version if i had the money better not see a 60 price tag on that i am still new to the ac games i have enjoyed them all so far i am going to get this asap i love connors story but this video is so full of lies the gameplay looks exactly the same even the air assassinations still glitch when connor lands on the enemies it wasnt a revolution conner had his moments but was mainly unlikeable the ending was disappointing the gameplay was climb trees just blergg thanks i was a big fan of the original ac3 i think i am going to enjoy the remastered i unfortunately skipped this game when it came out but im glad i get to play it with all of its content now remastered 300 it honestly felt intense with connor shouting for the cannons to fire too much advertising for a remaster like i know it looks good and add new stuff but geez ubisoft you dont even promote your new game this hard lol great job ubisoft i waiting for tomorrow to try this game i am inspired specially since i didnt play original of this hey its the host of vjdjagame apocalypse podcast why didnt you remove the knowledge ac 3 and 4 prolly have the best fighting system imo thebritishdidnothingwrong the only thing i hate about new assasins creed games is that the enemys have health bars witch kinda ruins the vibe for me bring the online next ghostreconfuturesoldier remastered or remake or whatever this is by far one of the best assassins creed games gonna have to try and remake my connor cosplay now from ubisoft fair enough not buying i wanted new parkour model nice remaster assassins creed 2 next time does it have unitys parkour ubisoft please update those ugly wax faces are you for real dropping a remaster like this this must be a joke what about the multiplayer mode will that be in the game are you really advertising ac3 in 2019 lol have you really gotten that desperate the visual mod pack i used for my pc on the original game still looks better ac3 and rogue were my favourite games and they are both getting remastered my favorite part naval combat fingers are still crossed for an assassins creed based during the civil war or perhaps the war of 1812 or maybe the mexican american war during the 1840s i cant wait for new players that played ezio collection do the homestead mission first pls to think that i am a big fan of this game i cant tell that this remastered version is better than the old one the difference is not that much ubisoft check call of duty modren warfare remaster and learn to remaster what could have been cool is i can put my hood onoff animation i know the answer already they didnt do it is mp back i cantttt waittttt just release it ive never played it and im hyped add more naval combat for me naval combat in this game was better than black flag seems so real ac3 was my favorite ac game cant wait cant believe its been 7 years since the original ac 3 first came out is ac 1 next look at the color pallet it increased they should redo the first assassins creed but not remastered instead they should completely remake the game at least the altar part in the new engine and call it assassins creed reborn or something similar ok but can you crouch wtf ubi no one care about ac3 make ac2brotherhood revelation remastered and call it ezio edition or something ac3 is bar far most forgettable one in series im in the middle of another playthrough with the 360 version and i forgot how terrible the foliage looks still an enjoyable story though im not sure if its worth buying a remaster faces are scary o we need another templar game i think after world war 2 story or after 19 century i think we will then have timeline set in 2020 century and play as desmond without any ancestor memory thing just think about it a modern day assassins creed game and climbing on a skyscraper that would be awesome damn now i want a black flag remaster i still think its funny they decided to make a main weapon for liberation a machete that jason voorhees would probably use lol i miss ezio the ezio series imagine the ezio series with ac3 animations and climbing the progression in ac2 and brotherhood were so fun also acb multiplayer was my favorite multiplayer rip am tired of remasters i only liked this game because connor looked awesome in the trailers and game covers and obviously the bow 60fps lock on pc assassins creed 3 was bad and odyssey is top 3 in the series change my mind i already know wat to except cough cough no choice ending cough cough cant wait to actually play a real assassins creed game again its been a long time where can i get it at dont change that conner is boring to listen to happy they didnt do the same kind of enemies as the last to you know with the health bars look english aint ma first or sec lanuage still havent updated the horrible ui man ill cry if they remaster assassins creed ii ultimately its my favorite in the franchise still if i already have ac iii do i need to pay for it why not a better version of black flag my face right now wow is this the remaster that makes the gameplay and missions not unfinished and total shite when this game is actually better than oddysey this was the last game that truly felt like assassins creed to me everything after focused on the gimmicks of being a pirate being a gangster and being a spartan the creed has taken a back seat in recent years i cant wait to jump back into this one hopefully some day connor gets a sequel so his story can get its closure fans are oddly excited for a game that most of them call one of the worst in the franchise assassins creed 3 was my favorite out of the series atleast they could have made the sea like black flags sea ocean blue this ones still dull its tomorrow im so ready to play this magnificent game once again with improved graphics and gameplay im also glad they remastered liberation as well it looks much better than the first pc version they released especially enviroment grass trees water look very improved look better but not all that improvements oh yeah this is a thing only will buy if its 20 great now i can watch desmond die in 4k although its remastered it doesnt have the best graphics like odessey or origins 2019 ac 3 remastered 2020 ac4 remastered bbut i just bought ac3 plz remaster price of persia for current gen well i be able to get this on the playstation store tomorrow yo i cant wait to get this i loved this assassins creed due to me loving the history of the american revolution haythams sword play is so gentlemanly and elegant love it this was the 1st and last assassins creed i played everyone said assassins creed is such a great game so i got this 1 looking back wasnt a good choice to be honest anyway played this game when i brought for an hour thats it no more no less and because of this 1 game ive never played any assassins games at all pals say i should but after this 1 no way back when assassins creed was actually fun to play do rayman 4 please bring back desmond and the present day story in the next ac ubisoft nobody cares about that girl in the present whatever her name is the story and mechanics are way better than shitty ac odyssey cant wait till its ouch today they better have fixed the synchronization on ac3 hated that i had to just go around the map for it to be fully visible they better have fixed the synchronization on ac3 hated that i had to just go around the map for it to be fully visible ah yes the first game that blew me away with its snow indentation this is not remastered with graphics of 2015 or 2016 this is the assassins creed gameplay i miss so question do they add that original trailer battle scene or again 214 and then they said spartan kick is a new thing on odyssey you know what this isnt a remaster there are mods out there on pc that makes this game look beautiful that is a bad thing when modders can do a better job at making a game look beautiful than the original creators i really hope the first ac gets remastered remaster unity and this time finish it unity has the best gameplay hands down will it release tonight at 12am et is it just me or does conor look differently in every cutscene what about multiplayer we going to get online too im not ready for this game again yet i was so close to 100 sync pretty sure it was 97 but for some dumb reason i accidentally deleted my profile when trying to load it up ever since that day ive always been salty about this game that combat and music cant believe the animations for the new games have been so downgraded parkour is bland now the last games makes this one look good can we have multiplayer now remasters or remake the first game is there online when will this come on the playstation store wow this looks fantastic so glad i got the season pass ubisoft downgrades incoming for those newcomers side quests and homestead missions are so important if you dont play that you will be like wtf is this game why is conner white i loved this game definitely picking it up the mohawk gotta go man i just love how respectful this video is of what ac3 and liberation did for the franchise the visuals look like they were taken from the original version of the game is this or unity more fun i have all the ezio games and unity never got to try ac3 but im excited and then just looks at the nintendo switch edition the team who created ac 3 doc was decent but they went on to create the two worst ac games odyssey in m1y opinion is not an ac game or an rpg for years ive wanted my favorite game to be remastered connor is still to this day my favorite video game protagonist and i cannot wait to dive back into the animus as him once more isit me or is connor looking a lot less native last time i checked he wasnt that pale does it include multiplayer ubi thanks for upgrading this gameim glad i can play it againi dont get the hate it had something graphics even worse than in version of 2010 lol 427 oh yes the sound of that execution is still faster than animation therexddddd what happened to connor assasinscreed 3 yellow edition when i was younger me and my dad went to a game to buy ac3 a year before it came out we came out with 2 instead as 2 was the only ac game i hadnt played 7 years later and im so happy we brought 2 ive finished it 10 times and finished all side objectives back when ac was awesome ubisoft you all know what we want bring back desmond in ac games the last good game of ac i hated playing nine mens morris in black flag they even lag on the video what optimization or does it seem to me that the lags on the video you can play all of the ac games except the og on the current gen consoles thats pretty cool ubisoft is doing big things and i love it how much will this cost for origonal ac3 owners i cant wait omg this is gonna be a blast ubisoft we know that you are no longer interested in polishing ac 2 but please this is a request make a remaster of ac 2 that could also attract new generation gamers now as we have seen your fabulous remaster on ac 3 we also except you to again give life to ac 2 pleaseeeee is the lockpicking fixed can we have black flag next 428 glad to see those sound effects are still unsynchronized i wanna play right now so bad lets be honest the series died after black flag will they add the epilogue dialogue from connor into the remastered i hope they do shouldve remastered the first one the best game in the series is back assassins creed identity remastered please the only thing that would make this perfect is ambient music please ubisoft i implore you to add music while you walk the streets of boston and new york and weave through dense forests in the frontier look how they massacred my boy connor what a coincidence my last exam and ac3 releasing date are same guess what i can buy it and play it without any stress is there a pre download for season pass holders i cant wait for it to come out on the switch loved running threw nyc boston 24 more hours boyz this commentator makes it sound like you will experience something like never beforelies i know im gonna do all my ship upgrades cause grinding bears for hours took way too long to 100 will all of this be on nintendo switchs launch please add a online coop so i can have fun with my friends and make new one still a bad ac but at least it felt like an ac game for the most part unlike those things they dispatched as ac now hello again full synchronization miss that option in origins and odyssey my first assasins creed game forever loved im so stoked for this ive never played assassins creed 3 before this is by far my favorite ac game i cant wait to play through this game which hopefully fixes some of the bugs that were in the original gues ubisoft ran out of ideas play the game with better graphics lame and no ps3 edition remastered or repaired that game was so glitchy it marked the beginning of me not trusting the franchise anymore and i was right i uninstatlled this game because it use mouse to run rest of the controls sucks i hope this remastered will be like black flag controls plus is this coming to steam if not i cant get this game i dont have credit card im from poor village i dont live in us or europe based on the trailer it looks like the same game with better graphics will there be a physical copy is the guy talking desmond sounds like him finallyits out tomorrow for pcxbox and ps4 question can u digitaly download the stand alone version becase it aint on the ps store ill buy it no this game honestly had my favorite combat animations made you feel like a total badass graphics are awesome but connors face was seems better in ac 3 not remastered but graphics are awesome seems really good when assassins creed was assassins creed is it 60fps on consoles or not damn connor now lokks like a ghost or a zombie now do 4 and 2 please ubisoft i can t wait for black flag remastered i would rather play the original aciii even ac syndicate looked better than this remastered spending money to see a yellow tint and a slightly better resolution shadows seems pretty senseless i would probably save for ghost of t than wasting money over this junk good going for new comers tho what about the multiplayer tho funny that they mentioned smoother combat but ac3 has one of the smoothest chainkilling combat before it was revamped in later games yeah but wheres brotherhood remastered great setting i prefer this style of combat over the simple one we got with origins and odysee im pissed off that europe gets the signiture eddition but we dont we are america this game is about our fight for independance damn you but i love this series cant wait ubisoft please do remaster for assassins creed 2 is it me or do the cutscenes look weird yees and i still waiting to ac usa civil war or ac in czech republic ac 3 was my fav assassins creed game and its still my fav i will buy it once again on my ps4 one day left for a real ac game cant wait thanks a lot for this remaster i really hope it will have less bugs etc why was ac2 remaster so bad my favorite part of the original was building up the village i cannot wait should i buy it wow the cutscene of conner and the general at 230 looks very good edit hope that they have fixed the thing when you can wear the outfit that you have selected and still have it equipped when the cutscene starts wish they redid the story as well desmond should still be alive and a playable future character i always thought assassins creed 3 was seriously underrated yes now please please remaster brotherhood day one buy i knew it had to happen this game is too good and highly underrated at least this game has legacy outfits and minigames checkers hype while dressed as arno or jacob anyone defenetly gonna buy mine on switch yo i think this assassin game is one of the best cuz they always talking about it did they fix the weapon wheel where is doesnt go into a whole another screen but is running through the snow in the frontier still a drag why the hell did you guys remaster this over black flag never been this hyped and happy in a very long time im so happy i got gold edition instant get my favorite ac cant wait to pay again why not make a totally new game filled with trees that will be the selling point after 30 years saveourplanet 306 they forgot rogue i applause you for representing old mechanics as if they are new things make remastered prince of persia warrior within im hyped 24 h left baby ac 3 is my favourite gamei am happy that they are remastering pc game too this looking good if i purchased the ac odyssey season pass am i able to pre download on the 28th before midnight its to bad this game was dragged down so hard by a bad story and bad missions had a lot of good features i loved this game and here i thought when you first mentioned the tyranny of washington comes with the remastered edition and had the cutscene of washington saying never touch that i thought was a creative way saying that storyline sucked cant wait to play assassinate online again so much fun is it too soon for a remaster man their hair sure do look ugly ac3 is the best fighting combat in ac franchise the last real ac for me they really remastered one the worst assassins creeds in the series wow never played ac3 im soooooo hyped black flag remastered please might buy it physical miss the day where your hidden blade instant kills everyone except boss recent ones had changed a lot 3 was my favvvvvioriteeee alongside brotherhood 30 fps cape on higher consoles are a huge bummer wtf ubisoft modern day missionssoundtrack the combat was the only plus here dont wanna hear to the left connor over and over again tho ubisoft can you let us use tyrannt of george washington connor outfit i hope you guys realize we loved desmond timeline and go back to him or make the comics games does it drop at midnight tonight for ppl who have the season pass need a modern assassins creed game right now or maybe one set in japan as a ninja or samurai why not 2 or brotherhoodtheir sales were good im so damn excited for this game playing on the pc ive played the one and two but this one was my first assassins creed please remaster the first one im really upset theres no pre download on consoles got it free with odessey season pass im sorry but what is new here if ubisoft remasters ac black flag i would gladly buy it hoping it has better graphics and maybe more features how this is still not available for pre order i am new to assassins creed i dont know where to buy it on pc so this is what remastered graphics looks like ezio casuals are like only ac 2 matters wheres my google stadia play button thank you for being fair in your review everyone else seems so hung up on it being a last gen title or connor not measuring up in some way shape or form the usual tired complaints thank you for not falling into that and also being hyped for the game itself why the hell was this style of combat abandoned i mean i love odyssey and origins but not the clunky awkward combat they had one job and they re doing it thank ubi yeaahhh assassins creed on nintendo switch where is my super ac2 remastered why does it look so bad in some scenes i mean film scenes i really hope multiplayer is included i got more nostalgia from multiplayer then single player coming home from school hopping on ps3 to play with my friends from school i always picked the highway man or the red coat girl or night stalker the good old days omg i can not wait so much better than the gladiator bullshit thank you ubisoft for remastering this please fix the broken stealth played both games and honestly cant remember anything 258 connor face is when ubisoft remastered a game add a yellow filter thats a remaster omg i hope all the old glitches are fixed as much as i like the current rpg combat system the kenway saga or the colonial saga games have my favorite combat animations and yes tomahawk chop is my death blow liberation had god awful fps drops in the bayou i hope thats fixed on the console he never say anything about the ships ac franchise are osom okay but what about the online multiplayer modes wheres fate of atlantis 3 was my favorite so yay i love the fact how they have 2 of the main characters of the ac games ac3 and ac liberation there showing huge respect for the natives because they where hear first they were the true americans and thats how they came up with conor than they have the african american how africans were brought here as slaves so there showing huge respect for both sides idk if anyone notices that two races that were here and had a dark past in the start of new england lmao theres a cutscene glitch at 349 with the guy running by pls no more lock picking tho the graphics havent even changed so excited to play this while im pooping in an airplane bathroom thanks i think ubisoft should have united the games and put on ac3 map a mark to travel new orleans and a system to change the characters but i suppose that was very complex xd please ubisoft i beg youbring the old assassins creed backplease ubisoft make the best open world games i wanna get this remastered assassins creed 3 remaster the worst assassins creed lmao really enjoyed that eight hour tutorial when i was younger honestly top 3 assassins creed game 527 why need lightningfast chain kills when enemies are just politely waiting for you to kill them the character models ugh is it just me or do the faces look off bro this was my childhood this was my favorite ac this game is cooler than odyssey connors face looks weird but i will still buy it i was experimenting with connors gadgets one day on my ps3 apparently his snare can be used as a weapon when in a counter attack his trip mine as well ive always had respect for assassins creed iii i never spat on it can we get a remaster of connor he had the personality of a log of wood when ac veterans return im coming home now we just need the original ac to get a remaster i miss this ac formula for games i saw the cutscenes they look kinda bad i remember homestead activities are the best feature of ac3 dear ubisoft now this is ac game but odessey im not saying its bad no i loved it but you can call it anything you want except assassin creed its not nd you took most of the stealth away many enemies it has to be a big noisy fight cant stealth kill them i hope you fix that in future odessy has nothing to do with ac line at all i like how the did its the 20th century and youre still running around with a knife for ptotection before he brutally murders 3 people with it cant wait for the stand alone version coming out in april cause im not getting odyssey that games horrible cant wait to kill some more red coats i love this game bro 3 hmm the graphics dont match the characters builds up main theme background music owo on one hand i liked connors story and getting liberation with it is great but on the other hand ac3 is the reason i completely lost interest in the ac lore desmonds story was so disappointing that i didnt play another ac title until odyssey 231 wow such an improvement looks alot like origin i hope this looks good on switch connor later became jason mamoa boring then whats change except the graphic assassins creed iii yellow filter edition ac1 remake please where is the multiplayer where is the multiplayer someone reply is it going to be remastered too your game got cracked before release obisoft comon ubi make a remaster of graw 1 and graw 2 please dont tell me i have to sit for 10 hours of handholding again thats what i hated about ac3 i love it dearly but it takes at least 10 hours before it completely sets you free to play ac3 better than other ac games awesome the lightning is great the game is already cracked and im downloading it 2 mins of silence for those who are going to buy it lmao they release it on brexit day lol im impressed that this guy somehow managed to explain the features in ac3 as if it was just released yesterday this game doesnt need a remastered version this video won me over in terms of should i get it it or not answer im definitely getting it i remember was so hyped in 2012 plz tell me about pc requirements for the game plz reply now we need a remastered version of ac3 remastered graphics not good enough its worthless even to download torrent of this masterpiece however ac2 is another subject so is this as much content as it seems like i started at origins forgive me ac purists aciii welcome back back to colonial america thank you ubisoft for adding the animal spirit outfit to the main campaign and i like that you added the ac4 way to see all outfits when the wardrobe is full believe it or not this game help me passed my history test when i was in the 6th grade thank god for ac3 lmbo for me the main character is haytham and i dont care what anyone else says d the final of the assassins creed iii has been the best the one thing im upset is that the faces look really bad i dont know what they did to them but they dont look good at all is it just me or does liberation looks better than 3 assasins creed japan pls thats what remastered looks like looks bad ac3 was so boring btw i remember finishing it and going oh thats it they also kill off desmond 410 game pass we need assassins creed in persia and new prince of persia guys best assassins creed game i hope that they fixed that anoying horse mission i could not kill those templars wjth out getting of the horse and now im going to feed you your teeth hmmmmm while i play this game should i listen to the hamilton or the patriot soundtrack i got ac 3 in 2016 for free you just make me want to redownload 3 and compare them one of my favourite games of all time originally developed for handhelds hey the ps vita has a name there was a bug where enemies are respawning infinitely nice downgrade textures ubisoft hur dur ac feels boring and repetitive we want new stuff and innovation ubi gives us two amazing games in origins and odyssey both is the best stories other than ezios trilogy ewwwwwew those games suck we want old ac back like just stfu guys stop being fucking retarded cant belive people miss that hallow and shallow character that was desmond modern day sections also sucked they pulled you out of the actual game to pad the games time for nothing the ending is also one of the worse endings in video game history good thing the masterpiece that was black flag came after so then the garbage that rogue unity and syndicate were and then we got the masterpieces that are origins and odyssey i am really looking forward to see the next place we will visit in the next ac game and the multiplayer c im really excited for this remaster as it does look good though you guys are describing the game as if its brand new but the new features and graphics look very good thank you ubisoft please make it look great and run smoothly on the switch anyone ever realize that desmond miles looks luke drake i still wonder why ac3 ac1 needed it way more what about the multiplayer yo 003 full synchronization failed this is good but ac4 would be 100x better god i fucking love this game i loved it then and im gonna love it now thank you for this ubisoft connor kenway shouldve been part of the naval infantry under naval officer samuel nicholas not a soldier i might actually buy this one i stoped playing these after they added the level system those eyes nobody ubisoft assassin creed 3 remastared coming march 29th why the hell you guys arent bringing desmond backreally ubisoft i am starting hating you infact everyone has started hating youyou are striking your self by not bringing him back i want to see how it runs on the switch if have to download liberation on the physical version can forget it they ruines connors hair the only ac of 20182019 ac3 wasnt the best but ac3 and ac4 were the last 2 ac games that felt like ac buying it on the switch did they fix bugs where is alexander hamilton yeah but why naval battles of black flag those good old days 022 this is how its done i really hope the pistol reload time is reduced lol 146 speaking of modern day where the hell is shawn and rebecca this does look very good but i still dont trust ubisoft remasters based on their awful history of downgrades especially on the pc platform gotta wonder when well get the assassins creed battle royal weve updated the hud to a more modern one changes the objective icon from white to yellow what time will it be releasing tomorrow so no multiplayer seems like dc darkness converted to marvel 534 thats not at all what i thought it would do kaz miller is george washington awesome when the game was at its prime and not trine to be its own i hope they at least included conners speech they cut from the game it was a good speech and already recorded so it just has to be put back in the game i liked this but are they going to fix conor why 3 and not 1 or 2 bring backs memories 136 a lot of people thought origins was the first ac game that let you climb mountains but its was actually ac3 back then when assassins creed was a real assassins creed when it was about assassins and templars i want an assassins creed with assassins and templars and no mystic creatures like medusa cyclops or minotaur back to the roots ubisoft back to the roots edit i hate layla hassan oh good they kept the instant kill button face animations are a lot worse i think the real question is will they fix the horses one day to gocant wait this is pretty neat can you remaster the classic ghost recon games as well nine men morris was so broken to win it you had to pitch its ai againts a browser game ai on highest difficulty gets shot in the face with bow enemy what was that i hope the ai is still stupid xd its what made the game hilarious well i guess they are making the series compatible with stadia i wish desmond was still alive will you be able to play the multiplayer cant wait to buy assassin creed 3 remaster i love this one his name is my name thats why i love this one does it come out midnight friday i have it through the gold edition of odyssey and im so pumped and want to know when exactly ill be able to download and play man i miss the old assassins creed games get rid of the rpg bullshit honestly it looks like you added a textures mod and nothing more no new mechanics no even a little change in the history even isnt a big graphics difference between the original and this i was excited dude connor is one ugly mofo long live ezio i cant wait to get this liberation remastered how do you play it do you have to complete 3 first great i will finally feel satisfied having bought the odyssey i have unfinished business with ac3 wow omg just like the everything the original had but4k facial animation looks weird i love ac3but you guys at ubisoft have completely botched this game do you guys not know how to properly animate face models is it hold r2 to run because if it is looks so good they awnsered my wishes cant wait if you own the original is the remastered version automatically playable or do you have to pay for it i wonder if they fixed that color glitch that prevented the change of costume colors from staying during cutscenes will this game be sold on the playstation store as well it was horrible the first time why would i want to play it again a vast frontier filled with trees omg yay where is charles lee hd remastered 036 looks horrible please make ac2 remastered odyssey 3 2 1 revelations my favs no multiplayer do assassins creed 1 remastered my all time favorite ac get and ive played them all i cant wait to play on my switch i would consider re buying it if they actually upgraded the graphics and not just the lighting and some of the gameplay mechanics who tf gave aveline the same combat style as haythams dude shes copying him at what time is it coming out pls help i dont care what people say ubisoft i love you 306 ah i wish they made the naval combat more like black flags as i never enjoyed it when it was like that but hey cant wait to dive into the game again on friday get back on the horse conner im really excited to play ac3 again i remember pre ordering it and taking the next two days off from work it was great seeing a native american represented just a foot note im native american very nice i will get the season pass for odyssey next week d bringdesmondback connors moves were the sickest ill give him that can you buy it standalone or no so if every dlc is going to be added does the saw sword be in it as well conner has one of the best outfits in the series change my mind cant weight sooo are the clips from the original or imagine locking the game at 60 fps lmao is it a glitch or not cuz i already have the game on steam 258 why does it look like connors new face was cut from an amazon prime package all these improvements and they couldnt add a crouch feature is there multiplayer though cant wait to play on the switch ac3 was my first game ive played on the series one of my favourite games hands down you should remaster all the other assassins creed games and use the new graphics from assassins creed odyssey assassin creed 1 remake what about the multiplayer is it coming back as well on switch it has already been cracked yes this is exactly where we need to be 259 oooooooof what have they done to our boy my man looks awful not just bump up the resolution this is how you do a remastered game right one word multiplayer brotherhoods multiplayer was simply the best bring it back please funny the fact that ubi realized that a ac from 2012 was way so much better than the last five at least ac games i mean you could have gotten rid of optional objectives in the remaster like missed opportunity lol and the downfall oh look the last assassins creed game before the decline cant wait to play this again godbless u obisoft i preorderd both psn and physical im so hyped this was the best when it came out lol honestly what got me into ac wellp guess its time for me to grab the ezio trilogy xd great video guys very informative why faces looks so weird man watching the assassinations and combat makes me sad all over again that the awesome combat system i loved is gone please give us real assassinations highprofile and low with the hidden blade again i miss them so much the british redcoats still look inaccurate i hope they changedspoiler haytham kenway boss fight that fight was the laziest designed boss fight i have ever seen switch users need ezio collection too the textures look so crappy and almost identical to the original how is this a remastered in any way all youve done is made the game look more yellow im honestly just waiting for liberation which is one of my favourite acs of all time probably on my top 3 as someone who was too young to do much gaming when this first came out im so excited for this im trying to piece together the events involving desmond and who his ancestors are but its kind of hard when i cant play the first games im ready i cant wait to assault abstergo again one of my favourite moments in the series love this game cant wait to play it 004 you literally failed the optional objective reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee doesnt look that much better than the original to me this was always my favorite assassins creed i cant wait to play this remastered version my favorite thing to do is stabbing through someone with a musket and shooting through him into someone else a remaster of the single player is nice and all but the thing is tell me i can assassinate fools with my boy night stalker in mutiplayer the branches move like in the og test footage if i buy the season pass in april do i still get the game with it im more excited to play the remaster of ac3 than i was to play origins and odyssey not just my favourite ac game but my favourite game of all time it was the first game i got 100 on and spent hours just wandering through the frontier hunting and and testing my limits to see how creative i could get and i really cant wait to do it all over again while running around in edwards assassin robes d kinda wish you change the hud i cant wait for my boys to be even better the remaster it is not awesome at all i was expecting something spectacular something wow eh maybe next remaster the most beautiful combat that no other game other than assasims creed could even achieve literally looks the same as the original maybe ubisoft should go to raven software and see what a remaster actually is how to fix fov and this was the last brilliant ac game and when the present day was important for the historythose were good times it sucks because it kinda looks like wax figures thank you ubisoft for remastering one of the greatest ac games in the series i have bought ac od and the seseon pass will i get tha liberetion and ac 3 with platinum trophy now we just need a remaster of the first game to make the entire series available on currentgen consoles that was a hint ubisoft with directional blips introduced in the minimap for enemies stealth is going to be easier in the remastered version good ol days where the blips were nice red round spots assassins creed odyssey this games story was trash cant wait got it pre ordered and been waiting for yeaarssss lmao i miss when ac was an action adventure game and not just a grindy dark soulslite game when can we pre load man i am so happy they have decided to remaster this game i know there are quite a few people who didnt really appreciate this game but i absolutely loved it and as a matter fact i never got to play itmy parens were the kind who said i was too young for these games and when i was finally old enough it wasnt available for me i was devastated so thank you ubisoft for doing this my favorite assassin creed is this a remastered version or are they marketing of selling the same old ac 3 wtf looking forward to it on ps4 pity the game looks same or worse as 7 years agoone would hope more like a rerelease than a remaster i hope ubisoft learns some day how to do those i am still waiting for shadow of the colossus style remake of assassins creed 1 graphics as in assassins creed unity czech localization is missing why in the ac iii 2012 is czech translation justubisoft but it looks good i have already downloaded preload dont disappoint me again i was gonna buy this but i only recently replayed it on pc i hope theyll let you take your hood off whenever you want im looking forward to it back to the revolution for independence connor kenway is trash so season pass also includes liberation honestly it is the best offer ubisoft has ever released please tell me you fixed the mission where paul revere shouts in your ear every 10 seconds on the back of your horse the disguise mechanic and different tools available in each custome of aveline is one of the best and sadly most underrated innoventions ac had in that period why on earth it was scrapped is beoynd me the poisondart umbrella was so cool i see a little more textures contrast more hd and ready the truth is that i will have to see many comparatives to talk to buy it yeah yeah cool cool but rebecca is alive please what is the realese date for ps4 thanks did anyone else notice how weird connors face looks especially at 256 this is cheesy xd looking forward to this bought the gold edition of oddesy really didnt get on with it hope this makes up for it im late but this remastered is getting released on my 18th birthday not that i didnt 100 ac3 when it first came out though is there mp wait dont people who got the special edition odyssey get this for free pls help lets ask the important question is there going to be multiplayer how much storage space does it require on consoles they really went off track with origins and odssey will owners ac3 get remaster i got the season pass so will i ge it russians have already hacked a remaster this and unity were the peak of ac gameplay for me goodness i miss it so much oh man so much content i cant wait i need a break from the division 2 and this come right on time not to mention im gonna get it for free finally back to an ac game with a proper encyclopedia ingame whats the price tho remastered ac rogue can you play captain kidds mission the only thing i ever wanted out of this remastered was a removal of the optional objectives or at least minimize them to not be obnoxiously irritating and yet they didnt even bother with that this game wouldve been so much deeply better in terms of gameplay if we were allowed the freedom to tackle or do any and all missions how we saw fit like how ac1 ac2 ac origins and ac odyssey offered guys the game is basically the same with the original one should i play the original one first or i can play this instead of original one i dont wanna play 2 same games awesome ubisoft pls keep making more assassins creed your awesome the still kept the terrible qte prompts that never change for specific animals when hunting jesus how about assassin creed 1 remastered this was included in the origins season pass right is that the game i need to launch in order to download ac3 as an update i was playing through all ac games but had to stop till ac3 remastered came out may 21st for the switch you can take my money sooner if you want i want connors dlc outfit for the main game damnit just give us what we want ubisoft you have the legacy outfits how hard is it to add the george washington dlc outfit half irish dont buy this garbage if youve already played it its just colourful and thats it ha lol im getting it for free im hiding in my room thinking about this game lmao im super duper hyped for this already done the preload but i just have one concern why did they opt to make the remaster a yellow tinge honestly yellow tinge suits middle eastern settings in order to capture the essence but when i think of new york they shouldve gone with a more blue or neutral color palette love the volumetric lighting in this remaster i just wish they didnt make it so yellow aaahhh the original of assassins creed im waiting for nintendo switch version yeah i aint sleepin this weekend pre ordered because its the best ac ever im a little to excited for this remaster all the changes ive noticed 004 main mission logo was dark blue now its yellow not to mention optional objectives logos are different now 023 i dont actually remember but i guess in original the map was on bottom right now theyve moved it to left but its a guess i dont remember 023 there were two action buttons eq for pc ab for xbox xo for ps3 above the map now its black flagrogueunity style which all the four key buttons are top right 023 calling for other assassins was alongside map icons now its alongside the weapons though it may be just like the map since i dont remember clearly 111 the logos for a custom item chosen from map is now different 130 side missions also had a dark blue logo now theyve white logos 147 maybe some people are saying remaster is just a yellow filter but did anyone notice that desmond has a darker and more blueish filter color than the original also back then when modern day was enjoyable 218 while on mission back when modern day was actually important for story now ill finally buy odyssey gold edition these brits about to lose their tea again the way i see it after the desmond saga and black flag you can skip ahead to origins and miss nothing i forgot how the combat looked amazingly epic before they changed it up please stop it i already have the division 2 to complete and i havent even touched far cry new dawn or the final episode of legacy of the first blade next up brotherhood or said in an other way you do other things than just kicking and killing soldiers and animals in a pointless and repetetive killing spree that last 100 hours i remember this was my favourite game i played it in 2013 and i was amazed as i am now the graphics from liberation look really bad and i know it was a ps vita game but still i already see downgrades in original ac 3 multiple enemies would engage in sword fight not just 1v1 oh yeah nice nice d bring back unitys parkour it was awesom are the cut scenes actually from the remastered version the gameplay looks good but the characters in the cut scenes look really bad how many fools can i kill today love it more then stupid odessey is it bad im more excited for this then i was for odyssey tbh i passed 7thgrade history with this game please do black flag next that was my favorite of them all but will it have multiplayer ive missed those in recent ac iterations i cant wait everything is good enough but the faces look like theyre made out of cheap plastic does this include bringing back the multiplayer ac 3 remastered is a red dead redemption 2 version for pc users far cry 2 needs a remaster ive no desire to play this version as ive already completed the original version but i am gonna try liberation since ive never played it before back when the story was actually going somewhere after this game they totally gave up on the modern day which had a really deep story will there be multilayer that music 3 soon as you guys remaster part one ill have em all on the ps4 this wont have the multiplayer right damn i am so hyped for this i bought ac odyssey gold edition or something like that that included this and was so dissapointed to learn this game wasnt coming out for several months 150 villian guy its the 21th century and you still running around with only a tiny knife for protection desmond kills them with that tiny knife and moves away hey theyre changing the hud layout too ubisoft you see all these people missing desmond what about you stop being dumbfounded idiots and bring him back we all know that it is possible you even showed multiple pieces of eden that can ressurect plus it is said in the unity files that his mind is in the animus grey hey look social stealth can we have that back if a new ac is released please use the ac3 fighting animations feels very inconsistent remaster like some textures models and animations are not updated give us black flag with x enhancements look at connor and haytham character models look really bad the sea looks worse 60fps i was hoping they had changed the horse models they are so weird cant wait for the switch version doesnt look that good i dont about anyone else but i played the whole freaking game with just that one tomahawk never used a sword once why not assassins creed 4 black flag is amazing remastered unity please 126 we can see some magic here it took a while but im happy its here this guys laying the positive adjectives on thick massive frontier seriously it takes a minute to cross on horseback also explosively action packed cmon i cant believe that my favourite ac comes out remastered at my birthday iam about to explode 17th century thought this was nolan north talking but nah this dude just sounds a lot like desmond this looks quite cool i only just got odyssey as my first ac game i will probably buy this mellioon doliers for these ubi im i right how much is it good atmosphere and innovative mechanics for the series but the story and the main character arent very interesting in my honest opinion yoo i whant my old assassin creed back i dont relly like the new stuff would have preferred a remastered ac rogue need more ambient occulusion i think stronger what about the multiplayer remember the infinite fighting of random officers on the streets would be nice to see that here 2012 where is lee 2019 where is lee ive been counting down since they announced the release i cannot wait for this game omg from ac2 ac origins im a big fan of this series bad remastered looks absolutely beautiful though i wish they could have removed the highlight in targeting instead a small lock icon would suffice like acod continue from this and forget syndicate unity was best ac evertech details and sad story never got to try this out cant wait to download it wow your so awesome i just want to say thank you i love your videos u have great contentyou have inspired me to make a channel of my own and im working on my dream just like you im here to support you stay amazing my friend need remaster of ac 2 when i heard about this is was a bit meh then about a fortnight ago i saw a trailer and decided it did look cool then i remembered that if you hold an odessy season pass like i do its all part of it so im playing this one should of just made a new conner game i cant wait im so hypet like who saw this on friday 29319 including behind the scenes content is the best way for adding value to remasters great job ahhhhh back when the inner and outer story was cohesive and desmond was important im excited but is it just me or are the textures looking a little off it was fun killing those evil patriots 258 um what happened to conners head his pallor and hair color seem off haythem my man the real hero this game have best animations of odyssey the real question is the turkey still here please make this happen to black flag the improvements are amazing im so hyped march 30th is my birthday wait this is north america i was born in east asia that means it comes out on my my birthday east asia is 1 day ahead of north america i dont care what anybody says this game was awesome id take this over odyssey and origins any day of the week is it just me or does connors face texture looks awful the environment looks great though ubisoft game remastering step 1 add some fancy filter skybox effect step 2 sligthly increase texture resolution step 3 step 4 profit i just wish that they would fix the notoriety system that was the one thing that kept me from continuing to play this game filled with trees oml you have sold this game to me i cant wait to play as haytham again yeah i said it i loved his fighting style am i the only one that thinks the face and hair textures where heavily downgraded like if there where made of clay my chilhood is coming back i just bought the normal ac3 again for the memories and now i see this pls do sth for skull and bones im way too hyped cant wait to play this on switch once it comes out for that i cant freaking wait as much as ezio is my favorite i truly believe that ac3 needed this i do believe the original release was rushed to hit the 311012 release date but today is another story im excited for this ill admit its a shame you play as the bad guys i wonder if they fixed the outfit color bug in the cutscenes hey guys we need some money k just remaster one of our old shorty ac games lmfao garbage ubisoft pirate free v connors hair got really dark or is it a new lightning first time i saw the remastered desmond i like assassins creed 3i just played last week it should have been ac2 remastered removing bodyshields while keeping guns was a mistake unity desmond dies at the end not looking forward to repeating the first three hours is this the remastered version still looks dumb what about multiplayer im still suprised the british goverment hasnt tried to prosecute the soldiers involved in the boston massacre yet please remaster ezio trilogy with improved gameplay i mean a true remaster looking forward to playing it though hope the improvements make it feel a bit closer to the modern combat system we now have in odyssey ideally id have liked a full remake that uses most of odysseys systems requiescat in pace ac multiplayer yes i can finally play my favorite and my first game of the series im crying tears of joy well that all sounds pretty dope but what about the online mode i loved the multiplayer of ac 3 and ac 4 and i really want it back in future ac games or in remasters like this one so cool that you get it for free with the season pass this is the first time a season pass is worth its money am going to buy this for the switch so i can play it everywhere the best ac3 ill definitely be getting this for my ps4 best assassins creed change my mind assassins creed is a good franchise the assasins and the templar are the iluminati and masonic people they rule this world so very accurate will you guys keep adding stuff to the game like you did with odyssey aaaaaa im so excited you guys at ubisoft did an incredible job at representing my people in assassins creed 3 with connor his mother and his friends my father was amazed at how well you guys did no multiplayer can they bring back the online still has the best combat connors outfit and running animations and animations in general remain my favourite of the ac series to this day plus he has a tomahawk wish i could pre order for pc can pre order the game before 2019329 i love the old ac games hate the fantasy bullshit new ones the first assassins creed game that disappointed me the modern day story delivered but conors story was boring and the gameplay was clunky at best obviously more assassins creed than odyssey but i think ill give it a miss i named my youngest son connor because of this game ill definitely be getting it not my favorite assassins game far from actually but lets forget that i want to replay this so badly xd all the assassin games after assassins creed 4 suck assassins creed origin and odyssey dont even feel like assassins creed anymore thank you ubisoft barcelona this is what sold me on the ac odyssey season pass best ac to date no boytoysuave ezio isnt it chief gameplay is great but graphicsoh man its a big downgrade assassins creed 2 was the best one no cap damn wished they removed those annoying optional objectives well specifically the one where youre going to sabotage the ship very curious to see how will this game perform on switch new assassins need mode gore ubisoft i kinda liked this game but what always threw me off was the damn map it was horrible even doing all the viewpoints wouldnt reveal all the map you had to run in circles like an idiot to do it which is why i love ac black flag so much that game perfected the map and added color to it when is it going to be out they shoulda done the first assassin creed before this game can you pre download it on ps4 the cutscenes look awful come on ubisoft when i saw the gameplay in the march update trailer i was excited but now i am just disappointed again ubisoft can you not see it can you guys not see it thank you ubisoft thank you day after tomorrow i want it now or two days before the day after tomorrow soon the only one ps4 wont have access to is the original i wont be surprised if they remaster that id take a remaster but having some remake elements wont hurt either ac1 can use database entries and other players want other adjustments like better fist fighting this game had a lot of effort put into lets hope ubisoft remasters the first game like how capcom remastered resident evil 2 its one of the best and brilliant games of the franchise along with the ezio trilogy black flag and origins somehow this video is way better than conventional ubisoft trailers does anyone agree that assassin creed unity had the best parkour system can i get a rip for the multiplayer should i rebuy the old ac3 and finally complete my all achievement run or should i buy this with its more improved features and start all over again iamready it looks exactly the same as the original 2012 version except every single character has vaseline effect on their skins connor looks really different and odd in the thumbnail this is cool and all but they should have made desmons trilogy remastered ac1 ezio trilogy and ac3 in same package is ac liberations a seperate download i am here only for desmond miles black flag would make the perfect remastered with more missions of piracy and side activities and a larger map than rogue this game was supposed to be the end of assassins creed but here we are will we still have multiplayer if only the multiplayer returned was awesome loved the music in this game loved it when it wasnt originally released crazy excited to play it again waiting for mredxwx for new assassins creed remastered videos thnx like if u too cant wait for this this was one of my favourites how can i buy the game on the playstation store i cant find the game how yall go from this to odyssey itll be kinda weird to play desmond again but im excited to play the game again i wonder did they cut down the time in the beginning of the game cause i heard it was to long until you got to play as connor do you realy think we need a remastered of ac3 fix r6s first who loves to play conor i love that they celebrate the paul revere ride mission you know the mission people love to point to when talking about how bad the game is anyone know the downloading size for the ac3 remastered on ps4 yet cant wait even though most people didnt like it 3 was my favorite they released this video because playgames released gameplay and they wanted to be the first to make a statement so they took his videos down i watched alot of the gameplay and it is very disappointing the game is the same and honestly you are better of playing the 360 version on the xbox one than this washington dlc made by quebec that explains a lot seriously ubisoft quebec is whats putting the franchise down back into mediocre just stop giving them access to making ac games thats all i want is it coming out on pc how can they release this with slightly better graphics and charge 40 for it nice tactics ubisoft this looks great until you see the character models and textures yikes start working on a patch right now cuz those facial animations look trash assassins creed 3 way the first game in the series that i played and im super stoked to see it getting the remaster treatment though it is a shame that we have to wait till may to buy it on the switch you guys copywrite claimed the youtuber playgames earlier for posting gameplay of this so ubisoft you remastered this hidden game thanks but what did you do to the faces and facial animations doesnt look much better than the original ill pass oh yeah first ac origins and then ac 3 remastered hell yeah this is what i live for great work team ubisoft doesnt show up in the ready to install section rise and grind colonists lets get this independence black flag remastered when this looks like it was made in 201516 which is real good for a 2012 game with lighting and shadow improvements so can we get the tyranny of king washington dlc wolf outfit available for the main campaign because many players would appreciate it may the father of understanding guid us till march 29th thank you ubisoft for a late birthday gift ac3 is my favorite assassins creed of all time one of the best hope they remaster syndicate in the future so excited are we able to preload 144 back when modern day actually mattered i miss that time i wonder if they made some of the homestead mission mandatory so it would show connor as a character better remastered or not it doesnt change the fact that the desmond ending was lousy its looks great well if ypur remastering this game then why not remaster splinter cell blacklist or chaos theory ac3 was my introduction to the series shouldve remastered black flag instead best ac ever omg my favourite assasins creed ever i had forgotten how much the animations have been downgraded in recent games pathetic remaster the first one now this video is gonna disappear every assassins creed game is now on ps4 except ac1 wow they need to do it good times i will have videos on this game soon for now enjoy what i have hell yeah and some of the issues that ac3 had are fixed cant wait thank you for crating such an amazing game so is there multiplayer for ac3r only colour change not graphics improved cant wait they need to remaster assassins creed 1 are the benedict arnold missions available for xbox one and nintendo switch too i like the washington dlc u can fly and invisible and slash bear i love ubisoft to make same ability on new game 2020 still glad that switch is getting a version of aciiir wheres my multiplayer at please make ac2 remastered trash you guys still going to say they only made it yellow finally its funny how this guy is talking about things i already knew for the past 6 years i have been waiting for this finally cant wait to play as desmond again my favorite character i am conor fan will assassin creed 3 come in future story i mean do script come like ac origins gameplay and functions hi ubisoft one of the best assassin creed games out there assassins creed iii was my favorite ac game until odessy took it away thank you guys so much for remastering it cant wait always wanted an even smoother gameplay this games combat animations are simply my favorite my favourite assassin d thank you ubisoft ac3 is my favourite ac game please give connor a sequel best assassin by far this game literally changed my life also i bought the season pass so how would i get the game god seeing him wear some of the outfits really reminds you how much of a tank connor really was can we buy those outfits in the shop i love how theyre still trying to convince us to accept aguilar 453 bayeks in the homestead connor wears shays robes hope crying kinda disappointing that jacobs outfit doesnt come with his top hat my favorite assassin back lers gooo aguilar outfit actually looks pretty good but doesnt fit with the atmosphere maybe in the ezio games it would is this for ps4 the only reason why altairs outfit was not showing in this video and some other videos where it was not in ubisoft clubs units is because altairs outfit was already apart of the original game also ezios outfit thats why ezios outfit had to be unlocked in ubisoft club units and altairs outfit can only be unlocked by complete all the main story missions with all the option electives it looks like they choose arnos fearless outfit i wonder why jacobs outfit was much darker than that i wish we could get ezios other two outfits too the one he wore in ac2 and the one he wore in ac revelations arbaaz mir and nikolais outfits would be cool too how about ads outfit the nature is looking pretty good little red connorhood the worst game of the series thats got the most outfits so since alexios outfit is in this game would that make his storyline canon i thought kassandra was canon connorwalks in wearing shays clothes achillesconfused screaming they need to add the ezios white ac2 robes and the black altair master assassin robes w armor we need an ac game based in the mexicanamerican war the protagonist is an american of mexican decent splitting his allegiance setting would be california and mexico assassins outfit heavily inspired by auigulars but maybe made out of leather templars and the brotherhood on both sides of the war boom still waiting for that hood toggle in syndicate its kassandra outfit no alexios i know the legacy outfits are supposed to be are supposed to be like these are the people who helped start it and how all the suits are before conners time so it makes sense that achilles would have them but the jacob fry suit was after conner in the games and the regular timeline so achilles shouldnt have it unless achilles can time travel bayeks robes really fit connor aguilar one fits him perfectly connor looks like a woman in arnos outfit altijd rise the best but where desmond outfit connor wears shay outfit haytam whats form heaven nice i know the train hideout i have the game nice to see we finally get an arno outfit i absolutely loved unity i never had any glitch issues and its one of my favourite ac games after the ezio trilogy like aguilar had one of the best outfits in my opinion he was just a shitty assassins are yes i see arnos outfit is completely fucking wrong and they somehow fucked up jacobs black colour he looks more of kassandra than alexios why no desmond outfit how to donwload this skins lmfao his legs are white as fuck achilles would kill him self if connor agries with shay arno dorians outfit looks nothing like arno dorians outfit why is it soooo orange tho damn alexio outfit lololololololololololol agular outfit pretty cool looking bayek outfit show off them muscles connor shay cormac outfit dark and sexy jacob frye outfit looks like jacob pretending to be connor edward kenway outfit best of the bunch by far arno dorian looks out of place on connor aha thats hot thats hot ive always beeen wondering why does connors regular outfit look like achiles as one of the biggest fans of ac origins im glad to see that bayeks outfit is perfect for connor did they included desmond outfit just like the older games just asking do you have to beat the game to wear these i bought 2 skins from the store and they are impossible to equip from the store and homestead why is he so thin fuck im just happy they final added the quiver to all his outfits beside conner assassin outfit use to drive my ocd up the fucking wall watching him pull arrows out of thin air making me only wear his original outfit i cant stop thinking conner goes to cold snowy mountain with bayeks outfit the only thing that i dont like about shays outfit was that in the trailer he had his hood still but in the game he doesnt have it with his templar robes so you niggas in the comments not gonna acknowledge how awkward connor look in arnos clothes is it just me or does arnos outfit look nothing like his outfit from ac unity they should give aveline evie and the female character from odyssey outfits aguilar outfit is the best one there is dont me i find it weird they named it alexios outfit and not eagle bearer outfit or mercenary outfit or misthios outfit given that kassandra is the canon one wears shays outfit achilles im disowning you if you wear that in my house i cant feel my leg hurt its so hard to believe that connor is half white he looks 100 native connor look thinner when hes wearing arnos outfit i like aguilars otfit the most what happened to connor being big and bulky hes so skinny in these outfits wasnt kasandra the protagonist of odyssey instead of alexios connors thighs tho boi he thicc arnos is the worst ive wanted some outfits to give bonuses like equiping shay or edwards outfit would let you use dual swords or sword and dagger i was expecting a dickslip in the alexios outfit i wish we got connors beta outfit the one we saw in the pre alpha gameplay along with its variant that has a cape the alexios outfit is currently my favorite outfit in assassins creed but only on alexios it just looks plain silly in ac3 cause it changes connors skin tone how do u get to the basement and put the hood on i still kind a like the original outfit more since when did conner use guns i thought he only used bows shame they never added the desmond outfit from brotherhood aguilars outfit seems to suit every protagonist it looks like a fucking mobile game id honestly prefer a ac 2 remake i dont know what it is about edwards outfit but it just feels right guys is assassin creed 3 available for purchase on its own without the season pass when they add the reject arno dorian outfit they forgot to add duncan walpole outfit i wanna see how it would look on connor 1150 you havent unlocked this character yet nice remastered graphic nice and why there wasnt any achilles orginal outfit one u get after completing all homestead mission i mean alexioskassandra pilgrim set would be clean favorite assassins creed game ever is it only my opinion or do bayeks shays and aguilars robe are the only good looking ones from the new one haytham will be so proud seeing connor wearing shay clothes oh i am only wearing edwards outfit so awesome connor is now white 114 oh hell no i was crying when i saw this i got the game in person even funnyer 635 achilles punching the air rn where is altair i love these outfits but connor looks so skinny in them compared to his normal bulky build how can you get jacobs and arnos outfit if they live in the future hey what happen to shay after assassins creed rogue the physics on these outfits are great too bad they still havent fixed the altair outfits legs but connors outfit is the best omg forest in this remastered version is so sick only outfits i would use are aguilar shay edward and connors originalcharlestownnew york outfits the jacob frye isnt great because the tomahawk clips really badly it looks like the tomahawk hangs through half of the coat i think connor looks the best in the bayek outfit it matches the bow and the axe and his darker skin not really the gun though and we all know edward is the best assassin is it too much to ask to get giovanni auditores robes added to these available outfits in game i actually burst out laughing when i saw the shay outfit its been 5 years and they still cant figure out how the physics of shays outfit work two minutes for each outfit lol connor looked skinny in those outfithes usually bulky asf jacob outfit with hoodie always upthis is how they should do in the ac syndicate playing through ac3r its not nearly as bad as i remember connor is no ezio or bayek but hes an okay protagonist wish theyd just give us the hooded version of shays outfit as seen on the cover of the game im confuses how can you get ac 3 remaster bayek outfit looks perfect now did they fix the old outfits though the next remastered has to be black flag right that game was awesome im playing this game and i put edwards outfit to connor i want to end every templar with it the bow and arrows do not match with any one of them except bayeks outfitmeh the original one is the best anyway for me that is in ac odyssey the alexios outfit is worn for a total of about 8 minutes until you level up and get better armor so now we need to buy games we finished years ago to play with the legacy outfits thanks ubihard what i want is to play with the desmonds ancestors outfits in odyssey now i know how would arno look with a bow ac3 is just better trapchics more glitches new audio the bell glitch why dose conners body look more feminine in the arno outfit his waist shrinks so much my fav legacy outfits are 1altiar 2ezio 3bayek 100alexios outfit is there multiplayer arno outfits looks too dark can you imagine seeing your apprentice wearing the same clothes of the man who crippled you can you run this on your pc if you could run the original i think the best one is bayeks like connors face literally just looks like bayek in it wait is arnos outfit missing texture or what i finished the game 3 days ago lol alexios is so much more muscular the clothes look like theyre falling off of connor and wheres altairs outfit speed your talking english boy you could do more then just running in homesteadpathetic connor looks good in his grandfathers robes 950 thats wrong edward becomes the master of the brotherhood not a member greey said that in assassins creed syndicate you forgot the ezio outfit holy shit i never knew i wanted this damn did my mans arno dirty couldve at least done is starting outfit or his master outfit hahahahaa connor in shays coat is the best wow the graphicz is mush apprieatiable they couldve at least made the alexios outfits skirt a bit longer it just hurts to look at the game is not worth it if youve played before this didnt need to be 14minutes long i like short shorts this game launched silentlyand im a bit pissed that it did shay outfit is sick af cant even see the difference between remastered and original its still shitty i wish he had a voice line for the edward outfit is the physics on altairs outfit actually functional now or is it still literally the most pisspoor legacy outfit in the series i love altairs robes but the iteration in ac3 and 4 was insultingly bad like always ubisoft cant remaster a game we saw that in ezio collection and then in rogue im not disappointed becuz i expected that hey just wondering is this game worth to buy the lighting messes up with the outfits make another video but this time be in a conflict and be in the city would be much better and every detail might show up aswell edwards outfit look great on connor arno dorians outfit does not look like the one in unity well is not like someone cares about arno or unity i bugged the old game out i completed the campaign but i still have my hood up tbh i wasnt mad alexios and bayek are not cannon as their stories do not ever align with anything assassins creed nor do their stories play like an assassins creed fight me altair s outfit still suck hey i have a question can u shoot the bow n arrow iam glad they put jacobs hood in assassins creed 3 rather than his top hat connor one of the lowest assasins thinks really hes iron man shays main robes didnt have a bandana his collar should be popped up if they want his incognito look he rocks bayeks outfit connors head looks big when wearing arnos outfit i already have ac3 bc version so i feel like id be wasting my money i would like of edward robes has and description like this this is connor grandfather robes first time seeing another assassin in jacobs outfit does outfits show in game cutscens or does it not like the old game now i want to play this game again but this time with shay outfit shay has no hood still false advertising tbh and you cant even use the armlet to zip across anything thats whack as hell sure i get the reason but cmon now i still cant tell if the edward one or the shay one are my favorite outfits in any ac game looks at alexios outfit on connor look at dem assassin legs its thicc as heck i wish they added haythems outfit missed the perfect opportunity to wear an top hat for jacob outfit i really like the bayek outfit on connor wait does connor skin tone change with the alexios outfit damn connor has some nice looking legs is it weird that shays outfit is one of the better ones the video compression is absolute shit in this video might as well go all out and cap resolution at 480p god damn ubisoft stop putting in ezios brotherhood outfits barely anyone likes them so where is the outfit you get when you collect all feathers i knew theyd add shays outfit into ac3 why does arnos outfit look bad on everyone who isint arno while ezios outfit looks grea on everyone sorta wish they had the option to have the hood on or off like in origins or maybe the option to have the bow not appear unless in use it sorta kills the look for a few outfits edwards and jacobs etc connor looks like his grandpa with his grandpas outfit i think its petty cool how shays outfit has the mask pulled up connor wearing alexios outfit looks like as if he is cosplaying red riding hood they could of made changes to the story at least why is connor white just glad they havent forgotten about arno dorian do they show up in cut scenes it looks like arnos body instead of just his clothes who wears short shorts connor wears short shorts in the alexios outfit would shay be the only one that actually active at the same time as connor the thing that messes up the alexios outfit is the lack of a beard at least in my opinion i bet achilles davenport died in remastered version when he saw connor wearing shays outfit the shameless way you express the lazyness you feel about putting extra effort into achieving full synch for an extra outfit in this video is beautiful shows the quality of content you produce if connor wear shays outfit before he shaved his hair he is almost identical to him still no haytham outfit huh bayeks robe actually fitted well for connor its quite cool that they included currentgen outfits into a lastgen game remastered still we get a load when exiting the manor i disliked the video because i didnt like the way this dude said assassins dont forget the assassins turkey they shouldve add legacy outfits of connor edward shay arno and jacob on the ezio collection as well so connor killed shay cormac and took his outfit achilles will be proud how do u jog dude i havs only sprint connors haircut reminds me the one geralt can use in the witcher still a shit ton of glitches the problem ubisoft needs to get right with legacy outfits are they need to have had that character happen chronologically in story before can be worn by another but the real question is do they show up in cutscenes syndicate outfit looks better in this game does shays come with the phantom hood bug i honestly forgot about arno lol at least the game looks remastered and is unlike cough assassins creed rogue remastered cough notice the roman collesum is the time of chimpanzees our way we are in our world why the hell is it named the alexios outfit when the canon protagonist is kassandra shays actually doesnt looks bad imo surprisingly was kinda hoping jacobs outfit would have a hat hahahahahah they should just remake from ground up ac black flag shays outfit still hasnt a hood dude ubisoft is very stupid two of the best outfits in the series imo look so weird here arnos and jacobs got this in launch thanks to ac odyssey season pass i think alixos s oulfit look really good on coonre woah o finally jacobs outfit hood stays up what up with ezio revelation outfit well shay was badass and so was his outfit slick af very good video thanks does anyone else think the ground looks like ubisoft didnt even change any textures on it is that wierd second pistol holster glitch still present here it occured in the original game when you worse any other outfit other than connors original assassin outfit and fast traveled i really need to know if this and the rope dart glitch were patched alexios outfit looks ten times better with the hood i knew why you laughed at the alexios outfit while parkouring on a tree you would see his undies 1358 so the game lets you equip one weapon of each kind sword heavy and blunt instead of only being able to have one in your inventory sweet ummm is it just me or is there something wrong with arnos costume did they also allow us to wear his captain outfit when hes on aquila missions that outfit was badass and somehow conor and bayek are not related bayek fits perfectly for some reason im going to play this game because i apparently suck at sekiros combat i wish they wouldve just made another tenchu title instead i got ac3 remastered for purchasing the gold edition of ac odyssey might as well play it again with the next ac game i really hope they remaster black flag they will sell a lot of copies for sure in my opinion other outfits dont go good if it doesnt match with the bow and arrow the bayek one looks good also the alexios one love aguilars outfit the bayek outfit really fuckin suits him connor with bayeks outfit is bayek with a tomohawk yoconnor you either have a pistol or a bow lmao i actually dig jacobs legacy outfit its really good when your not forced to wear a stupid hat seriouslyno one is gonna talk about that alexios outfit the game looks laggy connor looks like an egyptian with that bayek uniform why the hell did connor become more light when he wears the alexios outfit bayek legacy outfit fits him well 0i really like the bayek outfit on conner also kinda wierd that u can have shay and arnos costume as they should still be alive and jacob who isnt born yet xd previously theres no good outfit but his default now they made some noise about it well lets wait until black flag gets remastered soon puts on alexios outfit stares at himself in the mirror and says im white as fuck boi even assassin creed 3 has better mechanics than shitty odyssey lol yall know im maining bayeks outfit damni know all of those clothes before do outfits show in cutscenes now it may no longer have altair or ezios outfits but in some ways thats probably for the best in the original those outifts didnt have any cloth animations so the leg parts were just stiff these new ones however are animated good that at least they had some effort put into them connor is a buff man right how come he looks rather skinny in those suits connor looks tuff in arons outfit wish ubisoft had included the tyranny of king washington dlc in this remaster as well he look like a trap when he wear alexio outfit i like the shay one he is my fav assassin and the bandana and the hair makes him so cool i wonder what would happen if achilles saw connor in shays outfit wtf is rong with my arnos outfit wtf is rong with arnos outfit serious respect to ubisoft for this acc is me or does connor look more white wear alexis outfit edit btw i doing a play though on my channel of ac3 do a video where you do a which outfit is better to wear in assassins creed 3 remastered i cant find it on steam even though i have the season pass could someone please tell me how to download it i love the animal spirit outift it makes me want to write a serial fanfiction of him but the captain of the aquila is still there right i get it now its just jacobs outfit that made him look so chunky side note i dont remember jacobs outfit being so gray on another note the only outfits that dont look too downgraded is shays outfit and edwards outfit and even they feel slightly downgraded its not a bad thing i know that they have to downgrade these outfits so they fit with the game and yet another note i thought arnos outfit was the default blue outfit that you get thanks for the video still the same bug with other outfits in cutscenes connor wearinng shays robes inside the homestead achillesmotherfucker for real for real get your native ass outta ma house when they say kassandra is the canon misthios yet continue to say its the alexios outfit oof by the time i play the game if the robes still clip through benches imma be disappointed im getting it tomorrow how do you get the game through ac odyssey its really really stupid of ubisoft to not put the lagecy outfits in ac oddysey but if kassandra is canon why is it called alexios outfit why would achilles hang shays suit with the other legendary assassins suits xd arnos outfit is a black blob in this showcase vid the one i didnt like the most was arno dorians legacy outfit the rest of the outfits tho looked good on connor just my opinion edwards outfit looks sick shays outfit looks wierd with the mowhawk but i think it would work when he had his normal hair the ability to control the hood and hair styles i remember people begging for that in 2012 wtf why is arnos suit black it was blue the last time i checked maybe its just me but i dont see anything wrong with the alexios outfit did it not look good to him man was getting full sync on every story mission the costume was awesome but not worth the hell youll go through to get it hey guy just some question in ac liberation how to get alligator hunter hat rewardsold hd version can get in on trade ubiclub 40 coin now didnt saw this hat for trade in ubiclub so arno is considered just a member of the brotherhood but freaking jacob frye was a master assassin what in the hell no proper connor captain outfit you can wear on command instead of that halfassed one from the season pass that was nowhere near as good as the inmission one shame i wish they added haythems outfit but that might be too trippy during the scenes with him this game would have been perfect for meif they fucking added ultrawide support they didnt add the armor of altair what the fuck is up with the alexios outfit lmao agulars outfit doesnt look out of place in this game for some reason wtf that isnt arnos outfit it should be the one advertised in the game or at least his master assassin robes wowbayeks outfit fits so well all look silly on connor lol did they added the crouch button i was hoping you would show shays outfit with connors old hairstyle so they added the red color from the trailers to alexios mercenary belt but they couldnt let it be in odyssey ubi logic shay outfit wouldve looked better if connor kept his original fucking hair cut fizhy is a man of culture says enjoy and follows by showing connor wearing the alexios outfit match made in heaven ive played the original game and i am amazed at how different it looks its like connors build was made smaller for these skins we need unity remastered do dye colors display properly in cutscenes now i would like to know why the game isnt showing up in the playstation store or my library when i own the odyssey season pass the running animation of alexios and kassandra is the same as that of connor when they start to run and they repeated other animations sorry about my english im brazilian hahahah connor look like bayek in that outfit the graphics look absolutely amazing amazing job ubisoft finally you did something good for your ac fans cant believe they make arnos suit that bad just realized that both connor and alexios have similar initial running animation when conor wear arno assassin outfit its look silly his body look smaller than when he wear his own outfit connor wearing bayeks outfit just looks right 811 i like they added sir jacob frye in the description a nice reference to the end of ac syndicate when will it be out for pc will it be on steam or do i have to get odyssey to play ac3 bayek outfit looks great on connor honestly im just curious to how the outfits look on the main characters in the games if ac2 gets a proper remaster and gets the outfits ill be happy and probably laughing at how the italian looks with bayeks outfit using bayeks outfit looks like bayek without superpowers why changed arnos costume new ac unity coming tbh jacob fryes outfit actually looks the best why ubi never add adewale outfitfrom freedom cry or rogue to any ac game as a legacy outfit love to see conner in his granddads outfit kinda wish we got shays assassins outfit instead of the templars one random question but is this coming to pc and if so do i have to pay for it again if i own the standard game does this remastered version give u the other dlc outfits such as captain kidd colonial assassin and captain of the aquila its 330 am where the hell is it in the store how the hell do i download it stayed up till twelve just to do it its like it doesnt even exist ps4 someone help could have at least had a spartan helmet on alexios i love all of the outfits especially the outfit of aguilar aguilars outfit looks slick like its from ezios time period but its still fashionable to be worn anywhere and blend in what about the original bonus outfits from the game i liked some of them like achillies outfit did connor starve himself so he could fit the legacy outfits wtf edit thanks for the 137 likes kill haythem with edwards rob why no haytham outfit and can you wear the old outfits from the original game like the colonial assassin or achilles robes alexios outfit is lit my favorite has to be aguilars i always thought the player character in ac3 walked and ran weird it just looked as you were uncoordinated or in some ways pidgin footed is the mask permanent on shays outfit because ill def be wearing my bois templar outfit edwards robes looks so good on his grandson hey fizhy i know its lateat least where i am but i was wondering since can tell you already completed the story can you where conners outfit with the hood on after you completed the story or is like the original version my favorite where the edward kenway robes edward was his grandfather and i can imagine that maybe adewale had kept those robes at the homestead somewhere yes the greek robes looked ridicules on connor also did arnos robes look darker then they were in unity or is that just me achilless worst nightmare connor walking around in shays robes in the homestead connor once wore shays outfit at the manor achilles grounded him for a week on a more serious note id like to know where all the old outfits went to make space for all these lol at a spartan warrior outfit amongst assassins outfits isnt it weird how he looks like bayek in bayeks outfit damn ratonhaketon looks hella gaytageton with that alexios outfit wow connor looks surprisingly good in shays outfit and so did arno by the way seeing connor wearing his grandfathers outfit it so satisfying wtf is the jacob outfit it looks like the wank outfit at the beginning of the game was hoping to see the maximum dracula or master assassin outfits to represent jacob not that connor is the only practical assassin in terms of body build honestly i never used legacy outfits in ac titles same shit with the mystical and crazy shit in origins and odessey just totally throws you out of the time period damnit shays outfit doesnt look as cool with connors hair being shaved connor wears shays outfit haytham watching from heaven tearing nice this is the best profit of assassins creed 3 remastered hey fizhy couple of silly questions for qa but first some brief background for context so like you i am a former huge ac fan when i was younger i used to roleplay almost every game as if it was somehow taking place within the ac universe my imagination isnt what it used to be so i dont do it much any more recently though i was doing my second playthrough of rdr2 and i was starting to get bored and lose interest that was until i got the idea to dress in all white with a red tie and pretend to be an old west assassin now im really into it again anyway my first question is 1 do you or have you ever done this with any other games and 2 if hypothetically ubisoft bought the rights to the rdr franchise and gave you the responsibility of incorporating it into ac lore without retconing too much of the story how would you imagine it if that makes sense how do you have the game early it was nice seeing connor run around in the legacy outfits but i really wanted to see him do a leap of faith in each one of them loved seeing the edward outfit the most oh yeah i got a lays ad in the middle omg this game is sooooooh gooooooh i gotta say im really liking the fact they added these outfits but a few things i cant help but not like so much are how shays outfit seems to be stuck together in the back but the rest of his coat flutters around it just doesnt look right same with jacobs outfit its stuck at the back as if its buttoned up and seems to stick to connor rather than wave around edward and aguilars outfit seems to look just fine the robes flutter about when you run and walk but shay and jacobs just seem to be like altairs where they stick another thing i noticed is why is jacobs outfit more grey and dull i remember his coat being all black and his suit vest being green and then arnos outfit is the dlc one that was actually going to be his outfit until they changed it its not the one that is shown in the cover of unity and whatnot i dont mean to complain so much i like the fact that theyre in the game but i also cant help but notice these things does the warpaint and the blue eyes go with the dlc outfit i really wish they added ezios ac2 robes thats my favourite outfit in assassins creed and not one game since ac2 has had this outfit shays outfit will make connor give me kakashi vibes from naruto bayek is my fav love the outfits but i just wish there was an option to remove the bow and arrow because it looks kinda weird on some of the outfits do outfits work in cutscsnes in this version of the game i know this is little nitpicking and probably kind of silly but it would have been nice for you to legacy outfits if they gave us a weapon associated with that particular assassin so what happened to the other outfits that were available in assassins creed 3 there was the prisoner outfit the captain of the aquila the master assassin captain kidds outfit then again that was a side quest spoilor warning then achilles outfit would you get after completing his quest line how is connor standing up with jacobs hood on that shit was so heavy in syndicate that jacob had to constantly crouch when he wore it im gonna use jacobs outfit i came to see connor in edwards outfit 1154 yeah i definitely wish arnos blue default outfit was arnos legacy outfit instead of that another excellent video thank you fizhy why did connors skin color change when he was wearing alexios outfit 1000 connor wearing his grandfathers robes i hate how they did the trim on shays outfit looks like cardboard bouncing back and forth whyd they have to mess that up does conner change his body depending on the outfit is it just me or did shays outfit look wrong on connor without a hood can anyone tell me if itll be on the playstation store shays outfit looks good thnx for making the video very cool aguilar outfit looks great on connor i just want the fucking tyranny of washington outfit is it too much to ask just curious how do you actually get those pants parts of alexios outfit in the actual ac odissey i could never get that exactly one they really didnt put much effort in arnos outfit i am so happy they added the washington dlc outfit to the main game can we unequip weapons now i always wandered how conner would look like in his grandfather robes well now i know youve gone back to milking ac bayek is that you connor got no legs in the alexios outfit lmao edward and aguilar outfits look the best on conner besides ezios and altair did they get rid of the other outfits from the original game like the captain of the aquila and the colonial outfits i love the content keep it up also if you dont have the original game but you play the remaster do you still get the connor legacy outfit for edward in black flag bayeks and shays outfits looked the best in him in all honesty id wear the shit outta shays outfit i kinda like the aguliar outfit why is it ubisoft never give enough love to ezio original ac2 outfit altairs armour or his revelations outfit its always the one from brotherhood did connor do white with alexios armour lol imagine assassins creed remakeremaster and altar with alexioss outfit bayek and ezio are the best assasin altair also can you wear connors wolf outfit while playing the main story i kinda like the bayek outfit is it just me or does jacobs outfit look better in ac3 remastered than ac syndicate i was just playing the original ac3 before this video came out did they remove the original outfits or are they still in the game ex achilles outfit thats cute but do dyed versions of the standard outfit display properly in cutscenes and why did they get rid of them what happened to all the old outfits why does connor have such a big head in the arno outfit they did arno dirty smh bayeks outfit fits connor best because of their matching skin tones build and they both use a bow he almost looks like bayek in bayeks outfit the arno one looks fucking weird i mostly associate arno with his default dark blue outfit the orangei still love it though can u toggle the hood on or off year 2019 shays outfit still hasnt a hood i love how jacobs and arnos outfits look but the bow and arrow looks a bit weird on them damn shays outfit make connor look like a gangster i knew it will look good but that mask tho lmao my nigga connor looks like a gang member tbh in this game arnos legacy outfit is shit compared to his actual default look alexios isnt the canon character but the outfit is referred to as his hmmm man the more i see of aguliar the more i wish we would have had a game with him instead of the film why the hell didnt they give connor his proper skintone when donning the alexios outfit those pasty white limbs just look plain silly on him im kinda early hmm needs a little more orange if i use alexios outfit im gonna make a deal with myself that i dont look at the front cause i aint trying to see connors thighs shay and edwards outfit looks good on connor ezios revelation robes would be sick whyd they say bayek was the cofounder when he was the founder i know its not a big deal but come on assmasters creed 3 demastered some legacy skins i wish they added the ac2 ezio outfit i would have preferred new outfits over legacy outfits tbh did anyone actually use the outfit from odyssey that they put in this game its ugly as fuck even in odyssey let alone this game finally cant wait to ware the the washington outfit in the main story the aguliar outfit just looks off with a shaved protagonist in my opinion i know this outfit isnt a legacy but im glad ubisoft added the animal spirit one to the main game hey fishy i know this is kind of not your style but is it possible that you could take a look at the army of two games i havent found anyone who has done a retrospective on the series and i would like to hear your views on that type of game my dude that alexios outfit is fucking funny as shit what outfit would you say is the best looking on connor from the legacy outfits they used the early version of arnos outfit not the actual one in unity im disappointed had to choose between this and your stream im first today first hi fizhy in top 10 could you remaster assassins creed 2 100 lol is that the same voice actor for dr zere from dying light deleted it after playing for 5 minutes looks no better then ps3 version glad i didnt pay for it far cry 5 graphics was just about to replay this on ps3 never really bought the dlc held off because i expected this and thankfully here it is honestly graphics were still really good even on last gen so just install a graphic mod and it will look better than ac remasterd ubisoft i like your games but i really do not understand why you guys believe that orange is an upgrade the world isnt orange a very good idea but still waiting for ac 1 over here like come on i acheived better results using reshade im glad im getting this for free with my assassins creed odyssey ultimate edition as theyre no way id pay for it even at 4k this game looks exactly the same as the original for me which i already own on pc well it has an orange filter now lmao it seems new lighting adds depth and detail to world during gameplay which is really great at the same time many have noted that the cutscenes look worse this is probably because the original cutscenes used the old lighting system to create dynamic contrasts and shadows to enhance the mood the eyes often used to look creepily reflective in dark but with reflections and contrasts completely gone characters now look more like lifeless mannequins this is especially true with the scene with haytham and connor on the roof the original version with its dynamic contrast between dark and light reflected the dramatic mood of the scene and the character of haytham the new one misses completely the artistic meaning of the scene i hope this is still work in progress and cutscenes will also be fixed not just technically but also artistically to reflect the intention of the original developers ubisoft you have a real masterpiece at your hands please do it proper credit my biggest question will it come with multiplayer please say yes please say yes why cant capcom be like ubisoft and put both version of their xbox games on xbox one waiting for the face comparisons didnt see a whole lot of lip movements ac2 remastered also had very weird faces i remember how terrible the original optimization was hope they fix it im probably better off asking on twitter but will the wolfhood outfit from the king washington be in the main game it wasnt before and to be honest look better than the orginal perfect move pc version the first one was shit wow the game that killed desmond is back the owners of season pass will get it earliermy favourite ac ever i rebought the original download reshade for pc and thank me later for remastering every single game on pc d never understood why people hate on this game i actually think its one of the better stories in the original series assassin creed 3 reshade assassin creed 3 remastered not bad the orange filter jokes are funny but im just glad to have all the kenways on the ps4 now and desmond that guy needs respect love connor now remake ac1 id actually pay 100 for it good but can you make an ac2 remake does it also fix the countless bugs the game still has after all this time how about the multiplayer ubisoft they have erased it from their history is this remaster really necessary what about remaster the second game so now its in the summer yeah remastered version of one of the most boring ac games ever cant wait connor kenway amazing assassin why not actually make the game look remastered instead of adding a filter im definitely getting this this game includes the bugs too thats a lot of volumetric fog hope they changed the story as well because wack probably buy just for the dlc king washington was amazing still think alt history is something you could do more of in dlc oh wow you brightened it up whats the big difference you didnt remodel anything cant wait the firt assassins need remastered not this best part in ac history i love this game assassins creed 2 remastered would be better nothing is true plot twist remastered includes a different md ending and thats where theyll proceed on with the series let me dream looks like a normal modded version of the game i know ac4 was brought out on xbox one but a remastered version of that would make me sooo happy damnit stop all these remasters and give us assassins creed 1 a remaster more yellow remastered xd omfg is the a dlc or a stand alone game remastered ezios timeline please and the people that have old version pc cant you remaster the first one assasins creed 3 yellow edition finally my favourite assassins creed 3 the graphics are great for the remaster than the original type that my favourite assassins creed 3 game same like rogue exactly no change but more orange buguisoft is back on pc we call this mods if i have bought assassins creed 3 i will get remaster 3 or will i have to buy it just imagine what the remaster remaster will look like in another 6 years did this game really need a remaster this subtle after re2 nothing will impress me sure but this is just lazy stuff fuck yeah my favorite in the series is getting some love the face animations are terrible hope the controls feel modern 100 achilles let me tell you something connor life is not a fairytale and there are no happy endings connor no not when men like you are left in charge wow connor was an ahole i love achilles omg cant wait either drop the price of the dlc or offer a price drop by half for the remaster 40 bucks for a 8 years old game is too much for the same price you offered ezios trilogy with all dlcs and there were 3 games not just one finally men miss ac i a good game absolutely castrated by a poor story and even poorer mission design when capcom do it yes when ubisoft do it woaah they just want more money well wake up my sweet child everybody wants more money and if i am gonna play this game with better graphics and design thanks to new technology what is the problem ps remaster and remake is different i know i just hate the critism ubi getting from this wow the colors look a bit yellowish cant believe such a technology i wish they actually added new props etc rather than literally just improve the graphics and lighting slightly oh its blue light filter and thats it d now all they need to do is ac1 slightly different light now pay full price motherfuckers assassins creed oranges i cant wait ive completed ac3 three times cant wait to do a fourth now i havent played liberation or the solo dlc so even better hunting every achievement will be fun too ahhh i cant wait cant wait to think of ac4 remastered ubisoft why cant you make a sequel for assassins creed 3 and retcon desmonds death wow it looks the same but with different lightingr u serious the first ac that ruined everything that came before fully missed this game i really rated it this and brotherhood were my fav and 2 ofc fix the missions and the ending dont be like dark souls r looking forward to removing that orange filter capcom sets the bar too high for a remake i know its a remake but a remaster should get the same treatment instead of making it more orange and put a full price in it graphics sameee this is main game orange is the new creed higher resolution and much better surface and foliage textures absolutely awesome lighting new character and npc models characters have been repainted and polished from head to toe as you guys notice their eyes have so much more life than a pair of shiny golf ball looking ones weve yet to see how the combat and and free running navigation feels because apparently thats been improved phenomenally so hands down the best looking remaster for assassins creed 3 well done ubisoft your work has paid off and to those complaining really need to grow a pair and just appreciate it because its so much better to have an absolutely awesome fully polished remaster like this compared to a simple non improved compatible copy like they did with the far cry 3 classic edition graphics never were a problem of this game wrong ac game to be remastered bugisoft its like the whole game is now during sunset and is orange some parts dont look as good and the game wasnt great anyway why not bring the games fans liked the most to a newer engine make assassins creed ii remastered assassins creed brotherhood and assassins creed revelations switch huh poor connor he got played this is not fake i hope the game breaking glitches in the dlc are fixed in this remaster when i completed the 360 version of ac3 last year i came across a game breaking glitch in the first episode of the dlc that prevented progress so i hope its been fixed and it can be completed now after spending more than 100 hours on origins i dont think if ill ever wanna play another ac games origins set the bar too high for other ac games its too good of a game we want new missions for black flag 4 ubisoft this game had the best combat system and animations connor was very much a brawler and brutal in his fighting aco preorder ultimate edition worth it i enjoyed this game but do we really need this it looks epic cant wait for it i literally just bought the old ac3 deluxe for pc an hour before this was announced sigh which shots were the remaster that music is mad nostalgic man even those men you fought to save have turned their backs on you yet you fight you resist why because no one else will what is up with ubisoft and their obsession on yellow piss filter pack it in lads for fuck sake its ubisoft believe it when you actually see it the first game in the series i didnt bother to preorder and also wheres radioactive my starting assassins creed remastered this was amazing cant wait till i get this perfect better should have done a brotherhood remaster at least tell me you wont be selling this 60 euro connor is the coolest ac protagonist appearancewise i miss the days when each ac protagonist was recognizable by their awesome and iconic clothing that was thrown away back in unity where rpgstyle customization was introduced and its gotten worse ever since hell yeah all the ac games remastered on ps4 sucks that ac1 isnt included as part of a pack or something just to complete the set theyve found the miracle of the brown filter i think it kind of fits the game giving everything a yellow sheen does not actually improve a game get rid of the yellow filter um wtf wrong game 35 no thanks why change the hue its so distracting and unnecessary you guys should create remastered of assasins creed 1 and 2 super awesome but i really dont think i can make it through that opening section this a remaster oh cmon resident evil 2 got remaster this is more like reskin not worth to be called remaster there are only two path how to deal this money greed doom bfg way and trully sensitive to fans approach resident evil ii way which one are you i will not judge until this so called remaster will be out but ive got some idea people still complaining that it looks bad its a remaster not remake i am playing it nevertheless why ac3 why not ac1 or 2 so you just added a yellow filter no multiplayer again why dont even need to remaster it just add it into the game on xbox atleast same for the ezio collection dont wanna have to buy ac3 xbox 360 version to just to play multiplayer how about you remaster the first assassins creed charlie lee ending ruined this game who else is looking forward to murdering the british again 1776 freedom what about the onliiiineeeee ac unity that i truly need so connor the least interesting assassin in the series gets a remaster fine and all but what about altair or ezio those are 10 times more interesting personalities and stories im so getting this will shay cormac be mentioned or seen in this remastered version all of my tension used to be gone just by roaming around the frontier have the people who are still bitching about connor played as that boring chore of a protagonist known as arno well an orange filter covers the last gen graphics to make it new gen imo not one of the best acs but the remaster looks nice i guess this was actually my favourite ac game thinking about it ac4 was also great but it needed to be a bit more fleshed out less buggy and smoother i guess ac3 was the same though i dont know why i liked ac from the beginning but then i stopped liking it after a while assassins creed iii remastered oranges ayyyyeeeee hell yeah let us play as haytham again by god please basically the same except with a hue change increased resolution and a bit of motion blur sometimes its hard to tell how much better something looks on youtube im sure itll look much better on my 4k hdr tv finally first thoughtyes please second thought i neeed ac1 remaster too my first assassins creed game assassins creed 3 and the best in the collection fuck off and give assassins creed 1 the re2 remake quality it deserves desmond is back the best ac game fight me cowards cant wait to see desmond dying with new graphics i hope time to go faster from now until its release realising that the cartoonish rpg style combat isnt selling very well in comparison to the older better ac games the grass is more realistic and the pixels are better but what is that orange color ok boys and girls we both know what the last assassins creed game is now to be remastered the best ac game in terms of story soundtracks and combat animations cant wait for march 29th are the controls remaining the same or will they modernize them i remember playing the old games and the controls were all over the place it took 8 years to make the game more orangey wow an actual ac game i wish it was a stand alone game and not an extra for odyssey season pass how is it already sold out great another lazy ass cash grab nice hype the last good assassins creed all games after that has no story when will the crack come i still say the desmond ending was cheap and halfassed did they used unitys engine ffs wow thats awesome wait i thought you get this if you bought the ac odyssey season pass make another ezio game that focuses on story i never liked the way ezio ran in his games everything was great though just the running his elbow movement when running looked bad ezios games were great because of story and setting put in a plot twist or something maybe bring desmond back that would allow us to play ezio the fans want it free for season pass owners this was my life bk in the day bought the season pass just for thiss ill pass you gave assassins creed 3 away for free on pc like last year lol looks very good hell yeah connori am back ac 2 series is the one im waiting for want to see desmond back again in this remastered edition so if i buy assassins creed odyssey season pass do i get this free still liberation and ac3 bringbackdesmond is this the standalone one oe the dlc one a ubisoft remaster with a noticeable visual difference thought id never see the day way to go you just picked the wrong game to remaster like they when they remasters mwf1 when everyone prefers mwf2 how much money do i need to buy it my first ac game dear ubisoft doesnt mean that it helped you made money in the past doesnt mean that people will buy it again knowing the storyline isnt that good 055 damn that theme hits right in the feels 116 an ac remaster that is not just a slight tweak unprecedented uuff that theme its been awhile 3 and the award for the best running walking goes to ac3 the most underrated game in the franchise looking great definitely looked 10 times better than the original one kudos should have forgot odyssey last year and just released this odyssey is absolute shite in terms of the ac universe looks very good but im still waiting for a ac 1 remastered best assassins creed game very nice best combat animations in the history of ac whats the difference so they made it more orange ok lets go i cant wait to replay one of my favorite assassins creed game again i think you make it worse first ac 3 was the best ac game assassins creed 3 and assassins creed unity are the best the best gameplay in the assassin creed is in blackflag but the best story is in assassin creed 3 what a masterpiece he is good but ezio is the best the way connor run its amazing the parkour is bad has he gone mad im so shit at jumping in this game if im moving to another direction i like the running style and pakour of connor my god the thumbnail is hideous last ac nice ac3 hey this is kind of late but i still dont get how to do double kills with pistols in black flag or rogue i use a ps4 could anyone help me pls does the remastered version of the game finally look better now is it patched hey ed would love to see an ac unity medieval gear vid played this for like 10 hours and im still not connor forgot how much it dragged at the start i

miles oh my god god name a bigger liar than the devil me ubisoft hey ubisoft im looking forward to playing assassins creed 3 remastered and one of my biggest expectations is to improve the animation of connors hidden blade by showing it performing the traditional function and maybe make that choice instead of always using knife form thanks ubi for bringing every ac game to ps4 and xbox one i am waiting for ac1 to close this generation with a golden key i never had a favorite videogame franchise until i met ac in 2017 i am kind late to the party i know but the feeling is real may the father

yesterday because of my ac odyssey season pass and ill play it with much fun jesus the ai in liberation looks awful damn this remaster somehow looks worse than the original this is the most fucked up

huumhumm ok take me money again mmmmmm sure why not price of paisa new game today march 29why i cant access the game not for me to judge but why would you remaster one of the worst assassins creeds in the series ohubisoftu made my wish come true just one more wish pleaseplease make a game with ezios badass moments arnos parkour skills conners combat and edwards weapons please this is a little fans wish assassins creed iii remastered when i said it would still be a low system because my computer low system do ac4 remastered too bad the combat is still the same it was so painfully easy the graphic is way to good its the 29th and no where to be seen its just the favorite game of my lifei literally have everything about ac iii better remake the first ac i miss the praying nice nostalgia and everything but its still looks and feels out dated af especially after games like origins and odyssey man i hope this franchise will never die this is the game that killed desmond edit did they really change anything because it look like what i have already played the regular version on ps3 recently i thought the story was really good and much better than black flag other things i really liked was the homestead mechanic the assassin recruit and city sector liberation how detailed the naval battles were the horses the huge nature area and the far longer daynight cycles cons poor main mission design qtes and the horrible abstergo real world bs now remaster ac4 please very very very nice i enjoyed aciii but a better apperance does not make connor a less boring character or the game less buggy just fix for honor connection how come the assassins moves in 3 and liberation were more fluid then odyssey so this releases at 1pm tomorrowlame af i want to play it at 12am tonight will it be on steam for sale no it was just black flag and rogue not odyssey oh great now i can see desmond die in full hd where is haitham kenway i know that he is a templar but he is an awesome character whats next assasins creed remastered hd remasteredultimate remastered edition hd 4k only 3 forts actually 139 more forts would be so good assassins creed 2 remastered how to make money with 2 3 new gameplay mechanics and a yellow filter 018 the scream made me realise its ac3 menu theme in background of the videoat least til 035but appeared again at 159238 damn d woah o i cant wait for tomorrow d i will revisit those 2 at the right time 3 ive never played ac lll dlcs now its time for remaster the classic 1st one with altair he brings up the modern day sequences and canons as if they are a seamless part of the game no they are meant for certain setpieces and missions only 153 that was a nice cut so glad i bought ac odysseys season pass lol i got ac3 today one day early better than all this garbage they are making now like how are you going to have an assassins creed without the hidden blade terrible parkour and taking things out like hiding against a wall has it been released yet imagine a secret mission where connor hunts shay this is my all time favorite ac game i have a feeling the reason we have gone on so long without the very original assassins creed being remastered is because it isnt being remastered but actually remade while i loved the game it was quite outdated when comparing it just to ac2 so there is no way it would hold up as a mere remaster nowdays it would have to be completely remade from the ground up i just hope im right conner my favourit accharacter my favorite assassins creed i just hope that exploration and map uncovering is not going to be such a pain in the ass in the wilderness it looks good but ill wait for the black flag remaster instead of doing new cool games they release anew and so cool games that you can not touch ubisoft can we get black flag remastered new life for connor i miss blackflag i would play it again but i had the disc version and it got corrupted i sadly never finished it i still remember the river fightmmm what a day play ac on pc as smooth as you can what a joke it looks the same welp ill keep my money in my pockets for now fix crash assassins creed odyssey on pc i cant wait anymore 258 holy fuck connors face if it was remake i would buy it omg finally released i wish they remake ac 1 incl graphic and new combat system like originsodyssey man this game was good 3 ac unity remastered wierd animations tho

any idea if its coming out with the online mode remastered as well or only single player i hope there will be russian language does this include multiplayer though like the original isnt this already backwards compatible his dads a templar suck it sojust the same game but with better lighting did the fighting system get remastered too i wish i could turn my 360 version of ac3 into the remastered version dont you get this for free with the odyssey season pass yea ima need that one been too long since i played ac3 who the hell asked for this dim the white loading light the greatest main theme song and antagonist haytham of the full seriesbut the shittiest ending for both desmond and connor im still waiting for the first assassins creed to be remastered best ac game made hands down the last good ac game cant wait i remember this came out when i was in 8th grade and we were learning about this era in american history should of bought it to actually learn something but y start with 3 50 shades of yellow i did not fw this game or revelations i really wanted to like them piss poor effort still my favourite assassins creed still has the best theme song of any ac game will will it actually not bug out this time lol what color enhancement not worth it well i know what im getting in march yessssss we need more of connor still got the original one awesome cant wait to play orange i love it black flag remastered will sell faster than fresh bread wish it was ac4 instead they made it orange i just finished assassins creed2 on the ezo collection cant wait to play this again played it when first came out on xbox 360 wasnt this out like 2 days ago please tell me its coming to pc probably equally buggy i own assassins creed 3 with the backwards compatibility on my xbox one i hope one day if you already own the game you get the remaster for free meh already played it remastered e3 version of the game sooooo can we get multiplayer heck yeah cant wait to get it it just looks yellow but thats the problem with remastering newer games nothing looks truly different its too subtle cant wait to hunt and trade goods again i woud say that game killed the series but black flag just did that does this include the multiplayer the best game in the series the best assasins creed ac 3 was my favorite ac game ever still play it on the 360 thank you for this xbox loved assassins creed iii and cant wait to play the remastered version on march 29th why play this game when you can go back in time this was the first assassins creed game i played id be happy to play it again looks really good one of the last good ac games by far my favorite assassins creed will be buying the models still lookweird oh lord ive been waiting for this omg yes 3 i loved this one you mean bearings are best played on pc and xbox they should remaster black flag after this its my favourite assassins creed after the ezio collection age restricted are you serious theres literally nothing offensive about this video more like games play best on pc am i right i have ac3 but i never played it are the controls the same as the original or are they rebinded just the favorite game of my lifeand i had played everything you imagine resident evil operation raccoon city backwards compatible i wonder when this was gonna get remastered totally buying finally love but please remaster black flag dont think we needed this remastered but never played it so i can finally play it lol nope if only connor wasnt so boring i cant wait to get this game as well and im going to be getting all assassins creed games one the best assassins creed after ezio saga the last great assassins creed game ac3 one of my all time favorites just what the world need more assassins creed as if the other 50 wasnt enough love assassin creed i realy love assassin creed updated yes i have the old version it was for xbox 360 and it works on my xbox 1 the assassins creed iii remastered now have good color ill like it if its cheap so gonna get that game does it have new quests my xbox 360 red ringed ill buy it for sure this game looks beautiful heck yeah cant wait to get it oh yeah third hey i cant find my ac3 remastered on my ps4 console i bought ac odyssey season pass if they want to remaster one series in ac all they should remaster ac2 and launch ac2 collection edition to pc ac3 is so bored have no any special new feature in the series then the crafting of stuffs from animal skin is so cumbersome to players just consuming u times to do or find these unique animal nothings else to the remaster edition if u didnt play it or get it from free bonus dont buy it its not worth for your first ac experience please respond is 30 fps on ps4 disturbing you i have a question which one is better syndicate or unitynot storywise i have a ps4 slim so is unity really glitchy and which combat is better pls answer this game is my life right now what do you think of the ezio collection is it different enough for me to grab even though i bought this game recently ugh i want to i install this again this has made my day how does this remarster answer the question to how does connor slit someones throat with a stone tomahawk so they added a warming filter and more bloom 2012 why cant i pick this fucking lock 2019 cool now i can see the lock i still cant fucking pick still the best assassins creed love this game ik 3 is the dark horse of the series but i love this game so so sososo much way more than ii and brotherhood they have made it so orange wtf so of putting ac 3 was probanly my favorite and when back in the days when they did the coming home trailer did they just change it to yellow color if theres no assassin turkey we rebel what the dev called remaster is the modder call enb assasins creed yellostered 80 are about some yellow sht is it just me or does the older one look better we finally have the golden filters yay i honestly dont know why people hate this game its not a remaster original graphics were much better even on console does this have multiplayer with it one of the favourites have to play it again especially when it came with odyssey wait is it just a recolor to be more yellow so all that changes are the graphics ac is worst game best ubisoft game series is prince of persia assassins creed is a dying breed it seems like after assassins creed 2 ot started to suck but then black flag which is a great game not so much an assassin game but last good one with at least the title end it please or come out with something worthwhile because honestly after the ezio trilogy its been pretty terrible i play this game remastered bad graphics whats the difference just colors wise smfh best ac game ever not sure how ign gave it a 5 i love ac but i hate to say it they look almost no different so they chose to remaster perhaps the most tedious ac ever gg altair ezio connor 3 of the best what i disliked about ac3 the first time around is that open combat was no longer discouraged and in some parts even encouraged currently on sequence 2 of the remaster skeptic as to whether they changed that bit ubisoft did u make this so every classic ac fan can relive the sorrow of desmond miles death the most beautiful ac in my opinion it only deserves a whole rebuild on todays tech and with a naval campaign improvement if every ac was built on this model everything would be great the fight and amazing combos hunting the community of the domaine to build and and that ship damn it was perfect way better than the jackdaw talking about black flag it would have been better to have real improvements as the game goes on come on you cant see a brick drawning a capital ship could have been nice to be able to get a man o war and truly custom it adding that to an open world and a multiplayer the kind of open world like the silent hunter franchise where the danger can be anywhere its great but the stupid dlc doesnt even load or save your progress its just yellow now i thought they will bring him back but they put up a filter on the same game though conner deserves remasters every time when technology improves the kenway trilogy ubisoft should do a remastered version of ac 1 ac 2 brotherhood and revelations i would love to see those games in the new engine and better graphics looks shitty shadows textures etc the tweaks are kinda weird in spots and can make some scenes kinda creepy too its tooo clean of a remaster as far as graphics in the tighter scenes faces and indoors and still cool or better in the open world better controls in parkour but still has the issues the old version had so yeah the original still works i agree when he said in the name of i thought he was gonna say jesus i about to say whaaa assassins creed iii reshade assassins creed yellow version because yellow is dynamic light and shadow add some hd textures add dynamic lightening add dynamic shadows change some colours statues in the theater for example get some sepia filter on it remastered buy it again for 60 bucks bitches got the game today and man i must be spoiled by graphics nowadays i thought it was pretty good when it first came out but playing it again even remastered the graphics kinda suck still love the game though how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in my way i shoot a guy in the neck with my bow tomahawk chop is my deathblow imagine if they have actually redone the graphics so bit more foliage and an orange filter that it also we need remaster for ac2 revelation and black flag should have been a remaster of the iconic ac2 this was my fave by far is this an april fools joke how are you making this comparison in 1080p this is why ubisoft is failing look the same with color coding reshade 3rd quarter 2019 assassins creed 3 black screen of death all i see is different colours and the game that nobody liked how about black flag ffs people actually liked that one soooremastered godrays is that all if so its not worth more then 5 since godrays a new game make not ubisoft remastered ezio trilogy rogue ac3 and liberation but no assassins creed 1 whats next assassins creed bloodlines hd this should be a free upgrade for owners of the original game for digital copies so a remastering is going from cool to warm this isnt a remaster they just added minecraft shaders will i get it if i have the original one with all dlcs so everything got an orange filter best thing is that skyrim mod community does the same job better faster easier and for free pro tip just buy the regular one and apply sweetfx hmmm i think ubisoft could have done more for this title the change is minimal if they ever do blackflag it better look photo realistic af and not just improved lighting guess it was too much of work for billion dollar company with thousands of employees to do the remaster themselves and do an actual one meaning rebuild and redo the whole game in an up to date engine now its orange buy it i would suggest remastering ac 2 and ac brotherhood and black flag hated it the first time round no interest in buying it again terrible game black flag is superior in every way how many fools can i kill today so in some meeting someone said lets add a sepia filter to ac3 and there was much rejoicing i loved it the first time around but likely wont play the remake unless there is more than just visuals to be had 106 connor looks so bad what have they done to ac3 ubisoft its called assassins creed for the reason in odyssey there no hidden blades or hoods whats going on the ac game of all time is coming back out and more yellow then ever odyssey was trash everything about ac3 is perfect hands down will this ever get cheaper i feel like it is too expensive at the moment all assassin creed but assassin creed 3 very nice another overpriced underlivering uibsoft product why cant we just get back to 1 attempt at assassinating people how to make a million for 3 days of work add yellow filter and activate nvidia raytracing ubisoft headmanlets make assassins creed 3 remastered crewwhat about adding yellowish tint ubisoft headmanthats more than enough good job i love ac games looking forward to the new ac from all the assassins creed why choose the worst one for a remastered version we want ac 4 remastered ac black flag was the best ac game should have remastered 1 2 brotherhood and revelations instead of this assassins creed iii recolored have you played ac3 remastered nah no need ive just made my screen yellowish i cant believe ac 3 is the only assassins ive ever played and loved it played it on ps3 and might get again on pc ubisoft creates assassins creed 3 also ubisoft changes some lights and call it a remaster totally not worth buying honestly graphics look cleaner but no less cartoonish idk of all acs that could have gotten a remaster or just a genuine fix they chose the worse one i mean the history and the story was spot on but it was so goddamn boring at times sun is 30 bucks assassins creed iii sepia edition i cant tell any difference in the graphics other than the fact that you made everything yellow this was also a trash game to begin with why are people excited apart from some key events it was the most forgettable story in the franchise the writing behind this game was next level bad team haytham unite i liked ac3 but really i can see no difference in this remastering assassins creed iii yellow filter version ac3 is actually a pretty good game when it first came out i didnt get beer stand all the hate for it did they only change everything from morning to afternoon thats what everything looks like lmfao so enb gaming companies are a bad joke when it comes to remasters hahahaha make an ac1 remaster and then shut up and take our money im coming home im coming homedont get it sorry but not ac2 wtf oh thank god this was my favorite one one of the best assassins creed game ever made how about you remaster the ezio series 2 brotherhood and revelations brown filter great innovation man who gives a fk about the american revolution we need something more exciting than this trash american history i just cant stand the fact that there is no multiplayer in this one why not assassins creed 2 no updated polys just some recolors this is not a remaster this is a change of color pallete i hope this is selling for 15 because at 60 or even 30 or 40 this is a massive waste of time and money for consumers i really wanted to love this game because i love native american culture and myths but it just wasnt enough to keep me playing id love to see them totally remade revisited but i doubt theyll do that should be free to assassins creed iii pc owners or was the pc version already the remastered version i bet i can find a reshadesweetfx preset that makes my original ac3 look exactly the same this remastered is definitely not worth the 40 price tag the real question is out of all the ac games to remaster why this one why the one with desmonds end ubisofts trying to tell us something but what so you added a piss filter big whoop so you really out here not about to remaster the best game in the series ac2 just gonna sit on a shelf aight i see you ubi this game spelled the doom of the series everything but black flag and syndicate has been trash since should of remastered black flag assassins creed 3 sepia color assassins creed 3 remastered 710 too much yellow ign is it online mp this game helped me with my history class with some questions can any one else not find it in the ps4 store wtf are they out of stories or what this is bullshit i mean it was fantastic the entire series of assassins creed till black flag was great unity orign and odyssey are the worst assassins creed ever they broke the mechanism of the original assassins creed and now they are remastering the assassins creed 3 atleast if ubisoft cant make good assassins creed anymore they should just discontinue the great assassins creed like they did with prince of persia get rid of that hideous yellow filter what in the world were you thinking it makes the whole game ugly original one looks way better tf is dis welcome back master connor kenway we have missed you 2k textures this time wait until ac black flag got remastered for me once the combat changed the love for the series changed with it all they did it seems like was change the time of day to evening for every part they showed already out on the high seas ive taken a look at the files in the game and did some data mining it is the same engine with lighting tweaks and some added post processing effect you better off using reshade unless godrays really flip your switch assassins creed 3 if it was assassins creed 4 id be excited after playing every single ac game thru recently i do like something about every single game ac3 kept the ship as a side thing it wasnt huge ac4 was great playing it again but rogue was so annoying i didnt even beat it the first time i played it i was oh god its another ship game its a fun change of pace but those games are just annoying id rather be running for miles than sail around i wish unity had another year of development it was awesome to play with other ac players for once throughout your story its nice theyve reset the story back for more games i guess but i was always interested in the present day story line and ac3 just fucked it ever since they should remaster them all starting from the beginning id love to see ezio remastered and id love to see the first game remastered fix the same lines being repeater endlessly wherever you go this is my favorite creed game screw the people who say otherwise if you want hd textures and a lighting overhaul you can skip the remastered version and just get mods from the nexus community hell yes yes my favorite ac of all time assassins creed iii sweetfx assassins creed 3 is my favorite game from assassins creed series just an orange filter and its called remastered right 4 more days hell yes black flag was the best ac ac3 vs rd2 graphics wait theres no competition still dont understand why they would remaster this one instead of the one that is renowned as the best one ever and do 4 instead i mean i like it but brotherhood would be a way better option to remaster ac iii remastered lighting coming to pc looks pretty game is still garbage however absolutely loved this game by far my favorite in the series cant wait to play it again fav one out of them all by far so hyped 2012 assassins creed 3 2019 remastered 2025 revisited 2029 was a timeless classic the patches will be included with the game fuckers downgraded character textures wtf did they make the desmond levels repayable did they fix the weapon wheel to be like ac4 no ill stick to 2012 edition thanks tomahawk chop is my deathblow how many fools can i kill today to many to count dont get in myy way shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow tomahawk chop is my deathblow ahh finally i like the new games but the originals are my favorites especially 3 wouldnt be cool if there was an assassins creed game that was set in the 19th century like what if the mafia gang like al capone and such was a front for the new assassin order like every assassins creed game always has 1 or more important people who help you like benjamin franklin leonardo george washington etc but what if it was al capone it would also be sick if they traded the old hooded uniform for like trench coats with the fedora like a mafia or spider man noir thing idk it would be dope imo not on pc assassins creed 3 but more yellow this time and for those who already have the original can get the game for free or at a discount or simply buy it as new because it is remastered seriously because the graphics are the most important in the series of assassins creed obvious i hope they leave the combat alone i miss the days of one shoting people and not having the beautiful words hidden behind level locks that i didnt want to grind out to have access too i hope this game has multiplayer if they remaster black flag i want them to make it so that i can wear the pirate cloak and the pirate captain at the same time if i have game on uplaywill i be able to play remastered or need to pay ahhhhthat ac3 main menu soundtrackso many memories we seek the same as you boy lets hope that they have fixed the glitches why is the original so coloursapped though just looks like they addedchanged colour filters wheres far cry 3 remastered if you have the time and resources to remaster ac3 we need a far cry 3 remaster it has ac unity graphics now if i already owned it on ps3 am i getting the yellow tint update on ps4 for free i notice if they remake games its more detailed and there subset the soundtrack for this game was amazing ac 123 and 4 all had great soundtracks then after that other than rogue they said screw it just make something without care or effort for the soundtrack i wanned to play that game because it was so atraktive but i only had a ps4 and i never get to play it in ps3 times thx i hope they add more side quest like in black flag and rogue where you can conquer enemy area so they added a piss filter ac3 wasnt bad just lackluster i enjoyed this game when it first came out i didnt even know people didnt like conner either i see protagonists in a different way i suppose assasins creed odyssey players that have the season pass get this free i believe i liked ac3 but ac4 is way better 1 the double assassinating in not new already in original 2 whispering from a bush to attract enemies is not new original was from a hay cart 3 only free aiming is new graphics need more weapon and attack skills so they added a red color filter to the whole game is that about right ac2 andor brotherhood please the last assassins creed that i truly liked getting this for free with my odyssey season pass looks good never played ac3 so im all about it now this is how you do a remaster i immediately thought of all the other remasters that were created in the last 8 years and thought this was going to be a disappointment no sir take my money best assassins creed game without a doubt best assasins creed in my opinion i didnt ask for this assassins creed 1 should be remastered not this one i hope they remaster rogue as well by far the best ac about the americas assassins creed 3 mars man i wish they could have put this on the 360 ac1 ac2 ac3 ac4 are the best games in the series they need to do one on the civil war cool colors warm colors they should change it back assassins creed with connor mcgregor cool gonna preorder it comes with liberation which ive never played so thats even better so basically its a reshade why not ac 2 the remaster nobody asked for 2012 assassins creed 3 cloudy weather 2019 assassins creed 3 sunset wheres that viking ac where you fight dragons at lets go dont spent money on this the original color corection is more better imho hype is real why have i not heard about this i love the assassins creed games so much that my car yeti rambler laptop toolbox my bedroom backpack all have the assassins logo i hope we can turn off the stupid glow around npcs this time ong some of these games helped in school lmaoo imagine this remaster with unity parkour omg at least make desmond outfits charles smith does this come with two games game has mass effect andromeda faces hahaha why the hell did they choose to remaster this one you spend so much of the game just ramboing people with tomahawks barely assassinating yikes loved ac3 one thing that i found frustrating however was the fact that there seemed to be a glitch with respect to actions you can take in response to a firing squad about to fire on you in some cases i could use an enemy as a human shield but in other cases it wouldnt let me and it seemed to be random do you know if this has been modified in any way thank you cant wait to play the remaster please black flag remaster lol who would want to play the worst assassins creed when they killed off desmond for no reason other than theyre not creative enough to continue the story i was done give me 5 minutes and i could have came up with a better ending what a joke would be much better if you guys remaster the ezio trilogy ac3 is my favorite ac game out of all whoever like ac4 was nuts bc that game got so boring bc of how long it took to sail everywhere soooooo boring and just got old they now need to remake black flag this is beautiful but just imagine if they remastered and rerecorded all ac 4 lines just imagine the sheer beauty of the gameplay while youre on the boat looking at the oceans scenery and the beautiful distant islands i just hope they dont change anything beside the graphics hopefully this brings multiplayer back as well ac3 like idk if its just me but i found ac3 boring compared to ezios trilogy and black flag getting it for liberations remaster tho unless they plan to sell it separately later love this game has my favorite soundtrack possibly of any game what about multiplayer the best assassins creed because ameri can we please be able to buy a musket and carry it around like unity asc 3 and black flag are my favorite of the series i have been waiting forever im definitely going to get the remastered version i got this game on its release back in 2012 and i enjoyed it i didnt mind the slow pacing at all and i didnt understand the hate this game got my only issues with the game were the menus and some of the optional objectives were harder than they should have been probably the dullest thing in the game were the tunnels other than my issues and tunnels the game was a fun experience so basically they just increased the warmth well done ubisoft the new outfits will be good but pls do not remove the old outfits they made everything brown i was literally playing ac3 on backwards compatible today and was thinking what if they remaster this yo im getting this straight this remaster is going to be a big hit assassins creed 3 was far ahead of its time and unfortunately released after the conclusion of ezio one of gamings favourite charactersand now that many miss the old ac style of games people will try this game again or perhaps for the first time and will be completely drawn in no hype no expectations everyone will just experience the game properly and realise what a masterpiece this game is it wont happen but i hope they add a mission for us to kill shay cormac but i dont think they will do it my mom tooked away my ps4 and i got the ac odyssey ultimate editiom whitch gives me the ac 3 remaster faaaaaaaaak u mom and fakkkkkkkk your life gooooooooooddddd anyone know if theyre bringing back the multiplayer aspect of ac iii it says all dlcs so im wondering thanks i swear you better not sell this remaster thing as 60 dollar my grandson sees ac3 on its pedestal in the living room whats this grandpa sit down boy im going to tell you a great story ac 3 remes is bad one of the worst games in the series dont know why they decided to remake this one i hope they have the updated controls now we can play with the original e3 graphics more like assassins creed 3 not downgraded version what killed it for me with these old ac games was the horrendous combat system press b to parry them press x to kill too easy especially compared to the new take on ac games shut up and take my money take ac3 put an instagram filer over it and bam you got a remaster it better be 60fps imo best ac game ever dont mess this one up ubisoft please is it just me or is the lighting much more natural looking in the original version either way being reminded of this game makes me wonder what a ac civil war game could look like though im still waiting for joan of arc and shao jun games i think they remastered it because in this one desmond lives i am so exited too bad theres no female protagonist am i the only one who truly loved this game i really liked connors stoicness and really liked the story as well especially the parts where connors father was involved i have the original version and soon the remastered version i will do comparison on my 360 and one i havent played this game since it came out shouldve been assassins creed 2 all in gold bronse color and this is your remaster look at call of duty modern warfare remastered thats real remaster im fucking hyped for this this is why i got the gold edition of odyssey this my alltime favorite ac game i already replayed this a year or two ago but man ill do it a hundred more times edit and one of the greatest ost of all time god damn the title theme used to be my morning alarm p looks like a good of remaster of a mediocre entry in the series why didnt they give ac2 this treatment instead of the shitty remaster we got better do unity one of the best scenario in series what about people that own the original pc version will we get an upgrade umm why do a comparison video and then upload it in such shockingly low quality i see no difference whatsoever between the original and this remastered edition i should point out that i do own assassins creed odyssey ultimate edition so i will get this and liberation for free anyway but ubisoft should have uploaded this at 4k not 1080p as how are we supposed to see any difference at 1080p how many fools can i kill today the pc version is coming to consoles why the haystack is this age restricted i just wanna go back to being an assassin not some gladiator getting the amazing dlc and these remasters glorified ports with gameplay changes was well worth my 26 with multiplayer could we get a remake of assassins creed 1 altair will and always be my favorite assassin my favourite ac game but even i dont think i can be convinced to buy this shameless repackaging of a 7 year old game it doesnt even look very good me doctor i think i have assassins creed 3 remastered doctor no you have jaundice that will be 40 please my favourite assassins creed game thank you ubisoft very cool why ac3 get remastered they should remastered asassins creed1 why it looks yellowishis it a ips panel i cant be the only one that learned more history from assassins creed than from school this game has the best detailed historical knowledge of all ac settings great job weaving the games story in the background of real historic events i mean you get to participate in the boston tea party reminds me of dan browns writing style by taking detailed historic events and telling a story about how things could have been to lead up to these events oh you guys tweaks the white balance to more warm and called it remasteredokcoolwont argue about that will it feature a multiplayer tho id rather have ac2 remastered looks great cant wait to play i never played assassins creed 3 of all the franchise i have but i got it on my dlc from odyssey when it comes out ill give it a try seem not that bad after all what if this remastered version could turn out to be really good i honestly think it will be a great game but thats my opinion just remake assassins creed 3 entirely the story and character arcs so badly need an upgrade now with modern technology and the ability to make it this huge sprawling story like the witcher 3 or hell even odyssey i want that i want the story and character of connor not to be suffocated by stupid limitations also the desmond story shouldve been beefed up too all i care about is no health bars anyone agree we need high graphics remastered assasians creed 2 revelation how will the combat bewill it hold more to the original style of combat or more like the oddesy and origins combat system we can still hope for new combat machanics im really glad i got that version of the new ac where i automatically get this now i hope they fixed the glitches that the original had like i hope different colored outfits that you bought at the general store finally show up in cutscenes also a small one but in the original connor would have his right hand closed after you kill someone in combat with the hidden blade and the way to fix it was to pull your tomahawk out and put it away those two glitches just bothered me i know its small compared to the other glitches in the game that are more game breaking but i just hope they fixed a majority of them both big and small if its not broke dont fix it people are complaining and im here all surprised by how upgraded the lights and shades are what about assasins creed brotherhood remastered love ac3 one of the best im addicted to ac odessey ac black flag should be remastered hell yes im hype to play this game again i think its good that its getting a remaster as it didnt really have its time to shine as the xbox1 and ps4 came out around that time also dont fight about the whole blue and yellow thing its just warm and cold colors this game already looks fantastic on my ps3 i dont need to waste money on getting it again on my ps4 connor is my favourite character in assassins creed gameswhy people hate him he is a badassi cant wait to play it will there by physical copies how modern warfare 4 had makarov as a easter egg lets hope shay is a easter egg great way to sell more copies of a game you already made instead of just making a new one you guys planning on touching up unity and adding more things to it theres actually an upgrade on textures and shaders or its just a upgrade on the resolution thats cool now can we have ac4 remastered system specific cant wait for this im getting it through the assassins creed odyssey season pass ready for this no pc remastered yes my favorite assassin hope they add more mechanics than just add new graphic like throw the tomahawk jumping while shooting the arrow like in the trailer or actually run fight horde of army on horse like the first cinematic trailer or make stealth even harder with smarter enemies ubi soft so how do we make money employees make ac3 yellowish ubi soft great idea wow so many likes thnx guys ac2 still the best ive played combat system have improved but for its time it was great i was super hyped until i realized this was the revolution setting that ive already played looks great but idk if i want to buy it if ive already played it so a sepia effect has been added wow truly a must buy to everyone who says that connor is dark and mostly has no emotion has never heard of batman besides ubisoft was portraying connor as a silent but strong type for ac3 yuo had me at liberation ok im excited for hunting in this game and the ship combat and everything please remaster 12 bh revelations i was just playing ac3 because i was bored lol if you could completely take out desmonds missions i would be happy only want to play in the animus can u plz make a samurai themed assassins creed im so happy they finally decided to remaster this game as its my favourite ac game so far still waiting for a trailer showing off the updated machanics ubisoft is the new apple publish the previous thing again is this free for the original owners on uplay or steam more navel battles better faces more combat variation better hair better water more weapons more missions my list what they should do d ac3 remastered is due this month buying it finally back to a good assassins game not that rpg trash first good thing ubisoft has done in years i did not enjoy this game at all the only creed i just didnt bother to finish game developers will change the lighting a little bit and call it a fucking remaster wheres the hd textures already paid for ac3 ima be pirating this to replay tho looks like they did the same thing with the skyrim remaster and the skyrim remaster was very ugly and made a suppost to be cold place look tropical i liked this game but did we really need a remaster of this did anyone even ask for this lmao better off making it backwards compatible if it isnt already they need to ramake edzio saga with unitys parkour o and not just a filter like this garbage but an actual remake like the new resident evil ac liberation remastered hmm its been reworked then thats worth a play through need more envolvment like prince of persia maybe u can make sme tree to tree climb run n stop press e button for killing bears proof that assassins creed is the wests version of jojos bizarre adventure altairjonathan noble respectable but often looked down upon by his father figure and had to fight someone very close to him seen as boring by the fans eziojoseph next iteration of the bloodline whos fun quirky and charismatic and intelligent most of his family had a tragic death is now feeling the effects of his predecessors altiarjonathan conflicts being the pillarmenthe reformed templars we get to see him grow into an old man as well connorjotaro stoic and aloof personality but incredibly powerful more so than his predecessors doesnt say much but doesnt need to say much and is mixed race edwardjosuke much like eziojoseph he is charismatic smart skilled and reliable and his story takes a drastically different tone than previous stories in the franchise evie jacobgiorno ultimate gangstars 4 lyf arnojolyne framed for murder and sent to prison upon which hesh ubisoft please can you remastered of assassin creed 4 black flag assassins creed revolation was a muslim oh i cant wait this is my 2nd favorite one the combat in this game is something else miss this type of combat style hate the new combat in the ac games feels to clunky there is a sale in uplay right now you can buy ac odyssey gold edition with 50 off and this game came for free also you can buy a 20 coupon with 100u and add it to the already discounted game this being my first ac game i played really happy to see this remastered it really needed it hey we should remaster one of our older ac games yes but which one well we could do ac2 the one that is still considered to be the best in the series or the other one that everyone forgot existed ac 3 it is then when i tell yall im buying this i mean it like connor is and has always been my favorite and i hated everyone that said the original was trash he the best out of em all and not for pc i know a lot of people didnt like assassins creed three but it was honestly my favourite game out of all of them im so much excited for switch version for my favorite assassin creed glade i bought odyssey gold edition on the ubisoft sale i got the season pass and my fav ac game from it im happy its the best one assassins creed 3 honestly had the best story not including ezio will it include online tho question did you went the lazy way and simply upgraded the graphics slightly or did you actually bother to fix the insane bugs and glitches this game had they pulled an assassins creed revelations on us they just made the game yellow p damn am i happy about this that was by far my favorite ps3 game seeing it come to ps4 is awesome so is this a remaster of asassisn creed 3 liberation with the girl and her family yess i been waiting for this i cant wait to see connor ask for charles lee again no 60fps no buy its simple damn excited since i grew up with this game i love all of a sudden people like ac3 orgins and odessy are trash because of the gameplay bring old fighting style back ive been waiting for this game to be remastered ac3 is by far my favorite ac game black flag being a close 2nd i wished there wouldve been more haytham connor moments together not just 1 whole sequence thats it im so happy this was my favorite character by far wtf i literally just beat the game today again and i see this fuuuuuccccc i want a modern time 21s century 2020 time assassin creed game i better be able to buy this on disk on ps4 man this game was lit in 2012 no one asked for this they are just milking money out of you ac fan boys because they have ran out of ideas please remaster 1 how many fools can i kill today just added a yellow filter to everything lol guys its remastered i promise assassins creed 3 was my favorite so ill definitely get this who asked for this nice ubisoft better than origins and odyssey so they made the game have more sunlight is that supposed to impress me my favorite ac of the series i was excited for this game the key word is was now im really fucking excited for this game the game that i 1st played that had an m rating i finely get to play again best ac game ever and thats a fact glad i got this free lol this is a remaster not a remake a remake is a complete overhaul of the entire game including but not limited to graphics voice acting game engine story soundtrack etc the entire game is essentially remade a good example is the resident evil 2 remake a remaster is pretty much just a game being ported from last gen to current gen with the differences only being a higher resolution increased framerate changes to the lighting hence why it looks so yellow and some textureanimation improvements aside from that the game remains the same in all other aspects some examples include halo ce2 anniversary resident evil 4 and dark souls remastered heres to hoping they also fixed the bugs as well im going to buy this game for sure this will be cheaper so excited to hunt charles lee again oh they just add a filter i mean i was an idiot for expecting a res 2 type remake lol yo ubisoft should make an assassins creed about the spanishamerican war in the philippines fight the communists remaster assasins creed 2 plzz honestly the original graphics still hold up today all they did was make it yellow lol its still a cop for me tho this is my favorite ac never disrespect ac3 like that againyouve been warned to get this do i have to buy the dlc for odyssey or will it be sold separately on its own too i meanyou are going to fix the shitty gameplaycombat right this was probably one of the worst assassins creeds smh wish they made a proper remastered version of brotherhood that was a masterpiece best ac soundtrack hands down do you really call that remastered ha it only color changes assassins creed 3 is my favorite because of the changes on the running animations that really bothered me in previous titles and the combat is just more solid especially handtohand combat and when i beat the game i just try to get as many double execution with all the weapons and tools ahahahagun through the mouth of one enemy and then points to one enemy and then shoot is favorite ahaha i hate the fact that literally everyone hated on this game once it gets remastered you guys love it ohh best charecter omg i always loved this game just some examples does odysse season pass version has same realsede date 11 k templars disliked this you just made it yellow wtf ubisoft please remaster ac 1 or brotherhood i think ubisoft needs money the only assassins creed game i ever played how is this age restricted wow this is the best assassins creed iii thats what im talking about i hate achilles he is evil templars are the good guys i just hope its not a remaster like the ezio trilogy was a remaster bloom slightly higher res polygons more flowers in the foliage godrays fog and making it warmer colors thats all great and stuff but why arent we getting a real remaster for ac ac2 acb and acr ac3 doesnt even look that dated on the pc the original and the ezio trilogy on the other hand do look dated and would work awesome with a visual tuneup i am so happy they are remastering this game my favorite in the series i wish theres a continuation of ac3 looks like skyrim with an enb not the sort of difference i was expecting no one asked for this this was my favorite ac dont forget that they remastered assassins creed rogue and that was barely even a remaster it didnt look so great hopefully this looks good though loved this game murcia odyssey is my first ac and i really love it anyone that played the original ac 3 think its worth it to buy this remastered one what was the original footage captured on pc looks more sleek than i remember it being on ps3 wheres charles lee and those who already had the game have to buy it to have it or they will have it for free they added a reshade preset beautiful i hope steam gets the remaster aswell so is this going to be like skyrim special edition where you guys just change the lighting and make minimal to no improvements to the texture and mesh quality literally the best assassins creed assassins creed 3 was my entrance into the franchise back in 2012 assassins creed 3 remains my favorite ac game to date recently very recently decided to catch up as the last ac i completed was assassins creed unity didnt much care for assassins creed syndicate that one was eh boring and not memorable in my opinion ac 3 was just amazing the history the graphics alone was worth the price of admission the snow being able to be in the room where the declaration and the birth of america took place was amazing assassins creed iii made it brighter edition i dont care the fraking graphics ill buy it anyway the original ac3 looks good making it yellow and adding pretty god rays is cool but im not paying full price again for it sorry ubi please new ac game ubisoft okay i will say that my opinions dont mean jack so beat you to it 90 of the haters in comments buuuut i liked the game when i first played it but randomly remastering a game is kind of lame its not that old i would have given it a little while longer i definitely would have re done assassins creed 1 first that was an amazing game changed everything when it came out the franchise and the skills of the teams creating them have grown so much since the original game itd be nice to see it updated and extended connor wasnt that cool my favourite ac game but yellowaaawesomee this is my first ac gamesdamn i love this game am i the only one who thinks black flag was garbage ok thanks bye wish they changed the way he walks im buying this i mean its more yellow ill give them that we need assassins creed 4 black flag super remastered it looks like it was animated using gmod to bad well never get multiplayer back how to remaster make colors yellow this looks like garbage lmao why do companies think a remaster is adding bloom fx lighting making the game yellow and having god rays to be honest i dont appreciate these new lightnings the story is about a dark world trough the eyes of an native american freedom fighter where its dark bitter and more into the story than if it was brighter anyone else who agree with me connors speech better be in this game why not pc why 3 and not 2 ac 2 is the best in the series cant believe this came out 7 years ago screen goes brighter and the bugs still exist plz make this game we really want this game again i want connor and arno hunting down shay it could be a great adventurethriller game they chase him throughout the world and in the end they realize he was not completely wrong my boy is back in town can you climb trees normally yet dont you get this if you have the season pass for odyssey stop using heavily compressed sounds for ac and ill change my mind haha you guys cant make up anymore games so you remaster it lol assasins creed bluelight filter edition my favorite assassins creed of all time my brother promised hed buy this for me and ac 1 come on ubisoft this was my favorite assassins creed this or black flag the game no one asked for there are mods that make this look better am buying it regardless im hoping theyll add connors forsaken speech im doubtful theyll do it though will there be a remaster of the multiplayer game asking for a friend this game was so mediocre when you choose to remaster the worst ac game why would they remaster this game why not ac2 this game is really not good please no lets go washington so its gonna have graphics and controls like origins and odyssey out of all the assasins creed games this and black flag are the 2 i wanted remastered for finally so theyre making everyone orange cant wait to re play one of my all time favs plays with the hue slider and calls it remastered finally i can shoot mofos in the throat with my bow again will this game have a code for all the dlc cause i want it ingame the old version has a better i dont understand its yellow now if aciii had odyssey graphics it would look way better imo is this real best assasins creed ac3 and brotherhood are my favs ac 3 the best fightings art move ever created d still hoping ubisoft put the movement code into odyssey and origins so the battle will be more artistic just ljke ac 3 dont even care about this i just want liberation ubisoft for the win when ac was good i remember wanting this when it came out but never bought it i will definitely be getting this one i really hope it can also be for the ps3 look at that exactly same game but gotta waste 40 so it can look a little nicer this is whats wrong with gaming now days ac3 had the best story best characterscombat and best of everythinggggggggggg so how much are betting that its gonna just look slightly better than its original version cant wait get to play this game with better graphics and get to collect all the gamerscore again when you have no game to make and you have to release a game like every year this is what you get if connor didnt talk id love this game even more than i already do theme wise certainly in my top 3 ac games next to origins and black flag am i the only one that remembers this game looking like rdr 2 couldnt remaster audio though eh ubisoft what is it with you guys and shitty audio quality im playing origins and ive heard better sounding voices in games from the early 2000s my favorite assassins creed thank you not paying another 60 for a remastered game so they put an instagram filter on it an amazing piece of american history retold beautifully hopefully theyll remaster black flag the first ac or ac2 deserved a remake imo the worst one of the series it was so boring i know a lot of people didnt like it but 3 was one of my favorites in the series conor was fucking brutal with his fighting style which yes made it a bit easier but i had a blast with it one of my favorite things was getting as many guards as i could find and fighting huge groups of them also i love the revolutionary war setting my mate told me about this and i didnt believe him this is beyond useless this is a joke wtf assasins creed liberation i love assassin creed but i just think the remastered is useless because ubisoft should be creating a new splinter cell game i still think a remastered is a cool thing but some people thinks ubisoft needs to make a new splinter cell game make a sequel connor kenway meet shay cormac saying its just yellow is not true focus on the close details all i want is nowisclears throat realistic gore ac3 yellow edition it kind of looks the same never played the dlc though so i guess thatll be fun this one had the best finishers hes probably the best fighter and has a big physique i hope they fixed the horses cause goddamn they made me rage will it be on steam one of the most disappointing games i ever played dont get it twisted not terrible disappointing dont see the point in this i cant wait to beat people across the head with a big blue stick while run ing around with dual pistols lmao those were the days i really dont care about colors that much even though its great but the mechanics of game play is more important if they would have updated how fluid the motions of the characters could be the animation in cut scenes sure ill buy it again for the colors i can rearrange the settings on my tv stop lying yourselfjust spit it outnew ac sucksold games are better thats why people hype old ac games remastered now its time for the only ac game which has not been remastered yet the original assassins creed so you guys remaster assassins creed iii but not ii brotherhood or revelations ok where is the smosh song my favorite game of the entire franchise it is great to see remastered a true master piece i cant wait i already have rouge remastered but now this man it just seems like theyre going with my favorite games in their series orignal is the best its going to be like how they did aciirev remastered where the world graphics are beautiful but the characters look like they are made out of mud clay dude i just relayed the third one and beat it today for like the tenth time and then i see this make a black flag remastered black flag and origins are the best ac games in the world edward kenway is the best protagonist so is bayek of siwa ac3 was honestly my childhood hey everyone this game is also coming to nintendo switch on may 21 i expected little bit more its okay but it does not look great just looks like ac 3 with a warm filter put on so fucking pumped bro thank god they are remastering the best game in the series if they really wanted to do a good comparasion the original version shouldve been the fucking pc version not the ps3 version where the graphics are set to low the gun stock was my favorite weapon assassins acreed iii orange edition is it coming out as a disc that would be awesome whos ready for switch version yes i love this game but my favorite is syndicate damn i love the theme song epic i just hoped they fixed all the bugs bro this was the last assassins creed game that i actually enjoyed nooo its not on pc rip im crying of happiness best story in the series im interested to see how this turns out connor was always one of my favorites now we need a remastered assassins creed and im happy its almost the same thing dont need a remaster that soon just an izi money grab the best ac game i played among the series how many fools can i kill today i beat this game 4 times i just want ac brotherhood remastered with the new free running system waiting for the face comparisons didnt see a whole lot of lip movements ac2 remastered also had very weird faces so all i see is an increase in saturation i thought it would be like better animation this is totally unnecessarily the game looked fine i prefer this kind of assassins creed and unity creed gameplay then the newer ones with the level systems and stuff but either way love the series why no one asked for this i loved that game alot i love native americans i stopped buying assassins creed games after ac3 because of how bad it was they have only killed desmond so they could just make ac games forever and get infinite money without finishing the story and lets not forget about the cheesy 2012 end of the world plot this game sucked ofc you can say gameplay was ok but a game isnt only gameplay the last ac game was revelations i didnt like the original much but this makes it look pretty good tbh this did not need a remaster but ac1 did anyways this is good tho that yellowish lightning or whatever honestly makes it more artificial than realistic if we got assassins 3 original should we buy for the remastered come one assassin creed rogue remastered with ray tracing doesnt look that much better for me to buy and play again remaster revalations too that was my shhhiiittttuh ubisoft dev can we make an original game ubisoft corporateok ok i get that buthow about we just put a new tint on ac3 and call it a day everyone claps haha lets make some money please add skip checkpoints to assassin creed are you going to fix the controls or is it going to be like darksiders i normally call bullshit on remastered titles but im kinda excited about this one assassins creed 3 sepia im definitely getting the game again this one was my favourite why dont you just remastered your best story which is ezios story ubisoft i heard you liked god rays customers i guess i cant wait to buy this on the switch this game was awesome is it just polished or did they add in the mechanics introduced in origins that fixed the series does this mean we can play the tyrany if king george without a single crash or game breaking bug assassins creed 1 needs a remaster top 3 assassins creed games is 3 black flag and rogue so wheres the remastered version i love assassins creed but upgrade the graphics a bit more conner is back and remastered hopefully a ac1 remake in the future hearing the music gives me goosebumps and chills everything is now applied to with a shy yellow filter that has been widely adopted by the majority of games this generation yessssssss this was the first one i ever played i got it for christmas cause i wanted it so bad really think people were wrong for hating on this like i never understood it at all i thought it was an incredible game thats what we were talking about carry on the job remastered every old ac with 4k ghrapicsand u will rock again pls dont use the shitty new combat system yes this was the first ever game i played this remaster better not have that desmond animus stuff because that was the only downfall of ac3 assasins shits liberation this is coming to switch wait wat the worst game of the desmond series is being remastered ugh how to remaster make it orange now we just need a ac 1 remaster and we will have every ac game on the ps4 or xbox one dont own an xbox one but im like 90 sure you guys are the same i cannot wait for charles lee one like 1 charles lee better graphics are nice and all but will i be able to change outfits without loosing a gun this annoyed the hell out of me back on the ps3 and 360 and didnt really hurt the game but still bothered me when i changed my outfits color and it would turn back to its normal white in a cut scene the gun disappearing when you changed your outfit was a bug i hope gets fixed and the outfit color change would just be nice to see as well but honestly those are the only 2 things i hope is fixed in this remaster i have a feeling this 2 year break ubisofts taking is gearing up for a continuation of connors story once they see the demand for ac3 when it drops they will definitely consider continuing the kenway bloodline why dont you guys just finish connors story origins 2 please will all robes and suits bee in it like alexios jacobs edwards shays aguliars bayeks master outfit new weapons arnos adewales best assassins creed game idk why but this makes me really nostalgic why remaster one of the worst games in the franchise unity and ezio trilogy would be a lot better candidates for a remaster i hope they added the ability to skip the credits what a dismal game this was i remember really looking forward to it too same story with almost every ac game out there really ubisoft specialists in consistent disappointment i played this game but i dont remember it at all lol unlike ac1 acetzio 3 parts black flag and origin it should be on xbox 360 too cool but id really rather see a real remastered for pervious assassins creed games with the engine of unity and origin ac3 was my favorite title until rogue was released i go back and play it all the time so im definitely among those looking forward to the remaster especially as im not exactly the biggest fan of ac odyssey the multiplayer aaahhh i missed it it was siiiiiiccccckkkk how about remastering the ones that matter is it just me or is ac3 their favorite game everyone is always trashing it but its always been my favorite in the series black flag is a close second to me chzech republik lokation yes no black flag and this its the best becose have the old compat mode soooothey added a yellow filter it looks pretty much like the only major differences are lighting foliage and possibly a slight change to hair at least from what i could tell who asked for this why are we getting this connor was the most annoying bland character ever really ubisoft 4k support and your comparison is in 1080p ddddddddddddddddd tragiccc why would they remaster this over ac 1 or 2 looks great i hope there will be remastered version of black flag too too much yellow tint how is that realistic anyways ac4 black flag is the best ac of all time so it will get a remake for 5999 of course just change effect blue yellow add some new object new graphic with same story and sell it ubi lembut wants like capcom make remake re2 and we got money haha ubisoft is defferent they just change the camera effect and resell benarkah itu ubilembut do you still get it free if you got the season pass for odyssey is this a reshade filter lmao just buy a pc copy on g2a better graphics and cheaper rip ac series it was fun while it lasted my boy haytham is comming back ezio auditore has joined the chat you could have just remade the ezio trilogy ooh i am crazy about assassin creed played it all age restricted imagine assassin creed having a battle royale unless im living under a rock is this their first ac remaster cause i was pretty sure most people like me just didnt enjoy ac iii im not gonna trash on it or join the bandwagon but wasnt there a lot more fans for ezios trilogy or even altairs story or was i just seeing a few note im not hating on ac iii just curious as to why they remastered this one compared to something like ezios trilogy or altairs story its funny when this was released originally almost everyone was saying it was the weakest ac yet however all im seeing is praise and happiness for this remaster it shows that people dont know what they want meanwhile assassins creed 1 requires going back to ps3 and playing it in 720p with no trophy support after far cry 3 remastered i dont trust ubisoft with rereleases anymore because thats all this is how to make easy money the 3rd is always the best where is charles lee honestly not much seems different im still waiting to see if they lied when they said they were changing the combat worst to best 3 1 revelation unity syndacate brotherhood black flag origins odyssey 2 ac 3 wasnt a bad game at all but at the time i was so hyped by the second chapter and ac3 has only a little in common with ac2 a part the assassins thing what connor said the other part of me is the outsider what i initially heard the other part of me eats the outsider okay wish they can add crouch mode in this people have to die for things to change every game after assassins creed 3 was just bad wait so is assassins creed liberation a download or game im confused i dont give a damn about yall opinions i like this game dont know what people are talking about if you arent blind you can tell there were huge improvements to the graphics maybe even the gameplay looks beautiful if i remember correctly a previous game was remastered with pretty low effort only thing i can noticed is they tried to hide as much of the characters faces suggesting that they didnt bring the facial animations up to speed with the current day who else wants desmond to somehow return because the whole theme of assassins creed and desmond were so original this was the first ac game ive played cant wait to go back to this game again this is my favorite assassins creed game out of all of them im so excited they shouldnt have killed desmond damn it i would love to see ac 2 or brotherhood remastered i never like that yellowish color grading dont get me wrong im excited this just means ill be looking for a no yellow mod but please ubisft dont drown this game with drms thats a fucked up way to reward the people who actually buy your games and by the way ac1 remake when washington was basically a templar i am actually so excited looks the same but a little more polished wow this so disappointing considering how re2 got remastered this looks like they just slapped a filter on it id like black flag with either a 4k update on console or a whole remaster gonna be honest cant really see a difference in those splitscreen comparisons lmao this was not what i was expecting but itll have to do if theyre going to remake an assassins creed give us something like brotherhood 1 or 2 about time out of all the assassin creed games you could have remastered ubisoft this one this one really you would think the one that started it all would have earned that right i guess im wrong or just crazy with no sense of self worth but i just needed to vent this lol unpopular opinion but this is my favorite ac game how about let desmond mind come back in another host and lets finish this i loved aciii and i love origins and odyssey as well difference doesnt mean bad and itll be a nice nostalgia trip reworked the most boring one imo ffs am i the only one who dont see an improvement kinda like the original more then remastered im just gonna sit and wait for black flag it mustve taken a team of 3 people to remake this one guy to up the saturation one guy to add more grass and the other to take dump on ac fans i love all the ac games and i can see how some are less than perfect but i still love all of them but people saying the new ones arent ac games doesnt make sense the franchise has simply advanced do you want the same formula for every game because i sure as hell dont dear ubisoft you will never reach capcoms level in making remastered and remake games im glad they did this i think im going to buy this game one more time the music oh the nostalgia doesnt look a whole lot better lol i dont give two shits give me ii and brotherhood already q how to remaster game a increase saturation looks like you slapped a filter and called it a remastered version ill be honest assassins creed 3 was the most dull one for me connor had the body of a man but the mind of a child he was a gary stu in its most pure form it got so boring that i simply got sick of it in sequence 6 and ran through it as fast as i could every assassins creed game hooked me in some way this one not even close best thing in it was the double counter kills the music and story were good though nice to see an accurate retelling of amercian history without my countrymen blustering about how great washington was made me more invested in ac4 you guys enjoy this its for you ill take a hard pass ill keep enjoying brotherhood and black flag instead dam no switch ubisoft cant make 1080p60p videos lol its time to dudududududududel idk why i wrote that but like this comment love this game awsome its pretty sad to see that they cut multiplayer from the ac3 remaster it was the best part of the game in my opinion i guess they were to lazy i hope you like orange good game but that postprocessing looks trash dial it down not much difference how many fools have i killed today to many to count dont get in my way shoot a mofo in the throat with my bow tomahawk chop is my death blow please get that reference who agrees with me ac 4 blackflag is the best wtf i just downloaded it some days ago and you guys making remastared version now thats not fair placebo rework really add to it the notorious ubisoft downgrades and youve got a completely useless rework just another cash grab for the rich dumbasses out there it will be a great hit just look at 043 the colors are more powerfull not just yellow like the fortnite kiddos keep saying and yea the yellow is used to give the game an old aspect after all its a 2012 game just when i thought all hope was lost now imagine ac2 with unity graphics and parkour cba doing start again takes about 2 hours guys image ac3 combat with unity animationsmap boooooah it just looks like they changed the lighting so basically they just upped the brightness i wish i was able to continue my story with remastered one this was the worst one tho brotherhood on the other hand dope asf what is this just added lightning volumetric fog and saturation is this the remastered version made by a random gta san andreas modder im getting this as soon as it drops where is charles lee about that time imagine them making assassins creed odysseys remastered edition im pretty happy with this especially with rumours of it coming to the switch but why 3 dont get me wrong its a good game but wouldnt it make more sense to remake 1 or 2 i wouldnt have mind if ubisoft just remade ac3 entirely its one of my favorites out the series couldnt have been brotherhood nooooooooooo had to be lll love it its the main reason i got the ult edition of odyssey just one question when are we getting the remastered edition of the original assassins creed best ac story when he started painting his face for wari was screaming like wooooooooo that is amazing so cool now we just need the original assassins creed game to be remastered for ps4 and people can play the entire series well that is if they dont have the old ps3 anymore hope its not buggy like the last assassins creed game still very mixed about this game it needed some fixing on gameplay more than a graphical upgrade original trailer is way better also make faces and animations a bit better pls looks nice my favourite assasins creed finally gets a remastered how about ac2 remake honestly should have done assassins creed 1 or 2 so they made the colors even warmer and added god rays im kind of kidding but seriously i prefer cooler colors it looks amazing though and i can see the effort already preordered this was one of my favorites so happy it got a remaster the game was too beautiful for when it came out on 360 please multiplayer this is ac will desmonds story be touched in this remake if so will they change this story assassins creed 3 but more yellow connors voice is my favorite of the protagonists should of done brotherhood ac 3 had a nice story im going to have so much fun with this game the memories played it so much 114 look at the backround and you will see part of a cintamatic from a old ac 3 cintamatic trailer ive been waiting but shay cormac is my fave this story is depressing i loved it just remake the game all you did was add different colors id rather have a remake of the first and second games what about a remastered ac1 idk y people hate this lol so they remaster the worst entry in the entire series and it doesnt even look that much better damn pc gaming is dead right now meanwhile im still fishing the lannahechee river i started playing assassins creed when ac2 came out i played ac3 the most out of all the games and loved it ive played all the games and beat them multiple times im a ac nerd when i saw this video pop up i thought it was fake i started to cry when i saw ubisoft as the channel this is a nostalgic game and one im definitely playing all summer thank you i know its from a different time period but connor kenway reminds me of a younger version of charles in rdr2 and i dont know why make the lee chase possible please lol to bad you cant change the main character they need to remake the 1st assassins creed with the origins engine and give us the figgin crossbow they showed in the game and trailers that was my biggest disappointment in that game was that but it still a great game that built the foundation for some of the later games this looks great and all buuut how come no ac1 remaster we had the ezio trilogy and now this i miss playing this game this is gonna look so awesome on pc assassins creed ii this game and black flag are probably my favorite ac games of all time excited for this remaster all i want is an ac black flag remake or remastered please make it happen ubisoft who who on this planet of earth wanted this switch why not assassins creed 1 doe this was one of the best ones they ever created does it still have the multiplayer look at bright side atleast we get to see a remastered desmond this game was hell for meand i love it idk why so many people hate ac 3 its my favorite in the series and ive been playing em since day 1 the new assassins creeds i dont like doesnt feel like my character is an assassin ever since black flag its been down hill and black flag started that everyone gets a fucking boner for that one but its the worst ac ive ever played ac black flag remastered the one they released looked horrendous who asked for this the game that never deserved a remaster gets given a remaster no thanks no reason for this whats the difference besides the gold filter looks awesome cant wait to pick it up on switch do one for black flag ac3 has one of the best main themes in the history of games it sounds like a hanz zimmer score i hope the next assassins creed will actually be a assassins game not like odessy that was a rpg what abaut assassins creed 4 black flag remasterd who asked for this nice try ubisoft i aint gonna fall for this again ubisofts version of remastered is just warming up the image and adding godrays how about you actually remaster it then ill buy it loved the atmosphere in this game the story could have been even better than it already was though they should have just expanded upon connors story so we could go back to this time or slightly before this time to be a true native american fighting against the colonials during that time i miss assassins creed multiplayer never got to play this but played liberation definitely getting this love the scenery and what its about asscreed 4 is better wow that is some nice mod they made too warm and yellow people hated that from witcher 3 so good luck if theyre remaking this it makes me wonder if theyre finally getting back to a desmond story line finally something good happening in 2019 what about remaster good ol ezio this soundtrack was gold perfect remastered omg yes this is the only assassin creed i loved so the remastered version adds a gold instagram style filter on top of everything new assassins creed iii with instagram warm filter physical copies for preorder they upgraded the lighting engine from the looks of it not just increased saturation never understood the hype for this game conner has always been the most boring and wooden character in ac for me i want a remaster of brotherhood and revelation theyre going to downgrade the remaster sooooo what about the otherrrsss rainbow six vegas 1 and 2 remastered how about that who wants a ac 4 bf remastered version bruh im a 20 year old man and im actually crying right now i never thought i would see this day i loved building the town up in this game come on ubisoft youve been supporting the switch a lot by decided not to bring this over to their platform as well damn so they made it yellow in my opinion blue colours were better a good game but i cant fully admire connors personality as the main character i liked more his father haytham and sadly the story supposed him to die so they added a orange filter the combat in this game is mind blowing the saga that shot assassins creed into fame was the ezio saga why wont you remaster that so they made it more orangeokey xbox one is backward compatible so later losers so hyped for this this style of assassins creed along with black flag is the pinnacle of the game imo polished just beyond what 1 2 brotherhood revelations were and without the mishaps of unity and syndicate oh can you do assassins creed iv remastered you realese games very fast its awesome and all but we need more kassandra wow instagram filters are really affecting the assassin creed franchise too soon for remaster the original game still rocks im probably gonna get this its my birthday today and honestly this is the bestest present i couldve gotten ac3 is the best game in the series and i cant wait to play it all over again smth changed this and black flag are the best ac games im all for this as long as the redcoats stick around after you beat the game in all honesty i loved this game maybe its cause i just loved the revolution aspect to it we want a new splinter cell game gosh the yellow tint is back and ugly as never before the other enhancements are good though but bloody hell this isnt a sepia movie oo soooo assassins creed yellow everyone is always saying how connor is boring and bland character id like to ask if those people have played the game at all many who say so do not understand connors character in the way he is connor is a bit further from the usual protagonist personality type and thus unpopular for misunderstandings he is not the generic loud extroverted protagonist type who implies his feelings for everyone to see not saying theres anything bad with this only that its different and different is what we need to have every lead figure be practically different versions of ezio with differing levels of passion that would be boring we need to explore people and represent their nature as they are not everyone expresses their passions and fears and confidence in the same way connor is an example of that just because his feelings and thoughts are not exploding out of him doesnt mean they arent there ac 3 is a game where you really need to pay attention to the little details subtle hints ac iii bug fixed but you have to buy the remastered version damn ubi nice marketing strategy nothings improved lmao ubisoft so funny i was expecting the remastered version will appear just like how cod4 and cod4 remastered looked like but anyways this games really great for me connor is different from ezio so dont bother compare them connor matched how indians would be like back in the day ubi just removed the part where he would remove the scalp of his fallen enemy would love to see black flag remastered imo ac iii was the most meh game in the series before unity era this was my first assassins creed and i loved it cant wait to get my hands on the remake we need far cry 3 remastered as well not looking like a huge difference especially from a remaster this better not cost 60 the theme song still gives me chills i remember when this game came out and i can assure you this is what the final product should have been when they released it unfortunately they downgraded it like all the others and now theyre trying to sell us nothing more than textures they already had from the beginning i loved this game but im just going to download it without paying a single ubisoft i love you so they just add darker and more hazey looking graphics wack lets seeim very conflicted my first ac game was unity when i got my xbox one with the ac bundle with ac 4 and ac unity i love both i really do and then i bought origins which the combat system is just less satisfying ive seen slot of stuff on it and heard slot of opinions but i do think origins and odyssey have more challenging combat but its also less satisfying and the animations arent as great syndicate has a very fluid combat system but according to most people its too easy and the combat is stale the same has been said for all of the ac games prior to origins ac 13 ive never played but i have done extensive research into the combat systems of each one so to anyone looking for the better ac game if you like rpgs origins and odyssey are for you if you are a fan of the more stealth based and classic feel syndicate and prior is the way to go i think it just comes down to peoples preferred play style but what do you people in the co btec red dead redemption 2 as good as this is why doesnt ubisoft remaster splinter cell which came out in 2002 assassins creed syndicate and assassins creed 3 were the best i will love it this game was garbage in my opinion now its garbage with kind of better graphic quality you should have released a new sequel instead of making remastered edition btw nice remake my only question is can it play 60fps on a ps4 pro my favorite game of all time getting a remaster take my money now the game that killed the franchise yesss by far the best ac game story wise im gettin it im excited for this tried to play ac3 xbox one backwards compatible but it just kinda hurt looking at the graphics this however goddamn that looks beautiful assasin creed end when desmonds dies i think this is the last assasin creed game who cares about trailers graphics sooooooo you just added an orangish tint to the game cuz thats the only enhanced graphics im seeing i always thought this game got an extremely bad rapi really liked it and am looking forward to play it again this is by far my most favorite assassins creed game the haters can suck a fat one please fix the mini map i cant wait for the downgrade this was personally may favorite assassins creed game excited to play it again question do i need to by odyssey to get this they are remaking my favorite assasins creed and the new far cry is coming out im so happyyyyy i like the visual improvements but i think the colors are too warm and prefer the cooler look of the original this game saved me during history class i didnt even have to pay attention to the teacher one of my favorites i loved this game as someone who made and developed games before i believe it was a couple years ahead of its time mp was great if you didnt know it was kinda an esport ac games was never a jrpg open world it was a laid back let me fight the whole war by myself thing my favourite ac game are the controls like ac origins and ac odyssey also perfect niiiiiiiiiiiiice always loved the homestead missions in this game cant wait to buy and play this hey ubisoft i want to download ac3 dlc all episodes but i couldnt find it please give a link or tell the way to download a lot of people didnt really like this game but this is my second favorite ac ac 2 is my favorite i cannot wait until march 29 im wandering if ubisoft could make rainbow six siege cross play everyone forgets that this game has 11 chapters of tutorial before the game actually starts if they dont make the textures better then i aint buying it why not assassins creed 1 115 i though it says includes all dicks for a second lol ps4 and xbox only where pc lol new filter ill give ya 10 bucks for it its the same game i already own with slightly upgraded visuals didnt an assassins creed game just come out omg yes i loved assassins creed 3 was one of the best ones they can remaster it all they want but it want fix the giant disappointment that was assassins creed 3 please do a unity remastered i wish new ac games would just go back to the combat system they had sure it was easy but it was smooth and felt great i wanted assassins creed in civil war they say theres improved gameplay mechanics how so im playing asasint lll in my java phone xd not on the switch bullshit remastered just like the ezio one make a real remastered like how modern warfare or like re2 we want modern graphics cant pay 60 if it just the computer version on ps4 sorry now im just gonna wait for an ac4 remake anyone else noticed the graphics of any person is much worse than the original like wtf have ubisoft actually done to their faces so they made it more golden brown will multiplayer be back hey alexa play radioactive ac3 undeservedly gets a lot of hate a lot of the gameplay features such as the missions where you recruit new assassins and the homestead missions in particular are painstakingly hard to uncover because the game does a poor job of presenting them to you but i feel like these are some of the most satisfying missions in the entire ac franchise yes the game had a lot of issues at launch but that was because ubisoft was pretty much testing out their new nextgen engine and trying to cram it into ps3s and xbox 360s most of the hate was directed at connor and this was understandable because he was such a polar opposite from ezio but i think his character traits that many dont like are just products of his upbringing that bred a skeptical and untrusting attitude towards pretty much all people and it really fits with the story which is easily one of the best in the franchise also the main theme is probably tied for best in the entire franchise as well its just so epic but ye is this true thats the voice actor for charles in rdr2 right someonewhy do u like this game mebecause no one else will that game was so good watch this get a graphics downgrade just knowing that next years assassins creed will probably have the original assassins creed remastered makes me extremely happy i finished this game 7 times why just for xb and ps im playing on the computer and i dont care to finish this game 1 more time with the new version i can tell you that this game assassins creed iii is my favorite game of assassins creeds games but why my second favorite ac game first was and will always be ac2 easily the most epic game in the series disagree then comment which one is more epic this game continues from brotherhood right remake the 2nd ac and brotherhood they are true classics and best games also ezio auditore best assassin remaster the ezio collections bring back the old assasin creed the new assasin creed are not what is use to be no hate but the old assasin creed is mush funner and the oddesy is not realy an assasin creed you know it has to be like unity not in the grece or in egypte it has to be where unity was the fucked up game design will be fixed too all these people saying everything after this until origins was trash obviously never played black flag wheres san andreas remastered make a new prince of persia u goddamn idiotsstop with ac for a while both the remakes and new installments black flag and this are the best they better still have the same combat system omg ac3 was the first ac i played and it was the best ac imo i played all games after that and its still the best for me i loved ac3 dont get me wrong but out of all to remaster why not ac2 this game was the beginning of the decline for assassins creed imo ezio was the last great assassin templars are right tho the first game i ever played and it was amazing ahhh i love the ac3 main ost unity remake pls it looks like red dead with ninjas imagine assassins creed 1 remastered ill keep my money for this one lol wheres all the people trashing on ac3 all of a sudden you guys like it hopefully better performance ac3 on ps3 was a performance nightmare also the soundtrack on this game is awesome never was my favorite ac game but i always thought it was the one most deserving of a proper remaster apart from the original of course the game was alright a lot different than most but the snow levels really messed it up for me that looks amazing if they added co op missions and multiplayer like unity top ac games in my opinion 100 they white washed the horse how many fools can i kill today i knew they would remaster ac 3 too ahahaa arguably my favorite ac out of them all loved the soundtrack and the combat spite its simplicity connor being my second favorite assassin in the series as well nice they change the color will the remaster be free if you already own the game on xbox 1 kenwayss are back hell yeah hated this game i was so addicted to the game so i decided to start the story again and ended up finishing it in 2 days remake from a ps3 game wow the first ac game i owned and played can we please have an assassins creed black flag remake with different mechanics black flag is my absolute favourite of the entire series i hope the ac liberty remaster has more enemies around the only issue with that game was how boring the combat was because there were never more than 5 enemies to fight assassins creed 3 was hands down my favorite assassins creed game so happy it came out on ps4 the new assassins origins creed odessic addon looks great so its a bit more golden ubisoft just giveaway free digital copies to those who own assassin creed 3 on last generation and i own assassin creed 3 and i would appreciate it because were i live money is low and im only 12 and my parents are low on money and also do a limited time sell and sell this game for free why ac3 i would have rather paid 100 for a altairezio remake any of those 4 amazing hope there will be first assassins creed remaster too my first and favorite assassins creed buying for that remastered horse i am beyond excited for this ac3 is by far my favorite game in the franchise there is none pc version is it just me or at the beginning does he sound different too many blind people in the comment section is it a new disease lol remaster the old assassin creed game pls i want to see ezio in hd the legend game have be reborn when the only difference is lense flares minecraft shaders mod is better people need to stop thinking remake and remaster are the same thing lol people expect remastered games to have a jump towards ac unity quality graphics when thats not how that works ac unity is a next gen game built from the ground up using next gen assets last gen games dontwont ever look truly next gen just from a simple remaster this does look like a better remaster though vs what they did with ac 2 undo shays work connor was so underrated as an assassin got one question will the freerunning be like unity and i hope it is assassin creed 3 best game cant believe 7 years just flew by i cant waiittassassins creed iii is my favorite please tell me there will be pc version please they learned that blue light fliter is good for eyes ps just a joke i know they did more than that yellow filter i cant help but feel this should be released on nintendo switch make it happen ubisoft and while you are at it ac iv black flag remastered would be great too we want prince of persia warrior within remastered assassins creed 2brotherhoodrevelations remester when when can we play it if you got assassin creed odyssey may assassins creed ll comes next but it came out like 7 years ago why remaster so youve added bloom and increased the saturation good work weve been doing that with mods from day one but thanks anyway step 1 paint it yellow step 2 announced remaster step 3 step 4 profit pre rendered bullshittery give me lee this is a really good gamehope the remaster is good but brotherhood and revelations will always b my fav wish they would bring back the old fight system why make a new game when you can just remaster the old one why dont you guys remaster the first one this was the most boring but for some reason it was still good you can remaster this game but not splinter cell i think this is same game no one asked for this ac3 was a terrible game omfg this is my favourite assassins creed now conner smh first he saw his mother burn to death family village burned to ashes at maybe the age of 9 or 10 years old somehow surviving through war up to around the age 17 maybe 18 he has to learn all the skills required to be an assassin stuff that takes people there whole young and young adult life to learn 20 years of training packed into maybe 4 or 5 not to mention being part native american part british caught in the middle of another indian war trying to save his village and land but also trying to help george washington drive the british out he has to kill his own father he has to kill his best friend who he grew up with basically his brother he has to make sure his homestead is not invaded keep his workers safe from harm all of this on his own no brotherhood that he can call on and loses his true father figure and mentor the man who taught him all he knows to an illness all of this through his early to late 20s no peace no comfort nothing but hardsh the only one i was able to beat without getting bored might play it again once the price goes down way too orange is the game old 2019 i wanna see a remake prince of persia my favourite assassins creed after 2 i played it on ps3 360 and wiiu lol by far my favorite game in the series minus all the modern day garbage glad to see it staying strong hopefully the turn out is good videos can be deceiving for better or worse yall just raised the temperature so it has more of a sunset kinda vibe my think is starting remastereding 12 and 3 remastered sorry this content is agerestricted well sht charles lee looks like tom from tom and jerry yellow tint looks more ugly then its original version lol im not buying ac 3 remastered mainly because of that lock picking mini game that made me want to die still didnt fix the lip sync just the first one please this game specific should give proceedings made from the remastered versions to first nations communities across canada and america living in extreme poverty either way i am happy to see a remastered version ac3 had the best combat system and this was my favorite game out of the series youve shown us the lighting and some graphical changes now show us these new and inhanced gameplay machanics youve stated am i the only one who enjoys this game this game tbh conor is boring as hell the only ac game i completed from beginning to end lol this comes out on my birthday wheres charles lee instead of two games in one with one dlc remasters why not make a game the involves all of the kenway sega with all the games and dlcs that it involves now thats is a game that can be sell as a full price game you know like the ezio trilogy want to remaster something add a yellow filter still looks the same though ubibug i mean ubisoft is without ideas please add photo mode let me know when you do black flag all i want to know is can i use the dlc assassin outfit in the main game the last good modern day story in the assasins creed series despite the ending which led to the downfall of the modern stuff that i really enjoyed but cant wait for this to release gonna play all the assasins creed games in order when this comes out playing 1 on my old xbox then all the rest on the ps4 cant wait is like battlefield 3 grey background to battlefield 4 orange background ohalways wanted to play these two its yellow now thats the only difference i see the remaster no one asked for a shame this a downgrade to the original texture wise i expected this to look at least like unity why not the ones before this what about the first this was actually my favorite assissans creed game tyranny of king washington is going to look freaking awesome it looks more yellow ubisoft needs to go back and learn from this game when moving forward the simplicity in gameplay along with the twisting story that kept us guessing and making us work for the better tools along with exposing us to using our brains ac has become so hack and slash and the story has lost its luster id be willing to forgive and forget the last two installments and pick up with the story of after ac iii some people still believe british empire was good this is a game reflecting the true nature of britishers im bout to cry doesnt really look different 3 was the last decent assassins creed i just hope they have a hood on or off button og s will know my brain it only has more yellow me yeah ill buy this game i was hoping this would come i hate the horses in ac3 and the wolfbear quicktime they are so frigging clunky but everything else awestruck this is one of the worst assassins creed ever made the combat system is horrible and the main storyline died in this game along with all assassins creed franchise this brings me back dear ubisoft may i have a assassin creed 1 remake the best assassin creed game of all time thank you ubisoft for remastered my fav game i remember picking this up at midnight said id beat the tutorial before i went to bed little did i know that tutorial was going to be 6 hours long went to work with no sleep worth it though okay maybe it is only a pre conception about those remasters that make the game 1080p and 60fps but it does really seems the exact same game but yellow i cant tell the difference connor for life god i loved this game and the soundtrack was just amazing i just loved the time period too i enjoyed slaying redcoats i wont buy any ac remastered unless they remaster ac 1 godammit im getting this spot the difference at maximum difficulty level in the old gen version this is assassins creed with the worst gameplay in my opinion i hope they fix it in remastered black flag is the only good assassins creed game because its more than an ac game dude hells yes easily my favorite ac story i want to see the best templer heytam keneway im so happy this assassins creed its one my favourite assasins creed 3 remastered safety glasses edition it looks good but the faces definitely need to be updated i hope they remaster black flag aciii is my favorite am i the only one arguably the most underrated protagonist of the series connor is back in glorious form edit 12k likes real assassin creed the new ones just dont compare to the greats this is what ive been waiting for i honestly never thought it would happen well im taking its release day off because i really miss that does it have online tho this was one of the best in the series feels like its nothing more than a filter to be honest yes i been whant a yellow assassins creed for years i am so happy remastered ezio ac2 brotherhood revelation these motherfuckers really just added a sepia filter and an ok graphical uplift and called it a remastered version but wheres my prince of persia remastered or remake ac 4 was the last game that felt like an assassins creed game why make it more yellow though but why oh yeah money uncap framerate finally and better graphics what a steal cant wait to play this on my computer pcmasterrace killing desmond off was the worst thing they could do to the franchise they could have made him a villain instead of killing him off like even though his death is very iconic to the story and one of the best parts of this game man that music ubisoft take my money remakes are cool and all but how about brotherhood remake with campaign coop or any coop also unity and syndicate campaign coops would be great hope theyve finally fixed the low framerate bug in boston best assasins creed game ever i liked this game i dont get all the hate lol i hope this time they get the tea mission correct not the greatest ac game but connor will always be my favorite assassin looks like they added sepia filter you couldve used your resources and time to properly remaster ac2 and brotherhood instead of the mess you gave us with the ezio collection why is this game even happening too bad you guys didnt make the game have a better story not worth a remaster am i onlyone still wating for ps5 to come out so ps4 become cheaper that way ps3 is even more cheaper that way i can play original assassins creed 3 and since the remastered came out it will be cheaper ive beat all assassins creed and platinumed a few but i think ubisoft is running out of games to make i mean ac3 remastered thats not looking good for ubisoft why not splinter cell or something like that i hope they remaster the first assasins creed assassins creed 3 was my first assassins creed game ever probably my first game ive ever bought cant wait to play it again remaster more like added a brown filter time to earn the trophies all over again no way man the best assassins creed game is coming back omgomgomg ac3 yellow edition the horses in this game are so ugly well not bad abite green light and fog better than ezio if you ask me assassins creed ii remastered ubisoft remaster of the first assassins creed my favorite killer was altair you guys did a great story of him i read the books this was the first assassins creed game i ever played i still have my old copy on ps3 even if it wasnt the best of the series it still holds a special place in my heart and i am so glad that ubisoft is giving this game the remaster treatment im definitely getting this when it comes out best assassins creed to ever exist followed by ac2 played it once that was enough for me good game iwill download this game i love ittttt it will be 35 i think but we need arabian lang pleas so is there going to be an assassins creed 1 remake please ubisoft all we asked for was ac 1 remake it looks so good cant wait we need ac2 remastered well its about time it just needs now controls and physics c mon ubisoft i know its good but its too much yellowwhatever you still the bestnow i have to play origins nintendo switch please greatest assassins creed game ever havent played it in almost 10 years and now i will be able to thank you will players bought the original version having access to the remaster feature splinter cell blacklist remastered damn it is gonna be epic ubisoft is gonna downgrade this so much that the remastered is going to look like the original maybe this time it wont be broken af on pc this game looked originally on xbox and it looks good now so ac3 yellow filter slightly brighter in some spots ok well this is somethingno one asked for i wish it was ezio trilogy remastered i hope they got rid of all the notorious bugs and glitches the old ac 3 had remember pistol mismatch bug god that was annoying black flag remaster for the next generation connor is back in town nothing better than dispatching a squad of redcoats in the woods and then disappearing i miss this old combat system so much im assuming since i own the odyssey seasons pass i will get this for free and on the 29th correct is this coming to pc i know we can just play the og assassin creed 3 but i want them nice graphics papa i am so excited for this release i legit spend my childhood playing this game and seeign it come back brings joy to my life like all the flashbacks and stuff while playing it ive never been so excited for a game to come out so far the yellow filter is suppose to make it a more natural feel i stop playing this series after rogue the rest are just plain ridiculous to even play them man i loved ac3 i actually thought the revolution theme really fit the assassins v templar stuff everything about this game except maybe the crafting flowed so well 1 make connor more flushed out 2 have haytham win in an alternate mission 3 have a cutscene where shay kills connor 4 remaster the old ghost recon games and rainbow 6 all of them except for seige 5 keep the far cry formula how it is never change it bye this is the best ac ever too bad its not black flag bring assassins creed back we dont want another rpg we liked this series for a reason dont waste your money this is hardly a remaster my fav ac gsme it was so different and smooth compared to all the other ac games so whats the plan for the combat system is it remaining the same or will it be more like origins and odyssey damn this truly the greatest ac ive played completed the story and handful of times and the free roam was spectacular so they dipped the whole game in piss 054 just a filter cmon it is definitly more than just a filter lol thank you for this remastered capcom make a real remake of resident evil 2 with new mechanics and new cinematics ubisoftchange the light color remake why 3 why if you guys want to be lazy at least remaster the ezio trilogy a remastered that looks downgraded well yeah its a remaster im just glad it wasnt a remake labeled as a remaster or vice versa george washington was an evil man and we need to crush this silly little revolution ac3 was probably my favorite game because of the tree climbing and the hatchet of the creed symbol he ran around and used as a weapon overall 1010 would destroy the world again what about a switch version make it happen ubi these lines 100 were taken from selena gomezs song httpsyoutubeij0p6qtsst184 you cant just add a yellow tint and call it a remaster bruh moment it looks the same now dont turn it into a rpg ty i just 100ed the game a few days ago and i have to say the problem with ac3 wasnt the graphics but the amount of bugs that never got patched especially the dlc was incredibly fun but such a buggy mess that i actually lost all motivation to play it so i really hope this isnt just a graphical overhaul i would get it but you brought the backwards comparable version so ill be keeping my money what will be next for assassins creed find out next time on dragon ball z they should have a viking assassins creed with how theyre rebranding the series with title releases like origins and odyssey not enough viking games for my liking no brotherhood no buy best assassins creed game ac iii enb is it still overloading all the cpu work on a single core the original was polished for the pc when it came out years ago it still looks really pretty i hope this isnt like batman arkham city asylum on ps4 those didnt look as good as their 7 yr old pc counterparts remastered more yellow is it just me or it actually looks worse no im coming home playing in the background 210 trailer it also includes liberation niiiiccceee how about remastering the first ac the one that started it all you better refine and remake the controls and game play according to modern standards yeah lighting great but did you fix the game play combat and stealth in game i would pay for an assassins creed 2 remastered just imagine seeing ezio in odyssey type resolution i want another story of american saga bring connor trilogy this game was the first trash ac why would you remaster it i dont see much of a difference its mostly just a lighting change awesome trailer the ost gave me the nostalgia chills but ill stick woth my old copy best assasins creed game ever made in my opion this was one of my favorites im most definitely getting it again are you people seriously going to buy a sixyearold game again because it is yellow wow we are hitting the lowest of lows the developers are probably laughing their asses off will there be online looks nice i might buy it man im sure excited for this remaster now remake whole ezio story line all 3 games in one game it will sell like why dont you ugh remastered 1 or 2 makeing it yellow isnt going to make it a good game and pc one of the best soundtracks in the series na sta per napoli cool youve brighten everything up wow looks good but the game still sucks sooo they turned on the lights who tf wanted this but its just a yellow filter this isint 2007 lol charles be doing some weird stuff up in the north i hope they add a little to the game more battleground gameplay and many more ship battles this was one of the most important wars in the world so add more battlefield gameplay open fields with waves of men and women falling from gunfire we need to see more they finally did it wohoooooo honestly its ac3 itll be amazing either way but the graphics arent at all better the tone and colour is just improved also i think 60fps for console coming in the remaster textures are changed i have played not worth it worst of the series hated itno thankseven if you make it piss yellow lmao my favorite assassins creed game no one asked for this i just need assassins creed brotherhood remake im surprised honestly i thought the majority disliked aciii personally loved it myself though up there with my favourites in the series the locations were a bit bland for me with no real interesting places to climb the trees parkour was cool in the beginning but felt too similar and copy paste the further into it you got but the story the characters thats what made it for me loved connor despite what ubisoft thinks we dont always need the cocky showoff ezio clones connor was quiet reserved and an absolute badass the best parts were his relationships with achilles and haytham it had a lot more going for it than people gave it credit for when it first came out for the switch another remasterization or lets be honest another milking of the ac series the last ac games i bought was acorigins and it got me bored on other hand i bought and loved acrogue remastered due to its interesting story that plot shifting was awesome also i was quite surprised when you guys put lisbons earthquake in the plot to make shae rebel against the creed actually portugal has such a real immersive history that started with a knight who was offered a small county for his military services and ended up linked to sea exploration around the world atlantic oceans isles south america northsouth africa china japan india etc and that inspired so many european countries to do the same its also thanks to portugals past industrious sea exploration history that the countries in american continent exist the way they are today thats why im surprised you havent research it for next story inspiration purposes but basiclly all ac games have been d why does it look so warm now doesnt ubisoft understand that the lighting of ac1 was the best of the entire series well time to replay and then feel regret after because connor just stuck with hood down and mohawk after you beat the game i look 60fps lol remaster 2012 game seriously will the multiplayer be included this was the best assassins creed game i hope that add more stuff to the game and it isnt just a mod like thing where the lights and some other things are different because i played the original one and hell ima just gonna drop it remastered more saturation my second favorite ac after black flag will be buying for sure so glad theyve remastered it i was thinking to dust off my ol ps3 to play it again but im glad that i didnt do that change the ending with desmond he needs to stay as the main character hey perhaps you should seriously consider the idea of remaking altairezio stories instead of just upscale the resolution we really want something like codmw or re2 in my opinion ac 3 had one of the best soundtrack and background score of all ac series i want brotherhood remasterd ubisoft you are awesome who else always feel on release of new assassin creed game last game was better will be there some god to fight ohh yes so excited i need an ac4 remaster new water physics updated graphics and audio finally i have the chance to play a game spoken so highly of worst ac game ever just remaster the ezio trilogy im happy with this greatly but im still waiting for ubi to stop being dummys and make a decent combat system that has realistic rules intriguing enough to actually immerse in origins almost had me if the combat wasnt so ashy slashy and alittle more calculated and strategic in parrys i wouldve been sold i also cant be the only person who wants the spearshieldsword just mostly a shield to be a viable defenseweapon do a assassin creed game based on india why not the first one back when ac was an ac not an rpg openworld look im not trying to say that the new ones are bad but they are not ac maybe watch cats roma something or gods of egypt ascension of bayek but not acnot assassins creed my fav assasin and my childhood 3 sois it coming to switch just put an orange shader pack over everything and boom remaster this comes with the ac odyessey season pass right i didnt see the differences connor is back this was my first assassins creed its gonna have more story missions or just the same i know the ending will be same where is justin yt add fullscreen support for other resolutions than 1080p looks like a god damn reshade mod pathetic how the heck its age restircted i think ac4 would be better this is where i began assassins creed i wish they would do an american civil war im so glad they made a 2012 game look like a 2014 game great job ea totally not a cashgrab assasins creed 3 the yellow adventures definitely warmer color but really its the lighting in general the cool look was too bland may not be a crazy upgrade but certainly looks better no multiplayer tho only ac game ive played funny thing the disc got scratched and didnt even get 20 through the game siked to pic it up hello and pc version assassins creed 2 please why not 2 this is a real life or this is just my fanstasy when im looking at this trailer i feel sad because the original ac 3 had better graphics than this one this hardly looks different just looks like a different filter over the same graphics looks pretty sickwhat about multiplayer me and my pals always had a blast with that one i cant believe it one of the greatest ac games comes again nostalgia omfg cant wait perfect move from ubi soft those god rays remaster the ezio series id buy it p yeeeeeeessss connor is back why wont they remaster the first one with altair because it was made in 2008 or 2009 i cant remember however rogue one and ac3 dont need to be remastered they look and still run great instead of working on those they could have remastered ac1 within that time and then they could have remastered ones that dont really need it fighting was awesome missions sucked still liked the game though i miss the old ac franchise i hope the next ac was not an rpg you should make brotherhood remastered omg the best part of assasins creed with remaster im waiting for ac 2 remaster too ubisoftif you wanted to remaster a game then it should have been assassin creed 2 well what can i do tho best assassins creed for me best combat soundtrack story well this remaster sucks graphics basically the same with just different lighting remaster the 1 plz altair 4ever this is what i believe the assassins creed franchise should be a game that is about assassins and assassinations not a rpg like origins or odyssey that really isnt about assassins and barely has assassinations in them rly no switch back to the assassin that introduced a whole new definition of fighting for the assassins creed series cant wait for a dunky review 100 old black horse remastered white horse why is not it for pc watching in 144p both looks same expectations remastered like resident evil 2 reality yellow assasins creed iii wtf ubisoft this part of the game isnt the best one why didnt you remaster the first or the second game welcome back ratonhnhakton master connor remaster splinter cell double agent and include multiplayer so you made a remastered verson of the worst assassins creed dont you guys have better to do so a preset enb mod neat lol please make sure the pc port is halfway decent this time the original had some of the worst visual bugs i have ever seen in a game this comparison trailer is bad its so vague what actually improved except the colour basically every modder ever can make a better comparison video between original and graphics mod than this why cant they remaster assassins creed 2 this is really nice from ubisoft including all the dlcs and another ac in it oof the game isnt even that old lol 1 no pc version 2 will be an update for ppl already have ac 3 3 will the pc requires change why is it more sunny now wow im surprised they also remastered liberation cool i might get it cant wait i loved this game alot gets alot of backlash because it was rebounding from the ezio franchise i definitely liked this game its a great game so yellow godrays remaster the best ac game besides the ezio trilogy hands down the where is charles lee simulator xd finally cant wait first day out it over put photo mode in the game pls my personal favorite assassins creed perfect looking good but that eagle mission i remember most about aciii is still going to be just as infuriating no pc version i stoped buying ac games since the third because the traditional bugs present only on pc versions were too much on this one coincidence or not i started the series again z couple of weeks ago using my uplay account for the first time after 7 years and surprise the bugs and crashes were still here lol bro he is charles from rd2 a 3 remake but not the ezio games ezio collection does not count as a remake wow there is no difference whatsoever the only thing that changed in the ac3 is only the lighting fx first blue now yellow ubisoft mostly subpar voice acting basically no immersion imaginen if ezio saga would be one game imagine ac3 and black flag would be one game imagine unity and syndicate justonegameeee would be perfect but no every time ubisoft comes out with new features they recycle this new tiles so your pay 60 dollars for them possibly the worst ac game and now it is yellow i preferred the blue but maybe thats because im a boy who knows completed this game on wii u feels great was fun xd without a doubt my favourite assassins creed game put a urine coloured filter and call it a remaster i wasnt a huge fan of connor but i did enjoy the gameplay the desmond storyline ending sucked hard please let this be real i will buy this game again because no one else will this is legend really omg this is coming out on my birthday thank you ubisoft i hope one day they remaster ac unity on a new gen console and they fix the multiplayer that had the potential to be amazing it still was even dealing with shite bugs and not working 90 of the time amazing this might be the best remastered assassin creed game desmond died in the end wish it was 2 im not shitting on it butout of all the games you could of remastered you chose this one i mean i dont mind but why not one of the ogs give those ones a remastered look if anything thats what seeing this makes me hyped forthe fact that they are willing to remaster their games for the new gen i mean maybe they thought 3 was one of the best but who knows tbh 3 was one of the last good ac games in my opinion it went down hill from there if they made a remastered version on ac2 id love that take my money it was my favorite ac of all time after this plz do ac1 remastered its boring in hell so thnx assassins creed 2 needs a remastered 2012 trailer without night shift 2019 trailer with night shift 80 different from the trailer all they did is turn night shift on glad im not the only one whos annoyed that they just put a different filter on it theyd better make ac2 remastered instead of this literally the most boring assassins creed game and youre remaking it hopefully they remaster ac4 as well i wanna see pirates in 4k that arent owned by disney yes my first assassins creed game is back welcome back haytham and conner kenway exactly what i was hoping for best ac ever change my mind how about a remake or remaster of the first game what is the heccin difference are the countless bugs of original ac iii also remastered in this version shouldve remastered 1 and 2 ubisoft why u no remaster first assassins creedo wow it looks so remastered i love how people ask for remasters but then ridicule ubisoft fordoing what people wanted personally im excited for this remaster ac 3 has always been a top favorite of mine it looks like you added shaders thats it will it have multiplayer my question is it going to have the new combat system or the old one we changed the lighting thatll be 3999 why the worst one greatnow do ac4 remastered for connor grandpa waiting for black flag remastered why you guys didnt choose your most popular title i have no idea now only need a remake of the ac1 we want ezio cant wait ac3 was pretty dece in my book although i prefer a remaster for the ezio trilogy ac3 was still an awesome playthrough how bout you remaster the good ones like one or two or even brotherhood best game in the series did we really need liberation in 4k nice but the map is so goddam big this game sucked only 5999 orange a lot of orange at least this is an actual assassin creed game not sparta remember when assassin creed is an assassin game cant wait to kill some redcoats ubisoft the type of company to remaster their worst game ever why are you remaking this awful game just remake 2 god damn that game is amazing and remade that would win game of the year hard to believe the original game out 7 years ago time flies black flag 2 when ok plz dont be offended americans but this game bored the hell out of me why do i think the original looks better charles smith is that you this was the last and best fucking assasins creed game ever but rtx on how many fools can i kill today when i first played this game in ps3 i was 11 years old and barely understood anything but i still loved the game now im studying about the revolutions so this will make the game a completely different experience for me cant wait why not making a good assassins creed with the graphics of odisey and the epicness and story of 13 bring back the modern days like it was with desmond you had everything to continue a great saga but you just wanted money and new fans your story was awesome was now is just a cool game but not an assassins creed now they just need to make ac black flag remastered remaster the ezio trilogy so skyrims special edition was yellow and now ac 3 is yellow somethings afoot here i can feel it remasters are not even rematsering anymore its just a resolution buff if it was a remaster it could be a whole new engine or start from scratch the game nobody asked for bring back desmond favorite assassins creed story theres another comparison video and he used pc footage for the original it looks 100000000x better than the remastered but this video you can clearly see the remastered is better nobody asked for this when is the physical copy coming out id rather get that then the oddesey dlc this game is my favorite assassins creed of all time and im glad there remastering it assasins creed 2 remaster 30fps in ps4xboxone this is a joke yo when assassins creed 3 remastered comes out march 29 im so getting it hands down wait if we purchased ac3 remastered from ac odyssey will we get ac3 remastered for free they should have done ac2 this game has the best music in the series its not coming on switch excited af dann it looks so pretty cant wait to get this is it bad i couldnt tell witch was the remastered half until i read that it was the remastered half that looked beautiful this was my game i hope the mechanics are remastered as well i fucking love this game while its not my favorite one ac3s soundtrack was and is amazing i wonder how much so all this remaster thing is that blue enviroment its now yellow thats kind lazy why this and not 2 i want a switch versin because i finished on pc and i want a portable option wish the ezio collection was remastered with odysseys graphics very well but only one thing optimize your games please ac odyssey and origins maybe are the worst optimized games ever when are they going to do a remaster prince of persia all yal did was let rkelly piss on the screen im not buying this bullshit lol im out coner coming back omg i still playing blackflang this looks promising although the 1st game remastered would activate some naslagia i really hope they improved on the gameplay and story of the tyranny of king washington dlc this was a truly great assassins creed but my fav of the whole series is origins my top 4 are origins revelations 3 and the original but origins is just awesome everything about it i wish odyssey had the cinematic kills and multikills that this had it does look a bit better then the original did cant wait i remember most people not enjoying ac iii i know i certainly didnt hope this remaster turns out great though theres a lot of fans in the comments so i hope they get the best out of this last assassins creed with horse riding that looks like a mod gta modders created ah yes more orange oh no way the lighting looks worse and more unrealistic sweet ubisot u killed juno in comic and then made remaster now u going to japan to make another useless story for the god sake japan and china err just looks brighter with sharper textures and lens flare remaster brotherhood how much is this gonna cost its my favorite ac game but i dont want to pay another 60 for it when its backwards compatible this is my favourite one i have only played the 1st3rd and some black flag this will be legendwait for it dary legendary ok ey th is i s ep ic out of all ac games to remaster ubi really did ac3 what about revelations cool snapchat filter first time i even played an assassins creed game it was three so its nice to see it have a remastered version so who already own the game in steam will he get an update or he needs to buy it again and i hope the remake pop ubisoft should remake prince of persia series so many people gave this game disrespect i played it when i was twelve and i will never ever forget this game ac 2 is still my favourite in the franchise ac 4 black flag is my 2nd favorite every other is just meh to me especially ac3 i have a question is taking the hood off a new feature because there have been many scenes of gameplay in the remastered version of him walking through town with his hood off which is not a choice in the xbox 360 ps3 how much if its over 30 ill wait assassins creed remastered the lighting is a little better watch it be conpletelt unchanged i wouldve preferred black flag remastered instead it is not yellowit must be morning or evening i wish they make all ezios remastered version assassins creed 3 theater mode looks just like the ezio collection some random relighting the ezio collection was a joke of a remastered you just added the theater mode that my tv has basically i could just press a few buttons on my tv while playing in ton my 360 and get the same result normal assassins creed has no milk remastered assassins creed has milk i wont buy it if its 50 or more it was a great game but its a high price for the same story only with better graphics ac3 was my favorite assassins creed gameconnor was the best he didnt care about honor or templars hes just wanted blood and vengeance for his family and to protect his new one brightness 100 so yet again no pc release this was my favorite one of all unity was buggy af and sucked lmao face it the so said remaster only has better lighting and a shitty filter that is all nothing new no better textures for what ive seen just some grass that you wont even notice during gameplay if you think it is okay to pay for this youre wrong i bet any modder can do that to the original ac3 the kind of people who buy this are the reason the videogame industry is now in its lowest why remaster one of the shittest games in the series its not even a good remaster best assassins creed game why not the first one the game that ruined everything best ac hands down ac iii rtx on this better included something that explains shay patrick cormac why dosent anyone ever try to add newer game mechanics to the remasters any ac game with the crouchcover system would be 10x better for example for everyone saying they just made everything yellow did you actually watch the trailer there were plenty of cool color temperature shots from the remaster the yellow lighting is only ostensibly for a certain time of daythere are several in the game and they likely wanted to showcase it because it is when the new lighting and better godrays and such are most visible cant wait for the graphics downgrade when it releases s thankfully i bought the gold edition of oddesy this looks fantastic looking forward to playing i just wish they did this for assassins creed 2 brotherhood and revelations those games had great stories but the remastereds graphics were terrible they look as if they were barely touched its a shame but at least this looks like more time was definitely spent on this gotta say ac3 is definitely the most deserving of a remaster and not the other older ones that totally werent superior wheres my wallet not the best game but have a great story very cool soundtrack and the best atmosphere recomend to play you will not regret the time spend in thia game i loved this game not ac 2 but good im happy it is happening i feel like theyve just done what they did with brotherhood taken a huge piss on the whole game this is the game that made me stop playing ac i might try this game again i still remember watching the imagine dragons trailer for this game it was so hype never understood the hate for this game tbh i thought it was pretty good introduced ship combat the time period was cool the it was a good coming of age story assassins creed 3 extra yellow edition compared to the recent games ac3 actually looks good now ubisoft should just remaster all the ac games upto 3 sorry but i dont trust ubisoft trailers anymore best assassin creed ever cant wait they should remaster ac1 take my freaking money cant wait to use that nasty axe combat again is it just graphics can i finally fight the redcoat army on the battlefield like in the trailer or will i still get desynced after march 29 the ac franchise is dead i feel they should have remastered black flag rather a much better game imo i cant wait my favorite assassins creed a why b there is literally no improvement how much will it cost just a yellow filter and more god rays 60 well sign me and the america up looks the same with some foliage updates and an orange hue i love this franchise but this probably wouldve been better off packaged with rogue if not 4 as well copping that as soon as it comes out hey it looks like they tried this time thats good resident evil 2 gets a remaster and ubisoft resides to cash out just by making the game yellow haytham dont think i have any intention of caressing your cheek and saying i was wrong i will not weep and wonder what might have been im sure you understand still im proud of you in a way youve shown great conviction strength courage all noble qualities i should have killed you long ago charles lee why do you persist you put us down we rise again you end one plot we forge another you try so hard but it always ends the same those who know you think you mad and this is why even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you yet you fight you resist why connor because no one else will i would consider buying it if they would rework the combat system to be like odyssey or at least unitysyndicate not just the graphics i will make you proud old man please put it on switch i remember the alpha footage being something i was excited for we needed this my brother play this game in ps3 version last 7 years ago but now this year hes gonna do it again he finished the game and now its time to do it again one more time i need ac iv remastered resident evil 2 is a deffiniton of a remake this is not just looks like a reshade and texture mods god dammit ubisoft you remastered like the worst assassins creed dont forget folks you can get the apache edition for just 80 why do people hate on ac3 in my opinion it was really good i loved the story and how they portrayed the revolutionary war it was a great game this game was so boring it isnt worthy of a remastered cash grab another dark souls remastered great what a joke and yall gonna swallow it and pay for the same game with some tunedup graphics can we have ships outside of like 2 missions thank you i cant wait for black flag to be remastered can we get a remake of ac1 and 2 or maybe a remake of prince of persia games you have to be kidding meps4 really youre gonna remaster this but not 2 and brotherhood the ones that made you popular in the first place i wouldve rather had a remake of the original assassins creed but this is cool too nahim good ill stick with odyssey its not enough of a remaster to matter am i the only person here that felt the ezio trilogy was better best one in the series apart from brotherhood yes i have always wanted this game on ps4 who asked for this how to remaster a game step 1 add a yellow overlay step 2 make everything shiny step 3 dats it m8 yer good is it worth buying if this is remastered i can myself remaster the original without buying this one just go to the original and change lightning in display settings there you go its remastered and ready to go is this a joke ubisoft just looks like dynamic lighting wtf i was expecting like a graphics rehaul the best part of ac3 is plaing as haytham rest sucks wait for the micrograms actions to be announced this game better not be 60 the best ac to come out lets just be honest here iii was insanely good especially the combat why not remaster the first one before you start in the middel of the series i shoot a mofo in the throat with a bow most underrated ac game the best assassins creed game who agrees we need remake not remastered man i loved this game the sounds of the snow and climbing the trees everything about this game was amazing i meanassassins creed iii was still the worst one out of the bunch this game was great ac3 radioactive epic so instead of makeing something original theirs just going to be a port even for ubisoft thats lazy who remember smosh making a rap about this game when it was announced good times ac3 with enb preset if they really want to make it a complete remaster replace the godawful ac3 hud with the one from black flagrogue thats the best design choice they could make to convince me into buying this again its a little thing but i hated the ac3 hud so much it dosnt match up at all with the more subtle animus aesthetics black flag did it perfectly i litteraly finish this game with just the first weapons it was so horrible made that is was the last assassins creed game i ever played please make for ps5 everything looks nice but the character models need this on switch im happy for this but i really wish it was assassins creed 4 thats my favorite assassins creed cool cool cool ac3 is remasteredwill the multiplayer stabby stab return when you will do a remasterd version on ac revelation looks like human revolution vomited all over ac3 but why not brotherhood instead did this game even need remastered the original still looks fine not perfect by todays standards but still fine id like it if they put the new parkour system in their remasters theres absolutely no point in remaking this unless they want to fix desmonds ending lol wow the graphics are betterrrr what was i expecting switch please why is orange a better color for this game this looks great how about a unity remake with more polished mechanics i remember when i was little i was so happy the main character was named the same as me so remastered just means we did color correction they probably downgrad it worse than the original freedom slaying remastered sweet but will it have a desmond skin it looks the exact same with different lighting remaster more detail and its less blurry youtube its yellow but is it less glitchy one of the main complaints about this game at the time was that it felt rushed and unpolished i feel like they didnt remodel anything except for shaders kind of like ark and atlas then we get the ubisoft switch around and just get the 360 version of the game as graphics upgrade i have one thing to say add multiplayer this game was badass cant wait to play it again only worth getting if it has multiplayer is already ezio collection remastered perhaps we can see some cameo of shay patrick cormac oh you upgraded the graphics i dont care literally all the did was change the lighting not exactly was i was expecting butokay everyone is complaining about yellow but yall realize that the sunrise afternoon sunset and candlelight is all yellow right should completely remake the first ac imagine that with better voice acting visuals and improved game mechanics while staying true to the theme adding more ways to assassinate story targets would be cool too yay more trailing missions you made it yellow it took you 7 years for this im reinstalling assassins creed iii that music just gave me soo much nostalgia release rogue physical edition please youre still in time so of all the remasters that could happenyall choose ac3 blackflag cries in shame they really shoulda did more issa new filter lol remastered games are always going to be criticized from the og but i really appreciate these because it gives a chance for newer fans to play through all the games in newgen consoles ive been a fan since the prince of persia games where they got the ideas for ac franchise and playing the ac 1 all the way to odessey and i can say ac3 is the top 3 of the franchise following brotherhood and origins because these 3 games did introduce new and better changes i love the ac franchise they couldnt make a real assassin creed games so remastering the one of the great assassin creed game is the only way lmfao why not remaster any of the better games parkouring through trees and low buildings wasnt as fun or exciting as taking a trip to rome or jerusalem remaster ac 2 and ac 2 brotherhood we need a full hd remake not just remaster of ac4 black flag now just imagine black flag remastered still pissed off it was not an african american man ah the game that killed desmond and ruined my love for assassins creed looks like im still gonna buy it play assassins creed 3 song full blast the game that had to end the saga with a yellow filter anyway take my money nintendo switch version do you guys know something i honestly dont know if its me but they showed a lot of comparisons behind the playable characters back why not a face comparison please dont be lazy like the ezio remastered edition they were my favourite for old gen games so it looks like how it was supposed to look like on its first release still has the best confession deaths in the series its still going to look like trash i wonder if they fixed stealth in this game its kind of irritating being spotted through a wall if this game doesnt have multiplayer i can finally get the platinum trophy i almost platinumed the original but the online trophies were excruciating and i couldnt bear to play hours and hours of that multiplayer they should remaster ac 2 and brotherhood remastering the worst game in the series the hell blue filter was better does anyone know what brotherhood was ac3 was definitely by far not the best out of the series its like ppl havent even played the actually good ac games how to remaster change the filter remastered assassins creed 4 next please is this gonna have the multiplayer if so please take my money please omg looks like they finally made a good remastered oh look obisoft added a sepia filter thats what we were missing the whole time much like batman arkham origins i actually enjoyed this game even though it was apparently the weakest in the franchise at the time according to some im looking forward to revisiting this lets just hope the bugs have been fixed eh assassins creed 3 was my favorite because its one of the only games set in the early years of the american revolution great dont remaster a good ac game remaster the one where one lone native american single handedly wins the revolutionary war hopefully this means ac is coming back awesome one of my favorites i liked the graphics of the original it was perfectly fine and worked good on my 3d tv now if you were to buy a rerelease only because of the yellow filter and some textures lights and shadows no man u dont need any of that i am glad of the rerelease as an opportunity for younger people who never played this great game so theyll do it now but for people like me who played the pc version with full graphics and even 3d i can tell you something it is not worthy to buy newer version because it has no new content no new dlc or a couple of missions more but it only has enhanced textures and yellowish filter so nope why ubisoft why dont you make a full remake of assasssins creed 1 and i mean it full remake not rerelease new meshes engine longer historical events of the middleages there is so much to explore there and more of altairs life with details and all that would be awesome ok now remaster the story and change the freaking ending wheres the switch version that leaked i couldve sworn ac3 had multiplayer or was that blackflag either or itd be nice to see multiplayer come back in some way in the future what about a physical edition in the us still the best ac always holds a special place in my heart people here talking about ac3 but i would love something just anything new with ac4 which is the best ac in my opinion ubisoft downgrades what would you have me do assassins creed 1 remake pls so this wont be on switch like that leak said ok wanna know what makes me pissed i just bought ac 3 again to play again does everyone not remember how bad this game was nobody asked for this tho hey look the last good game they made is getting remade might have to cop it connor kenway is the best assassin all the time are they going to remaster ac4 aswell i waiting remaster ac2 51 they have actual circles oh my good god this came out the day i finished ac3 what wow gave up on assassins creed 2 remaster or brother hood even 1 meh all the ubi sock puppets in the comments talking about how ac 3 was so good lmao plz add better ship battles like ac4 look at the stars look how they shine for you and everything you do yeah they were all yellow we all live in a yellow submarine yellow submarine yellow submarine why did these songs pop up in my head as i watched this great now do ac4 assassins creed 3 is the most unrealistic assassins creed because they fail to show that the founding fathers were slave owners who just wanted to keep their slaves will there be online well time to one man beast man o war again best ac game change my mind this is the only assassins creed game i played im getting this for sure ac3 was the best ac imo because no one else will will there be online so they updated the lighting this is a lazy remaster this game was and is my favorite assassins creed game i love it to bits so seeing this remaster makes me unbelivably happy thank you so much 3 so i have acody season pass do i get this before retail release i hope so one of the main reasons i bought the gold edition but am waiting ac ezi0 c0llecti0ns remastered dont see real difference yellow filter thats all also face animation and detailing suffers very much mel gibson mod please so they added sepia ok all you had to do was remaster ac ii but are they bringing back the multiplayer tho lol back when assassins creed was good i heard of it never played the original because i didnt had a console around 2012 so this and liberation will be all cool would it have been that hard to include pc in the trailer this was the last good assassins creed game without any big gimmicks or convoluted unhinged stories connor is my personal favorite this shall be mine why would they remaster this instead of black flag i wish they would add the multiplayer though assassins creed 3 but we finally turned the lights on i still have the steelbook you got for pre ordering the game with rp on the front cause it wasnt rated yet i want 2 remastered im not buying this this game was great and the music was epic asf im happy its getting remasterd did anyone ask for this part of me wants to assume this is what the game will look like why is it so yellow now i go from playing as a smurf to playing as a simpson let me just go into the settings give me a second almost got it there i just remastered it yes thank you so much ubisoft hands down my favorite in the series 3 so you basically warmed up the color grading 8 years too late homeboy the meaning of the remaster isnt changing the colour of how everything looks this is my all time favorite game im so happy that this is coming out thank god i was waiting for this so long one of my favs will buy i never realised how much conner sounds like anakin how many fools can i kill today this game does not need a remastered it was ok but nothing impressive thank you ubisoft this was the best assissians creed plus i know one of the developers of this game his name is farris he was my professor while i was in college well well remasted games are going good this year did you fix that bug with the wagon convoys no but we ripped out the yellow atmosphere from fallout new vegas and slapped it right in here to be honest re2 set the bar high for remastered games this is a good game but if its just the graphic that s updated not worth it people who loved ac 3 must also play ac rogue its a prequel to the events in ac 3 i loved the game but didnt love connor much he may be ruthless but is also boring he can never be the grandson of edward kenway the coolest assasin i think 043 is a clear indication this is more than just a new filtercome on people i loved assassins until the day i finished ac rogue now i love a character based on hisher karma irrespective of them being an assassin or templar it looks beautiful yea im expecting shittier graphics because when it comes to trailers you guys always lie im still buying the game just not expecting the graphics to be exact hold up liberation and the dlcs too bruh im about to nut and cry i love assassins creed 3 this was the game that brought me into the series and conner is my favorite all of you fools whos first ac game was 3 looks great but why its not even the best one besides desmon do i need to play any other assasins games to understand the story of this one or is it a new story never played this one but hopefully it is as good as blag flag or even better this is assassins creed origins and odyssey can gtfo pass original looks better than the remastered my favorite ac game there was nothing remastered about that they jus added it to next gen consoles lmfao adding a filter to everything doesnt make it better save you can play the remastered version on ps 3 d with them remastering 4 out of 5 of the games featuring desmond i hope it sparks a revival for the modern plotline back when assassins creed was assassins creed so 2019 its gonna be the year of remasters is it just me or does the old one somehow look better and less plastic back when assassins creed game used to be good and not a messy fetchgame the most purest assassin has return how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in my way my apartment was struck by lightning and had to move to a place without internet assassins creed 3 was a great game for me to play during that time peaceful and overall enjoyable fake 10000000000000000000 i love how they make the campaign seem so dramatic cmon guys that wouldve been perfect to put on the switch given your relationship with nintendo yall dropped the ball wow thats my favorite one nice best ac game ever made why is it not on switch this looks better than the last 2 ac games lets go is this a joke most underrated assassins creed game this i cant wait for this i had so much fun and the combat is insane ac iii ac iv any other ac um soo who exactly was asking for this seriously the last true assassins creed game what a remastering give me brotherhood remastered then ill buy first i wanna say if you game on pc just get it there its usually on sale for like 5 bucks and for console not sure if itll be worth it damn if only we had black flag remastered that would be amazing now we only need remaster of ac4second best ac game imo who asked for this nobody i hope its not just graphical updates i hope they eased out the pacing of the game the only assassins creed game with the best combat and the best parkour animations back to the best fighter and most skilled assasin in assasins creed series so it looks exactly the same but with an orange tint i heard a rumor it would be on switch as well so tbh probably wont buy unless i get really bored on a saturday i hope its more than just a graphics change bring ac1 to ps4 then ill have the full ac collection who was asking for this game 60 for the game i pay in the past they just changed the lighting please tell me they did something to make the slow and boring opening shorter or better i nearl fell asleep during the whole crossing the ocean sequence at the beginning man i cant wait for the assassins creed 1 splinter cell double agent splinter cell conviction splinter cell blacklist far cry 2 far cry 3 blood dragon ghost recon advanced warfighter 1 2 ghost recon future soldier rainbow six vegas 1 2 remasters keep remastering every single xbox 360playstation 3 game you have ever made and remember its for the money dont forget to apply that yellow filter did you also fix the entire story so will connor going to be the best assassins now waiting for the downgrade the lighting is a bit better so games from 2012 can get remaster but we cant get resident evil 4 remake from 2005 but a million half assed remastersffs print the money remaster change the tone to sepia its just an enb i love assassin creed 3 they just adding the sunlight bring back multiplayer pls yellow filter remaster does this confirm we will get a hood updown option in postgame oh no blur sun ray graphic bought this when it came out thought it was the worst assassins creed game by far because of how buggy it was ubisoft be like lets us a filter and call it remasterd well graphics are little bit better they got the audacity to post a comparsion video huh did they pull this with another ac game they just turned off the hue settings or something it turned out it had more glitches than the original game i loved ubisoft they butchered the series ac 1 to ac revalations was fantastic then ac black flag was phenomenal everything else just sucked yellow creed 3 eh black flag was better i think this ones the best ubisoft god damn please make a remaster of acii i will buy it for all money best game in the series lol im getting this who would ever want to play this doo doo game again maybe this time people will actually see how awesome this game was never played ac3 started with black flag but i think i might give this one a shot my favorite assassin creed game is back assassins creed iii le lazy remasteur im getting this i thought wed never see a kenway again theyre back they just made it fucking yellow when assassins creed was good ac3 forever in my hard it would be nice to get beta missions or unreleased missions and new missions which would make us play the game for a lot more longer multiplayer please just become more yellow this is the last ac game i really liked and finished 100 i had a dream this would happen but ubisoft pls put in the post production connor outfit and other concept outfits which didnt make it to the game yes this and assassins creed iv are the only ac games ive loved what about multiplayer of all assassins creed games this is the only one they thought of remastering wtf idk why everyone hates this game to me it had an awesome combat system though the story was a drag but the gameplay made up for it i guess the yllow is from the lighting probably sunset or whatever i heard there was level redesign so im excited fr that and new mechenics maybe my horse will work better now i hope they fix that part where you chase braddock to save pitcairm because that entire segment made no sense wait its true im so fucking buy this game did they just change the lighting and labeled it as remastered now an ac1 remaster would be dope best ac story so far literally i like the other ones but this one is special isn that just different time of day in the game thank you so much ubisoft i love you all i want is ac2 and brotherhood remastered they got the yellow sickness you know what im sayin will multiplayer be available again i always enjoyed for this one i miss achilles i once play xbox 360now ps4 sorry for my bad english i am still waiting for the first one to be remastered or even a remake hell yeah i get to play as a piece of dry toast again charles before read dead sooo just the pc version but yellow at least the remastered version of far cry 3 came to pc theres no reason this isnt no switch just saying based on ubisoft popular downgrades by the release it will look like the original thr best story ac game till date thanks ubisoft why ac3 ac1 it would be a better choice p fav assassins creed game this game getting remastered makes me feel old but the game isnt that old right just install sweetfx and there you go remastered version make an ac 4 black flag remastered it looks the same i really hope they updated the combat or hopefully did more then just tune up graphics black flag would had been a better choice for remastered as it was the best in the series we got ac 3 blue edition and we will get ac 3 yellow edition we got far cry 2 yellow edition and when we will get far cry 2 blue edition all of these people saying they just put a yellow filter on you obviously dont have the money to buy the fucking game just keep playing the ezio trilogy which they failed at remastering that hunk of junk and not worry about this quality of a game how somebody can remastered game from 2012 they should remastered first part from 2007 ac3 was always my favorite despite being arguably one of the least favorite from the fan base so basically its yellow now the greatest and bestest assassins creed ever till date and theres quite nothing like it it has the most heroic sound tracks sadly not coming to pc wait wut it had dlcs why no ac2 remake that was the best ever my favorite assassins creed but why no one asked for this why not make a new game that isnt completely broken and repetitive if dishonored could be an interesting assassinstealth game im sure your budget would allow for a half decent ac game you know one that isnt years old with a whiney protagonist and 2d antagonist yellow only 39 nah i think ill download a hd texture mod lol gotta admit now that i see the comparison the game didint look all that bad before gotta give props to the original i wish you could punch kids down a hill before they patched it maybe they will add it in the remaster imagine thinking its just a yellow filter when you go outside do you think wow everything is so yellow its realistic lighting the only thing i dont like playing this game is the white of nothingnes during a loading sequence it gets even worse playing in a dark room my eyes burn badly the amount of people that dont know that there is already an ezio remaster is amazingly huge tbh i just got it on 360 the other day so i can play it bc but the beginning is so boring also since ive been playing rouge 3 seems so clunky liberation is my favorite ac game as long as they improve the horses i remember how tedious it would get a tiny ledge a horse cant jump cool ac3 with a yellow filter slapped over it and called remastered just like halo odst remastered the last creed i was ever excited for man this brings back memories i couldnt put this game down for three months i collected everything black flag was a good ending to the desmond story but man do i miss these creeds best storytelling in video games shout out to thw people who got oddesy ultimate editiom for 60 bucks on psn and get this for free lol back then they didnt want me now im hot they all on me guess whos buying assassins creed 3 again me best ac game known to man meh ill pass not buying any game of this company anymore at least until they do something new not copy paste like the usual more naval fight now this is a game i actually wanted remastered hell yeah what about the classic online mode why remaster one of the most boring assassins creeds lmao finally i lowkey want black flag 2 or a remake of it of all the ac games you could remaster you chose this one wait this is real oh man so excited i mean it looks good so kudos to them i know im probably in the minority here but i like ac2 the best i know its only the 2nd in the series and obviously not as fleshed out as the games are now however i loved the story and gameplay elements they added to that game i know itll never get remastered but id play it if they did why the remasters doesnt come to pc so you both tinted the game yellow and made it hd im sold the cutscenes sure didnt get touched up i killed patriots and red coats best in the series nostalgia and it s gonna release on my birthday oh my god im in love the remaster noone asked for turn washingtons spies anyone no ok then plz dont have that gay multiplayer finally best fighting and duel executions after this assassin creed came out for the first time i never bought another ac because they were trash awww come on why didint you remaster 2 or brotherhood whats the point of remastering this garbage trash game that came out 6 or 7 years ago and is the worst game in the series when the best game in the series came out 12 or 13 years ago and is begging to be remastered or better yet remade i will buy this asap who asked for this why would they remaster one now the worst assassins creed isnt this enough of a cash grab already okay but when do they show the difference but does it have multiplayer a remaster we really dont need i remember when the game first release just remembering it make me almost cry connor is the worst ac protagonist thanks ubisoft for giving the game a yellow filter it makes it look so much better now you got that right ubisoft so assassins creed 3 in 2019 assassins creed 4 in 2020 desmond miles will be back so they added sepia assassins creed should bring back coop missions like they had in unity i personally liked those better than multiplayer other than the excessively long first chapter and the desmond stuff this is my second favorite ac game only beat by black flag it introduced me to the series and i look forward to playing it again i loved the setting and the changing seasons was fucking awesome to me at the time give us remake new engine new phisics new ghraphics not remastered with resolution 1080 i found this to be one of the best settings in the franchise this is the best in the entire ac series only reason it gets much hate is because the racist mfckaz out there are trying to sweep it under the rug just like theyve been doing to natives since the mfckrz stole this land well the rest is all history the racism in the us will never end wish the remastered version included the new ways of combat like the ones in odyssey instead of repeatedly clicking attack and just watching your character hit people assassins creed 3 is my all time favorite in the series i loved the hand to hand combat and the story was just incredible cant wait to pick this up when it comes out my favorite assassins creed game remastered my body is ready do it yes i cant wait for it to come out plus on top of that i get it for free since i pre ordered odyssey guess it wont be running 60fps on console hopefully this pc version is better than the orginal still cant get a decent frame rate on that now 7 year old game horrible optimization please lets not go thru that again will connors face look jacked up like they did to the characters in ac2 remastered ubisoft needs to come out with a desmond saga remastered bundle without the yellow filter what do you mean by improved gameplay mechanics hands down the best ac ever created to this day wheres charles lee will this include the multiplayer as well so your saying ill finally be able to play this above 15fps i actually really liked this game fight me please tell me that we have free aim with the bow and the pistol look still same for me whats new then assasins creed 3 gold edition ive played with bland characters and still enjoyed games but why connor is so intolerable is because you have to play with fucking haythem kenway first awesome character and then you move into the disappointment that is connor why not acr uh did they just slap an orange filter over this i cant wait to see ur price tag on this so i can laugh i would buy if ac3 was remake like resident evil2 this is the last best ac games after this ac is just go downhill i dont remember the original game looked as bad as shown in this video has ubisoft done something funny in trailer again ubisoft we want assassins creed 1 remastered not the second worst game in your franchise ac3 is my favorite game of the series and im exited to play the remastered even if some textures dont look that much better but i would really like to play a remastered version of the first game doesnt look that good shouldve remastered brotherhood tbh way better imo damni have another drawings after this games hdr remastered great you made it yellow people are getting upset but you got what you asked for a remaster a remaster is the pc version at max settings maybe a few extra god rays shadows updated textures and hdr4k if you wanted a remake you shouldve specifically asked for a remake not a remaster dont ask for something and get upset when you get exactly what you asked for ehh ill skip this like how i skipped odyssey odyssey looked boring and this ac is just recolored yellow i mean id buy it if you know they actually made it have 4k graphics this is gonna end up like dark souls remastered i can see it now welcome back true ac out of origins odyssey stop saying that is just yellow filterits obviously more than that texturesshadowsit looks better assassins creed iii yellow edition so they just made the lighting better presumably also runs better either way i get it for free so ill be playing it heres to hoping we get some kind of remake of the original game like in the newer engine so everything is one map sooooo the remaster no one asked for tell me you guys have fixed that grass woah great work boiz ofcorse there is a woman character now only xbox and ps4 altair and ezio were the best every other assassin is trash dude im so excited this is the first game i ever played and it holds a deep place in my heart plus it helped me pass 5th grade history so im supper excited to replay this bad boy when assassins creed was actually about assassins idc if theres a huge difference ac3 has been one of my favorite assassins creed games im getting it omg the resolution the brightness the price meh ac3 still my favorite and the 360 version still good graphics espically when you take out the hub almost everyone never asked for this gamers ac3 remastered ubisoft a ps3 port but lets call it a remaster and change the color filter can we please go back to these style of ac games im really not a fan of the new direction makes it brighter and yellow remastered game because were too lazy to make good games anymore the textures really dont look any better but whatever tanks you ubisoft very cool haha i get it its a weezer promotion the blue game the yellow game haha not even on switch i thought this was a switch port lol who is buying these remasters of fewyearold games remaster brotherhood pls ohh yeah i remember this game personally my least favorite one due controls those who like it glade u guys got a remaster ill wait for the remasters black flag on the next gen consoles best part of the series cant they just remaster ac with altair that game has such potential that never got drawn out the character the setting etc its there too bad the repetitive gameplay and held it down imagine it remastered with better history combat and parkour if the game is being remastered i hope they put a lot more content in it than in the original game what i really hope for to be added in the remaster is more cutscenesscreentime with haytham kenway connors father like with how haytham is so conflicted between his duties as a templar and his duties as a father mentioned in a novel version memory corridorassassination cutscenes for the templar agents assassinated by connors recruited assassins in the liberation missions more contentgameplayunique missionsstory missions in the liberation missions and homestead missions as well as more spotlight in the missions characters more story missions side quests and plot its beautiful they should do enzio trilogy remastered not this looks better than red dead 2 finally they remaster my favorite assassins creed ezio was good but connor was the man buy now for 70 and get dark red and violet colors man this was my first ac game despite all the controversy it will still hold a place in my heart because without it i wouldnt have played all the other games now i think ubisoft learn their mistake at rogue well that good hope is not dissapointing why ac iii remaster ezio was an iconic character in ac remaster those first thanks guys different color pallet how stupid do you think we are pls new game ac no remastered tt i prefer assassins creed ii trilogy to be the one that got remastered best combat one of the best stories in the entire franchise the next gen assassins creed games wished to be like ac3 downgrade incoming lighting is wayyyyy better yay i get to play with a yellow filter i heard they were thinking of adding the original ideas they had in the early beta im eager to see that scalping finisher they had planned u are not capcom ubisoft imagine if they made the best ac game look like rdr2 that would be amazing i swear the fans of this game sucks so toxic really hoping for the ac 1 remaster so yeah absolutely getting this i loved ac3 hope they add legacy outifts and the concept art robe that connor was supposed to wear even though ac3 is one of my favorites the trailer barely showed me anything worth paying for assassin creed 2 even though ac3 is one of my favorites the trailer barely showed me anything worth paying for please make it on nintendo switch please please please wheres the pc version though i did really love the game im not sure if this was necessary so i guess now remastered means yellow lighting because the graphics look exactly the same as the original where ac1 remastered at tho so i guess we are all going to forget how much we disliked this game when it came out huh would have been cool to see some of the new features from origins combat and weapons and such i mean i guess it looks a little better ac3 has the best soundtrack just a waste of time for ubisoft seems like ubisoft doesnt care about their best assassin ezios origin game now i hope that ubisoft will do ac 4 remastered i dont know if i like how the remastered looks whats with the new yellow filter just a filter huh did yall at least get rid of the loading in between gameplay and cutscenes and the loading in the middle of cutscenes what about pc it literally looks the same hahahahah this song s2 i just recently played this on pc it fucking looks the same all i see is new lighting and a different filter they should do a remastered version of black flag yellow tint and 60 price tag lol alright ubisoft you have my attention better than odyssey real assassins creed assassins creed iii sepia sigh are the really this lazy blue yellow so its a downgrade then now this is real assasins creed not that rpg wanna be originsodissey this is where you are a true assassin not a bullet sponge killer this is useless we want ac1 remastered tbh the graphics barely looked like they changed wth this is another trailer assassins creed 1 remastered yo wheres the switch port at change the story that edward is alive i kind of remember that i didnt like the story much it was so much grief and connor kind of got lost in his vengeance still i loved him as a character and especially for haytham i will buy probably just a yellow overlay but i still want it makes you realise how far downhill ac games have traveled today have played every ac in the main enteries since it was launched and connor is the worst character i want black flag remastered do anyone asked for it ac brotherhood remake please ac3 ac liberation and all the dlc this is a pretty good deal imo it actually looks worse xd in ac3 times there was no electricity so inside the buildings is yellow like a candle the game is retextured sunlight is yellow the best assassins creed is back aloso the game was to dark at textures have a look 036 assassins creed 3 with glasses on this was my favorite game on ps3 made me feel like a hunter lol this was one of the last ac i liked because it kept the original style 042 those chandeliers tho yay i get to play one of the worst assassins creed games again so the just made it brighter they improved the lighting shadow and texture my favorite assassins creed but why does the orginal look better ive waited so goddamn long thank god its getting remastered always loved assassins creed 3 because i love america history so it was cool to see many historical battles so i hope i can experience them again in a better assassins creed 3 if youre going to remaster one of the games you dont pick the worst one best assassins creed game now connor can be bland in hd what about mechanics 2012 cool cinematic 2019 warm cinematic i mean dont get me wrong i really enjoyed this ac but this version is not going to look like rdr2 its like they added a few filters and boom no hate but mehh we need an altair ezio and connor collection as a remake called the desmond collectionremake you know id have a little more face if they showed us the people actually talkin in the remastered part instead of him running through a nice new lighted area oh god please no after seeing what yakuza and resident evil have done to remaster their games this is very disappointing i really liked acliberation looking forward to get my hands on this beautiful treasure rockstar games viewers watch this 058 left rtx on right rtx off yay finally an ac game that is about assassins again tho its just a remaster but yay you need to remaster assassins creed revelationits had yellow filter and you can turn it to blueyellow is boring connor i hear you have no naval experience what so everi here by declare you captain of my ship more yellow sunlight wohoo if i have original ac3 with all dlcs do i need to rebuy this if i want remastered version even if it is remastered no one will play it because of the old play style it looks just like a filter and better shadows and its going to cost like an aaa game this is my first ac game it hooked me into this series will the multiplayer work so this is what charles smith from red dead 2 is doing after leaving marstons house looks gorgeous now do this for all the older games and youll make a fortune i bought the ac odyssey season pass so im excited for this its shitty yellow overlay from 2007 all over again best assassins creed of all time people hating on ac3 but at least you get to play as an assassin with assassin features unlike the latest garbage ac games looks to me like they just put a yellow filter over the whole game why cant they fully remaster the ezio trilogy the nostalgia where is charles lee they changed the overall lighting of the game and said boom remastered assassins creed i love this game this is the last ac series that ive play not because of desmond death nor i dont like ac series anymore its just that i have a shyt pc btw completed ac 3 and dlc while playing at 27 fps below and 30fps when activating eagle vision gotta spam it to be playable at freeroam please remaster ac 4 black flag pleasee pleassee assassins creed 3 piss filter edition get it for 50 right now why couldnt this be ac2 looks a bit yellow but fron what i see i hope they improved the lighting it could really give the game a more realistic feel just from better lighting and shadows we are want assassins creed 2 remastered i hate the marketing speech of remaster these days im only going to be disappointed at a straight up port with a yellow filter if you lie to me about what it is the story is bad as the ghostbuster 2016 remember boys this is a remaster not a remake nobody asked for this ezio was the best assassin conner was just big dingus best combat in any ac game ever you must be taking the piss that game is bad so why they decided to remaster the 3rd one but not the first one and then if people liked it they could remaster the 2nd and 3rd okey so this is just a yellow filter over the og thats fucking lame i want a remaster like the new resident evil 2 remaster 129 available on xbox one and ps4 can anybody explain to me why ps4 disc is infront of xbox one disc no radioactive dislike im happy its remastered although thr graphics dont get my love one bit i care 60 percent about the story 40 percent about the graphics well youve never been honest about your games graphics so am i the only one that think the original with blue filter is the best one more effort than ubi usually puts into remaster they look the fucking same no graphics have changed you guys just filtered it lmao its got worse why this game looks so much like orgins whats up with the yellow effects yo ubisoft plz make a one more pop game i lv that game its been a long time the animus has been upgraded and they found old memories best combat system in the entire ac series its all worth it just to play as desmond again not to be a downer but it just seems like they changed everything to yellow now the real question is are the bugs and glitches included my best assassins creed game i was hoping it would look a little better but it is ac3 and i love ac3 so i dont care ubisoft already has my money that music tho ahh old times why did you change it from gray to yellow gray looks better and more realistic the only thing that bothers me is that it doesnt have the amazing multiplayer ac multiplayer is the most fun and unique mp ive ever played and i have like a 70 days playtime on ac3 mp alone the people who say ac multiplayer was bad are the people who were fucking trash at it and they know it wow such an amazing upgrade going from blue to yellow is truly next gen itd be amazing if they actually remade it in a new engine assassins creed 3 yellow edition last night i was thinking about an assassins creed set in the american revolution googled it only to find out it existed in assassins creed 3 then googled that to find out its getting remastered crazy i was hopping for more stunning graphics who actually wanted an ac3 remaster oh the nostalgia so many good memories from the music i think i was in 8th grade when this came out why does every remastered game more god rays ac3 is underratedi honestly this its one of the best ac games ever patiently waiting for the downgrade is this what you get with the odyssey season pass more blinding bloom and yellowish nuance remastered oh yay boring combat mechanics are back that orange filter seems good hope there will be aiming system from ac4 with guns and bow theres no russian sound in ac liberation hd thats sad cuz it is one ac game which i didnt pass please just give us a black flag 2 omfg its happening assassins one of my favourite parts my life best game this i have to admit the colour palette on the remastered version is way better than the original gamers why ubisoft just because first ac that i had played great memories the best game in the series only because it had the tomahawk better than syndicate and odissey remastering the original ac or black flag would have been better but this is good enough assassins creed iii upscaled ac 1 ultra edition when come on guys all are saying about yellow filter dont you all remember what a great game it was a true assassins creed not like odyssey odyssey is a great game as an rpg but not as assassins creed when assassins creed was an assassins creed connor in my opinion is the best character in ac series best ac by far piss yellow again but it just orange that it wtf putting an instagram filter without actual graphical upgrade r e m a s t e r e d assassins creed sunset edition ac3 is my favourite because he is not ezio damn dude now this is a remaster if i already have it for backwards comparability will it be remastered but why whats the point ill take your entire stock i was worried when i bought that seasonal past but now i know it just might be the best decision ive made yet one of the worst ac games hm a few changes in lighting and an extensive amount of god rays not sure if the yellow filter will be applied everywhere as it seems that at 104 its the same greyish tone the face textures look very shrunk and clear looking doll like i get that its a remaster and not a remake but this looks like black flag a game from late 2013 were in 2019 ubisoft we shouldnt have to pay for it it should be a free update to the base game thats what a good dev would do cant wait i remember going to the midnight launch waiting outside with a fat ezio pointless people judging graphics on a youtube video this is literally the best assassins creed game of all time in the name of liberty i will fight the enemy regardless of their allegiance this line gets me everytime never finished the game was too boring combat is brutal though wheres charles lee connor oh connor have i missed you now remake assassins creed black flag is it free for people that already have the game or doesnt look like much of an improvement second part love the run style of conor and combo far beter than assassin creed origins or odessy what about pc 2012 assassins creed 3 blue 2019 assassins creed 3 yellow my favourite assassin is back the savage the one who fought for freedom his people the one who sought revenge people hate this guy but i love him hes one of the greatest assassin there is people hating on him just bcs ezio story was ended and they want more of him this guy is a brutal assassin just like his grandpa was he wont kill you nice and slow like most of the assassins did he go rampage on everyone while everyone use a sword this mf used a goddamn tomahawk which is more thicker than a sword warning idiots in comments that dont know this is a remaster not a remake best game ive ever played ok now throw in ac 3 remastered ac black flag remastered and ac rogue remastered in a bundle for ps4 and i buy it god damn ubisoft god rays dont fix everything why did they add a filter in the remastered ubisoft releasing far cry and ac content is getting seriously stale time to come out with something new and fresh id say you owe the community that much wow these publishers are way out of touch how do you not remaster black flag the last good ac volumetric lighting todd howard approves did they really put a filter on and called it a remaster was just playing re2 remake these days this is just embarrassing by comparison we need a good assasins creed 2 remake for pc unfortunately ac3 has stopped working thinking for my potato pc it is so nice to see you people excited about an ac game you always trush talk about them at least you are positive the mazority of you anyway when you run out of ideas for games this was the first ac that had me waiting anxiously for its releasealthough my favourite is black flag ac iii had me so hyped and i enjoyed every minute of it so many good memories lightings and bloom and a lil fog he sould be on steam the game started my ac journey glad to see this again i never play this game along time now the remarsterd of ac3 boy is gonna be fun just one word nostalgia unity and 3 worst games in the series ac 3 is a great game but its about time we get a ac 2 remastered for pc please make ac1 remastered would love to play this i think i mustve played the original but never quite finished it i intend to do so with this remaster this is the best is coming ubisoft is back in your haste to save the world boy take care dont destroy it looks like they just added a snapchat filter lol i wouldnt call this a remastered but enb and grass mod installed version of the same game i like assassins creed 3 this game is my favorit please release this for nintendo switch play ac on the go is my dream question is does it have battle royal i never played ac liberation most of the guys never heard of tat so its good to see tat again with remastered looking forward to it ubisoft stealing money since 1986 never finished it however the gameplay was awesome smooth and fun although a yellow smear doesnt really scream remaster ubisoft i could never really get mad at you i forgive you they remastered this 1 i didnt liked it at all like many others that was the reason i did not touched ac games untill origins now playing odessey and played black flag im pumped but give me an option to skip past nathan hes as useful as white crayon this is the worst ac i couldnt play the series anymore after this one so im guessing it was a early comparison side by side for the downgrade it will have at release played 5 times will buy and play once more time to give one of the worst ac games another chance lmao you just made the game more yellow such a trash company please change the name to assistant creed also assistant sounds waaaay cooler than assassin it looks beautiful this is the last game i expected them to remaster what about ezios games they would actually be good lets remaster a game instead of trying to come up with something new ubisoft not much diferrent from the og favorite assassins creed 3rd one had a good story and now black flag only ps4 why not ac4 cant wait remake already ran out of ideal how to make a new as wow those yellow tint effects trailer looks just as glitchy as the games why ubisoft not remake ac 1 if they do it would be awesome ummm this game definitely doesnt need to be remastered at least not this soon so its an enb ooo the tyranny of king washington has to be one of the best ac dlcs people who think theyre clever piss filter i never played the 3rd game ive never been more excited for assassins creed ok this will be my last ac no more no more no more ac 3 last game in the series black flag sindycate origins odessey bullshits team ubisoft makes ac13 maybe gone i hope they bring shay patrick into this game it doesnt look like a remastered please make it good ubisoft we dont want another remastered with just a bit more brightness and filters if you think im gonna waste my money on another remastered assassins creed game you are absolutely correct we need an ac brotherhood remake remastered what would the specs to run max on pc so its a little bit brighter am i the only one who thinks that the word remastered has lost its meaning these days most companies just slap the word remastered onto their famous old games to gain quick buck without an actual effort its just sad im in love this looks like a very odd remaster but im looking forward to play it again 3 was the best one in the series finallya remaster i always wantedthanks ubisoft 3 paying for something that can be achieved by enb on pc console peasants never change sadly they dont make if for pc again they literally just added an enb and are calling it a remaster origins recently became my favorite ac but ac3 is a classic imo ya still spend the first 8 hours as the villain ubisoft and their cash grabs probably the most immersive story of all assassins creeds imo of course so they just applied yellow filter to everything wellstill waiting fot ac2 remaster this is no remaster but ill take it i miss the old games and even though 3 was one of the weak ones i liked it better lighting looks great wish the character models were redone too i loved ac3but this remaster doesnt look much better than the original ac3 holds a special place in my heart being it was the first ac game i ever played another remastered stop plsbeyond god ed evil 2 remaster a game from 2012 lol blatant cash grab and the idiots are gonna buy it what if ubisoft change a little bit ending of desmond giving us a 100 that he is dead or maybe he somehow survive dream but maybe sorry for english back when these games were exciting give me assassins creed 1 remastered omg yesssssss best ac game ever yes im so exited dont worry it ended be happy we had it one of the best games ive ever played better light effects and nothing more but we must wait till release day everyone must remember what they done with watchdogs they showed one game and sold totally different one please dont sell it like new game 5999 please to bad i left the series after darius was not playable besides i reached all ac games 100 platinum ubisoft will more lose loyal fans if theyre keep going and not listen to fans i saw a reddit post where someone said this remaster looks worse than the original yeeeeeah gonna have to disagree with you there chief honestly i think it looks better the original blueish colors were alright but it felt too cold for me if that makes sense i like the warm feeling of this more yellowvibrant look not only that but the models and textures do look much better than the original and well be getting gameplay tweaks as well honestly this will probably be the definitive way i play ac3 from now on it looks fantastic this music make me crazy i hope it will be better and better as resident evil connor about time i see ubisoft is getting short on cash so they remaster their good games again since all of their releases came from a trash bin good choice well at least this will be a return to the roots finally my favorite assassins creed game remsaterd time to start yelling give me lee playing as a native american assassin is pretty cool so excited ac3 was my favorite and im glad to see them remastering it with all dlcs take my money please this game needs a remake one of the last best games before the grand fall of the series what a story mark welcome conner they schould remaster all old games like ac and ac2 like halo did with all their old games i hope this game without stupid rpg bruhhhhhh my wish came true still hoping this would head for nintendo switch wrap three i cant wait for this the combat was so good why no to remaster ac ii the fucking antagonists were cooler than the main character idk what yall are saying i genuinely saw some graphic improvements like the god rays and some of the textures looked slightly better and generally the lightimg looked pretty decent as wellbutthats not saying too much ac3 still holds uo to todays standards i thinki still wanna see more if this remaster literally got the deluxe edition for ac odyssey just for these two games all my love for connor i wish they remastered the ezio trilogy black flag shouldve been the one remastered featuring the most bland ac character ever all dlcs included that was enough to convince me this is the one ac i never got the chance to play will def pick this up my favorite game im hyped for this one i have the ezio collection down loading as we speak nowadays if there is god rays its remastered thank you ubisoft for remastering my favorite game of all time i thought they were going to make this with a different engine little disappointed but well it looks pretty good i guess cant complain much it is great on nintendo switch but where is nintendo switch port on this game time to fight in the american revolution once again yeaaaaa we want ac 1 and 2 remastered because the creator got no job to their employee so they do remastered i dont care what anybody says this man was the baddest assassin in a fightso glad i got this coming with the seasons pass for odyssey im just waiting for ac 1 remake liberation remastered including the dlc oh boy welcome back connor freedom i was just listening to the soundtrack last week thinking im going to play this on my 360 but god bless ubisoft for a remake why did you remastered assassins creed iii why not assassins creed i please ubisoft i love this new open world formula but im ready to get more present day story like we got with desmond how can they make a 2019 game look like a 2014 game wack ill stick to odyssey anyone prefer the dirty and ghetto look to the old one or just me they wana sell this adding only new filter we need black flag remastered we need remastered version of ac ezio trilogy finally so ubisoft is remastering the worst assassins creed game so disappointed i like how people really be thinking that remastered is another term for rebuild the game from scratch its not man the navy battles with the aquila must be a delicacy for the eyes ubi was better made new pop or pop remake ive played every single game unity was my fav once they fixed the bugs honestly out of all the ones they could remake wasnt expecting this one oh my that god rays and light shafts is it coming out on switch hm my brother got this as part of a pack with odyssey when it comes out looks good now we just have to wait for the assassins creed black flag remaster i hope with a better optimization right ubisoft mrubisoft can you finish the story of desmond in next game pls pls pls you made it yellowish congratulations but i think everyone just want revelations remastered time to press b and x three million times nah not worth it do a remaster love the game already but i dont see enhanced graphics this was honestly my favorite game and the best assassins creed game in my opinion cant wait for this to come out so i can relive the old memories and enjoy the games i once loved underrated game hope pc requirements not so high bcz ac3 this is last game can my pc run without lag not best in the series but at least a true ac game not a witcher wannabe yeah my second favourite assassens life is no fairy tale and there are no happy endings no not when men like you are left in charge d a m n this us the game that killed the franchise for i avidly played all the ones b4 then this came out and it was garbage i do not need it i do not need it i do not need it i do not need it i neeeed it please tell me it has multiplayer remastered this but not 1 and 2 thats strange this was pretty boring imo so its a pass for me meh do a reboot of altair and ezio oh my god i had a dream about this before i saw it this is so needed ac3 now with 40 more orange best soundtrack best combat and best story for me did they just added bloom and yellow filters ac3 was great but those damn glitches better be fixed i raged quit twice because of it that game blew harder than the justice league movie this was the best one wheres the multiplayer hmmm this looks the same i need this game now hope not that happened but will we get it on switch im excited for this because it means were one step closer to ac4 remastered now weve seen how the remaster looks at daytime but im not sold until i see a more immersive frontier and can we please get rid of the bug that makes it so cutscenes only show the default outfit cmon ubisoft you are a company i know but no new game or remaster of splinter cell or prince of persia in many years you have an important sector of abandoned gamers and thats how you make a trailer please take note best assassins creed no doubt the best game ever played wait is it me or are the graphics like almost literally the same like the game is pretty fkin amazing but if the graphics only get a shadow boost ill just go back and play the old one hearing that theme once more sent chills down my spine this was my first assassins creed game i will say its far from the best but it does hold a special place in my heart will most likely be picking this up you only updated the textures it looks like not the faces a lot of toxic people in the comments wow amazing ubisoft has discovered the power of lighting lol all the people asking for ac2 remaster when it literally already exists the entire ezio saga was remastered on ps4 and xbox one i mean this is ok but what we all really just want is assassins creed ii remake not remaster can we get a christmas filter to make all the enemies snowmen and santas and horses reindeer oh shut up and take my money why isnt it on pc wtf if only ezio collection was this drastically different ubisoft ive been a playing assassins creed series ever since it came out and i will be fully honest all the games released till syndicate were fun and all and after that new assassins creed games were just boring and shitty af where is charles lee why not ac2 or brotherhood remastered wow more orange now remake ac1 remake not remaster then youll have me im still waiting for the ezio trilogy to be remasteredon pc remaster assassins creed 2 and brotherhood can we bring back this kind of assassins creed assasains creed but yellow in my opinion this the best assassin creeds ever made for me this is the ac ever nostalgia watch dogs 3 just wondering the hype is real 39 dollars for the yellow filter no thank you just look at their faces original looks better oh boy my least favorite ac game fantastic might actually get this onr excited i dont think ubisoft is good at remastering games looks the same with enhanced color brings me back to the school day getting excited for the midnight release that was the longest day ever give the connors speech at the end of the game and you win it ubisoft ill just stick to my steam version when they downgrade the graphics it will look like the original anyway we want black flag 2 damit if they wanna remake it then do it with ezio story they only have to give me nathan kenway lips with 4k res and i will buy it again damn that man makes me go gay and moist every time there is a close up of his face i wouldve preferred an assassins creed 2 remaster but i guess this will do part of me wants to glitch and go out of bounds or under the map finally a real ac game again not bad the witcher rip offs that lost the identity of the franchise origins odyssey ac3 was always underrated literally noone asked for this where is charles lee the major disappointment gets a remaster gg 2 deserves the remake more why cant we get a game this old in 60 fps if some of you guys have an xbox one and really want to play it then go buy it used on xbox 360 at gamestop for 3 its backwards compatible definitely worth it can you guys make a good assassins creed instead of the origin dumpster fire the online comes with it right i really wanted a remastered of this game time for full synchronization again yess pls add multiplayer so basically they got better lighting gimme a remastered ezio trilogy and im set best ac games so far hey what about my pc props to you ubisoft for not going the call of duty path and remastering the game just to recharge people for dlcs and liberation too cant wait d definition of remastered for ubisoft add a yellow tint for capcom basically a new game well i still have assassins creed 3 i dont need to buy this but remastered looks good will it downgrade please make free roam naval in ac3 strange choice for a remaster i want black flag remastered please that was better there should be a second part to this story best music in all of video games is this one right here you fight you resist why because no one else will ac3 was my childhood better not kill my boy desmond in this one mate finally i am waiting for this long time maybe the american revolution setting clouds my judgment but screw it i love ac3 hard to beat connor best assassin with the combatoutfit in the series imo how much though looks a bit like unity say what you want about the story or the characters or the graphics but the soundtrack for this game was an absolute beast truly a worthy successor to ezios music in this regard i like the third game but why not ezios and altairs games this the right assassins creed not this 2 new games i was hoping they would put the new parkour mechanics in the game oh boy i was waiting for this remastered assassins creed ii brotherhood and revelations please i so like your games but i cant play in acd ii now becouse graphic is so old buy in the name of multiplayer bring back multiplayer lightning and foliage improved very much but not facial textures was expecting the graphics and mechanics to be like odyssey btw still got goosebumps sooo excited to play wow so cool speed 100 hours on the ps3 version now going to do it all again on ps4 3 things i want 1 allow me to replay the navel and treasure side missions and update sync with them 2 let me replay the desmond missions even after the game is over that was the closest the series has gotten to where i wanted it in those missions and 3 have the dlc tyranny wolf hood in the main game i never got to play tyranny of king washington this may interest me music in this game was best as compared to other ac the only reason i ever got an xbox 360 was to play this game and now i can on ps4 soon lets goooo this soundtrack is so great man i love this game bro wild west ac please this was my first ac my fav assassins creed dont understand why people hated it why are so many games being remastered omfg yesterday i was just talking to my friend about how i miss this game and i wish they would remaster itlooks like i got my wish is 21 savage going to be in this game so its even more brown than before looks way better blag flag should be the next so good that bought odyssey ultimate edition since launch that included this have 1 more month to finish gow and hzd plus sm altogether then this comes out it honestly doesnt look any better i was young when it came out i can barely remember it but man i remember i loved it and ill love it now i just bought ac 3 like a week ago now im fucking mad that they make a remastered version dude i dont wanna rebuy it this looks way better than the original finally hopefully its better optimized on pc than the og this is my favourite ac game will it have updated controls this brings me back to 2012 that was a good year i cant wait for this one i never played 3 so im excited for this this is one of the most interesting time periods for me i remember learning about it in school and then playing the game when it came out back in 8th grade lol assassins creed 3 but with a filter i dont understand how people didnt like ac 3 its one of my top favorites i dont care what you say ac3 was the last good ac game ubisoft made back then is the great graphics for me 2012 we hate aciii 2019 we love aciii oh you made a tree look more like a tree cool beans i guess 002 023 my own personal version on this world i am torn part of me wishes to make this world a paradise and give its people all the right answers solutions part of me knows that i dont have all the answers solutions can we have haythams outfit in the next ac game please the only game that flexes on itself so does yellowish filter means remastered is there not going to be pc edition multiplayer so you add better textures better light rays and some color correction and call it remastered all these remasters that dont come with new missions and new features is pointless i remember the moment i killed his father cant wait to replay assassins creed iii but orange how about you remaster the real goat assassins creed 2 brotherhood and revelations an i mean completely remaster them make them look amazing definitely liking this and i will be picking it up now how abt ya remaster the first assassins creed game too with some trophy support since the ps3 version didnt have any were remaster ac games now ill still buy it this was the last true ac imo black flag was great as was origins but this was raw ac sooo when does this come out they gonna find a way to downgrade the upgrade its a good game a very good game but this is just easy cash grab imo improved lighting more foliage and you have remastered and sell for full price of previous game even if its with all dlc we already bought aaa publishers are really getting lazy these days but at the looks of the likes i guess you get away with it im buying this i would say that ac3 definitely had the best soundtrack out of the franchise this is coming to nintendo switch i cant wait mostly they are remaking games now huh i guess thats good now i want revelations remastered im gonna buy this game again i really like the combat here and parkour original is so much better i think that the first assassins creed worth a remastered edition more than 3 its time to feed teeth again i got this when it came out on wii u im so excited for this new version lmao its on switch too guys remaster is not the same as remake i dont see why remaster liberation though its the worst of the games im not gonna buy this piece of junk this is going be amazing especially being ac3 is the most visually stunning assassins creed game on last gen oh boi conner is back ma bois definitely need a ac4 remastered this was one of my favorites absolute classic better then the new one any day connor is by far the best assassin unlike other assassins he had to train hard to get his suit i first had this game on wii u my parents sold it before i beat the game now i can finally finish the story and get back all of those dlcs i had ubisoft is my savior and i thank them for this great gift i cant really tell the a difference my favorite ac is back bro i want ac 1 what i cant wait for it one of my favourite games ever i played it on ps3 and im gonna play it again on ps4 really happy for this idc what people say im playing this with origins combat how many fools can i kill today rip smosh 2012 please dont include the multiplayer bs i beg of you ezio trilogy remake pleaseeeeee take my money v i said remake no remastered nintendo switch you cant just add a yellow filter and call it a remaster okhow is this age restricted now i know what iam going to have for breakfast a glass of aciii remastered and cereal last good ac game remastered looksim not feeling like a dicchole today so ill say unfinished in most parts now idk if this remaster thing is going to continue but if it does i wont care since every other ac game after 3 is just boring bad andor boring also bad ok except maybe unity which was mediocre poor game what did they do to you unity and 1 are the ones that deserve remasters with some changes damn this music awesome im so happy this was remastered thanks ubisoft the still one of the best ac titles to date worth buying again shortest ac ever what is that 120 plus at the endis it the lady assassin from ac liberations assassins creed orange it will be a hit one of my favorite games of all time im so so happy its getting this never got to play this or liberation happy that i got the season pass for odyssey march 29th cant come soon enough this is not worths 60 besides who ask for ace 3 remastered it looks the exact same but with better lighting im playing as the indian guy when he learns how to hunt on 360 connor is this like basically the beginning of the game why did we play as that other guy for so long havent played for years so forget the story did they seriously just add a fucking filter and call it a remaster not on pc i get that this is a remaster not a remake but come on ac3 came out 2012 a whole console generation came after that and this what we get as remaster also they should do a remaster for brotherhood or revelations first i love you again ubisoft i cant wait to play it what i would love to see for aciii would be unity engine and gameplay that would be epic for me assassins creed 3 brown edition ok the game is gonna come out without the rendering bugs i loved that gamebut i remember i used to try not to look to the horizon in cities cuz every time i did so someone npc disappeared or appeared damn soooo multiplayer got remastered also no lol honestly my favorite part of assassin creed and knowing that remastered will be more complete makes me happy the best assassin ever different story different missions different graphic different feel new things it was just perfect kinda suspicious out of all the ac games ubisoft chooses the last game desmond was in to remaster uncharted 2 yes its uncharted 2 all for it if the bugs have been fixed when is assassins creed black flag remaster coming my first ac game is 3so im really expecting the remastered version out this made me buy ac odyssey with season pass otherwise i wouldnt i want ac not a fake witcher game crappy color correction it just looks like they put better lighting in thats it xd i miss this type of assassins creed the modern ones personally dont make me feel like the character is an actual assassin charles smith before rdr2 lol apparently halo 2 is the only good remaster in the history of remasters now patch unity and syndicate with 4k update plzzzz aw no pc i still need this good thing i got an xbox i still can not believe it the game of my childhood being remastered woow improving graphics is not enough this game needs to improve mechanics the regular version was broken glitch fest im just waiting for this bethesda get out of ubisoft this iz random but please ea remaster skate 3 rockstar bully awesome i didnt get around to playing it on ps3 so i hope ill be able to pick this one up at some point this was the good ac game change my mind please ubisoft assassins creed remake altar deserve it i am actually super fucking hyped for this looks like they updated the mesh of buildings and characters pretty well also you can see if you look closely the textures and shadowslighting are all improved personally the yellow light filter from the gray filter gives it a bright new feel to me im just super super excited for multiplayer most of all i wish they remaster assassins creed rouge does anyone know if this is on disc or digatal someone clarify this for me is using the most recent engine or just a boost in graphics filter this was my favorite ac game so powerful but some of the repeating missions could kill the immersion my favourite ac finally gets a facelift hope it turns out to be great game just like the original the good ol mexican movie filter my favorite ac game is this piss filter going be 60 bucks im just hoping they actually release the game physically unlike rouge which was digital this is the best ac in the franchise i dont care what anyone says great mature story great pacing for anyone that doesnt have adhd and the game play and parkour is great too its the only game that ive ever got a platinum in i got 100 completion in this game the only problem with this game is the poor framerate it had on last gen consoles but now that its coming out on this gen consoles it shouldnt be a problem anymore instead of remastering the 3rd game they should remake the first one never buying remastered assassins creed after ezio collection pass unless they added new and compelling content i dont think so game was good overall but a significant amount of the content was meh nintendo switch i was gonna buy this on ps3 i guess ill wait i just got ac3 for free on xbl gold ffs i think games should be closer to 10 rather than 5 before a remaster takes place makes the remaster seem more well seeming ac3 is a bit over 6 wtf that means ac4 is over 5 fml where do the years go as for remakes well considering the nature of a real remake it is hard to say when it would feel best for them to release americaac3 ubisoft was like yowhat if everything was yellow though add some yellow filter and god rays there u have remastered assassins creed 3 was the best made game ever in assassins creed series and this game will be outstanding i cant really wait till 29th march nothing is true everything is permitted best assassins creed wheres the switch if you think the original looks better please pause at 054 i hope there will be sandbox after the story ends this time dont downgrade these graphics as you do on other games where is the nintendo switch release make ac4 black flag remastered it looks like dogshit but im still gonna buy it lmfao does the game engine change i wonder if they finish the story how is this even a remaster this is a downgrade this shouldnt be remaster this should be a remake from the ground up for next gen waste of time this game got a bad rep when it came out but ive always thought that its one of the best the remastered version is the original before the downgrade waiting for downgrade and here i am still waiting for ezio shut up and take my money ezio is better always will be nope already bought the original version im just gonna pirate this one to see the differenti bet not much is that man come back remaster the first assassins creed already please make region asian please please assassins creed brown remastered with downgrade would be cool do we still get the multiplayer i love ac pvp also lets be honest everyone is getting this game just so they can do the bunker hill level again i am waiting for downgrade this brings me flashbacks to the old creed days where is lee im suprised they didnt go for a remastered ezio collection or something but im still hype so its brighter then the downgrade on this is just gonna be the original game new in remaster loading screen will take less time now will the loading screen take less time now blackflag please why dont u remaster then in order nice thx this is amazing and lokks much better than the rogue remaster the graphics are bettrr and the textures are much beautiful now and you will get a remaster ac liberation too that alredy got a remaster in the last generation this is actually a very good package instead of just more releasing remasters can you guys focus on making any original game became worse bro i still have nightmares about getting full sync on the giant and the storm on this game the first most powerful assassin got remastered oh boy i cant wait for those sweet remastered cut scene where i kill two man in a very brutal way why the sound of connor and haytham look different than original remaster graphics ubisoft graphical downgrade original graphics i played black flag freedom cry rogue unity in anticipation the problem this game had was the amount of dumb collectibles u had to collect the lack of fast travel and transportation around the frontier which was annoying i hope they release all the dlc for free with the game just reddish from bluish shut up and take my money 106 what are those textures ok what about ac1 and 2 if the painful explore the entire frontier bullshit challenge is removed and davenport homestead encyclopaedia mission can be not so painful i will consider giving it a buy a remaster is a good chance to fix some big problems and perfect a game otherwise no bro the remaster just looks like the original but orange why the ac3 why you dont remake the first assassins creed games used to be really dark this looks like an epic fail of a remaster finaly its real ac this is one of the couple main ac games i never played so ill probably get this assassins creed yellow back when single player games were awesome i was train like that no one could match not worth finalllyy could anyone tell me a price im assuming 60 dollars but im not sure ah finally where is leee ac iii more orange looks like all ubisoft did is added changes to the lightings and some of the foliage but going as far as to adding more detail to faces im not seeing in the trailers but wheres the best ac ac2 or any ezios tale remastered thats basically the next gen filter from uncharted mark my words ubisoft stop this foolishness and put some real effort into remaking the first assassin creed and watch the money raining on you i think i prefer the original lol no more new game just remastered your old game gamelogic2019 finally the best assassin gets a remaster but i really think after this we are going to need a remake for assassins creed 1 the first real and legit assassins creed in 3 years and its an old one with orange lighting i have a question do you going to remaster the tyranny of king washington hey look a new assassins creed game oh its a remaster of 3 back when the lore and modern day actually meant something oh great now they are remastaring a shitty game instead of making a new one or even make a game which has the actual word fun in it or even makes sense i hope that they dont do it like odyssey where they turned it into a rpg game because the last ac game i remember being a non rpg game is unity my favourite installment btw and black flag too i hope its going to be like the original title ubi plz if not ill start a fucking riot reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee they better add some new kill animations my question is will online will be on it i personally think this filter looks disgusting but if there are gameplay changes that make it feel less clunky ill be happy this gon be gooood dont get me wrong i loved ac3 despite some of the terrible maps and the awkward repetition of climbworthy trees the story was something truly special but remastering a game that came out a few years ago and is part of a franchise that gives us the exact same game with a few reskins every single year is just something different it feels cheap you call this remaster i am so hype for this and i loved assaasins creed 3 when it came out personally i think it was amazing prob the better game of the series assassins creed iii special edition well its nice to see good ole game but remastered this looks like they only implemented newer directx if they even did it and the rest were done with config ac unity remake when lul yet they wouldnt remaster ezio so they changed the colour of the horse from brown to white hopefully it has the controls of ac3 wait what when odyssey isnt assassins creed so you release an old one hoping that it will make everything better i cant see any difference i love connor but why remaster a game with a character that has such a dry personality oh yes next remastered my only question is whether this will have loading screens if not that would be actually great the last real ac i love the game but this also shows how lazy companies are you all ha e to keep remastering because everything you developed in the last 3 years has been trash where is charles lee there is no any difference shameee please let us use aquila in free roam thanks ubisoftbut i wish to make remakeremastered for assassins creed 1 best assassin creed ever they sayd that models will be changed to a new one but theres the same models why is everything yellow looks like it just has a new enb textures and such looks the same what is this game to be remastered about i really hope they consider making another ac game with connor do like god of war where kratos went on a journey with his son connor can go on some sort of journey with his daughter do brotherhood remaster pleaae looks like pretty basic enb mod with a bit sweet fx have seen skyrim mods doing better for free if the game play gets a solid update then maybe its a remaster but so far its more like a recolored ac 3 look at 102 that looks so bad the original looked better in a direct comparison video i loved this game not trying to hate but this looks like a weak remaster so many idiotic xbox fanboys here spewing false facts and making themselves superior no wonder why i sometimes wish the internet will be shut down ac 2 reboot please first they release ac3remastered and other acs which will be goodoookay aaaaand then they release a remastered version of ezios arc which obviously takes longer cuz they put more effort into it and will look and play astonishing 3 bring back multiplayer as you had it before unity sweetfx is your remaster i think every ac fan should buy this game so ubisoft gets the message that we want ac games like the old ones again of course the best ac game of the last years is gonna be a remaster of an old one modders can do this its about damn time now all we need is a remaster of the original assassins creed will it include multiplayer i prefer black flag tho i just like the multiplayer i need ezio trilogy remake not remastered we ask for new ac game they give us yelloworange ac3 d dah dah nice enb so whats really changed bro what happened to this franchise how weird everyone hates this game back on ps3 and now comments are all the opposite to me i always loved this game my favourite ac after ac2 but i have not played any ac on ps4 except like 1 hour of unity but i will definitely get this again hopefully it also has the online probably wont but it would be good to play it again i just want it in arabic ah god rays tricking people into thinking graphics are better than the original since skyrim special edition chills i swear i though it look like the remastered version back then amazing they made it brown remastered ac1 the one game where u actually fight real templars wow they changed the color i hope this worth the ac odyssey dlc now if only i liked this game when new assassin ive waited for this since ezio collection came out can i say something why are they remastering it when you can get backwards compatible desmond miles death in hd i am the only one love ac3 because no one else will switch anytime finally ubisoft giving us what we want that motion blur im glad their remastering liberation though also they made this look beautiful but why couldnt they do the same for the ezio trilogy like they seem like they pulled out all the stops on this but they seemed just to up the lighting for the ezio games well i guess what i can say is that at least people who love part assassins creed 3 will get something great p any chance you could produce a 4k60 gameplay trailer ac 2 remastered when noone really talking about liberation i mean it was great game sure but why still people dont give it a look its quite good ofc its a bit feministic at times but aveline is a great daughter imo nah its might be downgrade again hey ubisoft can you make this is in pc that isnt remastered resident evil 2 is remastered or call of duty modern warfare i bet you the originalremastered comparisons of connor in the world are bogus the original graphics are what well get in the final version and the remastered graphics are just different types of lighting in the same area same graphics looks like ubi just added a new lighting engine to the game is all why do you think this is offered free in the season pass for odyssey lmao here we go oh connor has no emotion an hes always angry he has no charisma or funny like ezio sheesh let it rest i wouldnt have a sense of humour if i saw my people get burned alive an i damn well wont be happy either atleast ezio had his mother an sister an uncle mario who did connor have left let that sink in we need a assassins creed with 4 player co op and better then unity and more stuff to do in unlike unity this game sucks the only people who actually like this game are americans oh yeah please let me play this i think i can with the season pass on ac odyssey i hope thats true but did you remaster the clunky controls erratic navigation sticky buildingtree traversal clumsy combat etc ah i guess not woooaw they put reshade just like battlefield 3 maps with its blue filters that in battlefield 4 the bf 3 maps become orange still im hyped for the remaster amm on 110 april it will be cracked so yo ho ho no money for ubisoft looks the sameonly with new yellow filter meh looks good other than the orange tint of the new lighting doesnt seem to fit the america during the revolutionary war theme i might just buy this again hands down my favorite assassins creed game regardless of what people think about this game you cant deny how amazing the soundtrack is hands down best ac gamemy opinion ubisoft is remastering it because ac 3 is the best selling assassins creed game of all time an actual remaster would be using the new ac engine that we see in origins and odyssey beautiful game and i cant wait for the remaster should be getting it with the season pass and looking forward to experiencing connor desmond and the beautiful world of ac3 once again also hope you changed a few mechanics so crossing rooftops is easier excellentwork you guys are brave calling this remastered after resident evil 2hope other colors will be available maybe green blue and red when are they gonna remaster assassins creed 1 they remastered every game in the original storyline except ac1 my favourite ac game looking great cant wait still waiting for an ac1 remaster no thanks game came out like ten years ago true fans dont skip the third game assassins creed 3 yellow edition yesyesyes ubisoft i love you omg 005 020 is that tune that plays whenever you climb up to a very high point i might just buy this for haytham muthaeffing kenway alone at long last my favorite of the assassins creed series returns ac3 was perfection to me in so many ways that black flag simply ruined and almost permanently drove me away from ac fluid movement wildlands of north america iconic era and people and the last game to feature desmond and any modern day story worth a hoot the pinnacle they should have had remastered assassins creed 2 it would look amazing wait so is there going to be multiplayer conors tomahawk and hidden blade dagger style combo was too good i also really loved the rope darts and etc do the devs at ubisoft not know how to properly animate faces anymore thank you ubisoft not many love this game as much as i do thank you thank you thank you looks the same to me have a 21 savage as on of the british commanders they can remaster the older games like ac2 brotherhood but they remaster this i think you must next time remastered the older games cause people wont play it i hope it will be on pc too why not black flag id get this just for the multiplayer it maybe the worst assassins creed to some people but this was actually the first ac that i invested hours into completing everything hunting every kind of creature looking for every gd feather and doing it again on the tyranny of king washington it will forever be special to me thank you for this remastered version ubisoft so excited for this why not ac 1 first our revilations ac liberation looks so good im glad aveline got put into this looks like it just has some red lightning effect to me how many fools can i kill today assholes cant make anything new assassin creed 3 remastered should have come in 2013 or 2014 i mean ac3 came out in 2012 and its has been 7 years whos going to waste 60 on ac3 remastered when you could waste used 5 for ac3 from gamestop yayyy itll always be sunset yellow orange for everyone assassins creed 3 more yellower edition my favorite assassins creed n the multiplayer cool to watch until they downgrade the graphics man how the hell this game lost the 2012 game of the year award especially for uhgh walking dead remaster looks really nice would love to see a remaster of black flag next there should have been a ac 4 black flag remastered version instead of this connor was my man such a well written story goosebumps hope they will add the dlc outfit for the main game this time assassin creed 2 remastered i dont see much difference here outside of colors texturesmodels dont look much improved environmental details about the same idk not sold so its a enb version for console players so now a 2012 game looks like a 2014 game now the texture little bit soft am i right now the only thing o want in this game is russian language charles they would rather slap an orange filter over this game and call it a remaster rather than spending time and actual effort remaking the ezio series dont get me wrong i liked ac3 but this is just a lazy low effort cash grab best ac hands down this is my favorite ac game stoked for the remaster connor was so underrated wait wait is it just me or they added the option of taking off the hood if thats so its f1cking awasome graphics and stuff look cool too nice move ubi im been wanting this since 2014 thank u ubisoft adds god rays makes remastered they said that they will use a different graphics engine why it didnt turn out like re2remake the lighting is soooo overpowered compared to original yeah you can keep this one wont beat the re2 remaster this was my first assassins creed game that i played back in 2012 and it pulled me into the assassin creed universe assassins creed lll instagram filter hell yeah i miss the multiplayer so much they bringing that back too i dont remember a lot of the game so uhhh this is gonna be fantastic a good purchase for people who are fans of the color yellow please let the different costumes show up in cutscenes yellow overlay remastered people are actually defending this poor remaster when all they did was add an orange filter smh sure you can argue that time of day affects it but the whole purpose of a side by side comparison video is to show you the exact picture with the only difference being that one is remastered so either ubisoft is retarded and didnt make a good trailer or the remaster is a low budget cash grab ps also just look at the textures in some of the shots for the remaster theyre so disgusting desmond dies and bad lip sync is still bad does this require previous games to understand the story i need photo mode actually looks pretty good haytham connor they decided to remaster the worst ac in the series okay assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1

assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins creed 1 remastered assassins cr please dont downgrade waiting to see this remasters graphics be downgraded ac3 best combat in an assassins creed game hands down always made me feel like a badass thank you ubisoft for remastering this gem screw the haters this game rocks when you are out of ideas for new games in the franchisejust remaster the old games no switch port im really disappointment assassins creed still not on switch edition if this is physical in the us day damn one it will be bought idk what people say ac3 was awesome connor is soooo underrated was the realist one about the creed make everything brown color remastered assassins creed iii filtered edition one word glorious will it show the assassin turkey easter egg unity is better in every way does anyone know if the multiplayer gonna come back too cant wait to play this game for old memories ac3 was the first ac game i completed after being confused on both ac and ac2 as a kid literally no one asked for this and we love you ubisoft pls do revelations next this is gonna be a purchase assassins creed iii was always my favorite so happy to see it coming back the best one ever i preordered and bought the original and the dlcs when season passes were brand new got maybe half way and just could not take it any more i sold it deleted the unplayed dlc and never would i play it again it was about 3 whole chapters as kenway then as a kid for a few and finally around 7 missions u become an assassin and i remember there being about 13 chapters maybe it just took forever the graphics and way the story was told was bland and boring i didnt agree with decisions and felt control was somehow restricted when compared to any of the ezio games lost more ben franklin papers than i caught and i seem to remember there being a huge mountain smack dab in the middle of your missions that you cant go over and it takes forever to go around not to mention the glitches i never played unity but im sure ac3 is by far the worst game sounds good feelsbad cuz i cant experience this on my pc lol no switch version what is the price for the standalone version in usd definitely a buy since i like the modern assassins creed the most will it have multiplayer very underrated game stil think that ac3 pre alpha footage was batter please give us the multiplayer version also sadly this wont have anything new so they added a piss filter finally ahhh the memories playing this game this makes my soul happy im literally crying rn it looks so amazing rogue and the ezip collection were touch ups but thisthis is like a true remaster piss filter and 30fps yesss thank you ubisoft it looks nice but not 40 nice why not remaster one of the best ac games like 2 or 4 decrease brightness add more shadows fix lighting okay this is completely remastered damn the music brings back sooo much memories my favorite ac and one of my favorite games ever remastered what a great time to be alive so its much more lighter so do we need to buy a disk or can i just buy it in the online store so they just added more lighting but oh well it aged pretty well anyway tbh ill definitely be grabbing this just dont take out the multiplayer this time this is what i was afraid of this is just more detailed walls with just as plasticky faces why cant ubisoft learn from capcom typing this comment with one hand if ya know what i mean can we get a black flag remake next that could honestly hold its own against rdr2 make remaster of ac unity i mean optimised so its yellow now sucks that we only get to see the complete after shots for half a second the remastered portions are either halfscreen and covered by weird bloom or when they scroll to full size they instantly change scenesz playing the americas collection and rogue is more fun then playing ezio trilogy ubisoft i love you so everything got more orange us declares hem self independent frees mexico from their land argentina declares hem self independent frees chile from spain and doesent become them their pupet us puts a military dictarorship in argentina argentina wtf pffff sow much freedom that once they got the chanse started a war whit mexico and disrespecting self determination in all america by 0uting dictatorships in power the argentinan revolition is the real example of freedom we even liverated another country and we didnt maked it our pupet but is the lock picking fixed this looks gorgeous is the remaster not for pc and i already own the original so will i get the remastered version automatically assassins creed iii recolored they only changed the lighting if you buy this then your a damn fool but what about multiplayer connor and ac3 is my favorite so glad they remastered it so can we get the hood back on in endgame im sorry but is better lighting all the remaster brings i was hoping for better textures but maybe its because its youtube those textures looked terrible yellow colorremastered ubisoft plsss make assassins creed 2 remaster just ac2make it actually look next gen like re 2 ezio collection wasnt dat good wait no switch port never liked connors character because it seemed like he didnt have any character but boi the game itself was pretty good itself the ac odyssey war system is what i wanted for ac3 loved this one the most so excited i am and forever be an assassins creed fan but i got to be honest resident evil 2 remake has set the bar real high with any game that want to try remastering theirs and you know people will be quick to jab at any remaster not bringing it for now on this game was just amazing just beautiful just changed color and saying ramaster come on atleast get inspired from the re 2 remake am i the only one who didnt like this assassins creed i think revelations was way better the best ac game i hope no one buys this just for better lighting and better grass it aint worth it its a shame that the ezio collection didnt get a true remaster cant wait to chase people for 5 minutes after rd2 nothing looks remasterd anymore dude i loved ac 3 it was amazing definitely buying that everyone ripped on this game so hard idk how its always been my favorite and im so happy its getting a hard remaster not like the templar game the first ac game i ever played the memories how to remaster any game step 1 grab tv remote step 2 press settings step 3 click display step 4 adjust saturationbrightnesscontrasthighlightsshadows to your liking step 5 lick my balls ur welcome feverishly looking for lotion i cant wait to watch my family burn to death in ultra hd rtx graphics much better remaster than cringyass ezio trilogy remasters so its more yellow now why didnt they remaster 2 this one was just another revenge story and the last ac game i played turned me off of the series garbage lifeless characters and just not fun like reggie says if its not fun why bother assassins creed 3 60 lighting mod all i see is lighting improvement thats it instead of this they should have remaked revelation or brotherhood black flag next year thank you please put jesper kyds aphelion soundtrack to this remaster that soundtrack is really good and is fitting the games setting its sad they didint put it in the original game oh man my assassin creed heart this was my fav out of all ah b and x simulator 2019 is coming this game was raw cant wait 2nd favorite game behind black flag something about the tragic story of the kenways is beautiful to me glad its getting better recognition now i remember it being mostly hated back then hopefully they improve the skin textures i can not wait to see the bugs remastered im ready to play my favorite ac game again what do you do if you want liberation only i played ac iii several times over back in the day i dunno to me it looks like a new coat of paint thats about it i m often play rdr2 so from now looking another new game looks like see cartoon graphic in hd thats make me not interest to buy new game huffff hope this my sickness not last for longtime ok very fucking dope i just dont like connors voice tho that kind of makes me sad and i kinda dont want to buy it anymore just because of that he indian not from wisconsin damnit and what about ac2 this was my favourite assassins creed game spoileralert keep in mind that therell be a whole generation who would be introduced to desmond for the first time and immediately witness him get killed at the same time not wasting money on this it doesnt even look that remastered fighting combat system also remastered i think we need to make this game more orange tinted ubisoft ac3 has its issues but it also has some of the most brutal kill animations in the entire series the doublecounters were crazy the rope dart was also awesome to use game developers are getting lazy and running out of good ideas remaster time remake assassin creed next please not a remasters a remake like re2 residents evil 2 if capcom can remake a game from the 90s u can do the same with ac one please actually listen yes best assassins creed great more milking of the assassins creed series can we just freaking get ac1 remastered its the only good one ive been waiting for since the ezio collection remaster revelations kinda let down they dont remaster ac 3 like call of duty remaster cod mw1 i mean this is nice but why not remaster the previous two games too and make it a remastered collection theres barely any difference give us the multiplayer ubisoft come on the most underrated game in the whole series extremely underappreciated with a great story brutal combat and a phenomenal soundtrack all im saying is we could have gotten stabby man jack sparrow edition remaster i hope this sparks a connor sequel man remember when assassins creed was this good and you didnt need to grind useless side missions to play the damn main story or have your hidden blade actually kill something yall know ima play this when it comes out ooooohhhh baby assassins creed went downhill after the kenway saga and this was the peak change my mind ive seen a lot of people say connor was a boring character but hes easily my second favorite assassin right behind ezio add 21 savage in this as a redcoat infiltrator played every main ac game up to rogue this has been my fav so far i am so happy right now ac3 has always been my favorite cannot wait to play it again its time to replay the longest prologue in gaming history hell yeah my favorite assassins creed definitely getting this so basically same game with better graphics and you just get the old dlcs nice one ubisoft orange tint and sunflares why dont they just bring back aciii combat and ac unity parkour together why not remaster assassins creed brotherhood the real og assassin better textures a lot of lighting and updated graphics looks good how about the nintendo switch assassins creed liberation remaster remastered yes yes yes yes thank you ubisoft thank you for remastering my favorite game i can finally stop using my ps3 im so glad i can finally play this game on my ps4 pro using my 70 inch 4k vizo smart tv thank you ubisoft it means alot to me now we just need the remaster of assassins creed 2007 then my collection will be complete then i will be able to replay all the assassins creed games on my ps4 pro im so happy i could just wear a cowboy hat why cant the new assassin creeds go back to the old formula it was so good please do assassins creed black flag sooo we get a yellow filter the soundtrack still makes me emotional ima wait for it to come out because ubisoft has been fucking up lately please remaster ac i and ii thanks for putting a warm filter on the game since i have the season pass for odyssey ill be getting this for free ac3 is one of only three games in the franchise i dont like ac1 ac3 and unitymainly because my game on ps3 was a bug ridden mess that made it very hard to enjoy but while the story was goodi didnt like connor and the setting in the time period really made the platforming dull but this will allow me to give it a second chancei doubt my opinion on connor or the setting is going to change much but hopefully the game runs smooth enough that i can at least enjoy it a little bitand attempt to plat it this time ac3 is nice but have you ever thought of acblack flag remaster not a remaster lol just and hd upgrade wow how about a remastered collection for all splinter cell games splinter cell 1 pandora tomorrow choas theory essentials both double agent versions conviction and blacklist please splinter cell needs to come back with a remastered and some new games is this going to sell for a full price of 60 bc ill wait black flag deserves one tooits my fav aqwhy not remaster farcry 3 remaster 4 please at last that music again my hairs are spiking up with static electricity ummm so whats the difference multiplayer has been removed mild sepiafiltered lighting thats it still not as good as red dead redemption it would be funny if ubisoft ends up downgrading the graphics in launch already was onboard when i saw remastered ac3 butlip quivers but then tear rolls down cheek liberation is included gets into fetal position and cries uncontrollably while handing my wallet to ubisoft i havent bought an ac game since this one came out about 7 years ago im crying i remember staying up until 1am to watch the original reveal of aciii it looked so awesome with all the snow tree climbing hopping through windows the tomahawk really different from the games before unfortunately i think its my least favourite main ac but part of me wonders if id enjoy it more a second time around original version is better tbh not much of a remaster looks like only upgraded lighting cant wait to not waste my money on this garbage i thought you guys said we wouldnt see much from the assasins in a couple of years after odyssey im both happy and disappointed that you lied to us love you guys but damn the best assassin ubisoft ever made after ezios trilogy meh you guys shouldve revamped the combat with the new system in origins odyssey of all the games you couldve remastered you did this one i dont trust it ubisoft has a reputation for upgrading graphics for trailers and demos then downgrading them for the actual game games wont never be this good no more im so glad this is getting a remaster my fav besides the ezio trilogy yes ive been waiting for this ac3 is my favorite ac game remaster the trailer please ubisoft not sure i want to play again odyssey has spoiled me why this game no one wanted this i dont see any ray tracing in remaster my favorite assassins creed 3 they need to remaster ii and brotherhood so you added hdr and turned on night mode to give everything a warm yellow hue thank you we need old ac fighting system back im playing ac3 rn i love it but theres so many goddamn bugs ill def pick this up i heard this was for the ac odyssey season pass can you buy aciii remastered separately best assassins creed since black flag connor will always be my favorite assassin of all timefollowed very closely by edwardplus the background music is awesome in ac3 im waiting for a blackflag remaster my question is did the game play get any better because assassins creed 3 is boring as hell compared to others take mymoney please looks good i might pick it up in when it goes on sale honestly ac3 was boring but the soundtrack was great i dont care what anyone says this ac is great assassins creed 3 yellow edition when ur younger ur just playing and trying just to finish the game and now u can see history and have a totally different point of view from 7 yrs ago when this game originally came out thank you for making this but does it still have the godawful final showdown and anticlimactic ending cuz otherwise no thanks never played this so im definitely looking forward to it glad it was included with ac odyssey gold edition oh boy i cant wait to see desmond die in better graphics ive always regretted not finishing ac3 im glad theyre doing this so i have an excuse to play it fully i dont get it when assassins creed 3 came out in 2012 everyone hated it come this year and 2018 all of the sudden everyone wants a remaster after i saw this i went to the announcement trailer for ac rogue and i everyone was hating on it and asking why it was being made even though it was the most overlooked and overrated assassins creed ever especially compared to unity who asked for this this remaster is not like a resident evil 2 remaster shame my first ever plantium trophy for the ps3 oh the memories this time my goal will be to get plantium trophy for the ps4 im going to love it i hope watch dogs 3 is coming after the division 2 i pray to god that you guys get rid of the feature that makes you wanted when you go on buildings the is assassins creed assasins is not rpg feels like they literaly added minecraft hd shaders lol be like resident evil 2 thats how you remaster aaaaaahhhhhhhh my husband is bbbaaaccckkkkk definitely better than assassins creed rouge remastered my personal favorite assassins creed game glad to see its getting a remaster is this still included for free in the season pass for odyssey my man charles finally got i sequel cannot wait to play through connors amazing story againtruly my favorite game ever i forgot about the dlc in this game might aswell play them yes finally really wish they wouldve made more games with connor hes easily one of my favorite assassins from the series right up there with ezio and edward smartest decision you guys ever made ac3 was the best one to date does it have multiplayer assassins creed is back baby wooooooooo this looks like the next gen graphic filter from uncharted two improving graphics though its been 7 years to remastered what about an ac 12 remasters ac3 isnt that old i dont think its nessasary as long as they keep it classic than new style this gameac odyssey this game put me off the series connor was a terrible protagonist especially in comparison to his predecessor i have origins so will see if it rekindles my desire to play the series they literally just increased the brightness and said its a remaster i really enjoyed ac origins ac odyssey is good but doesnt feel like an ac game but this game is still my favorite i love how they make games look good at e3 downgrade on release and then wait to remaster and make the game look like how it should have in the first place still gonna buy it tho if they have the online im buying oh well that is dissapointing i thought they were going to remake some of the models and mechanics if it is simply a texture and lighting overhaul then thats pretty shite connor is war torn over the floor boards on top of a ford taurus having an abortion 053 please actually look like that where is charles lee whod you rather have a trilogy about bayek or conner one great thing about this game on 360 i didnt have the ps3 exclusive content now ill have it on ps4 playing the ezio collection in preparation for this once it and liberation downloads the only one i wont have on ps4 is the original it wont surprise me if the original gets remastered i even got the side scrolling chronicles where do those fit in the ezio collection three liberation four black flag rogue unity syndicate origins odyssey do the side scrolling chronicles have modern day the modern day of origins and odyssey are after the desmond modern day so theyre not really prequels just wait for black flag remastered wow so yall put 1 lighting affect into play soo cool like im sooo really gonna but this again wheres lee may we please get a photo mode ayy 2019 the year of remake games yes yes y e s everything about this screams yes nice just in time too considering im still trying to finish aciii on xb360maybe ill finally finish with this one i have all of the ac games but havent finished one since revelationssmh will you be able to do ubisoft challenges in game this would be great as you could earn rewards in other ubisoft games like for honor and rainbow six siege any special outfit included didnt they screw up the ezio remaster that brotherhood remaster was a joke i dont trust ubisoft with the use of remaster unless you really enjoy it dont be fooled ubisoft really butchers their graphics finally an assassins creed game i might actually buy ive tried the last few and just havent liked them at all but i do love me some good ol ac3 so everythings more yellow now lol they said its gonna be different ubisoft thank you for remastering ac3 i love this game to death because ac3 was the first game i ever beat and the way you made this game and taking it all the way back to the american revolution it was amazing and such a honor to play for the first time and it was one of the reasons why i love assassins creed in the first place and why i love you guys so much for all the great games that youve made over the past years and not to mention that the assassins creed series is now 12 years old now so awesome so so awesome i love you guys so much and i thank you for all that you have done you guys are a part of my childhood long live the creed the assassins creed soooooooo does this mean we can play the multiplayer again because i know we miss the hell out of that i always liked ac3 the best one in the franchise im excited for the remastered version ac before gods fire horses and rpg was such amazing this game has the best theme song its so inspirational i loved this game idk why all the hate for it years ago but after they killed off desmond i didnt play ac until origins now oddessy the story has been off kilter every since this game in my opinion though since im getting this for free ill like it not sure if this enough for players who already have the original though yes unpopular opinion but this is my favorite ac game it looks beautiful soon get my hands on it wait 3 is getting remastered really dont get me wrong i like the game but id imagine the ezio trilogy would make more sense god knows it needs a face lift my fav assassin is back in 2019 thank you ubisoft wonder if they took this time to add other details besides just a graphics upgrade hopefully shay cormac and the events in the prequel will be included this time shay wasnt in unity so hopefully hes included or mentioned just bought the ezio collection on psn for 10 and should be finishing up around time for this i get the need to evolve and originsodyssey both look and feel great they simply arent assassins creed games this ezio these are ac games in every way makeassassinscreedgreatagain now they need to remake part 1 on the origin engine when you cant make good games anymore so you just remake the good old ones the question iscan you still downgrade a remaster hey guys so i bought the season pass for odyssey and ive already beat chapter 7 im level 52 episode one was already installed but i still havent gotten a mission notification at all anybody else having issues with this bout time connor got some love ive waiting for this too much remaster black flag you sorry bastards im actually excited about this latest assassins creed games have gotten way too rpgish in nature for my tastes is this a joke why bother remastering this when there is ac1 what is this browns vs the whites the game did they just add a yellow hue to everything anyone know the price me personally ac rogue black flag ezio trilogy are the best but i cant wait for this to add my collection personal opinion if you do decide to make another remastered how about rainbow six vegas 1 and 2 or make an ac somewhere nice odyssey and origins were nice to but too big for me honestly also didnt get into odyssey cuz of new stuff and politics but thats my two cents ubisoft if you can here me please make a remake for assassins creed 4 black flag on ps5 i mean black flag has the second biggest map in the history of the series after odyssey but unfortunately because it was a cross gen and due to the technological limits of the past gen the map wasnt 100 explorerable tons of loading screens and alots of water plus i like to play as an assassin pirate i a fan of the old ac formula and i and many others consider black flag one of best games in the series ive always wanted to play 3 but got rid of the ps3 before i could thanks ubisoft i wanna see difference of the cutscenes not the gameplay we all know its gonna be broken anyways xd but seriously though will it will the combat still the same just give us watchdogs 3 havent bought a assassins creed game in a long time but im picking up this one for sure is this a remaster or just an upscale like rouge cuz if its just an upscale shame on you my favorite assassins creed by far lemme just put a warm tone to make it seem remastered when can i preorder this on the xbox store ps how much is this will it still have its online game we want our ghost recon phantoms back bringbackgrp grp good work but will they have fixed some trophies too bad its going to be just as boring as the original when putting a yellow filter over everything is remastered heyy i have been completed play this game does anyone know if noah watts returned to voice over in this video or was it old audio cut from the game recorded in 2012 damn did i see some new finishing moves ooo ok then wow an actual remaster you make my day ubisoft im waiting nitendo switch please why though best ac game ive ever played best ac game is back boissss im so glad theyre remastering this since it is my fav assassin game what about any of this is a remaster i expected more but ill still get it spoiler alert i dont want to have to relive desmonds death and feel such massive disappointment afterward i have waited so long for this time to take down the english once again this is so fuckinggg epicc best ac made but you cannot call this remastered just some bloom and light effects cant wait to go into the multiplayer and die 50 times via poisoning assassins creed 3 is now going to be in the remastered version my favorite game of assassins creed 3 it has a lot of amazing graphics and i havent got a chance to get the dlc and now there all coming on xbox one im so excited changes color pallet alright bois i think we got ourselves a remastered game does any one really care about the old ac games they were boring and tedious ac3 in paticular had the worst ending ever i like the new rpg ac games no point in dwelling on the old decript ac games better be a black flag remastered coming id love to go back to good old edward my favorite game of all the time i cant wait for it thanks for remastering my favorite ac game i loved ac3 and i beat it a gazillion times years ago i never got why people hated it so much its far better than this rpg trash they are pushing into newer acs doesnt look that impressive tbh i cant play this again because i dont wanna kill desmond againmrmilesyou were the best part of assassins creed these ac games were better compared to origins and odyssey im convinced connor had sacrificed everything and got nothing in the end yet he still carried on a true patriot i cant wait to replay this game this game is the reason why i enjoyed the american revolution and made it interesting in the classroom i think that unisoft just added yellow in the game remaster with rtx off wont even bother my parent for this stinking game would be better if you worked on some better textures and less kids in assassin creed origins you lazy bum i dont see any difference theres no reason to make a remastered just work on the new assassins creed ubisoft assassins creed 1 and full ezio collection remastered please hey look its reshape except its not free its almost a full price game no one asked for this yeah yeah yeah but what about multiplayer are we going to forget how awesome the mode was from brotherhood to 4 fun af and pretty creative i really wish that a eventual sequel brings it back out of all the assassins creed games this one is by far my favorite and im so happy to know that its getting remastered assassins creed 3 is my favorite ac of all time gonna have a good time with my boi franklin rdr2 charles can i ask does it come with the awesome multiplayer i know it wasnt popular and the ezios collection didnt have it but hope we see its return whens the downgrade comparison ill be honest 40 bucks seems a bit steep for a game that i got free on games with gold all it has now is a fancy filter the cinematics still look the exact same nice try on the cash grab using our sense of nostalgia against us boobisoft so they know they are fucking up franchise more when they make new ac so they did remastered to regain community they lost im buying it day 1 but i need me some ac on switch i will buy that for 90 hand down the best ac game i know a lot of people hated ac3 but personally im stoked for this dont get me wrong i loved ac3 but it looks like the only difference with this remaster is just an orange filter with the same graphics as there were on the last gen consoles now do the same with ezio trilogy i cant wait i miss the memories heres hoping theyve ironed out all the technical problems i had back on the ps3 playing odyssey the conquest battles are what i thought it wouldve been like in ac 3 assassins creeds graphics have never been anything revolutionary they could never get hair ubisoftthank you this was always one of my favorites in the series cant wait to play through it again omfg yes my dream came true this one was alright but black flag was the best in the series for me lol i love how the majority of the comparison clips are cut scenes and not actual gameplay so its just how the game looks on pc but on console then looks like a mod adding more shading and foliage is there any texture upgrading can we get a ac 2 remastered plz this is the best assassins game ever is it me or is a bit too colorful this looks like a just a saturation boost a few different texture and over use of lensflarei mean sure it is better i mean as i said its just a few enhancement that in my opinion dont really worth another buy if you have the game ubisoft is making this remasters so new players can try out the older games but i mean its still not as pleasing to the eye so idk maybe its just a little pocket change for ubisoft making few buck from this assassins creed iii recolored i have the biggest erection right now assassins creed 3 orange edition lol i was playing this the ps3 and it hasnt aged well good to see a remaster is coming hell yah i am getting this one this was my favorite out of all the games please tell me this is on disk the only game i am looking foward to this year past anthem so basically youve modified the game to an extent that any pc gamer can do with a reshade yay how awesome incredible resident evil 2s remake kinda ruined this for me i cant wait to relive this masterpiece with connor does anyone know if this will be 60 fps on console and do i still get liberation if i bought the assassins creed odyssey season pass if its 40 dollars cad or less ill buy it great game but the beginning is like 3 hours long why didnt they do ac brotherhood or the older ones remaster brotherhood this be awesome to play assassin creed on ps4 the first assassins creed game i put my heart into cant wait im still mad at you for killing boomer but this game helped me pass us history so ill buy this game please be on steam unexpected why 3 of all things slap a piss filter on it and call it good i never played the first since then ive discovered how incredible the revolutionary war era was and now cannot wait to buy this cant wait and the music brings back some of my best memories assassins creed 3 is what i grew up with ubisoft i cant thank you enough your creations have been a part of who i grew to be love you the only thing that looks remastered is the lighting my dumbass is still probably gonna buy it though so whatever yes yes yes yes its happening its happening my favorite ac of all time yes yes buying why they chose third part as for me ezio way better main charactersecond part better and needs better graphics makersscharacterscheaperubiplz where is charles lee lll the remastered edition lol why remaster the one that everyone hated this is amazingaciii really was one of the best just like acii ive seen no other game that bests these two not even odysseyubisoft you know what the fans need now keep on delivering hell yeah one of the last real assassins creed games is making a comeback and its glorious ubisoft take a look at capcoms remake of re2 we want to see that kind of change not just a new color filter aded that is how moders make graphics so its not coming to the switch why didnt theg remaster 2 you call this a remaster the description says improved gameplay mechanics please tell me they didnt change the perfect animations and swap them for the n64 animations in odyssey best thing about it that ill get it for free ac odyssey season pass bonus why the f is it not on the switch i like this fame i am happy it will cone on ps4 cuz in this ps3 it does not work any more well that is great but ac 3 when you didnt even remaster the first ac what i know some people hated ac3 and wanted a main character like ezio again but i persinally loved ac3 and connor i thought he was the best character we had to date far more complex and inwardly thinking torn between his duty to the assassins and wanting his own people safe nowwill it have bugs fixed and improved gameplay that remains to be seen arguably the most irritating features about ac3 were the abovementioned points hell i wouldnt mind if the combat was given an overhaul to match current ac games thatd be nice too although hated by many when it launched i didnt like it as well after playing this game 3 times i gotta say its one of my favorite assasins creed games and the soundtrack is simply amazing any chance some mechanics were updated i remember getting compliments in 5th grade because i knew everything about this war nintendo switch love it hands still bother me tho why do they remaster such a sorta newer there isnt even a gen in between i know why tho lol its cuz off the money i remember playing ac 3 but really wasnt into it like part 2 and black flag seeing this make me want to play it again yo i played assassins creed 3 on pc like a month ago and it looks almost exactly the same besides the lighting and bushes on the ground awesome and yet i really wish they found a way to implement the multiplayer into the remaster that would be my favorite is assassins creed 2 i love the story of ezio its so good hes the best assassin ever is the fighting style the same or like odyssey if its 60 im fighting all of ubisoft will it be on the switch ac 3 didnt need a remastered version ac unity did just create a new assassin creed games like the originals the new ones arent even assassin creed games they the origins make it about assassins and templars again waiting for black flag rogue remastered they are my favourite in the series is the normal pc version the same as the remaster just wondering because rogue had a remaster but it was only for console this is why ubisoft is the best developer all they need to do is remaster the first ac now charles is that you boah ac 3 was a very good choice but in my opinion the ezio storys would be the best storys you could remaster theyre gonna downgrade this too dear ubisoft if you could find it in your heart to release splinter cell chaos theory made in the latest unreal engine as a person who owns the first four games pc and the hd remake i will buy it and i doubt im the only one we will witness desmond will die again your job is very good and wonderful ubisoft team i have a request for you is it possible to remaster with far cry 2 the memories that i had with my friends in far cry 2 were fantastic but unfortunately nowhere is there any server in the game i beg you to remastered far cry 2 i hope damn it they just sold me with liberation remastered and all dlcs the only ac games i finished 2x and i enjoyed it expeacially the combat system soyour gonna let us run around the battlefield this time right finally thank you ubi3 oh god yess they finally remaster my favorite game in the series dear ubisoft please remaster ac 1 as it is the game that started the whole franchise and we wouldnt have all these great ac games without it why do you have so much potential as studio but fail nonetheless the reason why i bought gold ac odyssey ubisoft thank you so much for doing this youve created a wonderful character and world with assassins creed iii it was my first one and even tho ive played all of it im going to do it again you are amazing i just see they add shadow and real light so how much of this will get downgraded on release good doesnt have the shitty rpg style remastered sepia tint i like how this got shown the day after the sotu we all know this is the best assassins creed i miss this version of assassins creed the first game that i completely passed and also one of my favourite thanksubi 3 so when can i download my free copy that came with my acodyssey rip nintendo switch buuuuut does it have multiplayer like the good old days it looks like ubisoft is pulling a skyrim special edition on us tight they just threw on a sepia filter remastered with new instagram filters totally forgot that nature was actually orange higher resolutions will be welcome but are the drab filters mandatory wow they changed the lighting and cranked up volumetric rays such a remaster loljust better light and shadow nothing more shitty remaster somehow it will still be downgraded disappointed how ac4 turned out to be empty my 1st assassin creed game i ever playedtruly feels great r they gonna put the canoes in the game since they showed it and never delivered it in the original version this looks fantastic ac3 still remains to be not only my favorite in the franchise but one of my favorite of all time we want ezio auditore da firenze end of story uh my least favourite assassins creed game gets remastered so its getting a physical release ill definitely pick that up need a watch dogs remaster with the e3 presentation graphics thank me later i got it you introduced an orange filter in all scenes pd i enjoyed it in ps3 xd so now they giving us the game back with the original e3 graphics no downgrade so technically they didnt lie about downgrading their games this is the upgrade we wanted and seen probably my least favorite ps2 era gameplay combat was bad tons of boring fetch quests and i really hated the stealth missions whats the price for the game and they even added the coming home commercial for the watch more option ubisoft knows their stuff do i have a bad sight or it just looks like it has another filter on the lighting first the ezio trilogy then rogue now 3 and liberation why do i feel that the first game is getting a remake did anyone actually ask for a remaster of the worlds most boring game yayyy remastered charles lee my favourite assassins creed game got a remaster feels good asssassins creed 3 was amazing and it will always be but u should try and remaster assassins creed 1 me and my uncle still talk about it today connor is the most brutal fighter if you got the 100 aco this is free right if we already own ac3 on pc do we get the remaster for free is liberation also remastered definitely the best we need the ezio collection remastered like this id happily pay 100 bucks for it best ac to date and im glad im getting the remastered version well guess i am getting this again omg my favorite ac game the pc version is much appreciated im buying this for for haytham kenway that is all this is actually perfect im currently replaying all the assassins creeds all the way up to odyssey and this is definitely a cop you remaster ac3 and not ac2 ac brotherhood yeah ok they are truly out of ideas the best assassin creed game out there omg i cant wait disappointed they should have remastered it to the beta version do i get the king washington dlc for free if i bought season pass in ac odyssey sorry but all i see is lighting changes ill still buy it tho lol ah man ive already bought ac13 on pc plus brotherhood and revelations for less than 50 when they were all on sale last year at least i can get this game on ps4 though no wait wheres the pc edition definitely going to be picking this up cant wait so they put a filter on it wow so nice to see so many ac3 and connor fans instead of the typical ezio gaylords all the time i hope the parkour is better than oddsey please look how resident evil 2 remake change their game not just a graphics but gameplay too but i know this is remastered not a remake but ubisoft must make ac 3 graphics looks like ac unity or ac syndicate now make black flag remastered the colours are better but isnt ac3 set in a winter feel place this was the best game this what the ubi should do pufff but switch version si live in 720 p xddd i mean the lighting is a bit better other than that the game just looks like it has a filter over it big fan of the entire series and definitely picking up ac3 again wtf is that orange filter and nintendo switch they remade the worst one thank you after 2 games real ac experience is back thank you ubi i wish you come back like old this is what you have to do we want this as someone who has played since the original released ac3 had the most entertaining story of the series achilles is amazing the substory of getting revenge on charles lee on top of already being mortal enemies with your father achilles also has an interesting connection to ac rogue which i played years ago and just bought it remastered on sale a few days ago hopefully that is an actual remaster i swear if ubisoft just pulls an ezio collection meaning just a fucking lazy port of the game with ac3 i will fucking riot side note ac liberation a major installment i never played because who owned a vita lmao is getting a remaster as well but seems to be an afterthought here hopefully they give an actual remaster like they are doing with ac3 can anyone update me on whats going on there uh i dont know if it was just the video but from the looks of it its just a bit more orange it might be because i played this on pc though terrible game ruined the ac series for me one of the best music themes in videogames history yessssss finally please ubisoft make the next assassins creed game as great as the originals with a great present story like desmonds i have the odyssey season pass but i want to buy this in physical form anyone know if they will release it at launch or maybe later on like rogue best assassins creed game what about steam i just came to read hateful comments about how the change in the combat system ruined ac im a collector and very pleased to see this is getting a physical copy cant wait you guys should remaster acu with more things to do and fix the game or else make another game and use the same meta that it had remove the op gun guards and use the same parcour animations assassins creed iii had an amazing soundtrack the main song screams epic conclusion which is what the game sorta was imo also where the franchise should have ended because all the narratives were finally concluded as well edit i just looked up liberations and apparently it got an hd reboot on xbox 360 and ps3 in 2014 what i never knew you cannot even buy it on the xbox store and used copies are probably gonna be hard to find at a certain retail store assassins creed iii yellow edition remastered filters everything with yellow favorite ac but i see only lightning changes and i got to rethink if i buy step onetake old game step twothrow up a piss filter step three profit wheres assassins creed 2 remastered at tho finally ac3 was one of my favorites thx ubisoft the only thing i liked of this game was the boston bar fight or how is named especially for the music theme all they did was improve the lighting but it still looks amazing cant wait to buy this it looks a bit too orange ok this is epic i noticed some uniforms changed in the remastered version does this mean even more historical accuracy this was my first assassins creed game ever ubisoft has delivered some of my favorite games for years now i cant wait for the next assassins creed game if its anything like odyssey has been i love all the choices and consequences in each quest we get this ac3 remaster for buying the acos season pass right im getting this day one connor is one of my top assassins idk if it cease im also native american or what but im every hyped for it i was hoping for ac3 remastered for a couple years now it looks like its finally happening ill give it more time till final full release but so far it looks like all they did was made the lighting brighter and added lens flares but i do see some graphic upgrades to the characters ac 1 remastered pls whats the soundtrack played in the background so this is what charles was doing before red dead heck yeah i never actually got to play this it should had been a remake i love this last time i played this was 2012 i will enjoy it again thank you ubisoft i cant wait this is gonna be good the way the lighting is different and the areas in the world its gonna be good my personal favorite in the series is jumping to current gen boyz cool unisoft you should remake the ezio collection i cant help but to compare charles rdr2 and connor they kinda look alike imo lol the only reason i bought the steelbook for odyssey is because this came with the season pass best ac ever other than the desmond bs hopefully they fixed that chest pick locking glitch i was still never able to complete all the homestead missions due to that fing bug ugh the music score of this game second best after ezios family my copy of this game was so broken that it became a birds eye view arcade shooter and i skipped from like the second mission to the last third of the game somehow the best story of the assassins creed franchise in my opinion and now its remastered please stop theres too many games this year my wallet hurts i love assasins creed 3 finally away from the demon that is assasins creed origins i just hope that it doesnt have those screen shaking problem like in the original ac3 not for 40 25 is fair the soundtrack chills yaaaaaaaassssssss i want it nooooow no multiplayer no buy mp was really fun and different than most games didnt look too remastered to me mostly orange filtering and some bloom but thats all i really saw need to see more gameplay yessss love it say hello to downgrades they literally just changed the lighting this is a real remaster ubisoft we need to see the king kong game remake or remastered because we not have like this game in this days thanks are they gonna have an option to skip the 2 hour haytham section if not i really dont want slog a 2 and a half hour tutorial just to get to the good stuff with connor i remember being 1 in ubisofts ac3 system for everything for the longest time then not giving a fucc with the dlcthis game disappointed me so much and i bought the collectors edition this is where the modern day lore truly ended every other ac title is just spin offs damn how can a game that was already pretty get even more beautiful lol first assassins creed and ps3 game now that i have ps4 i will have ac3 to remind the joy this masterpiece gave me what assassins creed game is not remastered yet now im just waiting for black flag remastered goddamn this game looks amazing i cant wait to get it again this is a remaster the only thing 2 thing that look different are the lighting and fog effect this is stupid ubisoft needs to take notes from capcom just look at resident evil 2 remake ubisoft asassins creed 3 remastered ea anthem remastered eternally squealing my favorite assassins creed of all time now this is a remaster i cant wait for this absolutely loved ac3 i miss connor the most epic assassin in my opinion got the season pass for odyssey came with the gold edition that i preordered so ill be getting this for free so excited to play this especially the dlc never played the dlc before would love to see all legacy outfits in this remaster like we did in the rogue remaster will the dyes actually show up in cutscenes this time love this game i got an achievement for 1200 combat kills i kill redcoats real good assassins creed 1 or 2 remake d as much as some ppl wanted ac1 i dont mind 3 always loved using the tomahawk d but then when you realize it maybe they will remake 1 since they did ac rogue then ac ezio collection and now ac 3 and liberation who knows yes the best assassins creed game being remastered liberation is pretty cool too in a way is it still free for people who bought the season pass looking crisppp damn you guys love the bloom button huh nice to see some love for the ps vita title as well would have preferred a assassins creed ll remaster but its fine shows the graphics comparisons on environment and 3rd person view and never on the faces classic ubisoft if its anything like their other remasters the faces will probably look worse again color filter hahahaha will it be free to those who have ac oddessy season pass because for example you brought back farcry 3 remastered for free if you had farcry 5 season pass im just wondering my favorite acs were 3 and black flag yesss story music gameplay 10010 cant wait ac odyssey is my favorite ac 1 2 brotherhood 3 revelation all this where really good but the current ac games like unity syndicate origin are bullshit couldnt think of anything else to remaster this is arguably my second favorite ac game after black flag and im so excited to play it again along with the tyranny of king washington dlc and ive never play liberation before so that makes me even more excited gamers acting like they learning in this game assassins creed 3 remaster featuring brown also fog this is the only ac game i got 100 in the story missions with all the optional objectives can i have it for my birthday please its tomorrow im glad they remastered this game imagine if now they do an assasins creed black flag 2 all i see is a change in lighting justin y here yet i hope liberation has high resolution textures since it was a port originally from ps vita ayyyyy was wondering when ac3 was gona get remaked excited so they changed the instagram filter cant i just download a sweet fx ubisoft with the big scam what are the new ubisoft club rewards though was hoping for assassins creed to take place in feudal japan i guess the wait continues bruhh its going down but i wonder will it have the same gameplay to the original the sound omg i cant wait is connor the great grandfather of charles of red dead 2 after this i hope we get a remastered version of ac iv black flagoh wait we already got one for the psn store already so essentially it looks like it has a warm color filter over it a slightly sharper resolution and better overall dynamic range where the dark areas arent so muddy please keep multiplayer it looks good but its got a piss filter loved the combat and gameplay of ac 3 but just never fan of connor i just finished the game a few hours ago lmao looking real good just worried about the sunrisesunset theme it has going on im pretty sure it wont always look like that when the game releases my favourite and most brutal assassins creed is back thank you ubisoft loved it you couldnt do anything in this game why not remaster ii take my money now im happy this is coming out on my birthday i need this i just need this so much i dont know why when ac was good very underrated game call me crazy but connor is my favourite protagonist ever no one has ever been trought what connor has been and he was almost alone not many friends not really someone to trust and have faith in him thats why you hate him hes serious angry alone but ever thought who was there to support him will it have multiplayer well now ubisoft after you finish remastering this masterpiece start making a new game where connors story continious thats what everyone has been waiting for remastered a bit of better lighting and added more motion blur finally its said coming soon for a good 6 months miss you ac 3 i really do wait ubisoft actually remastered something will this game have a physical release in north america it looks like they just made things brighter i have to wait but i cant my favorite ac the best one a game that inspired me to buy every ubisoft game ever i hope they made the game fun i wanted this but it looks like ubisoft just put a snapchat filter on everything this means remastered desmond missions right i own ac3 on pc will i have to buy this again just to get remastered update if so ill skip this is the game that got me into games thank u ubi the reason the original assassins creed 3 looked washed out is it was on older hardware assassins creed iii yellow hue edition without a doubt gonna be the best remastered game ill ever play assassins creed 1 2 brotherhood and revelations remaster when great job ac creed 3 one of the weakest games in the series for sure but man if lorne balfes excellent score doesnt make me want to replay it anyways the parkour better be better than odyssey this will come with loot box wow its available on my birthday d ac3 was my first ac game favorite one too origins is like right behind i dont feel as if a remaster is warranted it was a good game but its not that old or that well received i cant wait to play this again hey ubi how sbout a modern time ac game something along the lines of the cold war will we get everything in here with the odyssey season pass like liberation and everything or is it just the remaster loved ac3 i just hope it has multiplayer am i the only girl who loves assassins creed dudeee the graphics hell yeah lets go so its basically just more orangeish with flowers sure im sold might as well finally pick up this game for the first time ac3 was hands down the best ac game maybe 2 was close i would count the days for a month till the game came out me and my mate were hyped i am seriously about to cry i love this im so excited the last game assassins creed fans were excited for before it all went downhillac3 direction story marketing and sense of understanding of the templars and assassins struggle story its purpose and grandeur is unrivalled to anything after it and was a true and welcomed successor to ezios storyi am glad its getting a remaster and applaud ubisoft for doing it remake this game in the new engine assassins creed 3 has the best setting but its execution was terrible only assassins creed makes history fun i was hoping you would do this thank you lets just hope that this a hint from ubisoft of a connor sequel in the near future andor more modern day focus i want to see what happens to connor after and i want answers on what happened to desmonds mind is it still inside the animus like subject 16 hopefully they fixed conners personality it would have been a good game if not for his horrible emo sulking i get why he is hostile or vengeful but there really needs to be moments where he does something other than be some edgelord teenagers oc where hes a leader and not just an accidental one so some new scenes with conner portrayed in a genuinely competent light are a must it was very difficult the first time around to go from ezio one of the best characters in video games to conner who is probably one of the worst assassins creed iv black flag remastered when its sad how reviewers gave a totally bad impression of the game when in reality fans loved it from the setting the characters to the modern day sooo now do the older ones and smash gotta have ezio in smash this game is underrated dont get me wrong conner is my least favorite assassin like i was really hoping he die by the end of it but the time period is my favorite out of all of them havent played odyssey yet so that might change but i remember being so hyped when i saw the first trailer i almost forgot about this i am happy you guys let me remember it oh and ubi please no more downgrades i beg of you i didnt ask for this but im happy about it so they just added an orange filter i was hoping for one thing guess that fake trailer got me hype for it with the third person ac3 view looking like odessy is it just the graphics or is it the graphics along with bug and glitches fixed oh my god i cant wait till this comes out i have the third one tattooed on my upper arm everybody at work sees it i love connor best main theme in the franchise imo one of my favourite villains of video game history thanks for bringing haytham back ac 1 remastered next year mark my words where the hell is the switch version only thing im wondering is if the mechanics are the same or did it get an update is it free with odyssey season pass i loved that game but a remaster nah if i want to play it ill start my ps3 when it came out i had no machine to play but this times getting on ps4 i wonder what if black flag gets remastered cant wait my favorite assassins creed game now this is assassins creed good money saving game cover english and french both side by side hey i am not complainin just sayin next ac1 pls my favorite assassion creed game is this an addon the game that ruined desmonds story i wan expecting a ac unity like graphics but its ok i dont think the cutscenes showed were remastered but im sure they will be buying it regardless i love this game are the dlcs included in this is there gonna be a remaster of the multiplier its just warmer colors assassins creed 3 relighted now you can have the most boring main character in one of the worst games of the franchise in hd why does it just look like they put a orange filter on it best ac is ac3 and ac4 sick yellow tint lets go death to the red coats lol probably the last game that needs a remaster i think ac1 deserves it far more not looking forward to that 3 hour intro as haytham again but other than that it looks amazing omg loves this game so much but the new assassins creeds arent so good through the years this soundtrack is still amazing loved that game its been so underrated for so many years now will 100 buy it waited for this trailer for so long wow this is actually better than what i expected i have been very critical of ubisoft lately but this is genuinely a great tribute to these underrated games and also a nice gesture towards all the fans i never thought i would say this but thank you ubisoft very much appreciated ah yes the most boring of the mainline acs why arent you remastering ac 1 im actually really fucking excited i like it alot but i feel like the game still looks pretty dated ac3 is fun and all but why i think you shouldve done something like the re2 remakeim comparing it just because its the most recent example on the top of my head just remaking the game with the tech available today compared to then imagine how cool it would be ac3 is my favorite out of the bunch i hope you take my comment to the heart and create something more technologically advanced and as difficult as it is i do think you can manage it you have the resources ps ubisoft is one of my favorites keep it up guys but you can do better woah woah woah wait all dlcs too welp looks like imma get this then so just change the lighting and add a bit of foliage and call it a remastered smh please include connors speechmonologue at the end it explains his character perfectly and its awesome edit damn it ubisoft they didnt lmao reminds me of the comparison when the ezio trilogy came out think this one actually does look better tho ew imo it looks worse oo seems way too bright for me i liked the cold touch due to the many snowy areas ingame o so theyre doing a remastered of ac3 now cool i guarantee there is gonna be some loser who just says they put a sepia filter over it i much rather have a ac1 remake so i can play as altair once more he is my third favorite character other than ezio the 1 true of assassins creed he is assassins creed after him is edward and bayek ubisoft is great again ubisoft i want a modern day ac game exploring more of the life of desmond between games or his fathers life as an assassin for this to be a remastered game i was expecting the graphics to look way way better than they do ive never played ac 3 so i hope its better than the graphics all aboard the hype train i get it the remastered is more yellow lol no need to buy only if you dont have the game or some dlc and what about remaster 2 or brotherhood i dont see any difference between original and remastered i hated that i bought the original i should of waited comes ac1 remastered i have yesterday buy the season pass for the dlcs but i can not download on my xbox one the game is epic and i love the soundtrack i buy the odysee season pass for ac3 liberation stop playin with me boi one of the best ac games of the whole franchise why didnt they show close ups of the peoples faces is it because they just changed the lighting and some of the color wonder if it will have some sort of secret ending for fans either way im excited sighs while internally screaming yes i dont consider adding yellow filter is a remasterd edition thank you very much ubisoft so they added some gold lighting nothing compared to resident evil remastered what about the multiplayer is it still gonna be happening 130 ps4 xbox one and pc no switch but why didnt you put the entire kenway saga in this remaster im a fan of underrated games i like final fantasy 13 i play for honor more than anything else and dragons dogma is one of my favorite games ever and while im not really an assassins creed fan i did love 3 downgrade will look like the original assassins creed secession us civil war make it happen ubi back when they had a good sound track that wasnt ezio them they use ezios them way to much didnt like odyssey at all but this looks very good it got the good classic ac stealth and not this new originsodyssey garbage whats up with the yellow hues so everything is during sunset now all i saw was a shitload of god rays what remake assassins creed 3 so they just made it warm tone what about black flag why do people rebuy the exact same game lol horrible this looks amazing but it ticks me off ubisoft isnt bothering with the online portions of these assassin creed remasters and ffs release them on pc already i teared up this was my whole childhood the improvement to the graphics is impressive but i agree with people who are saying that it just looks like the game was just given a yellow and orange filter and more impressive environments now that isnt to say i wont likely play it assassins creed 3 was by far my favorite of the ac games but i just dont know what to think of it until i see more videos black people didnt fight in the civil war dont you just one time release a fuking remastered game on pc i waited to see this for 5 months and now i realize i cant play it good ubisoft very good im just happy to see my boy desmond again i hope they update the naval combat it looks alot better but i wish they made it look like there target render gameplay even though that would probably be a remake i wanna play it right now some of the most unique stories ever told in video games even bought a vita just for liberation thank you so much ubisoft next black flag remastered this game was underrated these remasters arent up to par at all haythem cape though what will they charge for this anyone know haytham kenway was the best character in the game load blown why this game was trash remaster brotherhood or ascension my favourite ac game are you making it in re engine because any game could look better on re engine i dont see the difference wont change the shitty story and pacing hard pass if its not 60 fps then im not interested wasnt liberation remastered already is that a remaster of a remaster the game mechanics were very good but ive got to admit the story wasnt the best i will always love black flag the most this is my favorite assassins creed game i cant wait for this always will hild the opinion that this is the best ac in the series so basically they added the colour orange im sold i was hoping for a remake like re2 which was a complete overhaul but this looks like the skyrim special edition remaster pinch me i guess we wont get a connor sequel but hey we got this sweet they should remaster black flag i cant wait yes my fav assassin d yall pussys why not do brother hood are the fighting mechanics also updated or is it still button mashing free for gold edition ac odyssey users right looks at all the comments wait didnt everyone hate this game when it came out one of the best ac games finally an ac worth buying again i miss these older acs when combat was easier and i could destroy thousands of soldiers with crazy counter kills thank you ubisoft amazing part of my teenage years my favorite assassins creed to date cant wait to replay this game also hearing that soundtrack again made me so excited also my favorite sound track in assassins creed but this game sucked whyyy this makes nonsense remake the first not a 5 years game back when ac games actually made you feel like a badass and actually could use stealth the animations were amazing in ac3 especially the multikills the new ac games have nothing near the quality of animation that ac3 had i wish the new games didnt have leveled enemies that ruin the aspect of you being you know an assassin with enemies that just shrug off getting impaled by a freaking spear wait what about pc or just make a new game equally as good thats how you do a remaster ubisoft thats how you do it unpopular oppinion best combat in the series hands down unity had the best parkour new games only have better graphics and details come at me looks the samejust with an enb can we get some splinter cell remastering the first three games please what about pop forgotten sands remake man this will be insane but does it come with the absolutely legendary competitive multiplayer introduced in brotherhood i miss ac multiplayer so much im not a gamer and this was the first ac game i played and i loved it used to play all the time 4 was great to play too make a assassins creed black flag remastered please while i do see some improvements i feel as if that most of the touches on the remaster are saturation boosts and darkening of shadows i hope we can get some actual increase on textures and attention to detail on cut scenes this game was a masterpiece and taught me a lot about history during the american revolution and the perspective of the native american culture as well best assassins creed in my opinion cant believe its been almost 7 years since it first came out i didnt really like this assassins cre ouuuu them god rays thooo is this because of blm my favourite one i might buy this only for liberations one of my favourite ac ac3 is my least favourite ac game so far that i have played i havent played odyssey or ac1 not impressed have you guys seen halo 2 remastered thats a real remaster it seems like ac3 remastered was more of a texture and lighting overhaul so exited syndicate was the last real ac game origins and odisey are good games but they are not really ac games i am cool with everything they remasted before origins perfect i want it nowwwww bot im broke asf ive played every assassins creed game except this one got the gold edition of ac odyssey cant wait till i can download this glad this turned out better than the far cry 3 remaster not number 1 for me but it does have the best theme song i would love to play hide and seek and hunt some animals good old days are back one of the best story after playing rogue i prefer the templars faces look weird ac3 was what brought into the lore of ac and is one of my favorite games conner is the best assassin no question waiting for assassin creed 1 remastered looks good but the facial animations are a little off so excited to see they managed to change the lighting and the lighting ahhh its so exciting still my favorite ac game in the entire series really not ac black flag yes ive been waiting for this ac3 was the first asassins creed game to feature naval combat plus it was the first ac game i ever played from the series now it has been remastered one word awesome assassins creed iii orange edition cant wait to search for charles lee all over again this is the only reason i bought the ultimate edition of ac odyssey tbh finally this was my favourite ac game dont me so excited to see what this game is like again in hd if they mess up the blackflag remaster so help me god ubi make a new trailer and use trouble in town trust me block was op they should nerf but did they fix that ugly blue hud it looked like it was in its prealpha stage in the original version i liked the combati n that game lol why remaster this one and not the original when connor talks its so badass when the trailer was better than the actual game back then finally a good game to remaster not saying the ezio collection wasnt but the rogue was pointless a real assassins creed lmao gets downgraded ac3 is backward compatible on the xbox juan is it worth the 60 price tag theyll slap on this dinosaur of a game if it was ac2 id be hyped this is just meh cant wait for ac1 remastered who agree with me ac 3 is my favorite ac game so glad they remaster it good job ubisoft cant wait remastered yellow ubisoft please remaster far cry and far cry 2 thats how it looked from the first e3 gameplay premiere but when it launched it downgraded so now you wanna remasteredrecycle it the graphics dont look as stellar as it should compare to the recent assassins creed trilogies this game has one of the slowest intros in history it does look improved especially the lighting but also i hope the gameplay was touch here and there yellow filter and slightly better lights remastered i guess my entire childhood is really coming back why are we paying for a game we already played after re2 remake every remaster just looks sad now better than any new ac game now make a ac 4 remaster black flag was dope who else gets this for free because odyssey season pass assassin creed 4 is the best tho its remastered because it has blue light filter i feel like im 12 all again its been a long 7 years but about time i see this beautiful gem of a game get some love im not sure this one was the right call ubi out of all the other games i mean the combat was a in 3 but that was about it connor was boring the story and characters were pretty lame aside from haythem but his boss fight nudered him also the desmond arc was particularly dry in this one would have rather gotten an ac2 or brotherhood remaster cant wait i absolutely loved ac3 even though it got so much unnecessary hate miles better than odyssey wow the music on this game i remember i played this game when it was free on pc ubisoft anniversary on my laptop fps was less than probably 5 it was very bad experience now as i have ultimate edition for ac odyssey i get this for free looking forward to it my favroite one of all time just excited too much for the release oh man the remaster looks even better than i hoped cant wait the original game doesnt look the same as in those comparing clips ubisoft downgrades at it again i have a big feeling the remaster wont look as good as it does here this does put a smile on my face ubisoft if you will just listen to one of your many fans of assassins creed make a sequel following connors story please do it now please make a black flag remaster selling a thousand year old game for 50 because it has slightly better lighting you gotta be crazy to support this ubisoft dont know how to release games in a finished state so they resort to remasters awful developers the character customization in assassins creed 3 multiplayer was insane only problem were the tryhard dudes who would poison u and do 50 other things and get like 3k points when they kill you multiplayer as well wait why arent you remastering acii seriously why are ubisoft remastering all the ac games how about you just make a better fucking ac game instead of simply just remastering old games to get money from them why is everything sepia as long as they fixed desmonds back glitched out that it pokes out the back of his backpack classic ubisoft release the game with graphics that they promised after 6 years classic ubisoft release the game with graphics that they promised after 6 years will pc players who still have ac3 get it free assassins creed 3 was the best one outside of desmond mode at least the combat was awesome the soundtrack the story whats not to love well i prefer this as modmxr will make it funny and thought provoking thoughmxr is youtube gamer i love ac3 as much as the next person but wheres the change the original actually looks better than the remaster i love this game but remaster is just here look we got better lighting didnt realize how badly connor just fucking flamed achilles was that even connor doing the trailer vo or was that a fake buy the game again for another 60 now includes upgraded textures and bloom youre welcome finally this game gets the layer polish it deserves seeing some serious lighting improvements looks sick this game was one that made my childhood still loving that soundtrack dat soundtrack though woo boi gonna replay the ac where it all went wrong do assassins creed 1865 civil war one of my favorites this is right below black flag imo so they are just gonna downgrade remasteted version now ac2 and ac1 too ok add yellow bloom call it remastered got it cool but were the good new assassins creed at i play this game too much but it cool i love assassins creed i even have all the games well almost can we call acl assassins creed liberation hd hd maybe this is my chance to appreciate this gamei put 75 hours on the pc version and i think its a decent game but still one of the worst in the franchise now this is an actual remaster many say thas ac3 is the worst in the series still its my first and favorite ac and i will always remember trying to get my mom to buy it for me xd i am so happy to get it again and finish it idk why but i feel disappointed out of all of the games to remaster why did they pick iii it looks worse wtf th charcaters have no facial animations and everyone looks like they are made of rubber how much will it cost separately pls help a brother out i wonder witch legacy outfits it will have will this remaster come with some fixes for the game such as ironing out a few bugs and giving connor an actual human personality oh this music this atmosphere i hoped that they would add tessellation and displacement maps at least they could subdivide geometry and replace old models with new ones it would be cool and for who has the season pass is the 18 march first ac game i ever playedit was on wii u this is probably how the game originally would of looked like before the downgrades haha but why nobody wanted this no multiplayer the remastered graphics looks like rdr2 this is what ive been waiting for when is the game coming out the problem is i cant trust you with graphic easily my second favourite ac love it with such a strong passion such a shame the series changed so drastically after acu pretty much turned its back on what made assassins creed assassins creed i cant wait this is my favorite game guys imagine a sequel with connor and arno working together to kill shay shay could create a new faction to destroy both the templars and assassins probably be the best ac if the story is done right and have ac unity combat with ac3 finishers so weve got to the points where even mediocre games from less than 7 years ago get remastered now does this remastered version has shays and arnos story completed or is it just a change of few colours with the same old game brightnessanti aliasingbetter shadowsac 3 remastered the music is so nostalgic i used to watch my brother play this game for hours back before i got a ps3 i miss those days i swear if it dont have multiplayer if aciii can look this good so can anthem damn well done ubisoft looks miles better than the rouge remastered finally remaster that we required but not rquested why so many assassins creeds make a new watchdogs game the remastered has so much more color than the original game but the original game will always be my favorite game of all time finally an assassins creed game that have templars to kill its not for pc although i own the xbox games with gold version for the 360 really wanna pick this up who is ready to see desmond miles die again am i only one who really liked multiplayer in this game we applied orange filter naval battles are the worst thing to be added to the franchise in history and here i am waiting for a ac black flag remastered rooolll bois roolllllll the best assassins creed of all time gameplay wise imo hmmm idk about this i think ill just stick to my original ac3 unless youre gonna change the whole game from top to bottom and give it a make over like what happened with re2 which was beautiful will it have online i hope im still getting this for free with my odyssey season pass my favourite ac game ever the story for ac3 was great except for the desmond parts also the king washington dlc was even better except for fighting him at the end of the dlc my gripe is that areas around the homestead were boring and had nothing to do in them remake or remastered which one u like most ehem splinter cell ironsides spies vs mercs that is all oh hey back when you could actually assasinate people still waiting for a proper remake of the first game can the tyranny of king washington be made into a standalone game i feel that idea had so much potential to expend and create a more action driven narrative that could change the kind of america connor is creating i forgot how captivating conner was in his sincerity that when confronting achilles bitter cynicism or haythams cold pragmatism he never weavers in his noble convictions he learns of course but he never lets that wisdom lead to sorrow or indifference it just inspires him to better understand the world thanks for the reminder of this heroic assassin pc version please charles smiths great great grandpa youve had all the time in the world why not improve the story that had great potential while youre at it as well not getting excited until they announce the price this is not worth 60 compare this remaster to the resident evil 2 remaster and the difference is night and day the most i could see myself spending on this is 30 not saying that the game doesnt look better but a few tweaks just isnt enough to justify paying full price for me so hopefully they dont get greedy plz dont runied the last one i would honestly like to see an assassins creed game take place in feudal japan the shinobi were often employed to assassinate people i could see the templars a as either damyos corrupt shogun or samurai ubisoft if you read this i hope this or civil war america is next on settings for the series yeah the best ac melee combat system is back well at least it has the dlc when youre excited for this but then you remember all the abstergo nonsense you have to go through uhmmm so it still will be dipping sub 20 fps on boston because even with an overclocked core i7 2600k at 45ghz you barely maintain 30fps in that area this and black flag are the best very underrated game never understood the hate dang i remember when my mom got me this game in 2011 when i was 11 awesome game the editing of this trailer is a mess sliced between remastered and original with no box telling which is which also connor just called achilles evil wtf this is the type of remaster that they should have done for the ezio trilogy hell yes my boy connor is back after this the combat went downhill one big thing they could fix is the ending coming home remastered trailer cmon just do it the last good one nice i wish this was on the nintendo switch soo you made it brighter ac 3 was one of my favorite games in the series i know a lot of people dislike it but i loved it that ending sucked but the story was excellent i have the ultimate edition for odyssey that comes with ac3 do i still get all the dlcs and liverstion as well ok this is what assassins creed is all about not that shitty odyssey non sense when we could see black flag remastered at long last the best assassin so good to see him again while i wish we could see him play a role in more of the games a remaster of my favorite game in the franchise is still so appreciated cant wait so excited to see connor return you dont understand is this the origin story of charles from red dead 2 lol march 29 is my birthday ac3 was one of the first games i had for the ps3 pre ordered actually nani how many fools can i kill today no multiplayer sad remaster unity with all the bugs fixed that was great with the coop so they made the remastered slightly orange so what is new ubisoft just a slightly improved lighting the textures remains the same the character skins the same the shaders materials the same the characters gear also the same im sure ubisoft can do better than this this remaster is not at the level of previous assassins creed games from unity to odyssey ive seen some comments saying that it just looks like a yelloworange filter was added to those people i suggest looking beyond the new colors the textures and lighting have been completely overhauled the character models look better the trees grass and bushes all look far more detailed the shadows seem much more detailed and sharper too i believe it was actually remastered using a newer engine or the engine was overhauled you can also see the light bouncing off objects in a far more realistic and visually appealing way the game looks better in just about every way not to mention that gameplay is also being improved as it says in the description of the video back to its roots i hope they change the reloading time of the guns took forever in the original one if any assassins creed in pc became online the franchise will be died forever is ac liberation going to be included in the odyessy season pass along with ac3 this looks like a really lazy remaster if youre going to do a remaster you better have some decent graphics but this looks worse than any of the new ac ubisoft starting not being such a dck i see best fighting best weapons connor the beast one of the best assassins that is my favorite ac and also black flag cant wait connor is still my favourite assassin i am so going to listen to last of the mohicans music while playing this assassin creed game with no grindy rpg scale refreshing fantastic a stealth mode would br the perfection anyway it will be mine i remember played this game and the advantages i got was i could answer all my teacher question in class oh the memories whats the price though never saw this coming ill pick it up i never played this when it came out assassins creed 3 is the best assassins creed i remember me playing it a long time ago am i the only one that expected them to remaster 1 or 2 before any others not that 3 was bad i loved connor and you just cant beat killing redcoats still just unexpected ah i wish ezio arc aaahhhwhen assassins creed used to be good now my zoomer friends you only have to wait for ac1 remastered to experince how awesome ac used to be cannot wait any longer my fav and a true ac game finally remastered not to sound pessimistic but the remastered just looks brighter will it be on steam or epic this is when the combat actually was better and looked better finally now i only need the first one and then ill be able to play all ac games on my ps4 why assasins creed 3 not 1 hearing haythams voice again even ubisoft will find a way to mislead you with a games graphics with a remastered game video game in 2012 this looks very good that graphics tho after 6 years in ubisoft ey guys i have a good idea we will remaster ac3 clapping we will just adjust brightness and make better shadows clapping intensifies guys if this will cost 15 dolars and up then i am out well time to buy the odyssey season pass i literally cant tell the difference between the two side by side except for the orange tint i have the original but never got around to really play it ill definitely be looking forward to jump on this for sure i love remasters remake assassins cread ii plzi jsut dont like origin and odysseys style i loved this game but the combat system felt a bit slow and not very smooth also in the game connor doesnt look as awesome as in the trailer i loved this game but the combat system felt a bit slow and not very smooth also in the game connor doesnt look as awesome as in the trailer so they changed the lighting and added anisotropic filtering even though it looks better i dont think this compressed trailer is doing the technical upgrades justice cant wait for dfs video on it better then origins and odyssey much better music too wait if yo get the season pass in idyssey you will get two remasted games with a dlc thats fucking awsome it was only graphical improvements i guess i thought they changed everything including parkour lol but i guess its better than nothing or odyssey lol but does it have battle royal did ya guys also remaster the monstrosity that is keybinds in ac 3 so an enb thats it ubisoft you did it again disappointment wow they added lighting well this is underwhelming its literally the same game but with a yellow filter on oh my favourite of the assassins trilogy original and orange hopefully people can see the greatness now of what this game was making ac2 remastered is good idea imo what about 1 and 2 im confused same game engine graphics were almost the same in all games till unity came out i like ac 3 but ac 4 remaster would make me truly happy i like ac 3 but ac 4 remaster would make me truly happy2 this is true assassins creed not that rpg stuff ubisoft is pushing lately i like ac 3 but ac 4 remaster would make me truly happy ac3 is my favorite assassins creed im definitely getting the remaster ac3 remaster splinter cell blacklist please got the ac odyssey season pass now im just waiting this is the only ac game i havent played looking forward to it fortnite assassins creed need for speed grand theft autoplayers i heard rumors that there would be a version for the switch any truth to this money grab training sequences in the starting part of game is boring though desmonds death hit me hard its really hard to go back to the old ac games with the buttons they use i just tried rogue and coming from odyssey and origins i had to stop playing not bad ubisoft not bad at all can we get assassin creed 5 cuz i dont know if theres such thing so dont yell at me guys but i never seen a number 5 on one of the titles maybe rogue was five i dont know anymore got more hyped about this than when i first saw odyssey yeah good thing i didnt get the season pass this looks like a very marginal improvement to an average game do they remaster the shitty follow undetected missions apex legends remastered is looking great rathonhakeiton catch lee wait liberation comes with aciii i already have it got it with the ultimate edition for odyssey but have been too busy with rdr2 to play it lol will give it a try eventually anyway so its the same game with an instagram filter i hated ac3 and its ending shame i am so hapy this is the best ac im not crying their just a bowl of onionswho put this here hook a brotha up for his birthday omg i hope theyll put his forsaken speech in i played this at max setings on pc cmon this looks like they just added sepia filterlol time to waste money on a game again somehow i find connor is the most relatable character in the whole franchise connor need a sequel and we allneed another open world pirate game dont tell me skulls and bones so excited ac3 had the best hand to hand combat out of the series the game that introduced me to the series finally remastered cant wait cant wait but wish ac2 and brotherhood got remastered on pc too or atleast a patch to fix the awful shadow and lod quality not a big assassin creed fan but it seems like something is always happening with assassins creed definitely copping this im so ready for this now we only need an ac1 remaster and then ill be able to play the desmond trilogy on ps4 will season pass owners get this and with this ill never buy a assassins creed again assassins creed 3 dues ex edition finally assassins creed please but is online gonna be available tho skyrim special edition treatment just a reshade mod ported to the game lol the game that killed ac and desmond love this game mate its the best assassins creed out there will the combat and stealth be changed as much as i liked this game those two areas could use some tweaking to make the game a little more challenging i loved the naval missions and connors story though i guess black flag is next so let me ask you something ubisoft did you at least fix the bug where only half my outfit is dyed in cutscenes personally this is the best and my favorite assassins creed game yeah the ezio trilogy is awesome yeah i know connor isnt anything like ezio ezio will always have a special place in my heart but 3 has pretty much every single thing we love in the other games the brotherhood system is far better than it was in ac brotherhood and lets not forget that this game was the one that introduced the navel combat we love in black flag my only question is what took you so long ubisoft either way im really excited finally a real ac game the last ac game where the story matters omg i cant wait one of the bezt ac games been puttinf this off fot ages in wait for the remastered version ac i should be remastered more then what i expected i recently bought assassins creed odyssey ultimate edition because you get this game for free if you have the ac odyssey season pass and game so like but it again thank you very much but i think ive had enough forests and trees to last me a lifetime oh god its here this is visually stunning and im so excited to replay it in an even greater quality to my nongamer friends that love the ac franchise is the same i think its just a filter yo please answer this for me is this gonna be its on game or are we forced to buy season pass from odyssey cuuuzz i dont have that kind of money seriously only on playstation and xbox seriously only on playstation and xbox im actually excited for that because i love the ezio collection and i love black flag but assassins creed 3 was always the one piece of the puzzlestory that was missing so i cant abit to buy it no switch no party this must be the laziest remastered work i ever seen in a game i mean this compared to resident evil 2 and other games is a joke so disappointed i was expecting a origins graphic or unity at least they just fix the lighting wow ubisoft great job i never asked for this but i will take it xd the question is did they just change the color tone from greyish to orangeish and bumped up the resolution still looks like a downgraded ac unity graphics wise not gameplay for the village idiots reading this comment thought i meant the other way around if anyone over at ubisoft reading this this is what assasins cree is this is what it needs to be again rpg is great but we want the more linear balls to the walls approach this series always had it has its charm i never played ac 3 before now im definitely going to buy it ive got the assassins creed odyssey gold edition and i cannot wait to jump back into desmond and connor good story better graphics optimised graphics more lighting good to go this is the most disappointing ac game next to unity i am here just waiting for that last entry on splinter cell man i cant wait to play as charles d what happens if we own the original civil war era ac3 was my 3rd favorite in the series right behind black flag and brotherhood cant wait to replay this d i didnt see the difference they should make 2 image exactly the same and remove this trail which take to much place in the middle of the screen edit 036 is not very bad for see the difference because its pretty much the same in the 2 screen how much why i found the original better than that yellow background that they call remastered smh will this have physical copies in the us we still have no ac rogue remastered physical copies so hold up yall remaster the worst and most boring one doa the frontier in the remastered looks way better than in the original if shay cormac and edward kenway are not mentioned the remastered would be a shame assassins creed 3 is probably my favourite game and now im very happy will shay cormac be mentioned or show up in this remastered version cant wait am i the only one who thinks conner is one of the most underrated assassins in the series it said the game was in the ac odessey ultimate edition will i get it early or something wait this is just coming out the lighting looks beautiful seems like ubisoft went to the bethesda school of god rays wow if only they would have done this with ac rogue this looks incredible this game is going to be worth it maybe in this version connor will be likable but in all seriousness it looks like the biggest difference is a bigger focus on lighting im ready lets go i liked it as it was back then but this is great and epic as expected from ubisoft and please we need a prince of persia plz plz the game that helped me pass us history 3 years after the ezio collection got released ac3 gets a remastered but no thanx i liked ac3 but hated the ending to desmonds story this game isnt really my cup of tea but i guess it looks good i would have loved an acbf remaster but i guess ill wait for that good job ubi i may cop only because i miss this combat in ac games assassins creed 3 was the absolutely the best they never outdid this game imo ac4 syndicate unity rogue all stand in its shadow no switch version really they shouldve truly remastered it like the resident evil 2 1980 to resident evil 2 2019 i miss when i could 1 vs 100 and assassinate them one by one cuz dank smoke u guys can make something else instead of remastering games remastered a different time of day still cant get in to the new ac games havent played more than 45 hours of one since unity never liked syndicate or origins especially i really hope the games controls are improved to be on par with aciv remastered is yellow good job ubi how about remastering rainbow six no maybe rainbow six 3 vegas aaaahh nevermind oh look when assassins creed was good i feel like im the only person in existence who enjoyed the first game the most please make a remaster just for me d its games like these that made me love the ac series after black flag the series died to me ill get it at some point for sure but not on d1 cause on march 28th is the mk11 beta and a few weeks later its the release but ill definitely buy it ill save judgement until ive actually played it but it looks from this like a lazy remaster if you could even call it that but well see be fun to play again anyway whats good with the multiplayer tho assassins creed 3 was my entry into the game seeing it remastered is a true treasure to me thank you ubisoft a black flag ac iv remaster please no doubt i will re play this one kudos for your work i think best ac is ac1 with legend altair so sad they didnt remastered miss altair and ezio it looks so beautiful it brings a tear to my eye new ground textures new trees and a new color filter all for 60 das a no from me dawg ubisoft you just have to remaster black flag and rogue man time to help george washington again remember far cry 3 classic edition seriously you call this a remaster i call it colour grading im beyond stoked assassins creed 3 is my favorite game in the franchise id give my biggest chin for a sequel imagine an old grizzled shay vs a more reserved connor where is desmond doesnt make a difference a remaster wont make it a good game wasnt rogue remastered i liked it quite a bit even tho i didnt get to play much just looks like a yellow filter is added ac3 had the best gameplay and 2nd best protagonist to ezio plz remaster this the tomahawk is back i cant wait for this i will delete every other game on my console to get this early ubisoft were going to remaster the least popular ac game for you puts on a brown filter on it waist of a remaster just out of curiosity is it possible to side with the british very good i hope add more gore blood bad no add nudity but looks great the remaster needs a remaster of assassins 1 include in the remaster of assassins 1 bloodeline too looks like joss whedon was here with his orange filter its just more orangethats it but is the multiplayer back tho is there no multiplayer i cant freaking wait cant wait best assassins creed remastered hell yeah one of my favs dont me ok ubisoft im just need to kill charles lee 2 times soooo does this mean we get multiplayer this actually looks like a decent remaster ok ubisoft i see you the desmond ending was bad but man everything else in this game was great wondering though will it have the multiplayer and please remaster ac4 black flag was my second favorite after this one then comes origins did you just add a piss filter and call it a day will there be an option to play as one of the most beloved natives elizabeth warren wow looks good enough for a replay one of the best ac storys told yet also could you please make a ac galactic space adventure that would be amazing ala mass effect can we get ac rogue 2 or something coz i want to find out what happened to shay switch version when 30 or 60fps omg yeeeessss thank you ubisoft the original one looks way to pixelated on my huge tv thank you are the zillion bugs from ps3 remastered for ps4 and xbone too ubishite crappy game one of the worst from the series selling for ships on full price ill pass with pleasure worse ac along with unity can you guys make a second ubisoft to iterate on unity i loved the direction that was going this game has no shortage of questionable design choices but it is easily the most fascinating entry of the entire series for me the little quirks just made me want to dive further into it to discover its entirety uplay nuked my save file for the original sadly hopefully i can finally 100 the game this time i hope the combat will be better that the original why am i more excited for this than odyssey and origins i also forgot how in love with that theme i was when this first came out yeessss the music d better aim and stealth por favor best ac game come at me was this included in the season pass from ac odessey i wonder how much theyre not telling us you know ubisoft shows one thing in a trailer and when the game comes out they do another i hope its not just a graphical upgrade some bug fixes and gameplay improvements would be nice to hell yeah im actually hyped for this lol i would be interested in a true sequel to ac3 with connor that takes place during the war of 1812 imagine meeting historical figures like andrew jackson james madison and francis scott key okay i guess ill play this game again for the 4th time this is literally the same game but with a instagram filter cool personally ac 3 was one of my favorites and these just brings joy to me no switch best assassins creed game we need prince of persia new game please princeofpersia great job ubisoft but if i have assassins creed 3 on steam will this be like an update or something or will i have to buy it again i dont know what this trailer is in 1080p but if you want full 4k go to the ubisoft italy channel they have it at 4k and it is beautiful the most underrated one by far and arguably one of the best oh yeah and it had the best soundtrack i still say the desmond ending was cheap and halfassed since this is such a big file its taking its damn time to process to hd give it a while and it should be all good eventually i know this is some 8 months past reupload idk when the stream was recorded but thank you for the upload enjoyed it a lot omg its still terrible game basically i hate assassins creed 3 assassins creed liberationi dont know which one is the worsthonestly not being horrible but does ur gf ever shut upp xd craziest thing about this was how fast you type i cant even think that fast this ranga is annoying the shit outta me ik this was 6 months ago but i hate how they dont give a fuck about the game please dont speak about origins i ordered it a week ago on uplay and it still hasnt shown up in my library they really need to patch the characters face textures in this game it looks like a game in prealpha with the least intensive modelstextures to save on performance 102252 they are both so dead and sick of this game assassins creed 3 was a really nice game i dont know why people hate it why did you do it why subject yourself to this game in one sitting the thought of me playing this fucking game again haunts me so i especially would not beat it in one sitting i dont even do that with actual good games can u talk about the fucking game not about others the girl is fucking annoying james punches rum tit with a in one beer hand the other in and 72701 what has anyone seen the footage of the alpha ac3 build man that game looked cool honestly i think alexander hamilton would have made a better protagonist for an ac game during the american revolution game wouldnt be half as bad if you didnt play half the game as haytham 3 hours into a near 12 hour stream buddy do you even math 43140 wasnt there a cutscene where connor goes to ask about charles lee and meets john pitcairn and benjamin church he was so smashed by the end lol 32835 that shay imitation man do they have a swear jar this was one big playthrough one thing this game does is show the british being easy to take out like we was weak in this war but in reality we dominated the first part still connor could one shot kill us its honestly stupid my father and grandfather are free masons but he wont tell me what they do also black flag is the best just my opinion i bought ac3 remastered as i played the original i named my save file nomultiplayer inb4 you and your girlfriend hate this game because you and your girlfriends side lost the war this game is set in wrong killing connor and haytham changing his ideal is lackluster idea which would be a disservice to the whole game and story thank you just demonstrated how less you understand ac last minute change up of main character for cheap twist level is amateur level grateful you dont write games tell me by upvotes who wants a forsaken stand alone hey if your brain was as big as shauns your eyes would be bugging out too haha drunk james and elva playing this game is such a good combination i love elvas reactions shes just dont know what is going on but she still like ahhhhohhhhyeahhhhh can u pls sub to magic assassin pls thank u i fully agree with you about ac3 but i dont hate it quite as much because i enjoy ruralnatural settings in ac games as much as urban settings also i enjoyed the naval combat because of the slower more cumbersome movement compared to black flag which made it feel more immersive to me although still not nearly as fun i also enjoyed how the assassin recruits worked in this game and although the individual commands for them didnt matter much and they act more like generic mercenaries than assassins its still something and better than not having them at all also i liked that the hunting was a little bit more challenging for some animals in this game than black flag and the more open setting of the frontier worked better for the ai overall i think ac syndicate is a worse game the weird casual tone of the writing ruins everything and makes it my least favorite ac story almost everything felt like a chore except for the gang outposts which got repetitive quickly using carr the game doesnt have awful writing though it has a better story than syndicate and odyssey combined connor wasnt a bad character by all means hes been through a lot in his past thats why is character is so stoic n short tempered as a kid he watched his mother die in front of his face n his people wiped out by british colonizers did you really played this game stright through achilles mentioning ezio makes me miss him hes my favorite character 20915 the wound is gone 65402 hehehe connors hood is still on in this cutscene why does she hate the game both of them apparently heres an idea when you have to save that one guy that is apparently slipping cause the ropes to wet just dont save him just stand there and see how long it takes before he falls to his death if at all 91315 it seems your tongue has tasted sour grapes i swear everytime they both stream the talk about burgers and mcdonalds your sister is annoying i know you dont like or even hate this game but i really love it it was my first acplayed all of them now and i just want to say thank you for uploading this playtrough gonna grab mine next week gosh there is way too much pride in you james im waiting to re get it for when its 30 what i dont understand is why you play a game you dont like for over 12 hours its mad but thank you for doing it maybe the whole reason that the animus doesnt change mohawk to english is because it doesnt understand it coz its vernacular like if alexa struggles to understand my northern ireland accent surely it could the same for the animus lol i thought you died in your sleep glad to know you live for another day ayee there it is this stream was really good and funny especially when james only said epic gamer thank you for doing this stream it really makes my day saying that it was my favorite ac also you never answered my first question correctly who did u play as in the modern day story in ac 4 thank keep up the good work wheres the multipayer godammit ubisoft only good part of this game sad i missed it live but fuck it just come back to your channel after a while good to see youre still grinding dude congrats youve come along way man you are such a hardworking youtuber for streaming the whole game for 12 hours and i appreciate your dedication for your longer streams just try to get some sleep because the body and mind needs to rest from all that the chick seams overly harsh and negative been waiting for this time to call sick into work and watch this for the next 12 hours is it me or is it only in 360p i have a stiffy first haha but still missions are more important so this is the galactic empire grand army have you seen any jedi still loading gonna come back who plays these things the same game reskinned over and over for more than a decade god bless this review i really want them to remaster ac4 i got ac 3 remastered for my nintendo switch and its fantastic on it they could fix the character models or the face graphics is by adding more facial features like facial hair pimples freckles and fix the lighting on the faces instead of it just looking like claydoh masked redcoats now attack in triple combos similar to officers controls are more wonky and do not flow i got it for free because i bought a ac odyssey bundle on play station 504 whats this slavery slatt they shouldve kept the original cutscenes and new gameplay views i always loved this game also was always a fan of american revolution times and movies like the patriot very glad i got it free with odyysey on my xbox one s is it worth it thats up to you go watch other videos on the original release waste of 12 minutes i noticed that when you are being chased by guards the game doesnt slow down was being chased by a lot of guards and it didnt slow down at all i think that ubisoft will make ac 4 black flag remasterd they need to do remakes and stop with these remasters i never liked ubisoft idea of a remastered edition cod does it right when the light works well in coyotes it honestly gives me rdr2 vibes huh these are some geniunely good changes too bad they couldnt remaster connor to have a personality nice i forgot how good the music was that jor impression is still great is this for ps4 too these companys need to go back to school and actually learn what true business is because somebody is doing something that have ruined these type of content why does this guy need almost 2 minutes to talk about bullshit got it for free on a 75 off odyssey deluxe edition its downloading now im excited i played the remastered and didnt like it because of the controls switching weapons and the slow as balls reloading i dont know maybe its because im use to odyssey but ac 3 is doo doo can u choose to use the hood or not the main reason people complained about aciii is because people kept comparing it to the ezio trilogy that came before it now while i absolutely adore ezio and all three of his ac games i didnt have any issues with moving on from that story and onto connors journey i personally really enjoyed aciii both for the change of location the twist at the beginning the story and even connor himself who i happen to quite like i didnt buy aciii remastered but i did buy ac odyssey ultimate edition when it was on a really good sale for around 38 so i got aciii remastered as an added bonus im not sure how well the game has aged but ill definitely be having a go with the remastered version more out of nostalgia more than anything else not only for the reasons already mentioned but also because ac iii was one of the very first pc games i played after finally getting a gaming pc after many years of playing games only on consoles so every ac game previous to aciii had been on xbo did they patched those horrible textures the new stuff dont work well when trying to do full sync use any new stuff it messes u up so basically ubicock saw an oppertunity to fix a broken game and make you pay for it fucks blinding white load screens i purchased it exclusively for liberation id like to see an assassins creed 1 remaster but include more variety in the setup phases like the pc version but maybe 2 or 3 more options for gathering information on your target 1023 lol whole heartedly agree dude alexios being cannon wouldve made a lot more sense 132 cuz you gotta hear it again this remaster is a piece of shit the original ac 2 looked way more realistic im pretty sure if you go down to a very sunny area it wouldnt look this ugly bright and orange this is a literal downgrade the only upgrades are the hud ive played this through twice i have been waiting to catch it on sale and now is the time i can not wait to enjoy this masterpiece this time in 4k this time i plan to 100 it top 10 game all time for me like that little joeraptor impersonation 1010 my favorite ac game ever but i hate the stupid time machine or whatever its called part wait wut he killed shay and he has jacobs robes wait did connor travel into the future you know what i just dont understand how he has these robes they should have fixed some of the dialogue patched laughs in cracked will a fishzy laserezz collaboration ever happen i would love to see a complete rehaul remaster of the first assassins creed and i dont mean a remaster like assassins creed three but i want to see a remaster like infinity ward did with modern warfare remastered where they completely tore down the old graphics and made it look like it came out on ps4xbox one are we not going to talk about those god awful horse models those horses from the original game were the things of nightmares brotherhood horses were on point not sure why they had to shorten their tails and give them overly long necks should i get this game for christmas feel free to suggest better ac games for the ps4 450 straight up ps2 era models lmfao great job ubisoft it doesnt feel like a remastered when the clothes have really bad bugs that turns all the outfits completely black its the reason why i stopped playing it hopefully they remaster assassins creed unity when its 10 bucks ill get it lol talking is a lot infos are few you earned a sub and i actually own the game myself and i think they have made good gameplay improvements and a lot more better parkour stuff and youre right indoor scenes looks fuced up to be honest the main reason why i got the remastered edition was in fact liberation i never had a chance to play it since i didnt have ps vita in the country i live liberation was never released on ps3 i bought this game digitally i bought the season pass but it doesnt show that ac 3 is installing good review but you can get the odessy anual pack now till sept 1 for 25 half price all dlcs pluse 3 remasterd with all dlcs thats pretty good for 25 heres something they could of updated the stupid maps i bought 4 both i loved the culture i wanna know where to buy it again ps4 or switch please give me your opinion thank you is it worth it yes if they can just removed all modern time shit im sorry but i think i might be the only person who genuinely wasnt interested in the setting off ac iii its just personally iv seen and learned about the american revolution and when i first started to play it the first time my mind would always go through what i learned and kinda picked somethings apart its a good assassin creed game but i wish it was at a set in a different time its the same with unity the french revolution was boring thats why i really feel like a assassin creed time zone shouldnt be biased in a recorded time event like and assassin the story should keep a low profile they should see famous figures not meet them i really love the smoothness and many gameplay features of ac origins but i wish they would return to the vintage combat unity probably did combat best but running into a camp as conor and taking out 30 men with a tomahawk never gets old way more realistic too then the trash they have now i bought the game on ps3 but never worked im thinking about trying this one out what yall think i never finished the original ac lll so i bought it loved it yet the original is still my favorite what i remember i hated most about this game was when using any other outfit other than connors base one the arrow quiver would not be on his back just the bow and it annoyed me so much lol is this fixed in the remaster does it still have all the little bugs that were in the original only worth it if you buy the gold edition of ac odyssey which i got it for only 42 lets talk about killstreaks with connor they put great detail in his combat throughout the years cause once you start playing as the adult connor you cant do killstreaks but after some time flies by and connor finally becomes an assassin he can do killstreaks and all kinds of other stuff he wasnt able to do before the only bad thing they need to fix with viewpoints is the fact after you synch with the viewpoint it keeps playing the little tune the viewpoint plays it gets annoying after awhile remaster is shitpeople check steam ac3 remastered have bad rating the models look different ie ugly af because they werent updated whilst the rendering method was this means that materials like their skin react differently to for example light the once gorgeous looking models look abysmal in these often overlit environments just take a look at how evorexposed they are when you stand next to a window and compare it to the original originally the game was much darker the shadows covered more than half of their faces just like in the godfather movies edit what the developers can do to make them look fine are 2 things add details to the models eyelashes eyebrows increase the geometry of the mesh etc or manually tweak the lighting for each cutscene this is what theyve done in odyssey for story heavy scenes instead of using the global lighting settings they did a bit of magic and suddenly everything looked better on the closeup shots it was done organically most people who played that game probably didnt even recognised the chan what is it with remasters having worse faces than the original it happened with the arkham games and now with assassins creed i have never played the original assassins creed 3 but i really enjoyed the assassins creed 3 remaster it was interesting i still to this day really enjoyed assassins creed black flag i really think that was the best one i have played i also like odyssey as well thats my second favorite gamewish rouge didnt have such a short story though they were really on to something with that game i liked playing the game from a templars perspective for once the thing i miss most about old ac is multiplayer tbh im assuming its not here i love ac3 love what the remaster has done but the face improvements are a gamebreaker for me 132 was that jorraptor that was sick i loved ac 13 and liberations then i stopped caring after that i bought for liberation because i never was able to play it i thought assassins creed 3 was good period as it was i mean the faces from brotherhood looked way better than the remastered anyone else not able to save a game did you know about assassins creed iii liberation in the game connor appears in a mission well ac 2 remastered i would actually buy i didnt like the gameplay of the original but i got it free with odyssey so i might check it out one more time personally i enjoyed this game its not the best in the franchise but its what got me into it i love the remaster but understand why people hate the story btw they fixed the faces ive tried soo many times to like this game i was so disappointed with it back when it came out ac4 however was a blast i feel like this game was just a prototype for 4 tbh the original is better if you got this for free because you bought assassins creed odyssey season pass then its worth it but if you have to buy this game separately then just stick to the original its not worth it to buy the same game again on steam for almost 40 looks good shame the time period was a downright bore i really want to buy this game cus i love the original ac 3 but there is some thing i didnt like in the original i need to ask you guys who already bought it 1 did i still need to manualy navigate through the tunnel just to unlock a f fast travel 2did the vantage point unlock all the section of the map after we syncronise it or its just tiny circle around the vantage point and we still need running around to fully open the map 3how long the loading screen compare to original 1022 there is ear rape fore warning all of you you made fun of jorrraptor in your intro thank you for that one time i was asked him a question about his video on twitter he was so disrespectful about it he indirectly called me an idiot omfg that jor raptor though lmfao why does arons legacy outfit not look anything like his robes master assassin or not so like how did they mess ho the face textures who even let that pass imo liberation is better because it does away with the modern descendant back and forth whereas the liberation game keeps you in the past what about the fast travels that took longer than running there did they fix it this game is a nightmare to control i feel like the graphics is a bit better than the rogue remastered anyone im gonna answer that in my way yes the faces look worse and not everything is remastered at all but its still the best one out there in my opinion the combat is very good and at the same time very frustrating and that gives this game character the story is amazing even tho it is a bit wonky with the connor was in every event type of themelike for example the boston tea party like really he was there to toss tea into the ocean lol but anyway i loved it the economical part was my favorite thing in the whole game d being able to go from zero to hero felt amazing building up inventory to sell it and build new things to sell or even new transports and transport options like first you start with only a carriage and a carriage driver and some basic goods to sell in the time i progressed to get a ship to export goods with i had earned about 1500 ingame that was satisfying as hell d and after some well spent time planning and building up inventory i was basically r the only minus is the faces pros to getting ac3 remastered all dlcs two in one they did their best to make the game look up to date visually and fun nostalgic times and of course the down side whichs for u only understand that is the narrative get out of here i hated this game when it came out butt the remaster is much better and i say if u want to try it again or for the first time go for it but thats just me kill connor club i feel attacked definitely getting this for my switch when it comes out they took out almost all the gore now the dialogue almost never syncs with mouth movements not to mention now mouths almost never move and the faces are horrible and look like you are playing oblivion lol while its definitely not my favorite i still prefer ac3 over ac4 can they just overhaul and remaster black flag i hate that too afyer synchronising with a area i end up falling to death connor is my close second favorite assassin right under ezio so much depth to the character and i think he was the perfect protagonist for the story that ac iii decided to tell great parralels and thematic connections between connor and haytham love those two characters am i the only one who thinks the the overwhelmingly orange filter they put on looks really bad why didnt they make it more colourful i dont want to feel like im im walking around in an industrial smog area uhh comparison then vs now scenes wouldve helped a lot very good video finally someone who talks about the improvements instead of criticizing the faces for 10 minutes keep up your great work greetings from germany excellent i just have to get odessy and the season pass works for me cheaper i literally bought this for liberation it was eh i agree with your ranking video im playing unity next then brotherhood i just fully completed black flag can you take the bow off when changing outfits well 023 after his bs theme song lol the crynation graphic mod is a lot better for me it too fucking orange everywhere i would rather take the bad original ac3 the game still sucks though remember spiderman 3 the game remember how terrible it looks these characters look like that the review for what its worth starts at 220 this so weirded i remember when ac3 came out originally it was a big disappointment and a let down everyone hated conor as a character and that ending ehh just pisses me of thinking about it but man the opinion of this this game has really changed in last few year ah well at least the remaster looks good ive experienced more bugs in the remaster than i did in the original so no bug fixes that were left unpatched from the original horses been blocked on roads in the wild like there is an invisible wall mouths not moving to dialogue enemy ai suddenly attacking for no reason in the streets there are more that i cant think of as its been so long since i last played it but i do remember it having a lot of bugs they should just have remastered the first assassin creed instead kentway trilogy was better than the ezio trilogy period until if they ever fix the faces i wont touch it looks like absolute shitttttttttttttt i had fun with it but still had some janky moments and a weird outfit glitch where all of the original outfits were literally all black some of the gameplay flow improvements i noticed were changing some of the more tedious main objectives to optional ones i think ill wait until they patch things up with the faces janky looking cut scenes id rather pay for a complete remaster not just some improvements here and there while other things are sacrificed 133 was that him doing a jorraptor immitation this games intro kinda feels more slow and boring than red dead 2s the faces of the pedestrian are awful but i get to kill red coats too bad they dont infinitely spawn i got to be honest i dont understand why so many people love this game aside from the cool setting i think its one of the most boring ac titles which bums me out even more since im from boston the game just felt way too restricteded which is the last thing you want from an open world game aside from the main story the side missions are just collecting different items whether it be feathers chest or pieces of paper i just dont understand what people see in this game especially when you consider that gta 5 came out just 8 months after this game i thought the horses would get a better remaster but i guess not i only got it for the multiplayer yeah i know i bought gold i feel like it was an okay buy im happy with it the only assassins creed i can say that i just really didnt care for is syndicate its also the only one ive never actually completed i dont know why but i just couldnt get into it why would they remaster a version of the series thats horrible still rather play this than odyssey i loved ac3 the first time round so i really enjoyed playing it again something you didnt mention is the included dlc i didnt play that until this remaster its so good the glitches are still there by the way i can go through locked gates in the underground like a ghost the bad thing with the visual update is that colonial america was very brown grey and muddy these visual updates is like unitys visuals where those visuals worked cus paris was a colorful city but not colonial america it should be darker and grittier like it was the only thing you didnt talk about does the altair costume still sticks to the legs this game on the ps4 is a literal fuck remaster unity so i can ball w my bros wish i could sub again just for that impersonation does this game support 219 lol got this for free through a file share i only liked the assassins creeds with ezio and desmond tbh so this completes my ps4 collection since they released the ezio games a while back dont want to spend 40 no problem turn on game mode on your asus display i found it to be very buggy and glitchy often in combat the red warning doesnt appear the camera gets stuck after i slip under fences and enemies get stuck in the fences and when i want to stumble them sometimes it doesnt work and then they get a free hit on me i find it so annoying and it happens more often in the dlc looks worse than the original nice whoopsie ubisoft if anyones watching this a week later you can get assassins creed odyssey ultimate edition for 46 which means you save a lot of money not only on ac3 remastered but you also save a lot of money on the season pass too d xbox one though d haha i thought u were really jorraptor there for a second love it and its beautiful in 4k yea their faces look a little wierd but thats because they are enhancing what they already had not completely rebuilding the game from the ground up if u take a pixelated picture and view it with a 4k tv screen its gonna look even shittier than if u were viewing it on 1080 p screen people dont know the difference between a remaster and a remake in my opinion this is the best asassins creed remaster they have done yet they put alot of work into it and really improved the game the other remasters were just ported for nextgen consoles i didnt notice much for differences from original in the those but there are a few goodness those faces would be game breaking for me i never liked wearing legacy outfits outside unity because the ends of the tails of the robes were always stuck to your fucking ankles the same thing happened in the arkham remasters with downgraded face textures batman now looks like hes made of melting plastic with resting bitch face i hope they eventually remaster ac1 kinda surprised they havent yet would love to see altair with todays graphics how can anyone buy this we need to stop being sheep and demand better it makes me sad that this is acceptable as a remaster at all ac 3 brightered what did you hate about ac 3 when it was first released well i did bought it for liberation only and its def worth it im a little butthurt they didnt add the speech at the end theyre just gonna remaster every one but the first one huh i want assassins creed unity remastered they made the game look worse like the textures are better but ehh poop bitches cant play this bro the faces ugh remasters for pc should be patches im buying this for liberation tbh thank for taking the time to judge the remaster based on more the faces unlike the comment section of all graphics comparison videos ive seen i loved ac 3 and i missed out on liberation so this remaster is a must buy for me did they tone down the linear sections at all it took me almost an hour to complete that final chase in the original due to the linear path bs i couldnt tell if you got jorraptor for that joke or if your impression is just that good i loved liberation personally still this review is great 222 to get to the actual review i bought it for both did they unkill desmond no well fuck also really disappointed about ezios robes in this game those robes have no physics and you can see conors feet going through the stiff cloth when running but of course all the other robes work just fine the faces look like plastic dude i be honest as much as i wanna like this remastered the character models take me right out of the fucking game too off putting just download the crynation graphics mod for the original that me made me laugh so hard haha 1015 the faces look like as if the graphics havent loaded yet i actually clicked this because i was only interested in liberation aw im buying it for liberation tho because its set in my city lol i collect anything new orleans and i needed liberation in my nola videogame collection my only problem with the remaster was the running i couldnt figure it out i held down r2 and all connor would do was a mild jog until i found out that i had to go above and beyond and use all my strength and hold r2 even harder for him to sprint but did they fix the outfit color glitch xd in original game you could dye your robes but in cutscenes they would glitch and theyd be partly the custom color you got and partly the standard creamblue color this was such a scam lol i think ive died in that same exact synchronization in the video today playing the game no matter what your opinion its a fact that ac3 has always had the smoothest combat system they literally did a comparison the counterkills get choppier in black flag and are fucking horrible in rogue the freerunning also is shittier in black flag and disgusting in rogue its way better in this remaster though its still not as good as the parkour in unity or syndicate ac3 also has the most brutal kills easiest weapon system and the storyline of starting as a templar and then playing as his native american son who has to kill his own father along with his colleagues whom are your allies in the beginning is nothing short of brilliant and i dare someone to tell me which ac has a better plot than that besides ac2 also why is there an ac3 remaster but theres not a remaster for the original yet a remaster of the first assassins creed could make that game look gorgeous so basically everythings better except the water graphics and cutscenes got destroyed somehow and nobody at ubisoft noticed i also dont think its worth 40 for a shinier version of a game released just 7 years ago given the butchering of the cutscenes its at most 30 ill take gameplay improvements over cutscene improvements i dont care about faces unlike the likefishers who are so eager to jump on the bandwagon ubisoft remastered ezio trilogy rogue ac3 and liberation but no assassins creed 1 whats next assassins creed bloodlines hd i was wondering if youd touch on connors subtle whitewashing but im guessing that that can be chalked up to oh god the faces another question is it worth 40 for a rehash of an old game with new graphics and minimal improvements one of my biggest issues with the remastered is that some of the upgraded textures on the outfits ends up making the outfits look worse one of my personal favorites the jamestown outfit aka the white and red for connors original instead of being just white and red now the chest is like almost a gray which ticks me off but at least it is a assassins creed game and not an action rpg game with assassins creed elements i thought they might have altered some of the 100 sync objectives to make them less jarring stuff like the dont shove anyone bollocks overall though im enjoying the remaster guys on steam if you buy assassins creed odyssey ultimated edtion for 50 you get assassins creed 3 for free so it worth it i also killed the bear which then made me think for a second it glitched because it was still telling me to escape the bear jorraptors intro caught me of guard i only played assassins creed 3 for a short period of time way back in the day cant wait to finish it now i still cant play it every time there is snow the game just crashed after 5 mins the characters look like they staring intensely i agree with the faces but also what is up with the sub titles why are they so big is that a personal choice did they fix it where you can keep your hood on after beating the game another thing with the hud you forgot to mention is that when you are on a quest it will now always show you objective in the top left hand corner they should do this for ac 1 they also added alot less hardware support and more crashes i have jumped off so much high shit in this game forgetting the whole no fall damage from odyssey wasnt a thing in this game haha kill connor club makes a full playthrough of this shit game proceds to tell that its not worthy after spending 11h oh the irony and fanboyism sorry to dissapoint but i have to say it xd i did buy it for the liberation remaster not for that alone but liberation is one of my faves in the series and 3 might as well be my favorite or brotherhood but brotherhood hasnt aged well at all i do kinda wish for an ac1 full on remaster i like how it shows the different colors on his robes is the uplay mission included i replayed the part 133 100x times that was hilarious i was halfhoping they would just add the connor speech cutscene that they cut out from the original and that would be it id have been satisfied honestly i kinda want assassins creed to go back to the older style of games that arent stat based rpgs and more stealth and social stealth based with combat that isnt just knock off easy dark souls and actual cities rather than just fields and hills and shit with the freerunning mechanics of unity or syndicate a question if i want to desable the free aimi can or is from the game cuz i played the original version and lock aim is more easy to me i love the ideaits my fav ac game nice work from ubi its free for me though so i dont care x also after playing rogue i must say i kinda agree with most of the templars motives in this game would still love a crouch button for 3 and 4 can imagine it would be pretty easy as its just the same animation as conner edward does in leaves and grass where is charles lee i guess i am the odd one lol i never played assassins creed three i did however play assassins creed liberation i played it on the ps vita and i really didnt joy it so playing assassins creed three will be awhole new experience for me i would like to see them do a remaster of black flag did anyone else laugh when he walked into the printer shop got rejected cause he was broke and then sadly walked away 1152 have they fixed the crafting system it always blocked the first time when you used it i have massive graphical flickering in new york the new walls or the bricks in it looks really wierd and are likely to cause epileptic seizure on someone its like it goes from black to white to black very fast anyone else experience this playing on ps4 pro been playing brotherhood for the last couple days so much nostalgia such a shame what became of assassins creed still not a good remasterthe graphical updates could have improved more theirs one problem with this remaster that i hope they fix there is a glitch with the snow the background starts glitching and people say the swords they buy disappears then reappear at random i thought that was actually joraptor that was scarily good worth buying just for the improved weapon wheel im enjoying it because i never really progressed on the ps3 one i have one problem the fucking game has the ps3 problem were after a certain amount of playtime the game starts to destabilize itself i would have purchased for liberation thanks for reviewing this i know it wasnt he greatest ac but it was one of the first games i played when i bought a ps3 after a long hiatus several years ago now ive got a ps4 and ill probably pick it up when its on sale which is inevitable i dislike this game with a passion never have i played such a subpar aaa game mostly because i know which ones to avoid entirely i remember being so bored that at one time i stopped playing it and started doing my chemistry homework instead as that was more fun to do the faces scare the crap out of me like i hate haytems eyes one change i noticed and liked was multiple of same weapon slot so you could carry a dagger and tomahawk or sword axe and blunt weapon im excited to play the king washington dlc again i fucking loved that dlc my man turned into jorraptor at 133 that jor raptor impression was a little to acurate that jorraptor impersonation was amazing james that jorraptor impression was on point i appreciate your review and candor i never played the original and since i get it for free with odyssey why not i do have a question though how do i get ride of the rectanglesquare hud box on the right i cant figure it out btw the plot twist where you a templar is one of the highlights of the game the main theme is good too i been following jorraptor since his horizon zero dawn review but man that impression was spot on didnt they change the faces in the update james what do you think about cdpr opening up there own merchandise shop as i have only just heard about it and im excited for it sorry its a bit off topic lol was listening to the review but had to close it due to him being a little gimp within the first 3 minutes trying to be funny the odyssey part had me in tears what happened to the old costumes first time im watching ur reviews u get to the point and say what i want to know thank u subscribed that impersonation u did in the beginning so funny i dnt watch that guys videos cause he talks crap and i dnt understand what he says as he sound like he has tampons in his nose thanks for ur awesome video u made my day they also made some minor changes for full sync optional objectives for example in the first mission from bunker hill when you need to destroy the ships you had a third objective to finish all the challlenges in a single playthrough means if you fail you had to restart the mission now they removed that so you can restart from checkpoint if you fail while i got this free with my season pass with odyssey i purchased the original years ago and if anyone is having problems with the xbox 1 controller not working correctly if you lookup the issue with the original game set the game to run as administrator also if you have a 2 monitor setup and discover a screen blinking show which never ending until you have to forcefully close the game unplug the second monitor also this game doesnt like the amd drivers its kinda getting retarded how ubisoft is getting with games and all of the micro transactions i mean really with all of the different editions and the season pass plus micro transactions when i first started to play these games i use to pirate them however i eventually decided to purchase them since unity came out and created a little collection of these games but more and more im thinking of just pirating them again as they are getting worse with the micro transactions plus the season pass and everyones favorite the tripl also you didnt mention about the missing textures on snow when running in it or the towns sounding empty at times when in fact there are people out and about still my fave in the series 750 youd think theyd fix that tbh are you secretly jorraptor james xd youre wrong i got aciii remastered for liberation i frikkin leaped out of my pants i thought you straight spliced some joraptor recording i to your vid im crying do legacy outfits appear in cutscenes are we just gonna ignore the fact that the alexios outfit makes connor white that was a good jorraptor impersonation you did loved that jorraptor impersonation ubisoft plz remaster assassins creed 1 hey atleast its main theme is great i really wish they scrapped the old combat system moving around and used the one from ac originsodyssey ive become so accustom to the new movements that old ac titles feel unplayable to me they messed up the snow in the frontier though lol glitchy as hell even some rocks are floating i do wish they had included the freezing water health deterioration mechanic though when its the winter climate they have it for one of the kidd letter missions they could have installed it permanently would make some escapes or even free roam a little more challenging or realistic i had actually forgotten what the faces looked like previously so i thought they were just ok lol i genuinely enjoyed this remaster more than i have with all of odyssey really made me miss assassins creed sometimes when playing the game i feel like there is to much of a orange filter i feel like for a soft patch ubisoft needs to patch the faces and maybe tone down the orange in some sections i was waiting for this xd 1017 yeah fuck you for that jorraptor impersonation it caught me off guard and made me laugh so hard here have the upvote and fuck off hahahahahaha i think they changed the philadelphia outfit to look less like the jamestown so alexios is the ac meme huh so be it when i saw that they were fixing up the mission structure i was really hoping theyd also redo those god awful bs optional objectives sadly they didnt but overall its still a good remaster imho im definitely picking this up because personally i like this game any however i understand why people hate it and it is bad game but everyone has that one game everyone hated but they liked for me it was this game im not trying to change anyones mind just trying to make the who liked it more comfortableac2 is still the best though followed by origins ps it was also my first ac game and you never forget your first lol at least its not the faces from unity the only remaster that turns everyone into clay 1022 alexios cameo was so apt taylor davis and lara always the go to for music covers beautiful i dont understand why so much effort went into this remaster where as the ezio collection was just ported i wouldve swapped the alexos outfit for a haythem outfit honestly i died at 132 jesus christ man this game definitely has its issues and its not as great of a remaster as you may think for one thing this game has major sound balancing issues you can barely hear what almost anyone is saying on the streets when youre free roaming around the only time sound is good is when its in a cutscene but barely audible with voices any other time when you steal from someone and they catch you you can barely hear them yelling at you same thing for the soldiers when you bump into them you cant hear any bystanders yelling at you when youre in a fight and when youre sprinting and you bump into people it makes no noise ive tried turning the voice in the options all the way then all the way down and back up again and it doesnt work ive even uninstalled the game and installed it again only to have the same problem the remaster also suffers with popin with random pedestrians appearing from out of nowhere and other minor glitches that i havent seen before these is i use to hold ac3 as god tire i was little so i naturally bought when i started play i realize i dont like as much i dont hate it but definitely dont like it how i use to i now want jorraptor to react to your impression ubisoft need to sort out the faces i have mixed feeling about the remaster i play on pc performance is incredibly improved over the original and it has nicer textures i love that they removed these patriot guards that were in front of printer it was annoying as hell sadly they didnt rework angry chef quest i really hate killing random guards on duty and protecting some enraged asshole which you then invite to brotherhood but besides that i actually had a lot of bugs and glitches probably more than on the original eg franklin dissappeared on almanach cutscene and there was only floating book they also could have remove optional sync obj or tweak them to something normal i am glad that i have it but i feel they could have done more gameplay changes still pretty damn good effort and still 1000 better game than odyssey it couldve be good if they added some easter egg about shay haha i thought i was watching a jorraptor video got a sec there best change no more blinding white loading screens just nice dark blueishblack i bought it because of this video and im also gonna take out my ac4 disc to replay it is anyone else having a glitch where the combat music stops it starts working after i reload the game but sometimes it will just stop randomly its great i got it also anyone else here from new york city 1027 except for ezios outfit because there isnt red inside the cape and the hood like in brotherhood its been 7 years and 5 games and ubisoft still couldnt bother to fix it if youre going to put a legacy outfit make it exactly the same as the original im happy you made a video where you tried to stay as unbiased as possible even though those of us who have followed your channel know how you feel about ac3 lol but good video thanks as long as they fix the ugly colour on the gun stock warclub the faces kind of annoy me and i hope they fix it 100 agree with everything you said here you really are one of the best in assassins creed community i watch your videos because we disagree on a lot in terms of narrative but why cant we be adults and have different opinions we all love assassins creed i got ac3 with odyssey gold god help me and ive played it a lot but i havent even played liberation yet i got the odyssey ultimate edition lol i agree the faces look off but the atmosphere has improved quite a bit imo lazerzz theres a change you missed which is where you automatically use the hidden blades when performing low profile assassinations im pumped that they added the outfit from the king washington dlc to the main story back then i felt that that wouldve been an awesome appearance for the final act where connor shaves and adds the face paint i love how this somehow has much better lighting than odyssey haha great review sir i didnt get oddesy so ill wait for a sale maybe the point with the faces soooo god damn true detective penis mate you are getting better and better at editing and content quality nice review mate i can see why you analysed it only as a remaster and not the game overall but i really wanted to know more about the mission structure changes namely well known for being bad missions like the one with the guy telling connor where to go and shit whether thats been changed overall enjoyed the flow and the structure of the video tho as always keep it up i chose to replay the entire series at the same time this game came out the curses of this series anyways stop reading these comments and lets gaow i cant wait to hear you complain through another video am i the only one who hates that they still havent given connor a hood in post game he still walks around without it dammit ubisoft i liked ac3 lol enjoying the remaster but did anyone elses ubisoft club weapons not work even tho the outfits did the faces other than main characters are pretty bad tho but overall looks nice nope haha a sam adams ad and i just met him in the game sad that this remaster have so much negative reviews in steam a lot of people dont understand whats the difference between a remaster and a remake i understand that the game is not worth 40 especially if you already played it and that having the dlc and liberation wont make my gameplay better when i saw that in my ready to install i dropped my hot pocket my croissant was buttered and i wrote this comment you killed me with the jor impression it actually annoys me so much when he says that but he does have good content 133 perfect james lol i remember when the original came out many ppl saying oh connor was to bland of a character and im like hmm really look hes bland besides ezio and who doesnt looks bland after ezio the game was good and in fact made some improvements to the combat mechanics also ppl complaining oh they put to much emphasis on the american revolution instead of the templar assassins feud really this game explores more modern day stuff and then some also kills desmond that im not really a fan of that decision but damn arguments stupid oneswell black flag explore the pirate side of things more than the templar assassins feud and is one of the best and dont get me started with odyssey that is not even an assassins creed gamei hope ppl can see this points more clearly now that ezio is not connor shadow anymore and enjoy it for what is it a very solid ac game i got it for liberation ok but when is ac legion speculation going to start great review james bang up job i mean its great and all but can conner be a happy chap now i think they should have updated the faces and made alot of the clothes texture darker because the lighting and shaders are from ps4 gen do you know if theyve fixed the outfit colours so they show in cutscenes great vid man really liked the original ac3 wanna revisit it should i buy it now or wait for fixes and sale the face problems you talked about are the really that bad jheez cant believe i was 10 when i got this game on release can you put your hood after finishing the main story ac rogue remaster was the best waiting for black flag remaster i thought it was pretty good it wasnt a remake but it was good are you jealous of jorraptor loved this review just unlocked the altair outfit that alexios part is killing me but you gotta admit ac3 has one of the best soundtracks any word on the money system it was supposed to be revamped and i havent heard anyone comment on it i honestly dont remember 3 so just curious they also made the lockpicking easier dude the faces are terrifying load times are fantastic though the impersonation lacks the letsh go thumbs down gonna get it after i beat sekiroso in about 4 years maybe personally i quite enjoyed the original weapon indicator without the puppeteer in the top right corner i usually turn it off myself but that is a personal preference obviously to each his own good vid man joraptor impersonation was funny but hes a good youtuber still better than batman return to arkham that remaster looks worse than the original gotta say your jorraptor impression was spot on james i hate jorraptor that joraptor voice was perfect i have experienced some horrible bugs and glitches including a character jumping in and out of a hat cart and not following me ive seen comparison videos where the new lighting ruins shadow detail due to the games core artistic design also ambient occlusion is missing in the remaster and screen space reflections seem shit not to mention how sometimes things get over saturated the remaster gameplay changes are what i really care about the graphical changes are subjectively better httpsyoutubeyfkws9ebhxa heres the video im referring youre giving way too much credit to the graphical changes it looks like on remasterd everyone rub their faces with dish washer a photomode would be nice does anyone else try to climb the larye trees in the frontier and just leap off them for no reason ghats why this game irritates me this remaster just reminds me how much i love haytham and the kenways in general and makes me want to replay 4 and rogue it also reminded me of my need for a game on edwards later years and haythams younger life although thats never going to happen yeah i totally agree that the faces definitely look worse i really like the added sun light though well it was better than odyssey though that is not much of an achievement sponsored by as always as always question ac3 remastered or ac4 black flag since you rushed playing ac3 remaster its not worth it for you i fucking love assassins creed every game brotherhood is my favourite but i love all of them too that jorraptor impersonation was on point my mom said if i got a fuck ton of likes i could get a dragon get me there boys yeahi uhhhi bought the odyssey gold edition fuck best ac shut the fuck up you piece of shit how many hour of gameplay is there i think that the pc or xbox 360 looks very much better honestly it doesnt look very well should i play this first or go straight to black flag and rogue sound is horrible but graphic is not bad as a portable console the same as the original one hey does this game auto saveeven if im playing without being connected to the internet is it me or is the sound really compressed hey man i know its 30fps but is there framedrops glitches is the 30fps ok and not bothering looks good but i dont have a switch lmao ubisock what are u do with the game it look the normal ac3 not remastered looks neat but the player shouldnt be allowed to record this they make the game look worse cause they suck so badly cant wait to pick it up tomorrow played it back on the 360 when it first came out hopefully i can enjoy it a lot more a 2nd time around does it take much gb to install if you have the cartridge cardlike did it need to install when put in nintendo switch console does it run with 60fps in the docked mode looks amazing cant wait to get this for the switch it looks very good on switch thank you hey everyone i hope you enjoy the video despite the annoyingly loud combat music with each ac portremaster some new glitch is introduced and this is one of them i apologize because i forgot to lower the volume for those fight scenes i knew there was something i forgot to do before i uploaded thank you for making this video how do you do that combo at 102 960th you are the best i love ac 3 great video i guess im the first one here is multiplayer coming also slap on a new lighting filter bam remastered im excited for liberation 3 one of the best settings for an ac game ill definitely be interested in this once its out conner was pretty bad ass too best game of the series come at me bro so can someone explain the difference between a remake and a remaster to me please people in comments clearly have eye problembecause they are saying thatthey only change color to yellowlolit made the world aliveand clearly there are so many texture changesoverall its a decent remaster i dont know why u people complain so much about the gray look of the original ac3 ac2 looked more dark and gray in regions like forli and venice but nobody complained doesnt look that worth it will probably get the current version on cheap since the steam lunar sale is on ubisoft has to much time on they hands great trailer tho the game looks so much smoother and cleaner but it looks too orangy and yellow this videogames companies sucks changed colors remastered why isnt rogue included assassins creed iii is possible to play in the new generation through backward compatibility from the xbox xd can somebody tell me which assassins creed is the best connor will always hold a special place in my heart at 054 prime example what do u see being done the textures are brighter or more vibrant and theres a lot more color and depth to it plus the character models on this day im torn part of me wants to play this gamethe other part of me knows this game is not good will the aco season pass owners also get ac liberation that is one of the only ac games ive never played love the music its just yellow fuuuuuuuck my favorite assassins creed game and one of greatest games ive played i must have it anyone else waiting for that multiplayer to come back they added lighting basically still improves the game quite a lot it seems lighting and shadows can make a game look extraordinary just look at oddysey great light and shadows with low res textures world and it looks really good love this game i honestly really loved this game it was a lot of fun to play the story and dick around in i dont get why it was hated so much ill pick up the remaster and try to understand why best assassins creed game in my opinion then it goes revelations 1 brotherhood 2 black flag never played them after that cuz they are let downs they shouldve stopped after 3 or black flag iii why not ezios story great ubisoft decide to remaster one of the worst ac game worst protagonist boring and one dimensional clunky gameplay and awful dlc very short story and zero replay potential lol did gamespot really remove pc xd edit for pc users who are wondering this game is still coming out for pc i literally just bought the xbox 360 edition bad remastered for very boring part of ac this was honestly one of my most favorite assassins creed games and you guys are spending all your money on making new assassins games why go through the trouble when you can just remaster old classics assassins creed 3 remastered instagram warm filter ac3 but its yellow this time im sorry but corners voice just sounds tobland i am the only one that see original is better than remastered will have more bugs than the original xd tendr mas bugs que el original el juego xdddd will it have battle royale look at haythams cloak details wow ac3 already looks good as it is but the new small changes and the light visuals looks great any chance of getting a switch version original looked already good what about black flag hu good game the latest i have ever played and a huge gamer lol who asked for this cant wait to play this where is assassins creed 2 remastered for those worried about full cost of the game you get it free with odysseys season pass which is cheaper then the full game price remastered you just put yellow all over the fucking game finally a real assassin game why is everything yellow i can hear charles lee there are only 12 comments as of now and all of them are negative wtf if they charge full price then no thx wow look at all those downgrades i hope original owners get this for free d this better be 30 it seriously saddens me that remastered for ubisoft means coloring everything sunny yellow the color palate of the older games made them unique all they needed to fix was pop in and textures the filters of the originals added character assassins creed instagram edition the new colorscheme dlc lookin great i thought 3 was kinda boring i too am a calm man whilst having an axe in my head i love assassin creed but new the versions need a mode or some gameplay like the old versions great video and i just started replaying all the old assassin creed games because of you wish you were able to throw your tomahawk see the clip at 247 conner brutally fighting lady no problem they are fighting i will just pass by them conner watched the lady lady sorry sorry i will never come here again see conners face expression in 214 is the game good for people who are only interested in the history 730 come on how this puny scout able to counter connors break defense can anyone tell me what is new in the remastered besides the better graphic always thought assassins creed 3 was the best love the combat system and just the overall game batman arkham asylum released in 2009 features a dedicated counter button for use against enemies who will attack frequently assassins creed iii released in 2012 has enemies stand still as you assault them one at a time conclusion the batman arkham series is better than the assassins creed series after putting like 250 hours into unity going back to the simple combat of ac3 made me feel like god lmao everything was so easy this is assassins i love assassins creed why are the stabbings so crunchy it sounds like its been overlayed with asmr noises paused the video in the start to see people commenting about the man with axe in his head speaking without any problem 117 how true ac fans play the games yay ac3 remastered wait the gave connor aguilars suit but not for arno that lady at 247 didnt get hit by the rifle wished they expanded an developed more combat such as these into future ac games sadly ubisoft has turned the ac franchise into something completely unrecognisable i friggin love assassins creed next video connor with ezios costume and trying to replicate his weapons a random sword the dagger instead of the more cooler tomahawk your probably one the best youtubers i have seen play assassins creed 3 i guess connor got a little excited when close to a soldier dk games why the heck are you cheating mr edxwx nice work bro one outfit that works well here petting the cow was probably the best part of the game in rdr2 how do you press dead eye i know how to use it but how do i get many arrow on their bodies is this an official outfit in the remastered version or is this a mod 926 what a kick combat is so satisfying there was a lot of glitches this game that was my only problem literally how the rest did not see one guy get assassinated i remember playing this i did this boat mission and i kicked one guard into the water while the other was watching me and didnt even get detected by him so i threw a poison blade at him cause of how stupid he was remastered weasome 1010 glitch in the opening clip this vid was made on my b day ac3 is still my favorite its looking like a ps2 game is that remastered really im getting the biggest nostalgia when watching this damn the years has gone so fast felt i watched the og walkthrough last year trev it was in the 1700s omg i grew up with this game i was five when i first played and it got me into gaming and it led me to find you then i started to play cod thank you so much for inspiring me to play games living for this seriesplease finish this game is based on far more important and real event i remember playing this game in its entirety when school was out the whole month of feb due to snow one of the best games ive ever played 826 looks like the alien lab in subnactica desmond sound a bit like drake from uncharted i can tell this series is going to be a lot of fun definitely finish it hey tmartn there is a ezio collection which comes with assassins creed 2 brotherhood and revelations all taking place before ac 3 desmond and nathan drake same voice actor cool is it on ps4 or pc cause i see u using ps4 controller the assassin that your playing was the grand son of kenway a pirate assassin ac3 was the series that made me subscribe to you 7 years later and i still cant get enough of you t i am replaying this game as well so it makes me happy to see you doing the same keep up the series how could you not play the ezio collection is desmond miles nathan drakes voice actor best ac ever imo i remember being so fascinated when i first played this game fell in love with it my brother actually mentioned the remastered edition a few weeks ago to me sweet playthrough dude brings back memories its epic keep this series up this gives me massive mission impossible rogue nation vibes i didnt know that they remastered 3 til i saw your video and ac 3 is the only one im missing besides rogue for my ps4 but checked on amazon and its on for the nintendo switch as well as ps4 the series is great go back and play the others that ddt though lol please play 1 and 2 i thought it was awesome to hear nolan north do the voice of desmond 1637 theyve been doing it since 2012 just me that thinks as much as the game looks good but the cutscenes look so much better in the original the facial definitions look terrible in this game this game is the best yet its a game i beat this game 5 times and it still is one of the best games i have ever played definitely top 10 man its really nostalgia just remove the facecam and it is all back in time the 2nd best assassins creed in my opinion i really like the ac series of games some of the coolest game mechanics ever gonna watch the whole series cuz i love ur ac vids ummmm dawn of man this is my favorite game of all time pls finish this game and you are amazing also i am from greece the game that changed ac forever i still remember each game cause i replay them too much imo they should have done desmond legacy i remember braking the lock 3 was the only one i could finish start to end i remember people hated on it when it came out but i loved it and its by far my favourite thats odisey ac 3 is one of my least favorite ac games alongside unity this was the first assassins creed i ever played and i still think its the best ac 3 was my first assassins creed and this game is and looks amazing but is it just me or do the eyes look really weird and the teeth are a little too white more this was my favorite walk through you have ever done great to see it coming back this is my first and favorite game of the series there are sooo many better games you could play though play different series and games that you

ac game for more gameplay footage check out our video here httpsyoutubel5qi501aigw can i barrow youre acc in nintendo switch we need the ezio collection on switch picked this up for 10 is the eshop sale these are the assassins creed games in the order i beat them ac3 ac2 ac4 ac original facial structures switch visuals and lighting ps4 gameplay fps ps4 my favorite ac is black flag and rogue just picked this up for 20 at walmart i never played any assassins creed game but im now thinking about getting one for my switch but i think there are ac 3 and ac black flag for the switch which one should i get revelations is the best assassins creed of all gonna be playing black flag for the first time on switch in 1 week super excited lmao i only want a nintendo switch so i can play assassins creed on the go honestly the switch version looks better just my opinion why are people hating on the switch version it dont look bad i fucking love assasins creed fan since altair made his debut definitely getting this the update that came out fixed alot of things this money should do a video on it again i would play this on my switch but it takes too long to get your assassins outfit i wish theres a skip option for previous players i guess i could just play liberation and king washington instead yeah it doesnt look as good as other platforms but hey you can play it wherever you want and it certainly doesnt look all that bad for it being mobile we now know we are getting black flag and rouge any chances we will possibly get the rest i would love to replay through 1brotherhood again on the switch i agree with others black flag was the best ac game i have the nintendo switch version of the remastered game and the graphics arent what they are supposed to be turn the switch light bright best assassins creed games assassins creed 1 assassins creed brother hood assassins creed black flag assassins creed 2 i have other more important goals to achieve in my life and other things to do rather than wasting time on playing video games it doesnt worth spending time playing video games it is the end im quitting gaming assassins creed black flag is my favourite mine glitches very bad to where i cant play itit freezes how long the battery life is in handheld mode the textures and lighting are lower quality but the character model 125 on the switch actually looks better than the ps4 pro in my opinion now you can play ac on the go why would you compare the switch to the pro atleast use the base consoles its not a fair comparison whst you did just started playing this today cant believe how good the gfx are my fav was ac 3 im picking it up today im disappointed i let my cousin borrow my switch for a month and when he gave it back i saw 150 hours on fortnite i had 40 from playing with friends and i saw 365 hours in zelda botw i had it at 360 before i let him borrow it i still play ac3 on pc amazon has it for 2999 right now i need the ezio collection on switch im going to wait until it comes on sale honestly any of the ezio games aside from the 3rd one it still amazes me that people try to compare the switch to a xb1x and ps4 proits ridiculous get a grip its the best hand held unit around by a country mile the graphics are fine for the tech we have on the switch at present unless you want to carry a 4k tv and full size console and a generator to power it stop babbling and moaning if you like it buy it if you dont get yourself a crossword puzzle and piss off for a game thats been ported its really important sorry my favorite is assassins creed 3 i originally bought this game for the 360 and now that i have a switch i thought i would grab it since it was the only ac game ive ever bought and not finished now i remember why i didnt finnish it this is the only terrible ac game ive seen the story conner the controls and most of all how glitchy the whole thing is wish i had kept the receipt its the first assassins creed for nitendo switch lets all be proud of that they wil fix more things in patches and we might see more assassins creeds games in the future good review tho what is it with the addiction to disparaging handhelds you cant hold the switch to 4k standards which require a tv of that grade as well as the console no 2018 but ok ps4 xbox 2019 my favourite assassins creed games of all time are unity and origins ac 3 4 or origins the only ac game ive played was 4 on wii u which i really enjoyed debating whether to pull the trigger on this one since ive heard more divisive comments on the game overall why do you keep comparing it to other consoles i want to know how the switch version is not how the switch version is compared to the xbox one or ps4 i heard this game has a wonky frame rate bad textures this game shouldnt run like garbage on current generation console that isnt acceptable how do we save are progress in remastered i definitely like it better than the 360 version that i abandoned its not black flag but it never was great to have good stealth on the switch worth the to me youre seriously going to compare the switchs to the ps4s hardware obviously they arent going to look the same assassins creed 2 was my favorite in the series i was so bored i literally returned it after playing for 45 minutes ok i think i may be crazy at 126 i think the switch version looks better i know its probably just a lighting thing but the ps4 version looks like a bunch of plastic barbie dolls in a doll house im sure this is just specific to this scene tho if we could just get ezio collection when the switch cant handle a 5 year old game watch dogs is to the wii u what ac 3 is to the switch the faces look way better on the switch ill just be the guy that does not say the original ezio games or black flag and say syndicate was my fav this might be a stupid question but how do you get a stream of notifications other than the high profile freerun one its been stuck on that since ive started playing and its frustrating am i missing something is there a way to delete that or scroll through other notifications this was my favourite assassin creed game it felt refreshing to have a new character was getting sick of ezio i think im one of the few people who disliked black flag i couldnt get into it at all they should just give us the ezio series as well i would love to play that while drinking a beer by the pool isnt quite at the same level 129 got a good laugh thanks for the review its as i expected it to be which means ill certainly be picking it up 15 hours to complete takes about 10 just to do tutorial black natives the remaster is also on pc idk why people keep comparing the switch version to xbox and playstation we know its not going to be as good visually we just want something that looks good and take it wherever we want it actually surprised me that this was not a well received game i thought it was the best ac game when i first played it i prefer wait for ac iv black flag i dont get it so warframe which has much better graphics and huge detailed worlds and levels performs better than a large number of ported games when are we getting a zelda breath of the wild remake its been like 2 years we should have had two remakes already seriously whos asking for remakes of games less than a decade old and whos stupid enough to buy them i dont play graphics i play games 3 is the worst one in the series assassins creed 2 is the best one the new legacy outfits are available on the switch version right you didnt even played aveline the psvita exclusive assassins nintendo itself scored the game 55 you just showed as the beginnings not other sequences they said the game drop up to less than 20 when story goes further 100 getting this ive never enjoyed assassins creed games the control layout and button layout is atrocious makes it unbearable to play black flag was the best ac game ac3 was glitchy on the xbox 360 so if its better than that on the switch id say its worth the pickup origins turned out to be my favorite i like how they added some western rpg elementsflavor to it though i still need to play odyssey to see if it takes the spot before that i liked ac2 a lot however id really like them to remasterport over the first ac game i dont remember much of it and one of my roommates at the time was still in school and didnt have a job so when i got home from work they were playing it on my ps3 and i ended up just watching them complete the game and never actually finished the game myself 130 and id much prefer it this way because if you compare the ps4 pro remaster to the original ps3 release the lighting looks very inferior for something thats supposed to be a remastered port give us black flag ac ii brotherhood was just perfection in my oppinion im getting the game i picked it up day 1 and this will be my 3rd playthrough and 1st liberation and all dlcs playthrough wait for ass creed 2 they shouldve remastered ac4 black flag ac3 wasnt very good get with the facts mate the ps4 and xbox one remasters came a few months ago how could you not know that the whites on the wiiu version far superior compare the water scene the vs video on youtube already yet another bad port nintendo should just stick to nintendo games and indies i thought ac3 had multiplayer a lot of dialogue is none existent when im playing like that franklin cutscene ac3 was one of my favorite ac games but im kind of biased since it was the first one that i actually paid attention too and finished picked it up after work today ive been eagerly waiting to play this one on the go its my favorite ac game i love the setting and haytham kenway is an awesome character may has killed my wallet for switch games for very much most of the year now 11 games assasins creed re01 and 4 observer cuphead guilty gear r castlevania collection mk11 dragons dogma saints row i have the ps3 one in mint condition so dont feel its worth it for me i would have been interested to have it in hd but its 70 aud here i mean ubisoft are out of their mind if they do a 50 sale on it ill then grab it from the us store that game on the switch looks nice btw this needs a comparison with the wii u version enjoying ot so far skipped it back when hope they fix the audio stuttering at times otherwise ive had no problems yet glad we get liberation too though i did play it back on vita when it first dropped would love to see black flag if they do another older one i bought switch month ago and i am really happy looking for some games reviews before buy i end up on your channel thank you for your effort and good job i have to admit that you got one of the best background music video i heard so far on youtube see you later mate why wont the free run on the screen go away nice review james i how you go into the little details when you review the game and not just the big ones just want black flag costs the same amount of money on ps4 so idk if it worth it on the go cuz games still look better on a ps4 but if its a game from 2012im not sure it might not be a big difference graphics vise came for ac3 review left for the cheap lets get to 10 minutes trick i expect better write more i just got this with the seasons pass of odyssey on my xbox one x but my dumbass is still going to gamestop tn so i can play ac on the go this seems so cool thanks for the review i think ill buy this one still runs better than the wii u 125 faces look better on switch here we are on the glorious shores of switchwatch who would have thought wed be playing this on a nintendo handheld happy days mark whats sup with these characters eyes omg face textures look way better on the switch lul i think ubisoft when a little too far with the lighting to the point where characters faces look like whiteout renaissance statues on the ps4 xbox1 and pc versions hahahaha great review sir james its cool to have a real assassins creed game on a handheld and none of this 2d stuff that we got on the vita black flag would be amazing on the switch even though i class black flag as a pirate game with assassins in it rather than a full assassins game i so wish ubisoft would release that on switch its nice that an ac is on switch but to me ac3 is still terrible 131 gods the remastered version looks horrible im glad they kept the old engine for the switch version fuck should i get or wait for it i really want it tbh i love ac games and this was the last ac game i really enjoyed playing wait for a sale by the way assassins creed ii is my favorite i got skyrim on the switch nothing else like it needed skyrim is my zelda red dead redemption and ac3 you can do all the shit plus the fights are so fun because of the tandom cinematic kills assassins creed black flag was my favorite game from the franchise so i wish ubisoft ports a remastered edition to the nintendo switch panic button would of done a better job porting this game to switch 126 switch looks better than ps4 pro i might get round to pickin this up currently have team sonic racing takin my attention this was my favourite and black flag and the first assassins i hope they port them over too loving the breakfast themed music lol great vid as always seems like a good port to me although for me it is more like the original version rather than remaster great review thanks hey i have a question the game is coming only physical or digital as well because i dont see it in the eshop now and then the firts nintendo switch assassin creed its not perfect but not too bad good review purchase for sure nice one james seems a solid port not played too many of the ac games but the one set in london a few years ago was good cant quite remember the name i loved the series up to this game and was last one i completed was the beginning of the end for me and them trying to create a quality game over quantity of games never gunna get another ac game long live ezio if it was black flag id buy it in a second at any price but ill pass on this aciii never really gripped me tbh im pretty sure i watched ac movie in 2017 that have a vibe like this i already played this on wii u though i didnt get the dlc for it i think my favorite assassins creed has to be black flag really liked that game rogue was pretty good as well though i didnt play it as much yo you remember me lol school suck so it looks and runs better than it did on ps3 im considering picking it up again on switch but only if its worth it compared to the ps3 version im tired of socalled reviewers keep basing graphics on the pc ps pro and xbox one x stop it base them on whats realistic ps4 and xbox one get better great review 1 question does that high profile freerun box stay on screen at all times i dont remember it from the wii u but that was years ago pretty sure the remaster on ps4 n xbox 1 was this year and not 2018 if it were black flag id probably pick it up unfortunately i find ac3 to be the worst game in the series pretty insane that a game like this is running on a handheld no brainer pickup big awesome games like this is perfect for the switch my boys are on a roll this morning now this must have taken a bit of time to review this game keep bringing us that switch goodness guys ive never played any of this series maybe its about time i dont know thanks for the review pal surprised it wasnt jordan catchy beat 3 i cant see ac3 at coming soon store nice review james but idk yet honestly im getting tired of games cost more on the switch than others consoles so not right i wonder how liberation hd holds up as well good review the game depsite aged in its presentation still looks good on the switch i like ac as a series but i tried this one back on ps3 and gave up before i got to play as adult conner it just takes waaay too long to get to the actual gamethe reason i play ac games is to run around exploring i hate the scripted bits glad to hear its another decent switch port though healthy for the system even if this ones not for me thanks for the review thanks for the review does the bad frame rate effect the gameplay a lot nice one after playing it over the weekend i have to say nice job ubisoft for including a switch portat the last moment there could have been much more of the remastered version in it but they probably hadnt enough time and just exploited the fact how they had a wiiu version running already so a few tweeks and minor improvements some additions and e voila the remaster was able to release on the switch too speaking from a technical perspective it is a nice game and better than the wiiu but imho you feel the rushed porting once again it isnt as bad as others but as mentioned above ubisoft could have smoothed several things further to make it a more true remaster instead of an improved wiiu version finally have been waiting for your review thank you trevor for playing ac3 remastered 5311 hahahahaha lmao because you rushed way too much and pressed the wrong button or hold r2 in the wrong direction i think you couldve made it battle of chesapeake do connor wash his clothes loving this series wish it was longer you will never understand the philosophical context of the series thus you were never or will be a true fan of the series i started this game with him and completed it today and i know the ending 5834 hopefully you guys join me tomorrow tomorrow dont

bugs that were in the original game i remember playing this when it dropped it is my favourite ac game but desmond definitely looks like ben stiller in this one i dunno way the slowly changed his face

hollow wont like this first first subscribe to pewdiepie he losing por favor first yes play more assassins creed hollow hi love the vid hey man great vid first first agian love you holloe first first first first first first fourth why is it the fearless outfit the dislikes are from ezio cocksuckers 0525 anarchocapitalysm is around the world in so many decades i find this parkour more satisfying then unity this remastered parkour is so accurate hey connor you look a little skinny i like the running style of connor correct me if im wrong but what is that suit that is not even close to arnos outfit the face petting the dogs got this video a like 528 the sickest ac game put the video to 15x speed im really bad at parkour in this game its always so buggy and glitchy i play on a switch the parkour in this game is so fast paced compared to unity it doesnt really fit the outfit with the game i mean if it had more contrast and they removed the bow id liked it are u shore about this being arnos out fit or is it evies outfit assassins creed 3 is the best series of assassins creed wtf its not even the right color this outfit has nothing to do with arnos who here thinks that the parkour and running on the original anvilnext engine is better than anvilnext 2 the funniest thing is that they dont look like arnos robes so you didnt kill a single person in a 13 minutes what an assasin tbh this outfit looks disgusting how does his gameplay look smoother than mine we should riot because ubisoft removed the petting dogs and cats feature in the newer games edward would be proud would be nice if the parkour system changed into unity they must have changed wheather effects right never compromise the brotherhood fellow assassinsamazing vdeo as always i hope ubisoft will remastered ac 1 and bloodlines ubisoft also remastered assassins creed 2 brotherhood and revaluation this is mod bro they changed the parkour moves or im imagining this okay so in ac rogue remastered they had arnos original robes so why does this game have his fearless outfit but where is arnos outfit lets start petition about making another sequel of ac unity httpswwwchangeorgpubisoftorgassassinscreedunitysequelrecruiter858476201utmsourcesharepetitionutmmediumfacebookutmcampaignshareforstarterspageutmcontentex673av6fbclidiwar0rwopc7usur2swly1j79pyxxjdurzmlazpx664hzrd6kvunjejg7n4 wtf thats not how he looked like in ac unity rip notre dame they got arnos robe wrong it never looked like that im sorry if this message hurts your feelings but are you playing connor as a kid he looks so young also great video hey ed i was just wondering how do we get into the mred club if you dont answer its ok congrats on 1 million subscribers have a amazing easter hey ed sometime can we play unity if you have free time it would be such honor ac3 remastered has nice graphics but people keep saying the faces are plastic while mine is good ugliest outfit of the bunch great vid tho keep up the work ed ps4 or xbox notre dame memes made this game relevant again connors head seems too big for arnos robes and body great video btw lol they did arno dirty in this game can i play with you assassins creed unity and how i get in to mred club assassins creed rogue remastered killer outfitsremastered when i see one of eds videos i clicksimple nice parkour thank you very much i really wanna replay black flag next nice gameplay ed do you think that the sequence 7 mission conflict looms is incredibly infuriating that looks so wrong on connor it makes his face look fat i wanna play ac odyssey the fate pf atlantis which arno outfit is this i thought he had a blue coat and it was more of a fabric not leather bro u are playing awesome i hope i can play this do you play your games in 1440p or 1080p 120 wait i think i drop something btw nice video unity still have the best parkour on the series and after unity it feels like every game has their parkour downgraded shame connor was such an underdeveloped character compared to his father haytham and grandfather edward connors arno montur is from assassins creed unity dlc dead kings hes playing ac3remastered like a pro while im sitting here playing ac unity in 15 fpsbtw nice video mate tbh im not a big fan of arnos robes in ac 3 remastered but great vid the only assassins creed game i havent played yet is assassins creed india from assassins creed chronicles i get its the fearless outfit but why it looks like its made of leather anyway next game i want to play is devil may cry v you are king of assassins creed this game looks so beautiful wow they did a really good job with it in my opinion wheres charles lee why is black not blue arnos outfit is blueso this isnt his outfit its weird to see arno not jumping 20 meters away wow arnos outfit are there too glad i got the remastered what the hell is that thats not arnos color best gameplay for assassins creed could you play some assassins creed unity please ed as it is my favourite ac game please notification of my favourite assassin first lol i love how they respected everything and just took it a step further and didnt change any of the story so lets just cut out the battle of lexington and concord and the signing of the declaration seems we have a tory controlling the sticks 32946 thats where im at reely reely helpfull why did they change the color of the hood it looks like a vomit color sorta grear parkour and all but just a ok outfit lol you are so bad at parkour aye mredxwx can i use some of ur footage in a video im making about parkour games i

love the series trev i love this series trev your my favorite youtuber keep it up great content trev keep up the great work hows cooper and koda your my favorite youtuber and this series first first first first yayyy im first first first first why are there so many graphical glitches sometimes arms arent touching the body and other things i cant think of right now this is the only assassins creed game where i liked the real world stuff i experienced the graphical issues until i finished the updates that came with it and that fixed the issues for me i got it today for 15 in the eshop i immediately noticed the bad framerate but for that price i cant really complain got it for 899 why not all the video is from acrogue isnt it this isnt an rpg what the hell is this guy talking about a trick that works for the switch i shouldnt be an issue if the developers had done their job well enough if you change the resolution in tv mode to something like 720p or 480p games that struggle to maintain a good framerate can now handle it you need to trade resolution for framerate if you have your switch hacked you can also unlock the clock up to its intended max frequency finally polygons render more pointally on ninendo just picked this game up for 1999 but who cares its freaking ac on switch omg im so damn tired of you try hard babies complaining bc the switch cant compete with a fracking pc shut up play the game and if you dont like it then just sit down and let us who know that we are on a switch enjoy the game gaw i think i will get this now its on sale for 1999 i think assassins 3 remastered was good cuz we were able to actually have the present time be important with the modern day assassin did they patch this right now i loved liberation people need to stop thinking ac3 is a game you can play without playing the other games boring desmond miles well theres a reason desmond acts like he does un ac3 but people tend to ignore that thinking assassins creed campaing is like cod where you dont really need to know a lot about the other games 8 hours to know the protagonist thats not true at all in this review the were only clips with haytham makes me asume they didnt finish the story the gameplay has been changed to be more like black flag in certain aspects but lets ignore that look yeah the framerate and graphics are worse than the original but there are points that doesnt make any sense sometimes people tend to hate ac3 just because everyone internet says ac3 bad i heard him saying that connor is no match to ezio seriously dude watch the making of ac3 original they will mention that connor is strongest than previous protagonist this includes ezio and altair as well this is just a ezio fan boy reviewing ac3 remasterd interminably boring desmond miles made me chuckle best way to describe him since probably the 3rd ac game if you are calling desmond boring you should see layla the new protagonist she sucks even more its 20 now and the current patch fixed everything go get it if ya never played it i skipped it on xbox360 n am loving this in both docked and handheld just be happy its on switch or make the game yourself ungrateful peace 325 the opening sequence i thought you were going to make a review not tell how the story begins you asshole good idea doing a review of a game that you have only played for 5 hours only haythams gameplay in the video and this is a prologue of 5 hours try to reach connor part before doing the review im spanish and my english is bad sorry if there are mistakes so next they chose 4 and rigue why even u could buy all assassin creed on ps4 nintendo switch not worth it bring it to apple arcade the game has a new patch is runs very smootly but if are in a big fight with som soldiers the frame rate drops to 20 fps i think its in everyones best interest especially yalls to rereview this game 2012 mainline ac game on consolespc scaled down version for handheld 2019 mainline ac game and scaled down versions remaster for handheld the switch really is succeeding where the vita failed only issue ive had is the right joycon being lose and creaky maybe its cause i got a grey one fuckin dumb ass game with a worse review honestly it shouldve gotten 710 i just got it with the patch and honestly its really fun not as much fun as the other ac games but still really fun idk why people are crying about it what a crock its one of the best games ive owned on my switch of course there is a tiny bit of pop in its a gigantic open world you guys just jump on the hate train played from start 2 finish loved it nah getting black flag when it comes i even get rogue and freedom cry with it not worth it at all the game is very clunky and not polished do remastered games sell well those of you have the game and the new update whats it like now i love playing ac i already played liberation on vita and the other version on pspsome says this game is trashdo u think this game is worth it for nintendo switch tnx for help written review came out months ago this video review came out just before a huge patch but doesnt take that into consideration poor form nl thumbs down ok so the audio crackling wasnt my external speakers at least thats good news rarely use them this port is truly a disappointment the graphics lag and fps drops are quite awful im used to playing games with lag and fps drops because my pc is old and not up to par but that makes it all the more disappointing that its still happening on the console remastered version you didnt talk about liberation enough many games runs better in portable mode thanks to a more balanced memory bandwidth at 720p but this is a bad port and nothing else specially after watching the witcher 3 running on switch maybe ubisoft will bring more ac to switch and i hope in a better shape then this one ive bee playing this remaster on switch since the day it came out maybe its just me but apart from the audio i dont experience anything like framerate issues or negative things mentioned in this video could be that im that guy who is satisfied with less ofcourse imo its a great game and it runs smoothly sorry but i have to disagree with the reviewer no one on earth can possibly be excited for a mediocre game from 7 years ago just because its on a handheld now the nintendo switch is essentially a portable ps3 which is still great i wouldnt be getting one if the vita was dead i think your overstating the flaws the frame rate is fine even smooth most of the time it often takes a hit in combat i played ac4 on ps4 alot and this comes close to its resolution as i percive it wow 5 our 10 the game is much much better than the resolution of ac4 on 360 sound from a tin can i have noticed glitches but thats another exaggeration the slow beginning which is enjoyable and is part of the main body of the game has open world gameplay worked to set up the story i find other ac games rush you into the game this is totally worth it i picked it up new for 27 bucks im still having a lot of fun with it you managed to publish the review three months later but didnt take into account the recent patch that fixes most of the issues the game had and could no one take some footage from parts of the game past sequence 1 and why you keep saying ac3 is the weakest link of the series when most people consider it one of the best it has naval combat forts open world crafting some of the most onpoint elements of the series that have been included and expanded in all following chapters thanks for the review you missed the new patch by a day another rushed port its not much better on the xbox one s this is cool guys but very strange timing im just going to ask why is this here 2 months after the launch of the game if they would have put blag flag on switch i would have bought it instantly whatever the merits of ac3 on switch as a game did nintendo life turn their old review into a video to tie into the big performance patch that came out this week if so why the audio was fixed and performance improved making some of the statements in the review incorrect now or i guess it could have just been bad timing and they didnt know the patch was being released the same day they posted the video based on the review from months ago why go with 3 it sucks ass should have been one or two theres no multiplayer so i wont pick it up is this the new update 102 i agree this should not have been named a remaster still i had a good time playing it and there is a lot of content ac3 was never my favorite entry but i enjoyed it more on switch then i did on ps3 back in 2012 for some reason still some of the issues during the king george dlc the game even crashed several times and i had to restart it this is nothing more than a port of the last gen versions with little to no work put in to it lol the game came out 3 months ago and now u wanna review it do more reviews please theyre very helpful what happened to alex most steam pc users say its a terrible fake remaster and left negative reviews httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp911400assassinscreediiiremastered arent remastered games supposed to look better than the original this is ridiculous an obviously rushed port hell the wii u version can even look better and the switch is a deal powerful than the wii u this comment section is saltier than a dried up argentiniean lake good to know i should go ahead and buy the 8 version available on wiiu spot on 510 i didnt finish it not as good as ac4 on the wii u and controls are really clunky correct word its a real chore wow that was way too late and impressively bad sorry to break it to you but from a technical standpoint i rather listen to df than to these false guesses you make ac3 is a game with many flaws but the way you shit on its technical side shows your populism instead of integer journalism sad to see the quality of your reviews dropping constantly i love open world games so while many have deemed aciii to be one of the worst entry in ac franchise it was the first ac game ive played and i was blown away by the beauty and the lively world this franchise has to offer which lead me to follow up with the other ac games afterwards so when aciii was announced for switch you can imagine how excited i was to be able to revisit this beautiful world that i once dipped in but after seen so much negative critics about this port i think i might have to give this one a pass for now at least until this port get a more reliable updatewhich i am not sure when ubisoft will release i really want a new prince of persia gameim so tired of assassins creed perhaps this reviewer should realize theyre playing on a 720p switch lol i loved this game in 2012 but i like to form my own opinions anyone who gets the lite is a clown 8 hours um no it only takes a couple hours to reach connorim not sure how long the reviewers was playing for also no gameplay for liberations 729 lmao that dude just turned into a helicopter you guys have got to stop talking about me yes my name is connor the real question is does it run better on the revised nintendo switch hmmm hmmm hopefully they do an update to it and fix alot of the issues with it 730 thats both funny and terrifying at the same time ubisoft should make an assassins creed game designed with the switchs hardware in mind or better yet a paper mario game as mario rabbids was fantastic i love it i have been playing it since it was released even though i enjoyed the game i found it incredibly annoying when i not so rarely passed by people sitting or riding in the air thats just lazy game development woah no liberation hasalways been superior to iii a broken buggier worse version of an already mediocre game 510 average huh loved this game on switch still playing after i beat it gotta grab all the collectibles i love this its good to know where you should improve and pay more attention a s s a s s i n s c r e e d i s a g o o d f r a n c h i s e assassins creed in general isnt worth it i think its a 710 savage review i still dont understand why people say this is weakest link in the ac series in my opinion unity is the weakest link the story was boring and i base that on that i cant remember one thing from that story the combat was really bad the same combat system was also present in the ac syndicate game but it was refined and improved and by that became much better there the character arno was forgettable the only interesting thing about unity was the 24 player coop missions but that interest didnt last very long oh and 18th century paris looked really nice this game wasnt worth it when it was first released every time the game loads the audio crackles like my coco pops thats just sad man ubisoft has ruined assassins creed as we know it thats all she wrote boys i cant wait for the bomberman review why not 4 u forgot to mention the wii u version looks nicer than this remaster lmao so lets remake the shit assassincreed and call it a good idea fuck you assholes that game is a pice of shit i highly appreciate the honesty here youd think ubisoft wouldve learned from their wii u kerfuffle and all the decent releases theyve given us on switch so far aside from just dance you cant patch a turd 250 saying assassins creed iii remastereds visuals even remotely resemble odysseys or origins visuals is absolutely ridiculous whoever wrote that into the script should be fired the game is a bit too foggy is too many areas the audio also sounds really low quality this is my second favourite switch game i had a pretty good time playing this game it should be no more than 30 tho ill pass when they get odyssey on the switch ill consider it dude what took so long easy answer no it is not worth it its a great game little late most people didnt buy this several months ago thumbs down nope not worth it average 25fps for a 360 game is unacceptable in 2019 why the hell is there no gameplay of connor at all in this review you mentioned him but you only showed haytham throughout the gameplay classic ubisoft i literally bought it yesterday im so mad but happy xd nobody nintendo life remember this waste of money bit harsh i think thanks for the review but i will pick it up one sale 730 what the heck was that ubisoft fix your game why does the wiiu version look better not upgrading from wiiu version to switch version until we get a patch fixing the game next we will get a review for mario rabbids as a sealed collector i picked this up on both ps4 and xbox than got it on switch and than got a 2nd copy on xbox as a playable copy lol whats up with all your reviews being super late after launch ac3 remastered came out in like 2001 ive literally played and finished the game in the time it took for this review finally was waiting for this first lol remastard worst like always is this what they can do with next gen shame they thing people cant understand honestly its a mixed bag the environments look amazing water looks worse faces look worse the remastered edition if it was to look better would need to alter the faces to work with the lighting effects of the remaster however whats unforgivable is the worse looking water effects theyre absolutely beautiful in the original and did not need to be altered old is gold you can beat the original except for the face the remastered version actually looks good at least compared to the ezio eddition and rogue remasteredwhich is the absolutely same to the original idk man this video is hurting my eyes should run at settings that your system can handle the presentation of what you are doing is nice just the content you chose to include is poop shoulda been default or max settings at a comfortable resolution for your 1060 definitely not 2160p dislike only because im dizzy now 1005 i prefer the faces of the original so many scenes looked better in original ubisoft doesnt know how to properly remaster games they made that clear with the ezio trilogy remasters this remaster looks like the biggest fucking hackjob in a long time what were they thinking it does look better in a lot of environmental areas and lighting can look better on certain objects etc however the characters and even some environment textures and lighting are a complete joke the scene where they bury achilles looks terrible in the remaster theres a topdown shot where you can see the edges of the groundtexture the original did not have that issue look at those fps seriously almost 3040 fps drop wtf assassins creed 3 reshade reshade another bullsheit from ubishait what this comparison doesnt show is the hdr the game supports by bringing a wider more natural color palette and making the brights and darks look more natural as well the remaster is the best way to experience the game especially if your screen is properly calibrated for hdr seriuosly unisoft you fckd up the graphics lowered the framerate and deleted the original version of steam just for better lighting and a bit of uv mapping i love how you made the remastered boxart brown in the thumbnail lol i am going to buy this game i dont understand why these developers bother remastering games when it is always worse than the original and then they have the nerve to charge 40 faces look bland boring and unfinished map has better lighting reflections shadows and textures in some areas maybe if they added that tiny glow the characters has in the eyes in the original would give them at least more soul or life and if they would make darker the cutscenes ubisoft you deserve bankruptcy greedy aholes wtf i get 60 fps with 1050ti they said on a comment on twitter that they will try to fix the ugly faces of the characters i have played the whole game throughout on pc and i can agree that the faces can look pretty bad sometimes but honestly after the whole haytham part the game just gets a buff in graphics or whatever i also wonder how u managed to get under 60 fps in the game my game was running on the highest settings on a 4k monitor and the lowest i ever got was around like 65 60 fps if ur thinking of buying the remaster and this video changes ur mind i would advise to look up some more videos on youtube cause i dont think this is an accurate comparison video conclusion faces can look rubbery at time and the lighting can be off in some cutscenes but when ur playing the game and walking around town the game might aswell have been made this year some part can look very impressive i would like to see a comparison video where they were comparing moments from the whole game not just the haytham part cause there something of there the remaster has way better lighting people for some reason tend to love this bland washed out look of the old game remastered definitely looks better what is that remastered why does it look worth then original is it version from 2010 im having difficulty trying to change weapons with keyboard and mouse it doesnt allow me to use the quick weapon 1 2 3 and 4 nor can i figure out how to swap between my secondary in game its really pissing me off lol the faces and a lot of ambience is missing the faces are not as good in the remastered version just me or are the faces looking better on the original why u play 4k if your fps are always under 60 fps i would recommend u play it in 1080p or 1440p and have good fps smooth play is always better than play it with frame drops sometimes the remastered version looks better sometimes worse well i guess is really rushed what to say im 5050 and the fact that the game eat a lot more cpu and gpu power just for couple texture changes idk but well atleast we got a remastered one i hope ac2 will get one ac3 no need a remastered really but ac 2 or ac 1 need a remastered ubisoft have to look to cod mw remastered for understand what is remaster and how to made 858 look at that horrible so its one of those socalled remasters where it doesnt necessarily looks better just kind of different in most scenes lighting looks terrible and ruins the atmosphere in some it looks better like the opera plus some random changes that you wouldnt expect or want here and there like the model of the cratecontainer thing looks much more artificial and flat now very visible at 040 brightness and contrast over sharpened with too much noise reduction i dont know what it is but i froze several frames where faces were on screen and the remastered version looks terrible in that regard their faces are tired faces in remastered are made out of plastic i guess you never know whats with the shadow aliasing on character models on the remastered gg remastered is running even worse than the original this game is so poorly optimized dont u guys feel that the remaster is too dark i dont know why but i feel ac 3 is better than ac 3 remastered and see the difference at 850 maybe i am right saturation mastered original looks so much better and this game isnt even that old or bad looking it was just poorly optimized for the time it was released in what was ubisoft thinking anyway nice video as always looks like shit good thing it was free with pass how do you play remastered in pc water character faces and rain and raineffect is better than ac3 remastered in ac3 original faces look pretty bad in remastered i hateedd last gen lighting it was so flat and ugly something is clearly wrong with yours gtx 1060 mine gets 60 fps without any problems i cant believe what they did to haytham original is better than remastered they just put remastered hdr well im waiting for that thanks 3 i thought these games will be released on 29 not earlier they shouldve made it easier to find charles lee do you know if they changed the way the detection system works in this remaster cause i remember the stealth inside restricted areas such as forts being an absolute chore due to enemies immediately displaying red and approaching your position if they so much as caught a brief glimpse of you while it was then impossible for you to blend or enter a hiding spot they adjusted that in black flag though so im hoping this remaster has that kind of detection system so basically the liberation remaster takes it from psp graphics to ps3 by the looks of it i like ac3 running through trees mashing square so he twirls his tomahawkloved it and i liked the modern day sectionac3 was the last game with a decent modern day section i feel the same way about liberation its not by all means the worst ac game but i dont know is just not that interesting i wish they would removed the optional objectives those are so annoying being able to skip the credits is a reason alone to get the remaster im playing it on switch and im so happy that i havent ran into slow down in the original version whenever a bunch of guards where chasing me the game would lag really bad and im glad to say i havent seen any slowdown and this remaster gives me a chance to play assassins creed 3 liberation i never played it so im pretty excited for it i should also give ac rouge a try i love odyssey i think u didnt play ac 3 original much we can whistle from haystacks does this include the dlc since i got this included in season pass and havent had it yeti played it and enjoyed bothespecially ac 3 theme song got mebest menu music ive heard putting revelations to 2nd spotsimply 3s song sound badassywhich is slightly more than the love you 3000 feeling revelations theme gives me when thinking of ezio and the fact that unuaware if there are comics basically both his beginning and end happened in movies lineage and embers respectively worst game in the series hands down 0200 to 0220 is still one of my favorite ac soundtracks its a horrible remastered mostly because the clothing is too buggy when you change the clothes connor is wearing your tongue has tasted sour dick am i the only person that wants a new full revamp of ac2 and black flag other than origins no ac game has even come close to them in reguards to story telling and character development the robe and weapon customisation along with the parkour of unity the rpg element of odyssey beautiful world elements from black flag and similarbetter story building like in ac 2 would be great in a new game ubisoft have a nack for making something good in one game and taking it away for the next when it was the strongest selling point of the last title oh yeah and can somebody please kill fucking layla and bring desmond back already da the one who wishes to get altair outfit has to still work hard should have got stealth mode and removing boring missions then it would have satisfy me curious as to how to launch the acl remaster i havent downloaded ac3 remastered on my ps4 yet but i want to know beforehand how launching liberation works they should give ac 1 a remaster just graffics nothing else i was not one of the first players who played ac 1 as their first ac game so i tried to play it but i just couldnt after 15 hour i was just depressed and bored as fuck due to nothing but the graphics id rather have an oh my fucking god everything is orangemoment than the everythingisgrayiwanttodienowexperience i had oh and a tutorial for the combat would be nice to because combat was just impossible with the timing and all it seems your tongue has tasted sour grapes was haytham a templar or an assassin if i get this is the chest unlocking is it harder if they remade this game and tweeted some storys details to make them better id be down to buy it but as of now i see no chance of that happening and one complaint i have the subtitle size they were perfectly fine in the original so why do they take up half the screen in the remaster wait when did the ac3 theme get a native chant i stay by the normal version remasters are mostly shit a remake would be better in ac 3 i like to watch what everyone doing in the homestaythey do daily stuff so realistically basically it good now i bought it for 3 and stayed for liberation i personally think liberation is better but still think 3 was ok story wise the gameplay was mediocre but thats assassins creed in general until the new combat in origins i appreciate how honest and fair you were in this review ac3 was one of my favorite assassins creed games for a long time and honestly they hit the nail on the head with this remaster i never dove deep into liberation so its free and ill give it a go just to explore the story of aveline keep up the good work honestly i liked the quote but the way he says it seems youve tasted sour grapes is such a good meme love the new outfits the new york one is my favorite by far i didnt even know liberation existed is it me or do i hear a sound for getting detected when i play still my favorite ac game to date this remaster is amazing ill definitely get it haythambreathes connerit seems your tongue has tasted sour grapes when it showed the part where you get to boston for the first time walking with charles lee i was stunned it looks completely different and in a great way playing on my switch rn so happy a good portable ac is finally here ive never played the assassins games where do i startfuckin loads of themi got a ps4 just for red deadready for something else im thinking about getting this game for ps4 but im really having trouble deciding as a person who has not played the original ac3 i feel like i should play this game for the ps4 and try it out however there is so many individuals saying that this game is terrible and not worth buying as i said i havent played the original ac3 so this would be new to me if somebody could reply telling me if this game is worth it or not from my perspective it would be greatly appreciated i love ac3 love what the remaster has done but the face improvements are a gamebreaker for me idk i mean i have it on xobxone and its way way too bright in some parts and way way too dark in other parts i mean jfc when your in the tunnels i cant see shit its so dark even when i use the lantern light up wall torches and even use eagle vision then sometimes its so bright i cant see again its like white light idk i think it needs a few more update patches i picked up the season pass on sale for 40 and well hidden blade was on sale for 20 i dont see a deal cheaper than 40 but the atlantis dlc was 33 so i feel ive gotten a good assassins creed three remastered for free and a possibly crappy liberations ringmaster for nothing as well well woohoo this game is worthless frustrating and boring to be honest i just want to see connor and aveline kiss now its time for the og ac1 too get a remake not remastered but remade from the ground up this game is a nightmare to control i can feel the framerate fanorona morris and bowls are still the same shite they were back in 2012 pathetic disgusting ubisoft graphics looks better than rdr2 is it just me or is the music extremely quiet in this remaster i couldnt hear the amazing bar fight song while playing it i never played liberation or the washington dlc so might just jet it a time were assassins creed was awesome assassins creed 3 frames per second ezio collectionmediocre remasters of great games aciiirgreat remaster of a mediocre game good review man i personally had more fun in the remastered version because the original was just boring with grayish feel to it but the remaster its more bearable i played on pc and as far as i remember you could free aim there too its glitchy as fuck what is the name of the song in the beginning of video only thing thats annoying as hell with the remastered version is that its even more glitchy than it was before looks better my ass the water looks 8 bit and they basically removed the shaders and upped the brightness messed with the gamma and called it a day youve been blinded by corporate ubisoft early access bullshit and not a proper reviewer get your eyes checked you philistine i never buy the same game twice the only game i brought to 100 when i was 16 new or old combat system hmmmm idk if i should buy this fizhy you can skip the credits too me take my money one of best ac gamesconnor was the most honorable and strong bull headed assassinwhatever he wanted done got done also has best looking combat in any ac game still to date im surprised that you havent been covering any skull and bones news this is a downgrade not a remaster shame on ubisoft they never learn whats with the big ass gaps in between segments idk why but i just loved the tomahawk what about the off mission soundtrack in the original unless you where on a mission or in combat the was no overlaying soundtrack there already is a black flag remastered right god ive been in love with ac3 ever since it came out but the visuals were downgraded imo on ps4 faces look like theyre made out of wax eyebrows are nonexistent and in some cutscenes the lighting is so bad its like the brightness was turned to 11 or its so dark you cant see a thing on the screen to be fair the ezio triligy was far superior to assassins creed 3 in nearly every way so didnt need nearly as much improvement from a technical pr gameplay perspective 3 was a disaster to not be able to skip the 30 minute credit wheel had to be the single dumbest thing ive ever experienced in a game like salt on a severe wound still the worst ac game that is if you can actually get it to run and you arent using an xbox 1 controller since theres no support for those the new lighting is a good add to the game but they shouldve updated the character models as well the faces dont look so good compared to all the other upgrades whats the deal with ac remasters having terrible colors they just look way too saturated for the mood of the game i actually kind of prefer the originals colors connors robes are just so intensely blue now its ugly the only reason i probably liked liberation is because i played it on my psvita getting to play on the go and and looking at it as a portable title made me a bit more forgiving hey you guys remember sequence 7 mission 3 the worst mission in ac history fun fact it is exactly the same in the remastered version too you use all your arrows and poison darts to kill redcoats silently but suddenly get detected so you reload last checkpoint only to find out your ammunition is still in zero considered when the checkpoint save happened you had full ammunition glitches are still there parkour havent been improved still annoying when you wanna climb somewhere else but it just does its own thing the annoying minigames that prevented 100 completion are still there to get you to smash your controller so the trolls were right its just ac3 with a bit of orange xd what language is this in found a bug on a cutscene where if you wear any outfit they just disappear and i have the ac3 assassin outfit im downloading the game right now and only could get up to mission 3 on my cousins playstation man i hate those analog gyro sticks but gladly i only have xbox one s im native american and loved this game plot entirely lets tomahawk some red coats ac1 should be remade it would be glorious oh dat das a horses ass lol xd hi there thanks for this amazing video does anyone knows if the patch improved the faces the textures on them arent good maybe due to lights or filters but the faces looked better and more realistic in the original ac3 yesss skipping the credits the best selling point of this remaster xd no seriously those felt like they kept going for 5 hours well i think the original at least on pc looks way better im currently playing the remaster on ps4 and it looks weird sometimes its too dark and sometimes the colors are washed out and the characters look like they are made of clay i think when you consider that liberation was originally a ps vita game it has certainly come a long way the movement in this video for that game certainly looks a lot smoother i do have a bit of a soft spot for liberation as it was the first time we ladies got to play a female assassin ive only just started replaying ac3 still playing haytham and thus far in boston there seems to be very little colour so im hoping this will improve once i get to connor i do wish they had removed some of the overlays on screen even on a 65 tv they seem to cover a lot of the action ive also found that some of my opponents flop around like wet rags during fight scenes the first one on board ship at the beginning of the game which i felt a bit let down by ill try and keep an open mind though i loved ac3 the first time round so am more than happy for the chance to play it again especially as it came included with my season pass anyway are we just gonna forget the classic assassins creed bloodlines on the psp finally i can sell couches in hd the more easily spotted marksman plus free aim were both present in black flag along with whistling i believe glad they added them regardless alright ill trade in the original at cex am i the only one who prefers the old lock on system opposed to the new free aim one i dont know how someone can like this game more then ezios trilogy this game doesnt have even a fraction of great story mythology rich history art architecture mystery and beauty that ezios games head not to mention that character of ezio is in a whole different league from connor but i guess americans will relate more this game looks so good i absolutely can not wait till next gen remaster of black flag ill probably take a whole week of vacation just for that is there multiplayer am i just remembering this wrong but couldnt you always free aim on pc at least honestly i miss the davenport homestead the most how about the tyranny of king tossing bob hehe recomends ac3 the world turned upside down them frames tho guys how to start ac liberation in the ac iii remastered damn i guess i should finally play ac3 wait but is online multiplayer still in ac3 does this also have the king washington stuff editsorry commented before the very end lol assassin creed is freaking awesome fizhy and fanatic commentary stupid snow texture i thought my ps4 was dying look at the fps drops say what you want ac3 old colour palette was more immersive this remaster looks like someone just raised the saturation bar liberation is way better than everybody says i like aveline more than connor is there multiplayer for the remaster 358 does he not notice the 3 people floating on the other people whats the intro music very good improvement in gameplay and better looking game wouldnt pay over 20 tho so fuck you ubisoft nice to hear its good i wonder how good it will be on switch now if they remasterremake ac1 then all of the main ac games will be available on a single console did they fcking fix or remove trading missions i hated those is there anything negative about this remaster anyone has found i like to hear both the good and bad when it comes to remasters does it have the same combat engine or is it like origins and odyssey assassins creed 3 was my favorite might actually pick this up after im done with sekiro is that the actual framerate its terrible why should i want to skip the credits d this game finally getting its due i played the hell out of this title why on earth would i want to spend 40 on a game ive already played oh they changed the loading screens from white to black thank god those white screens gave me migraines after a while i bought odyssey a few weeks ago for 70 off i got the ultimate edition or whatever its called all for 40 then i found out i got this for free greatest deal ever i miss the times when i was still in school i would always play ac 3 when i was sick while having a soup next to me good times this is not a remaster its an upscale avoid spoilers bro the damn game is 7 years old everyone and their grandmother knows what happens in this game free aim i think the real question is did they change the horses cause those were the things of nightmares in the original why they ever moved away from the models they had in brotherhood is beyond me a remaster noone asked for ac 3 looks decent at current standarts the game that would appreciate a remaster is ac 1 is nobody gonna talk about horses idk what they did to them but they are longer and look creepy and wrong xd i hope they fix that otherwise i love this remaster really awesome game its not awesome not awesome at all because you still cannot use the right thumbstick 4 look on pc it does not recognize the xbox one x controller assassins creed odyssey plays it just fine doesnt seem like much of a remake or anyone put very much thought into it nor will let you remap the keys when you try to change the video resolution the screen just goes black and hangs there then you have to hit ctrl alt delete sometimes it doesnt work and you have to hard power down your pc you would think somebody would fix these basic problems from the original game but they didnt they just slapped a little makeup on a pig well they did fix that thing where the screen would go white when ur having that vision when ur conor which is good because i wasnt able to get full sync i hate when people say thry like colorful games i want games to be gritty and realistic like in black ops 3 it was so unrealistically colorful another excuse from ubisoft to make money 34 btw liberations looks like a mobile game xd sub if you was at the club 10hours in and ive gotten only 2 main glitches so far 1 when i randomly fell through a building and kept falling out of the world til i died 2 after coming back from desmond to connor my whole screen was totally white and i couldnt see anything so i had to reload the game ac3 was my favorite ac game fight me yeah i fully agree dont have anything else to say 045 brutal punch truly stronk and ferocious s thet was a lot of remastered at the beginning is the multiplayer here though ill buy it if it is they remastered this one when i was like 11 or 12 maybe i played this game i didnt like it at all and i wanna try it again just in case i might like it now ac3 became my favorite ac game the game industry is going downhill the climate got warmer in ac3 remastered ill buy it on sale ik its good already just figure itll be on sale soon i love this game but getting to connor is such a chore is it worth to someone who has played the game boring connor in 4k is still boring connor 940 thank god they still havent fixed desmonds hair or facial animations compare cutscene desmond to gameplay desmond its like quality downgrades everywhere i mean to think this would be where they shouldve started damnit ubisoft game only has new lighting some extra textures and resand bam now its a remaster go look at metro or final fantasy for real remasterthis here is called a regraphicretexture againdamnit unisoft mate you are my favorite assassins creed youtuber love the work keep it up gaun yersel i dunno when i think of remaster i think of say the master chief collection ubisofts remasters just seems slightly lazy does it include dlc they had the opportunity to add shay picture in achilless house and they lost a big chance i know this isnt a remake but still i had hope does the ac 3 remaster does it comes with the dlc like original ac3 had back in the day what is the name of the song in the end of the video please tell me that you can put your hood back on at the end of the game the mohawk looked cool but i was pissed that you couldnt put it back on when wearing the default outfit there are still a lot of lightingambient glitches did they remastered the main protagonist tho im enjoying haytham right now if not then sorry ill pass btw thise remaster isnt that good i played on pc on ultra and sometimes character models are shit connors skin is sometimes lighter than mine stupid polish white ass is it worth 40 for sure not i absolutely loath the remasters the have been putting out the oversaturated colours are nausiating and harsh on the eyes ezios acii was cool because it was a really dark brown cloak with a blood red lining the remastered cloak it light turd brown with pink red lining a similar thing has been done with the blue of connors outfit which is really stupid the omnipresent orange light that you mentioned is in every remaster as well the thing is if one didnt own the xbox 360 versions of ezios trilogy one could chose to buy the remaster but if one did own the classic and was using the backwards compatibility the remaster was forced upon via an update i do not know if they will pull that shit again with these two but i want none of it the piss poor changes that they made are not worth extra money or ruining a classic yet again the only fault with the game is that its too hand held just look at the objective list its a joke it seems your toungue has tasted sour grapes what the fuck is wrong with their faces this game looks weirdly cel shaded at times not a fan when are they gonna remaster unity the graphics sucks ass in that game its rectified most of the technical flaws the game has suffered from 231 floor textures pop in after the cutscene started as i have the season pass for odyssey i got these for free i didnt play any creed till origins so i thought i would give these a go and tbh i prefer the way origins and odyssey plays the combat just seems to be more fluid in those games which makes them more enjoyable did someone notice this game looks worst than the ps3 version it have so much light i cant even see shit in the snow basically download an enb and sweetfx and save yourself 9 giga bites of space great another cash grab remaster that looks worse than the original alot of pepole may love ezio music more than conners ac music but i must say the trailer song and i beleve it was mabey in the game as well it is absolutely beautiful my verdict stunning i started with this game and they just improved it absolutely no negatives other than not enough change i always feel like its weird that there remastering the assassins creed series in my opinion they didnt really age well great i can actually finish this game after almost 7 years back when i played it the first time i was a mere 9 year old kiddo and i didnt understand a word of english so 100ing the game was basically impossible i hope they will keep this standard are cutscenes skippable in the remastered version consumers do you want to make better graphics or make the game shittier ubisoft we will make the game shittier but make better graphics yes but you already were able to free aim your firearms in the old version even on console played the old version yesterday on my ps3 and its very much true all the hipsters love this game nowbecause of course they do instead of this bullshit they should have remastered black flag the weapon wheel was also in the original ac3 but was used more by pressing a button based on equipment most of those improvements were already in the game the free shooting the enemy icons the whisteling and others ac3 is for me is the greatest ac game am i retarded take a shot each time he says remastered why was there any reason people hate connor is tyranny of the king in this personally i find the facial animations to be off putting especially the eyes we are all still waiting for that black flag remastered so basically it holds your hand with better grip as you play the game so you dont face any challenge and difficulty this last ac game in my opinion desmond died and they lost their way and everything after this has been shit i liked the dark atmosphere more theres nothing wrong with the visuals well expect the faces they look awful in the remastered looked much better in the original tbh i compared them on the pc version of both the original and the remastered and while they look a bit sharper in the remastered they also have less detail look like plastic and the freaking eyes are even worse than in the original i have only played an hour of the remastered so far but im not impressed the visual changes can mostly be replicated with an easy reshade on pc of course the textures are only slightly better most of the times they seem the same i havent been able to compare improved foliage yet but so far i dont see a reason to grab the remaster if on pc console is another story of course no changes to the god awful ui as well overall im disappointed jumping from odyssey to this uh i dunno it a shame they didnt change the opening 56 hours where literally nothing happens always thought the ac3 soundtrack was the best visual artist how orange should it be game director yes result 645 but its still my favorite ac game that horse arse unity should be remasteredthe assassins creed game we deserved but never got they should have enhanced the frame rate the original release ran like utter crap so liberations is called liberations remastered remastered since its been done twice in the original the asssins can whistle when they are in the bush is the online back if i remember correctly it was the best online in ac imo unpopular opinion i actually prefer liberation to aciii this shit better than odyssey imo the parkour of ac3 is very fun crowds of a lot more people that look the same best soundtrack in the series oh my i remember how responsive conor was beautiful animations yowhats with the horses having apple bottoms one of the better remasters ive played worth it ehh sure why not the only assassins creed game which i want to be enhanced not visually but being playable is unity and this probably will never happen when assassins creed was still assassins creed after black flag it went downhill i loved part 3 part 2 of course my all time favorite if anyone has played it are there really any changes in the rem version black flag is still one of my top ten favorite games ever and if it got a remaster then id lock myself in my room until i 100 it for the 7th time only if the ezioecollection was remade then they would of had to make shit odyssey is there still piticarn pistol glitch where you select like french coat guns and fast travel and they just change to piticarn pistols it was reason why i hated game ohh and swords floating trough clothes not gonna lie ima wait for all the patches to roll out then ima buy the game whoever decided that the first two minutes of the script were necessary needs to go eat some curdled milk why does it seem to me that other than the scripted blood effects during cutscenes there are no blood stains on enemies when killed i really liked the effects on the original pc so are they gone now i see the horse doesnt have balls that shrink if its cold so graphics cant be that good so this means we getting ac 3 online with it right liberation looks better with with the remaster great game horrible faces though is it easier to equip two guns yeah but where is charles lee bro i got this game for free on xbox im new to assassins creed and ive only played syndicate black flag ac2 remastered and brotherhood remastered cant wait to get this as well the remastered is way better than the original i dont really care about the story accept for desmonds story witch i dont like but overall i do enjoyed the remastered 2 questions 1 can you put your hood down at the end of the game manually 2 can you skip the 20 minute credits now ive only played the vita version so this is a huge improvement to me because i hate digital games but ac 3 is my favorite ac game so this remaster is 100 worth it for any true fan who loves the seriesits well worth it for me i dont put the ezio trilogy on a high pedestal and why would anyone want to skip cutscenes they give you information on what to do and the story otherwise you are not gonna know what to do or anything i could go on butif you are a true fan of assassins creedyou have to give each game a chance and not play favorites i dont and i am never disappointed but yes it is worth itso glad i got ac odyssey and season pass when i preordered it and i never got to play liberation or the dlc for ac 2 so this is a major win for me as a fan of the series lemme guess hes gonna hate on this ac game as well we need a ac3 multiplayer ill buy it when it drops to 10 quid 332searches for like button cracked before release i wish ubisoft had treated rogue remastered with the same careshame on u ubi is online multiplayer still on here somebody answer i loved this game so much when it first came out its a solid remaster but as always the faces in all ubi remasters look worse than the original in certain lighting hey fizhy i got to know two things before picking up this remaster on ps4 there were a couple of minor but really annoying glitches that occurred on the original vanilla release that were never patched the first one was when fast traveling anywhere with an outfit other than connors original assassin outfit the pistol in the second holster would change to pitcairns pistol automatically you could go to a shop and requip the pistols you wanted but it was really annoying the second one was the rope dart upgrade one of the rope dart upgrades actually doesnt increase your max capacity as it should i really need to know if these glitches were patch in this remaster because they werent in the original ps3 version to this day i hope they remaster the first game next am i the only fan of altair lmao ubisoft please remake ac 1 i feel like since call of duty remastered modern warfare people aspect so much from any remastered game my only problem right now is that the ambient occlusion seems to be kinda bugged and doesnt work properly like the plants in 410 and some dead eyes in the cinematics how come when i try to start mine up on my ps4 i get a black screen and nothing happens this screen just sits here i restarted the application like 4 times now anyone else having to problem this actually seems like a great improvement and not just a remaster are the dyed robes colors in the cutscenes this time skip the credits ok now you conviced me xd yakuza kiwami 1 2 absolutely brilliant games are remakes the ezio collection was a remaster now thats what i call a review unfortunately ever since i experienced the ending to ac3 years ago i vowed to never touch this game again and that will probably never change imagine liberations got remastered twice fizhy i dislike ac3 also fizhy continues to play it delicious youre being a bit tough on liberation it was a fucking hand held game lol not a full aaa console release i really hope the infinate guard glitch is still there had fun for hours taking on an army even though you could not do that in bunker hill what is the outro song can you kill civilians like in the original or did they get rid of that assassins creed lll saturation edition connor shoots charles lee in the nuts you left the faces out skip the credits i want to skip the fucking intro connor one of the most badass assassin i havent even finished odyssey yet and i dont think i will thanks for your opinion they need to make a 3rd person version of ac chronicles china in ac3 did they make it so you could do parkour or you still have to walk around the streets like a punk did they update the naval combat i dont have either game should i spend 30 on the remaster or get the og for 10 i think i know why there is the orange similar happens sometimes when i color correct a image that has already been color corrected they should remake ac1 did they fix the really bad notoriety mechanics meaning did they fix the posters and print shops big disappointment looks worse than the original in pc i love the darker colder tone of the old version and btw sometimes the characters looks like shit in the new one the only thing that have goten beter is the nature the darker colder tone of the normal makes it feel like real life boston in the 1770s and makes it feel more magical the frame rate is still shit a remastered disappointment is still a disappointment where can i find this game for pc ive been looking for it on steam and its not there are the costumes in cutscenes now sadly there is no ambient occlusion what a shame how do you download it on xbox 1 because its still not in the store or in my games and apps they should remake the ezio collection better mechanics graphics visuals and so on maybe it will be hard to do the same voices again but could just use the ones from the old game and sync it what i want to know is why is it a 60gb download in fact most games as re coming out with huge download sizes these developers need to compress their shit sekiro just came out from fromsoft and it is now 168 gb huge dense demanding graphics and gameplay and zero issues i i cant even buy the game on the steam store or the uplay store yet they give a copy to all these youtubers to review what a shambles im i the only one who doesnt remember there being horses in this game and this is one of my fav acs so lets review a game we reviewed a coupole of years ago wtf is wrong with you people u could have played the old one toosame shit great review whats the performance like the 360 version framerate chugged will the tyranny of king washington be added to this remaster ship combat get the black flag makeover better review than ign thank god they worked on the weapon wheel that thing would pull you from the experience dont expect a patch from ubisoft they never patched the original and left it with many bugs that really pissed me off willl unity ever get a remaster i want to see the dlc outfit on this game from day one can some one help me i got the season pass but i dont see any assassin creed 3 how am i supposed to do rogue didnt need any improvements ezio collection needed a graphical update still does in my opinion assassins creed 1 deserves the resident evil 2 halo 1 treatment the loading screen is also not bright as fuck lol the unskipable credits that no player wanted ac 3s soundtrack gives me goosebumps every freakin timeeee no one seems to mention the one thing ac3 did perfectly that hasnt been touched in the remastered and that is the soundtracks they really captures all the emotions no matter the cenario if u looking for a game to be completely remade a remastered will never do that lmao halo remastered what is it learn more whats a remastered dumbass watchvzhkejncvxjs disliked totally for no reason get detected i actually always found this to be pretty realistic youre a native guy in a dirty weird suit wearing a hood while no one else does and opencarrying a bunch of weapons including a pistol a bow and tomahawk charles lee cock in fizhys asshole charles lee is a totally underrated villain return to arkham situation where its better and worse should have fixed the running animation i hate it they should remaster ac1 and ac bloodlines great review really touched every points never had a problem with this game except that it ruined the series modern story tried replaying it on ps3 and it did not age well visually this remake seems like it has improved the gameplay enough to merit a replay the game was considered a legacy title in my ps3 digital collection but may earn a spot on my ps4 ac3 is a mixed bag for me as i liked the change of setting compared to prior games but it killed the series by taking out desmond and having a boring lead character it was also a little too cinematic heavy it takes a while to get going and the final assassination was literally a cutscene the only good things are travering the frontier and combat might have to pick this one up didnt care much for this back in the day but this looks great only thing i hate about all of those remaster games is that they are only for consoles and not pc release as well thats what pisses me off iam surprised they didnt change the ugly ass health bar i dare you guys to watch latest video on my channel and tell me the name of the video 646 i am hurting my eyes so orange is this coming to steam my only question is multiplayer omfg i can skip the credits shut up and take my cash in the pc you have the free yinhu i might go and buy this i will definitely try to platinum this game unlike when i played it on the ps3 cant even get this on ps store in canada they have to improve the faces in the next patch they look weird like clayfaces sucks how i have to go to the store to buy this since it isnt available on the ps store unless i buy odyssey gold edition assassins creed 3 was and i say still is my favorite ac game i think i have like 1000 hours played of it on steam to see it remastered means im hyped to play it with the updated visuals and the new smaller tweaks like the minimap plus new legacy outfits im excited i seriously hope they improved altairs outfit for connor where the robes arent fucking glued to his legs we only want a remake for assassins creed 2 we asked too much there is a release patch at least for pc that is 1680 gb i am sure it will address a couple of the items you mentioned in this review theres one weasel looking dude that looks like real life weasel adam schiff man oh man sure hope this doesnt remind everyone about that story they basically abandoned or that one dude that died at the end and that lore that once was easy to follow this game looks great now wow way better then ezio remaster which was worst then the original you only dislike ac3 cause your a lobsterback lol it would be amazing if i cpuld play it considering i bought the collectors edition glad u all get that shit free constantly am i the only person who wants to experience assassins creed and spiderman ps4 in first person maybe not oh great this shitty game is back again complete with protagonist that was given all the personality of a wet mop and missions more bland and repetitive than a drake album it would be amazing if they added something about shay christ almighty why do the characters look like they came out of a photo realistic aardman production did they change the lockpicking they should remaster and fix unity fid it fix lock picking liberation wasnt good i agree but i what i really liked was the persona system i was quite dissapointed that they didnt exapnd it a bit more i could have offer a bit of hitman feel which is something ac needs imho its nice to have something positive again most news on the gaming front tends to be negative these days very well made video ur content is always very enjoyable and good to watch and i like that ur honest about how u feel about games u dont lie and say what people wanna hear u say what u actually think of a game keep up the good work mate ubisoft really made injustice with ezio trilogy compared to ac3 remaster i wont forgive ubisoft for that nice nice nice fizhy thank you for this perfect video ill definitely play the remaster soon so long as this isnt the full on 60 then ill be getting this soon if not ill wait for a sale they should do this to the ezio collection i couldnt agree with you more about your opinion on acl fizhy its literally the only game i havent finished and dont intend on finishing all that is needed now is the first assassins creed remaster and i will be so happy is fizhy british or australian i cant tell fizhy is recommending people to play ac3 ubisoft finally won this is the ultimate victory fr remaster looks fcking dope loved this game but it had its issues and most of it have been fixed so good stuff did they give edwards running animation to connor my god that footballlike running that connor had in the original game was ridiculous if this can be confirmed let me know i actually do hate my body and i want to die its either that or remain a virgin and watch your videos hmm take a shot every time he says remastered lol remaster looks even better then what i expected can not believe there remastering my favorite game of all time did they improve that eagle mission easily the single most frustrating experience from ac3 that stands out the most for me wait call of duty modern warfare remastered was made from ground up i know nobody plays an ac game for the multiplayer but does it still got it and if it does any changes to it how much time will it take to complete the whole series from ac1 to odyssey is it worth playing all completing the series i gotta be honest the orange colors really hurts my eyes the first time ive experience this is from far cry primal fizhy is longer a america hater lmao love ya fish im on ps4 and i got the season pass for odyssey how do i install it i cant find where you can whistle in haystacks in the normal version oh shit the weapon wheel on the fly is really a big change for me honestly i like how this remaster looks so im really considering picking it up because i hated ac3 on a mechanic level i felt it was made to annoy the fuck outta me unpopular opinion ac3 is one of the best if not the best game in the ac series 1254 the feels lol but the buttpiraters on reddit were saying they could do a better job graphically with reshade idk wtf that is but ive yet to see a mod completely fix most of aciiis technical issues lol i used ktmx mod and it looks better than this remaster no one ubisoft lets make a remaster and downgrade the faces 347 to make it like the ps2 version of san andreas i guess i remember i got so good at this game i could defeat armies of guards by tapping that quicktime combo whenever a guard tried to attack me and never get hit i would counter kill instantly any that lunged at me eventually i got bored of that after killing like 300 at a time and had to lay the controller down to give myself a break man this is arguably one of the easiest games ive ever played but i enjoyed it it was genuinely a good game im actually wearing an assassins creed 3 shirt and i didnt even plan to i just noticed haha some parts look better others look over saturated like 413 never really had orange problem with remaster maybe set your screen setting to standerd or cool my screen setting is on standerd its on vivid with 51 brightness and 80color and contrast 55 and that fixed my problem with orange colors extremeitysorey for grammer nice review i like it unity is still the best lol i have the odyssey season pass and i still dont know how to preload the game one of my favorite games of last gen and my favorite ac game cant wait for the remaster to hit the switch i just want to see the 1st assassins creed as a remaster will this be out at midnight not real confident because i havent seen it in the store at all trying to wait it out to get a jump on te download pretty annoying that rogue didnt get this treatment i set my tv color all the way up which means there is better color im gonna be seeing the fucking sun when its orange welcome back desmond i missed u so much one question ac iii or odyssey for me personally the lack of actual ac in odyssey has left the taste of sour grapes in my mouth i dont think that playing liberations is necessary for the story part of the franchise it is a side part for simply extra gameplay does sprint still right click or shift now i got two questions but did they fix that you have my everlasting gratitude sir glitch and is benjamin franklin in that general store when playing as connor or is he still not there spoilers game came out 7 years ago the orange and teal effect they use that shit in movies too nowadays tell me if you can reduce the subtitle size and im just waiting for ac 1 remaster the remastered looks sick asf no multiplayer absolute waste of time xd kinda happy that they included liberation since i never played it before so id say getting the season pass for odyssey was a good deal even though odyssey is complete shit that should have never been made i really wanna play ac3 remastered but im never gonna waste my money on ac odyssey to get ac3 remaster awesome video as always does it come with all the dlc stay alive and wach my videos quote from fizhy truly inspirational they better put some patches in this remaster cause if they leave it the way it is theyll get some fire on them i loved assassins creed liberation on the ps vita so no change to the naval combat that was the only thing that really sucked to me about the game how do i download it i have the season pass but it wont show on any of my menus i havent seen it in anyones video so far but the faces sometimes seem to have lighting issues and ive enjoyed it so far maybe some mods will help enhance the experience even more like some more lighting effects where needed and some texture and model replacements also some improvements to the faces would be nice but overall the game is fun and a nice revisit id like to ask how much hard drive space does it require and if they fixed the map reveal thing even if you synchronized all view points on the map not all of it was revealed i like the old assasins games more because they focus more on the story in my opinion and i am not a big fan of grinding in odyssey this game looks fucking beautiful i become less patient as the days go by tomorrow i shall get this game please stay alive and watch my videos fizhy shillhy cant wait but ubisoft missed an opportunity here they should have included rogue remastered it could have been named the colonial pack and had all three games you forgot something where is charles lee there is no point in all of these early reveiws coz ubsioft put out on their official forums that there will be a day one patch with the size of 18gb which will make a huge difference to a lot of things so do the cutscenes still just have connors blue robes or will the different outfits show up in cutscenes ty for starting this shit with 2mins of nothing i liked the editing and pacing of the video good work fizhy i think the cold colors of the original gave it personality and i quite like it ill se when i play the remaster myself but so far it just looks like an orange filter i think the only in this series that deserves a total remake is really the first game some fans who have joined the series from unity or origins havent really experienced the first game that started it all i think it would really enhance the experience for many of the fans that havent played it it seems your tongue has tasted sour grapes so modern warfare remastered is it a remake or a remastered i wish all the white font text was changed too like silver from the alpha footage the white text was blends with some of the lighting that u cant even see it the face textures looks way better in ac 3 than the remaster the only differences with the weapon wheel in the remastered is that its not taking away your visual from the combat in the previous ac 3 you can open the weapon wheel like in ac2brotherhoodadm revelation but it sucks because it taking away your view from the combat i can finally skip the credits wasnt there freeaim in the original im actually pretty surprised how much positive praise you give to the remasterer personally i really liked ac3 and was pretty happy to hear we were getting it on the current gen and now im even more happy to hear about all the nice changes they added to the game awesome do you like the ac multiplayer absolute shit jk remake vs remaster remake meaning they take an existing game and completely remake it from the ground up the end goal is for this new game to be the same as the old game but with as many aspects as possible improved upon without chaining the core game remakes are often performed when a game has gotten so old that the assets in the game are of no use and even the best technology to remaster them is no use remaster meaning a remaster is when you take an existing game make some tweaks and improvements and remaster it on a new platform this is typically the fastest as the game is already built and functional all they really do is port it to another system and improve aspects of the game to take advantage of what the new system has available eg trophiesachievements network features better resolution etc i heard the face of the characters got downgraded or look ugly its that true piss filter is too strong other than that its great fizhy did i mention you could skip the credits now press skip ad plays this is what the rogue remaster should have been i expected you to straight up shit on this game also 452 looks like aang got turned into bubble gum xd im definitely picking this up on the switch ac3 is the best i dont care what anyone says well already loved ac 3 so gitty up is this available for everyone now or just season pass holders at the minute you should use footage from the original to compare my favorite assassins creed is back and better than ever how do i buy the game i cant find it in the playstation store looks like your horses ass has tasted sour grapes they shouldve added shay as a target in some kind of dlc where connor travels to france kills shay and takes the box from him and hides it in the crypts below saint denis it seems your toung has tasted soured grapes but does a dyed outfit show up in cutscenes tho thats my biggest concern i like the old ones yeahhh easy combat but wy not right your a assasins u are a trained killing machine so its normal you can handel yourself and wat is rong with a nice detailed city ore land and sea and a good storry sry for english 100 and platinum here i come there was free aiming in the original ac3 it was even part of the main mission with haytham they just diddnt hold there weapins up when they did it already got the season pass so it should be downloadable around midnight can i get it early does it download differently for other time zones i love liberation first time giving players a female protagonist ezio collection was more than visual improvements they fixed the missing audio in sequence 12 sequence 13 when ezio talks to that irish monk after saying goodbye to caterina sforza you can hear what theyre saying to each other now instead of just reading the subtitles nobody else complained about that was it only a 360 thing i will ty n get this game if i can i just hope i can get it with my season pass for ac odyssey how had i never heard of liberation i thought black flag came after 3 is liberation like a kinda small game as you also have with black flag you know with that black guy or is it a complete other game what i think when i play the vids hope he doesnt hate it cuz he british for everyone whos wondering if the wolf outfit from the dlc is included in the main game it is i wanted multiplayer so fuck the remaster im not buying the game im getting it with the season pass great video fizhy that part with the skip able credits got me like now that is a remaster good job ubisoft oh wait what i thought ac 3 remastered was ac odyssey go left connor i did wrong things with random npcs in this game oh i love if as much as i love charles lee and ezios big stick its really strange playing this game as a british person why was ac3s soundtrack so good woooah look at that weapon menu no more cutting to an entirely different screen awesome hype for this game rogue remastered was porting pc version to consoles which by itself is an upgrade i know most say this game is bad but im stuck getting it theres nothing i can do about it you just hate it because ur british the video saturation is killing me can you wear your hood in cities now when does this launch why does every cutscene look awful i barely remember the story of ac3 not because it was so long ago but when i played for the first time and i was much younger i skipped all the cut scenes because i wanted to get into the action looking forward to playing this tomorrow wow fizhy said something nice about ac3 but not conner lmao horse looks shit but horses in odyssey dont look any better incognito conner walks past guard guard seize him if you played this game back when it came out youll remember all the great videos that came out about ac3 smoshs ac3 music video a masterpiece the girl the violin oh and radioactive for the trailer song my favorite assassins creed game so fucking excited to pick up this bad boy skip the credits count me in please tell me you can wear the aquila outfit the ship version whenever you want in free roam now 241 they shouldve removed those damn annoying kids when is the og assassins creed getting a remaster i think it deserves one cant wait to grab this for switch hi fizh boy fizhy r u gonna do a walkthrough on ac3 remastered probably not just wondering tho wait we can skip the credits well im sold great review this is a very professional review very nice you had me at you can skip the credits rip revelations wow really beautiful just remaster the good shit like ac4 come on ubi do different colored outfits show up in cutscenes now kudos to ubisoft for not just giving out review codes to youtubers who love ac3 assmans creed 3 demastered review assassins creed iii mastered wait what about the lock picking when you are gonna rank you ac games would you rank the remasterd or the classic and did the remaster chage your opinion of the worst ac game did they fix the naval combat is it like black flag now here to fined a remaster and is it coming to steam and pc welcome to ac3 where the whole fucking earth made the game that mission at 655 was the bane of my existence when i was younger drink every time he says remaster as an ex vita owner i can say that you ciudnt aim freely though you could look around while aiming at someone it looks great ngl ubisoft i didnt expect this from you the tomahawk is one of the best ac weapons ever i like how this remaster improves the game most only improve the visuals like the ezio collection i wish that had also received some improvements only thing that looks weird is connor and haythama hair are like jet jet black at 212 from where did you get this variation of the main theme music these credits manwhen i played ac 3 for the first time in the xbox 360 i thought it was stuck on the credits because it took so much time i have the ac odyssey season pass and now i will replay all the first ac titles during easter 12 brotherhood revelations and 3 connor with the poetry it seems your tongue has tasted sour grapes yes fucking yes if its true about what you said about not being detected while running through the streets then im sold still better than batman return to arkham thank you ubisoft for porting ac3 to ps4 did they add the speech im guessing they shouldve remade it wheres charles lee achilles looks fucking amazing yes sir fizhy sir i shall stay alive and watch your videos omg u can finally skip the credits the credits were literally and hour long it would be amazing if they added connors cut speech and haythems from the book would have made the remaster perfect assassin creed orange edition are there more open world activities in the remaster your game was lagging in some parts question i preordered assassins creed odyssey gold edition for ac3 remastered but i cant find it in my library on ps4 so idk how to get it am i the only one that rememberd free aim was a thing in ac 3 2012 atleast with a bow i just wanted to tell you that i have never played ac3 how do i access this lets be honest assassins creed hasnt be good since ac 3 prove me right steven prove me right roadhouse who would win in a fight connor or charles from rdr2 we need classic assassins creed games like 3 and black flag thanks for making this review man anybody know if liberation is on the disc or its a code that comes with it didnt they bring back the whistling in 4 and syndicate i think this is better than assassins creed odesseyy ive been looking forward to this count dooku 19bby how do i even download it i cant find it on psn i only have one question did they get altars outfit right this time connor it seems your remastering skills tasted sour grapes ubi surprised face super underrated game in hindsight its a gem compared to what came after where is charles father has graced us with more content thank you fizhy very cool freaking epic it seems your tongue has tasted the sour lore cant wait to hear charles lee all over again love this game hillo thare first it looks good im happy assassins creed iii demastered thanks for rewatching me play this game after all these years really means a lot to me template to talk about peace but they want to control everything like the german nazis butchering but when it comes to assassin creed they make peace with everybody but some templars may be good like the rogue assassin i have to be honest assassin creed thats how rather be rick long says lets do this from canberra nerds inc what should i do next pls inform wtf how did you skip im still waiting for the credits to finish best game the world moral of the story the templars were right all along did they fix how connors hood would stay off after beating the game if you use the original outfit from sequence 5 or 6 i wished he wouldve just kept connors original assassins outfit not change it it doesnt look right with the other ones ac rogue was my favourite but ac 3 what second what no music i am really disappointed that brad didnt even play ac liberation remastered last mission note ini boston go there and you didnt find the mission assassins creed liberation remastered can you please play assassins creed the ezio collection i want a remaster of black flag play assassins creed rogue and you will find out who killed charles dorian in assassins creed unity and eventually rogue is an awesome game too like black flag almost hey brad are you gonna do the dlc and liberation pretty shitty ending play the dlc pls i miss the classic assassins creed ao much i never understood the end of this game and i never really liked the end at all how do you get that outfit on conner that end is quite sad connor fought to save his peoples village and in the end it was all for nothing and they still had to leave anybody else think desmond looks like an ape in this game can anyone else not sprint in this game cool such a cool idea to make the apple log a free roam and not just simply entering a free roam what is this shit xd i just spent 20 minutes on the original credits cause there was no skip button if you know the whole assassins creed lore and story it really has a beautiful story juno is related to yoda somehow remember feeding pigs doritos back in 2012 please do the homestead mission and use the ac3 original costume alright hey brad will you finish the last episode of the legacy of the first blade really awesome playthrh ubisoft honestly the worst game developers like deadass made the graphics worst smh ah so there is hax i thought they were removed this game is so boring you still got the dlc to do and assassins creed liberation remastered to do ac4 was one of the 1st games released on new gen consoles was only released on ps4 and xbox one now that i have happily experienced ac3 the only way i will ever experience ac3 pls do liberation thank you so much for finishing this series for a while i thought u were just going to drop it but u went all the way thanks again looking forward to seeing more great

dlc please do you wanna play division 2 on ps4 play the first assassin creed this remaster looks super gross this game ends on a major cliffhanger i guess there are dlcs for it that ive never brought

want this game to end i remember watching these videos when the game first came out to help me out if i got stuck respect bro i think u got a glitch on that scene at the village because connors body

drag your games i can watch it all day dont forget the king washington dlc if its present would love it if did a video there is comic series if any want to see more of the juno story line nobody plays

face stuff is there a multiplayer and this releases after i buy the dlc just my damn luck this remaster is the best the only thing i would change are the faces everything looks so much better and

to go through this doorbut i dont know when theres a open door infront im playing it on ps3 and it is epic i watched every single video of this series for 1st time i think does brad ever put teh power source in i have a feeling he doesnt lol why is connor so obsessed with charles lee the only way to stop an execution is to clothesline the tobeexecuted so the attention can be focused on me theradbrad wooo lets get it thats a nice outfit you are a noob you know that come here buddy stabs him in the back brad the master assassin is aguilar ahguelar why did you turn off the soundtrack can you do ac odyssey please if i see another video of him countering and throwing enemies i might just have to dislike for the first time ever i love that assassins creed movie outfit nobody ever remembers desmond just picked up a a gun why didnt he use his silenced gun while playing as desmond miles aguilar havent heard that name in a while brad please when youre in the present day explore the place to hook up the power sources id loke to see what happens press counter once then press attack omce enemy will die this outfit looks so sick damn sees theradbrad in next video how convenient brad uploads another video me who needs sleep anyway why all security guards in abstergo are black people thats so racist homestead missions homestead missions homestead missions homestead missions homestead missions homestead missions homestead missions please do it brad why this remasters lighting and graphics looks like a downgrade i heard there are some new dlc missions for this game is that true please play those too would be fun brad please also do the kings tyranny dlc for this game the problem with this game and many others nowadays is theres no chairs for brad to throw anymore how inconvenient it doesnt look good on connor if it was on ezio itd look better love your video bro pls do giveaway aguilars outfit fits arno why connor sound like edward kenway because he is his grandson my god its hard for someone who is a master in ac game like me watching this videodoesnt he know press counter then attack instead of counter then throw or hurt nice breg keep uploading dont get stressed out not gonna lie when connor wears the master assassin suit he looks like hes from star wars brad pls press circle then square in fights stop holding circle though the movie couldve been better i must admit aguilar had a badass look hence the thumbnail icon which has been unchanged for three years love the aguilar outfit though i kinda didnt like the movie great video brad keep it up brad how about doing a metal gear solid 4guns of the patriots for the next retro walk through series we all need to show homage to the great kojima 1711 brad does a counter kill confirmed brad uploads

press square straight after countering you will kill the enemy instantly i wont stop trying till he finally gets the hang of it dude please explore the place already remember that power thing from

last night and it will be 5 more parts total i will be playing world war z next week along with other stuff and also starting days gone and mortal kombat 11 the week after thanks for all the support fam this is how many times radbrad said so guys this walktrough helps me a lot i got stuck on multipal ocasions i swear connor is such a bland dufus sour grapes what a loser such a stereotype whoever wrote his character should be shot to deathlol wow this game looks fantastic it looked pretty good with the ps3 to begin with but on this its downright amazing to be perfectly honest i thought out of all the ac games for ps3 that this was graphically the best one not storywise though connor geeky whiney stereotype cool i like how he is wearing his grandfathers outit infront of his father thank you brad brad has gotta be one of the most wholesome and chill youtubers but also retains that entertainment value like the way he plays games is so organic and relatable lol 1301 the moment ive been waiting for bruh tbh with how many games this guy plays i feel like he should be pretty good at this but hes really not good at any games he plays pretty sure i have brain damage from slapping my head in frustration watching brad counter and throw enemies someone was saying you mean everyone lol 335 338 im going to say that in every argument ever hey guy congrats on 10 mil probably late af but still beside id play the song hes a pirate when playing this mission the song reminds me a lot of jack sparrow and connors grandfather for some reason i think you should play it on pc when your square button is broken 1323 when youre dad strong asf and beats you you even liked a comment that was telling u to press square after the counter when i was watching this video i was like may be this time he will press attack button after counter but all i got was certain disappointment ive never even heard of someone struggling with an assassins creed game so much this is the poorest ive ever seen brad play but im still a fan connor is the bitchiest assassin yea brad i am doing this playthrough on my small channel as well even with commentary i still got copyrighted lol its ridiculous will you play the game ancestors by the makers of ac and connor definitely didnt skip arm day freaking youtubenot giving me notifications i hope they remaster watchdogs happy to see that the latest trending game is assassins creed 3 remastered sad part is coonor killing his dad when you fight brad stop holding circle man stop just press it and then press square dont fucking hold circle literally man conor is a fool i favored haytham point of view hey someone please suggest me a game should i buy assassins creed 3 remastered jump force days gone or sekiro please play dead island2 why dont they ever included all the costumes and colors from ac2 the just keep giving us brother hood brad i love your videos unfortunately for gods sake man some viewers in here are right i will give you a tip when you are in conflict or in a combat situation when an enemy tries to hit you parry them by pressing the circle button then press x button for disarm then deal with your enemy go on for that simultaneously please brad god damnit i hope you see this comment brads titles are getting worser thats not theradbrad i used to watch connor is like edward except instead of being a badass pirate hes a whiny native love the assassins creed series cant wait till you upload world war z and days gone found your channel on the last of us and walking dead tell tale series years ago keep up the great content enemies that block your attacks you have to break there defense then attack plus only 22 parts for this game cmon these people made other titles and good games and i can say im a little disappointed with how the graphics turned out b slap of death father and son and son edward haythem connor g for big guys you press x to break their defence why is he still not not attacking after pressing the counter button to counter attack it makes me cringe roses are red violets are blue my name is dan i have a gun get in the van quote from a vine video the bigger and tougher enemies you have to disarm you do that by holding rt or the run button and then countering and pressing x the weaker ones you need to kill instead of throwing so you use square when you counter hey brad what was your best ac game plzzzzzzzz reply brad for the big guys when you press counter you press x to break their defence for the small guys as soon you counter them press square to instantly kill them your welcome please try pubg he should use his pistol more black flag has the best ship battles those legendary ship battles hi rad brad i wanted to tell u that detroit is connected to the upcoming game world war 3 finally after 18 part finally brad realize he can counter attack i actually didnt play ac3 but when i saw the exact same outfit in ac4 i was like assassins creed for remastered when u goy against the big guys just quick shoot him with triangle or try not to go for a big combo against them also is it possible u will do some side missions on this in extra parts for the ac 3 remastered community watching this like if the combat at sea triggers u when he atack prees circle in justic and square was the best creed then best creed now bradcounter with circle once pressing it a second time throws them you press square after circle 1316 you know what i do in these situations i use my gun mission called father and son look at the robes he wears in the mission keep up the good work

theradbrad benjamin church was a radbrad fan in his time how convenient use x button to break defense for heavy guys dont always use counter cause randomly they can counter your counter attacks who here think brad should post this game atleast every 6 hours i hope you upload sekiro today hey brad you should start or at least try to give a short on ghost of tsushima it will be super cool hes wearing his grandpas outfit and haythams dads outfit if you think about it hes playing the game like its syndicate when the controls are completely different break defense with x to kill the big guys ive already finished it years ago i loved this game and my cousins xbox took it away from me you cant counter the big ones only the small onesthe big ones needs to be disarm and then you can kill them by a series of attacksalso its been a pleasure to watch you play the gamethanks for going back in past and bring this beautiful game brad is a dumbass but i still like him sort of im 22yrs old and im autistic and i play games better than he ever will all these years of playing video games still shitty in playing them frustrating seeing connor wearing his grandfathers outfit and become the ship captain makes me smile haythem we dont know whats on the other siiiiii loading screen haythemiiiiiidddeee will the private videos ever go back up you must press not hold the counter button wew what an excellent gamepaly ah come on ubisoft if the memory coridorsthe place where you go when you kill someone does not have the a bitter truth theme why it is nearly not dramatic when you kill a templar i love your videos even if i dont see it i always smash that like button wasnt black flag the one with ships why call it 3 also never heard it was getting remastered what was changed yo connor your daddy is evil real evil u talk too much just talk a bit less and try to play like a professional u cant fight properly try not to reduce health so much u normally play stupidly its because u talk too much i an done this game of tow days a big sigh brad sit here listen u gotta press o counter then box to attack for counter attack i have an exam after 30 min and im watching brad how convenient search fo chests you ganna get so much money i got 8k 222 what the woow wtf i just had a tseries advertising pepsi they need to remakeremaster acblack flag im stuck on this mission i hate ship battle oh brad can you say fuck you chair i miss that damn connor looks good in his grandpas robes lmao your videos are awsome can you shout me out i would like to see more parts of the game hey rad brad you should watch star wars new teasr trailer realget plz play assassins creed rogue lmao press the counter button the square to kill the foot soldier guys immediately other characters you will need to break their defense and then attack or you can press counter and triangle to blast him with your pistol or counter and x to break their gaurd because some opponents are like that i think u might accidentally be hitting circle twice because when your fighting u just keep spamming the attack and counter buttons it happens but if u press circle and then square take ur time and u will learn it videos demonetiezed for ingame music is just stupid play all of those watchdogs symbols to get assassin recuits pls brad read my comment just press b and then x when they attack you to intant kill them its amazing how conor kept his hat after all this mess d brad you gotta counter and press square ubisoft should have worked on the controller as capcom did with resident evil 2 brad is there not new games comimg out i hope so its always surprising when you agree with what haytham said assassins creed iv black flag is in a ps4 theradbrad for a second i feel like hatham was edward i actually just finished dexter so i ge that 3050 assassins creed rogue reference brad some of ur videos are missing its really hard to watch you play my favorite assassins creed game i loved playing this game when facing brutes you should break defense or disarm them with weapon u should try liberation remastered next remember about breaking defence with those strong guys they really are harder to take down anybody else find it funny that conners wearing his grandpas hood you can only encounter to regular army but for higher level army with the bag and other with wig hair need to break defence to death the guy in the thumbnail is edward kenway the protagonist of ac 4 black flag the beat ac of all time i thought this was gonna be ac 4 man of war fight not ac3 i feel like i got ripped of since i mainly clicked because of the thumbnail brad got bitch slap to death this is when assassins creed had good storylines radbrad there is a extra mission at the end of the game connor sounds like edward kenway one day he will master ultra instinct right now he has omen defense and later on he will master offense hey brad first time i saw your channel was to watch the original assassins creed 3 when do you want to play days gone does anybody even know that connors original outfit given to him by his mentor wasis actually the remastered version of edwards outfit from ac4bf brad killed that decoy first yet he was talking somehow can you do a vid about world war z never got the chance to finish assassins creed 3 because my disk got scratched barely got through it too love from the uk brad 3 press circle and then square to counter attack you need to parry not counter parry by holding then attack brad click square while countering loving the series brad keep up the great work i would love

defense you will have a greater chance to take them out break defense on the big guys dont keep hitting circle continously idiot you just have to circle once then hit square to do why dont you get it love you learn to combat in this game you are not suppose to combat like that in game developers will laugh at you when they see you combat like this upload the rest of videos quick i have to see your combat dont dissapoint me xd we are same age btw lol 1745 to 1755 is just so funny how he says we dont know whats on the other siiiii then cut away to iiiiiiide i am professional on assassin creed but if someone asks me which one offers the toughest combat i would say assassins creed iii odyssey is different oops i was thinking of assassins creed black flag why does connors uniform look like the uniform from ac4 im a god in this game ive taken out all the legendary ships pro tip 2 just hold circle when there is a red triangle above the enemy then when time slows down pres square to kill them instantly however this will not work for officers or granadiers you have to do the same except instead of pressing square to kill press x to break guard them x again to put them to thr ground then kill them can u do another part today you havent played assassins creed rogue its just like 4 but provides a lot of backstory wow this game is very nice this game is very entertaining please stop by

up its a good game brad learn how to counter right new part like i waited forever for this much love brad sadly dont look better then the original this is my favourite assassins creed game of all timefuck the opnionsac3 is the best to me i think they did great but those where still some pretty sicc graphics back in the original faces look like a sack of balls ambient occlusion its feckin important the introductory screen is the only part that looks even remotely improved everybody mention faces but nobody mentioned how they fixed all the broken shadows should i buy this game on sale for 13 bucks on steam til may 27th this look good except for the faces which looks weird haha much more light and definition in the new version awesome ac video and congratulations on the views assassins creed looks like it was made by ea the extra textures are paid 331 lmao that guard just came up to him and pushes him those calling it reshaded have no appreciation and literally have no idea the hard work and dedication that was put into this its waaaay better than the original go fuck yourselves honestly just looks like they threw an enb onto the game which would have probably ran better theres a 20 fps loss on the remastered the original looks better in the dark and the remastered one looks better in the light a assassins creed 1 remake remastered assassins creed 2 remake remastered assassins creed brotherhood remastered assassins creed revelations remastered assassins creed 4 black flag remastered call me a stickler but it just looks lime they put a new lighting engine on and turned up contrast and downed the saturation original looks way better its like assassins creed iii demastered too lazy to grind through 6 sequences i would be way more inclined to buy this game if they didnt handhold you through the first five hours of storymode gameplay wow they removed the yellow filter unless its done properly with the models being done to unity standards in the same engine im interested theyve done all but 1 so hopefully theyll do the first one like that measure the response and then design and release all the rest properly one at a time in the original release order got to hold out hope rebecca looks like gay in remastered i wish they wouldve fixed the faces of rebecca and desmond instead of making them look like they had plastic surgery for people who are confused they made the remaster look bad because they wanted it to fit on switch they are selling you the same game twice fuckin scam scenarios look gorgeous faces not so much i hope they can fix this via some patch im so impressed with ubisofts remastered version they really did a fantastic job oh and btw great video your sidebyside comparison was really well presented keep up the great work and stay humble i feel like theres not much of a graphics change between the original and the remastered it looks like it was just colour graded differently and thats it the remastered looks rushed in my opinion ac3 is probably my second favourite ac behind black flag so it is annoying that the remastered graphics are kinda bad the faces i dont know why ubisoft doing this its fail original is better than the remastered they both pretty much look the samebut the colors in remastered are brighter and lighting is better my lnly complains no glowing eyes in the opera scene when you kill that old guy to tell you the truth i find it very stupid how bad the original graphics are compared to remastered light was now spot on and befor everyone looked like clay and the light was not even close to today ubisoft cant remaster games 046 william miles got older wth fuck i just downloaded the original earlier fuck u ubisoft maybe you call me crazy but i prefer the original have more indentidy the remaster just has a lot of contrast and some light effects 438 so remastered is ac 3 with a new enb but potato mode activated the original loook alot better in many ways man again faces manage to look uglier congrats ubisoft will stay on the old version in the original it looks like the game is on max brightness best theme song for any game imo love it please do it whit ac2 acbrotherhood and revelations i have the same feeling as of the comparisons between san andreas on ps2 and the remastered ps4 version while in details the new version looks better the overall quality is much more consistent in the original these more intensive colours and lighting just highlight the aged character models all characters in the remaster look like crap the original looks better with the characters the original looks better because the remastered version is kinda plastic looking and weird if you lower the brightness to 4 in the original it will look much better instantly yo rebecca looks scary asf i wish they make a game about haythem kenway because who doesnt want to know anything about him i think its kinda par for the course that character models made during the era of the xbox 360 will have very plasticlooking facial features with glossy eyes but aside from that its a gorgeous remaster and well worth the price of a game pass you can never beat the original and ac 3 is the best one in the series lmao this dude really typed the roman numeral 3 as three is idk why i find that so funny lol they just made it darker i always thought desmond miles was modeled after ben stiller 139 why was the chair patterns changed looks to me like they just increased color saturation lol 040 the f happened there im sorry but why does the remastered version look shitty in some scenes not bad at all i have like but i have to say the faces and hair colors wasnt good but the outfits colors is really good they can make a resmatered for the black flag 439 facial is so disturbing it looked like a clay model 102 hey shaun grew his hair back good for him just got the game yesterday afternoon the world looks better but the faces of the characters look awful in comparisonjust my opinion though dont see a difference dude when tf did ac3 remastered released i knew something was not right when i saw remaster my mind remebered faces as pretty good in original what is this then what the hell ubi is it just me or does the facial rendering look better in the original this is not remestered xd this is downgraded d i rather play the original i called this texture mod in skyrim not remastered to be honest i feel like this couldve been done the first time around if ubi didnt rush their games out every year is it just me or does some faces look better in the original good god these character models i mean just look at 148 and how theres no reflection in his eyes i sorta hate that it just constantly shows the skip button for cutscene and u dident even move any button and the faces look weird but im all aboard with this remaster it looks great the eyes are more dead than desmond miles i never liked haytham lips now he looks so much better 138 the chair textures look way different better in normal ac3 233 now tell me honestly which looks better same engine they used in black flag they just got lazy assasins creed iii new colour pallet original looks better in my opinion am i the only one that loved how the character walked looking like a fucking badass every single remastered version of the ac series theyve made looks garbage instead of giving us 1080p with locked 60fps and 4k with unlocked 60fps they chose this crap original all the way sometimes remastering isnt always for the better this is a good example you were too lazy to even synchronize the both versions old ac games always had like high brightness and that made that game look awful finally they added contrast and populated the town and more this might be a remastered fail again those improved god rays looks incredible okay some lighting changes thats it i looove this game characters are horrible in the remaster what happened to the faceeeees there anyone that thinks the original version looks better than the remastered version i honestly think theyve couldve done even better but better than the first how to get it is controls the same control of as 3 was messed up i want controls of unity its atleast better plz replay i want to play this game i stopped because i hated its controls how can i buy this game on steam if i dont have odysseys season pass i cant find it on the store the ship segment looks awful in the remaster not really a huge change like cod remastered the textures and faces are still not great they just changed the lightning and they are earning money at least assassin creed 3 has the difference than assassin creed rogue originalremastered 041 jar jar is that you rebecca looks like q duck how did the faces get worse so lfeless dull eyes the new one looks like cgi while were all talking about the faces can we bring up the fact that the faces in the ezio collection were literally absolute garbage and at least they did better with these ubisoft is the shittiest company in america too bad they didnt fix desmonds busted ass face i know in ac3 he looks much closer to his voice actor but he was already established as looking a certain way and they just kinda tossed it in the trash increase contrast original is softer warmer more pleasant to the eye in most cases i prefer original there faces look weird bgm is too loud and annoying assins creed increased contrast edition i kinda like original better with all of it grey colorish style i think they ruined the intended art style and mood by slapping a lot of saturation sunny days blue sky and warmer colours everywhere other than the shadows light ground textures the remastered seems to have more crowd but the godawful model textures is just ugg i just want a ac1 remake some character models seem downgraded this is the only way to make a game comparison good job friend it looks like they just removed some old style filter it looks the same as the remastered if i increase contrast on my screen lame wait what only more contrast and more face lines it doesnt surprise ubisoft for those reasons they will gonna be forgotten remake that game is just another waste of money for you and for us be clever people and fans the colors and textures look amazing but the faces xd looks like haytham is a asian now fixed glowing eyes 09 looks better 030 its ok i think 037 nice colors but the light is strange 101more realisticnice job 119 nice enviroment but wtf with the ticket guy 133 i cant understand the recolor beard 139 wtf is that bullshit 258 looks well 330 looks remastred 358 the tail of the gorse is strange 420really templars whats wrong with ur faces xd 500 looks remastered to u so assassins creed 1 is the only game left for ubisoft to remaster right those faces tho love this new atmosphier geez it look like some compare videos for ubisoft game downgrade but this time is another way around new generation consoles remaster added platsic hair and shiny wet face ac 3 e3 edition do any of yall actually remember the original being this dark or was it wayyyy too long ago the original has better face expressions in remastered soldiers push haytham more badly y the fk would they remove fog i think you have increased the brightness in the original game way too much yea except the faces everything looks great the original looked soooo desaturated washed out its nice to have some color i like how it looks but couldnt they had changed the horse models they were horrible in the original and now theyre worst in the remastered too much contrast and wax damn ac3 aged horribly lol a game should be created from scratch we need nfs most wanted remastered i promise you the remaster is the way i saw ac3 back in the day charles lees horse became white aside from the faces this remaster looks genuinely fantastic they didnt just improve the graphics they also changed things like the color of the theater from white to gold or the guys hair at 153 from white to brown they had a full development team working on this the ezio collection and rogue remastered didnt get anywhere near this amount of care bravo ubisoft did good with this remaster the crowded towns at night with the street lights lit look great i thought there was no improvement when i watched the trailer but actual game looks so good the sound quality for voices in cutscene are also fucking garbage in the remaster ive been playing it for a while the faces looks so much worse in the remaster faces has too much shadow but i wont complain cuz i bought it already what happened to their faces i didnt realize the american revolution was fought entirely by plastic figures just a color change this is the remaster that i was waiting for fuck rogue well i prefer the original onethe faces look more realistic and even the atmosphere is better in the originalthe orinigan version is darker shaded which makes tge game even better for an ac gamein the remastered they put too much light in it the hair looked way more realistic in the original and whats up with the faces the lighting is better but did they scrub their faces with a mr clean magic eraser haytham in the remastered looks like a plastic chinese 436 they didnt even fix rebbeca creepy face you know she use to be kinda pretty in ezio trilogy 240 assassins creed iii babyfaced edition they should have just remade the game lol face upgrade to mass effect andromeda 125 133 148 233 424 new wax rendering tech assassins creed improvement texture pack lets take a look resident evil 2 remake comparison im with both i think i was playng sc3 befor few years 437 why the remastered version looks worse then original 235 ubisoft please explain what is this is this released for pc i noticed a pc right click prompt ubisoft should have left characters untouched they look more realistic in the original one everything else looks alright but bit too colourful from an artistic perspective cant complain about hud though generally remaster looks way better but what the fuck has happened to the faces in some shots haytham looks like a retarded wax figure now game remasters are fucking lazy as far as remasters go this is actually pretty good except those faces i picked it up today and damn the game is improved gameplay changes are nice too 237 haythams face in the remaster omg xd what the fuck is that basically the fog has settled down thanks for the spoil gonna be honest they ruined some of the character faces the saturation levels are insane in the remastered revert back to original at least they couldve also updated the faces not only the lighting wow looks better than rdr2 after the latest patch what the fuck with the faces id better go through original aciii original with reshade better looks like they fixed the hold button to skip cinematic that was present during cutscenes that really bugged me when i played the original im i the one who think the original is better does anyone know if theyre gonna add multiplayer to this or is this just a remastered story wow they did barely anything im dissapointed but i expected it at least someone is a bigger dissapointment than me did anyone notice the wrinkling of haythams coat while he was on the horse in the original but the remaster removed most of it 400 437 haytham remastered have weird left eye wth is going on lol everything else is great but the faces looks like theyre wearing plastic mask why theres no fog in remastered version what about the 16gb todays update what improves present day looks better in the original game i always wondered why the original looked foggy when a remastered 7 year old game is better than a 2018 release whats wrong with the faces its the same 2013 game with more saturated colors but for 40 bucks umm a query should i buy ac 3 remastered who will win original like remastered comment they didnt changr much the original was better because of cold colors filter can i buy it sepratley without ac odyssey like ac collection the new shading really fucks up their faces check at 123 and see the man on remastered version his head loool nice plastic lego there xd why the original has this piss filter this isnt a real remaster smh if you want to know what a real one looks like go play halo 2 anniversary 041 ubisoft what the hell this is genuinely a lame remaster i wouldnt expect much from ubisoft anyway we are in 2019 what happened to acunity graphics 256 that storm looks way better in the original imo seriously they are sticking a tag of a full aaa game for some higher resolution shadows slightly detailed characters and a yellow tint i am gonna get ghost of t over this bs never noticed how washed out the original was o my main problem with the remastered is the eyes look dead i dont see the issue its remastered yes but did you expect it to look like odyssey this will still look very good on my xbox one x unless you want all the dlc i wouldnt bother contrast tint vibrance sharpness 4k remaster well ubisoft downgrade their own remastered game i guess mehh who cares i will still play it well game looks more better on some aspects evenphotorealistic its just like the ezio remaster the settings shading and lighting look awesome but the character models end up looking different because if it the original one looks better the remastered face animation looks creepy i think that those van riding cutscenes looked better in original it was stylish and all of that but ingame light looks better it looks really better i remember ac ezio trilogy and that was tragedy they made there just more brightless i just bought is because of nostalgic times when i played as ezio btw sorry for my english d im begginer d i dont know i like more the original version i mean this looks cool but the faces damn they definitely look bad i hope the controls are better this time ac3 was an amazing game back in the day but had a lot of bugs i really wanna see a remake of the first one it deserves it looks like what they did with the ezio collectiondumped in a bunch of extra effects and didnt implement the rest not to mention made it look flat as hell and killed the tone of the images did they just tweak the postprocessing effects or my eyes are bad im sorry but i dont see why this is such big deal the orignal never looked thie washed out no ambient occlusion in remastered what a shame original rtx off remaster rtx on why do remakes only look like they mess with the brightnesscontrast i guess i dont even know what to expect regardless as if looking at the matrix tn and ips the eyes looks like dead fish eyes it lost reflections 041 kill it with fire i prefer the look and feel of the original this remaster seems like a mixed bag to me some daylight scenes look better but then faces look waxy and lacking detail they went crazy with the filter and contrast too apparently look at 159 you can barely see the curtain in the back because its so dark haytham look more like edward in the remaster characters skins looks better on original everything look less yellow less blur and more texture but sadly the face animation look much more stiff like they just comeback from a plastic surgery the light and colors overall looks better but jeez man i am not used to the faces character models look like they are from rogue do i need to buy odyssey to play this it looks better impressive for a remaster id say looks like the lighting on some scenes and certain environments look worse on the remaster the same problem appeared in the ezio collection places where the ambient lights looked better on the original depending of the scene wtf ubisoft the eyes and faces of characters are creepy the faces of the original are better but the colors are really good in this remastered 2012 assassins creed 3 blue 2019 assassins creed 3 gold what the hell is wrong with the remastered dudes hair at 125 the horse in ac 3 better than ac odessy the original looks better fuck me an actual side by side how fucking hard was that did they fix the stealth i recall the enemies having like eagle vision and being alerted way too damn quickly failed plastic surgery 236 holy crap that sucks imo a remaster doesnt worth the effort its better to invest more and create a remake new lighting is too clean needs a better bloom i wish the remaster version would alsp be for the ps3 and xbox 360 im still playing it on ps3 what if you remastered the remaster the remastered looks really good i think it just lack ambient occlusion can be injected by mediator and for the textures they are a mixed bag they sometimes look really good with the subsurface scattering but sometimes look really washed out remastered yet rebecca looks terrifying no need to buy remastered game just adjust your brightness in original game then you have it no more blinding white load screens at least they fixed that 001 look at the rope detail in the original it is miles better than the remaster god those subtitles are awful now we need an ac1 remasterremake with unity graphics and parkour etc desmonds face still weird he used be a handsome guy ac3 made him ugly made him died assassins creed iii wth buildings and backgrounds look beautiful but sometimes it just looks like an enb well remaster can suck dickthis game needed remake with better combat and something interesting to do other than story original looks better also pretty sure the remastered haythem outfit has the same color of the one in rogue interesting that you put the flash theme song in video haha 040 ugly than before they added sweetfx why u increased brightness in the original one faces and hair look much better in the original everything looks good except their faces more vivid color thats the point in the remastered version the lighting puts an important role every kind of places had its own atmosphere differently is it coming out today at 1100 lol why does the original still look better than the remastered in my perspective its weird how awesome games look when they first come out i cant believe the game looked that dull and grey it was really missing color desmonds face looks kinda dead for some reason vibrant colors and darker blacks remastered seems like they simply increased the contrast and lowered the brightness what happened to the human faces where did they go i totally forgot that i have the season pass for odyssey im gonna get it for free and all the dlc plus the other standalone dlc all remastered so cool 333 that crosscheck xd 351 why they didnt fix that glitch with the horse its called a reshade not a remaster christ people from ac community already made mods to the original ac3 that look miles better than this remaster the remastered version is quite similar to the pc version we had if you maxed out the graphical settings especially the ambient occlusion and shadow setting remastered just color no different i finished this game with 15 fps back in the 2012 now i play remaster 100 fps with my rtx 2080 ti graphics are really better but they just didnt care about the faces cause they look horrible this will kinda disturb me while playing but what can i do right and the faces need need need eyelashes plus this is what the game shouldve looked like in the first place i want u all to think about how good this remaster couldve been if they just didnt spend time on a worthless game like liberation it couldve been as good as the modern warfare remaster because ubi is talented they are just lasy plastic faces didnt fix the duckfaces but everything else looks great how you have this footage already desmond looks like ben stillers notson from meet the fockers yeah what the hell was up with the entire games colors looking desaturated love the vividness in the remaster man im crying its been improved a lot this is truly an upgrade from the original game isnt the game coming out on 29th march 245 added a black guy to the background assassins creed iii e3 version the original looks better in some cases connor and haytham look plasticy finally no more washed out yellowish gray filter why didnt they remaster ac2a much better game jesus christ the facial textures color looks so much nicer how did you get to access it earlier they should have adapted unitys graphics that would be good everything but the faces looks better they look like theyve been made of wax when you put reshade on your game remaster this is pc and not console can you do a comparison with liberation thats pretty good couldve spent an extra month just to fix those fucken awful face models a bunch of the faces and hair somehow look worse than the original the skin looked better in the original too now everyone looks like theyre made of wax and someone just turned the heat up are we sure the remaster wasnt done by the people that did return to arkham do you think something will improve with the day one patch nice sweetfx we change contrast pay us 60 ambient occulusion is not lot streng for characters in nose is not shadow great but does the remaster make the game any less boring wtf is wrong is ubi those remastered faces looks so creepy with no eyebrows oringal one have much more better face models check out 153 can you make graphics mod for prototype 2 ac3 remastered the best way to pay 60 dollars for some hd textures and color correction which you could easily get much better with mods for free og was betterin cutscenes so good super trailer the subtitles are way bigger than before thats the only bad thing in this tbh i hated the trailer but this looks much better it improves more than i thought nice bro good one first thanks for the hard work yall are bitching about why its not so remastered i just want this game because its the best game ive ever played assassins creed iii piss filter does anyone think shay cormac might have a few easter eggs now that its remastered i hope they make the tyranny of washington outfit playable in the regular story mode i would rather have a complete remake with the gear system and combat from origins and oddysey remastered you guys just added orange color filter on sony vegas my remastered graphics mod for dead space 1 looks better than this my favourite ac are black flag and brotherhood unity and syndicate are good yeah but unity is frustrating origins is ok sometimes end up trying press buttons from bf the first assassins creed is the one that needs to be remastered no multiplayer content ubisoft and square enix confuse mei think they are drunk thanks to ubisoft for making a remastered of assassins creed 3 because i missed this game on the ps3 you know this isnt activision when it says all dlc is free why not remaster the first one and then go up to 3 im coming home boys i wanted it for the switch c all they did was put warm colours over everything which actually makes it look less realistic from the original lol we need black flag remastered i didnt know remastered means piss filter thank ubi you can keep that to yourself however if they had taken the time to remake in say the latest unreal engine looks alot more yellow so assassins creed iii remastered lighting its mine already cos i got ac odyssey aaaaahh everything is more yellow cop the facial animations could be better remastered my ass even they will get confused which one is remastered as someone who has played this game more than 5 times i can tell the huge difference in the original and remastered great work ubisoft nowadays assassins creed became an rpg game with lack of good animations which sucks and is boring to me apparently god rays and heavy color grading postprocessing passes as remaster these days got excited for a min there i love ac3 but i am not paying for it again just so it can be orange this is literally the same game but with a instagram filter yellow piss over the screen and blinding light remmaster i would like to see black flag remastered hey children we sell you the same game for biggest price because we love you c ubisoft facepalm c capcom my favorite assassin creed game remastered look at the halo remastered games or resident evil 2 true remasters not lighting upgrade nicenow do black flag its my favorite orange edition we need new splintercell and prince of persia the first of many assassin creed games that had nothing to do with assassins lol still like ac3 yyyeeeessss i dont love ac 3 but is better then the new ac remaster all the older once plz cant wait but wish ac2 and brotherhood got remastered on pc too or atleast a patch to fix the awful shadow and lod quality my favorite ac game rip switch in the name of connor kenwey amen first i cant activate eagle vision presses l nothing happened control has fools i love how big the subtitle is ps should learn that how can the nintendo switch make assassins creed look so good the console controls are comfortable why are they small waiting on watch dogs 1 and 2 looks great i cant wait to play it tomorrow hey friend how much did you pay for the game did u buy in eshop right now in the european shop it is 33 there was a whistle in the original remaster is ass should have just fixed the first game jesus not really sure why you think the odyssey costume is bad or why you think connor looks funny in it does the remaster have online its actually more difficult comment your favorite assassins creed game here um there was the double assasination in the original i used to do it all the time and i still have ac 3 oh wait now i understand you couldnt whistle in the stalking spots aka hiding in the bushes i just realized that ubisoft has accidentally told a lie there is a whistle function is ac3 why in the hell did they say that there wasnt one in the og version of ac3 maybe they got confused with one of the older ac games or something i prefer the look of the original tbh what about the online like wanted thanks for the update but what about online play is there an online mode and if so did they fix the disconnect issue id hate to be top 50 and lose a match to a bunch of beginners by disconnecting am i the only one who had all the actions accept the outfits in the original alexioss outfit is something we needed did they fix falling through the world and the myriad of other bugs that plagued the game did they tightened the controls with more than profile assassinations stealth needed a hell of a lot more than a whistle ai was horrendous and for petes sake can you skip the credits this was the game that killed the series for me i never touched it since can we still play multiplayer hope next coming assassins series back to old assassins game there was definitely a whistle in original ac3 i abused it why are there no 2 guns in for assassins creed 3 acrogue remastered definitely felt like a huge upgrade from the ps3 version that i played but its mostly in smaller details foliage amounts plant and tree physics crisper graphics and of course the framerate i loaded up my ps3 version of the game to see if i wasnt just making it up but its a ridiculous improvement so far im loving this remaster of aciii the added gameplay mechanics the combat that feels more like acblack flag and acrogue and of course the graphics particularly in the frontier please tell me theres multiplayer i dont like that they have fucking clay faces i miss the old hidden blade did they increase the radius at which you reveal the map while traveling on the ground in the cities and the frontier make the use of viewpoints as fast travel points add more fast travel points in the frontier fix the glitch which makes your sword disappear fix the innumerable technical bugs and glitches throughout the game get rid of those fucking annoying street urchins in the cities remove some of the more difficult optional objectives in main memory sequences and only have one per memory add more upgrades to the aquila reduce the number of liberation missions you have to complete in each city is multiplayer still going to be a thing it is not worth it if you have played it befor but if not go a head or if you got it for free we want another remaster for ac ezio collection with next gen ultra graphics that game was truly amazing but even this to be honest is great would love to try it how about the story it is the same or they change a lot thats what i want to know because i played asc 3 on original will ac3 remastered have a multiplayer you forgot the hud changes is the multiplayer still gonna be there finally i can play desmond again the new graphics make the characters look very similar to the characters in the dishonored series what about boston bad optimization all we need now is a ac1 remastered if thats possible of course or if they are willing to put time into that actually low profile double assassinations were in ac3 the original ac3 has a whistle i sooooo wanna buy this what about the bad framerate issues in the original i hope they spend time to optimize the damn game i can see why i stopped watching u and gay boy lazzers how ever u spell his name negative over stupid shit so what their adding odyssy armor get over it jesus british people need to fuck off sometimes i hope they fix that creepy faces lots of wordsinstead if a remaster should of been a remake with connor mother alive and haytham actually seeing that lee is a ass hole and give connor a girl so he has more personality and so onalso make so george washington actually give connors village a new home and also that desmond does not die but still save the world but still juno escapes from the temple bit hey as much as i am or at least used to be big ac fan it is really hard to believe that ac3 is the game that someone gives a shit about if they plan on remastering 3 then they shouldnt leave out 1 and 4 1 should be even remake at this point i just dont get why would anyone even stand up from chair because of ac3 they had the whistle in the original assassins creed 3 118 the original assassins creed 3 had double assassination that was the absolute worst outro i have ever seenheard on youtube same story im only buying this for haytham and the combat not looking forward to dealing with connors idiocy again man i remember when ubisoft announced the protagonist was to be a native american i was so excited then the game was released so sad well at lease i have haytham but how do i get it if i got the pass from the new one but wat about a crouch button i hope it gets unlocked framerates on pc if i have already completed the game on the 360 does that mean that i would have to star all over simply because this is a remaster on my xbox one does anyone know the original did have a whistle feature i played it just a few days ago wait i thought they did have whistling this is what farcry3 should have got the port is hot garbage why not second assasin did they do texture work cuz it sure as hell looks like the just changed the lighting and colours there probably releasing this because there working on another new assassins creed game that is similar to origins releasing next year they shouldve just remade the game but its we i swear whistling was in ac3 i would bet money i think there was a whistle feature in the original ac3 i hope they add connors unreleased concept outfit ive always had a soft spot for it was really hoping theyd add multiplayer looks like conner takes his hood off in neutral areas like edward and shay in a lot of the gameplay we see edit i also hope they get rid of the horse following you after dismounting kinda annoying the kenway saga and the ezio trilogy were the golden years of ac im looking forward for extended naval free roam on the aquila perhaps sail a ship from new york harbour to boston harbour instead of doing naval missions but keep the peg leg missions they are like the most enjoyable ones add better graphics etc is there mp i finished the game but i didnt enjoy it i had so many bugs every play through aciii on vita was the buggiest game id ever played and once i realized i had to erase my save to fix one of the issues i uninstalled i wanted to like the game both of them the only other one i got was unity because it was on sale for around 15 dollars or so but i played it less than 20 minutes really hoping this version of the game is great the biggest thing i want to see is to add the ship combat from black flag and rouge in this one and replace the stupid naval combat from the original they should do all th ezio games instead of ac 3 this game is my favorite ac game conor is just a badass i feel like he is exactly what an assassin should be not very emotional not scared or worried just a serious skilled killer im glad they kept the original combat system and didnt add health bars that shit is stupid wait wtf i could swear there was whistle in 3 or was that black flag connors walk animation looks slightly change i love to see water in assassin creed 3 liberationnot water in assassin creed 3 original i just want an assassins creed 1 remaster just hope the characters arent big and bully like in the original and its easier to climb trees or the branches ac3 is my fav assassins creed im so hyped if ubisoft wont give us a new splinter cell game give us remastered splinter cell pandora tomorrow and chaos theory double agent and conviction but the original 3 need it more connor was the best character ezio was shit compared to him in terms of story development also kinda bummed that the digital version of this which is included with the season pass is not early access like far cry 3 classic was see i just recently picked up again all of the ac games i was missing from my collection on ps4 of course with ac1 on ps3 since it isnt available yet on ps4 and will be picking up ac3 remastered on the 29th at retail so ill have a complete collection on the shelf hell yeah however as ive been continuing to play ac odyssey and have nearly beaten it to 100 this past week and the season pass is currently on sale for 45 down from 60 i was kinda hopeful that i would be able to get a head start on ac3 remastered before next friday because i am still technically paying for it in that season pass and it is now a worthless part like would be cool if i could get a season pass without the remaster for 40 or 35 and not have access to the digital ac3 remastered personally um id consider ac rogue remastered as a remaster considering the obvious and expected resolution enhancement as well as a bettermore stable frame rate compared to the original ps3360 version i mean outside of that it is just like a huge expansion though i hate to put it as simple as that of ac 4 black flag which is a game for this current generation so wtf i just love how you dont pad your videos with bullshit and actually talk about the subject matter my fizhy boi always has the good shit damn assassins creed iii was epic if only they actually did a good job on the ezio collection its so bad it isnt worth mentioning i hate that nintendo players have to wait loner to get it ac3 was my favorite and this will make me play it again but honestly i wish i could add the enjoyment with the combat of odyssey i personally loved the combat but it was so smashy and just a one swipe kill although this is nice and appreciative to make things easier and understandable for an assassin but i found no actual challenge what so ever 105 you could whistle in ac3 wtf man i wish they remastered the ac 1 they better have fixed desmonds dumb back hump sticking out of his dang backpack there was a whistle feature in the original not to diss there hard work the game looks amazing but not much has changed free aim better whistling in stealth and some outfits hardly worth the 60 something dollar price tag it will be can you crouch tho i could have sworn you could whistle in brotherhood great to see the graphics improved hope they remaster syndicate in the future fuck yeah ha ha one my favorite assassins creed games remastered for the ps4 goodbye shitty games like origins and odyssey it would be cool if remasters added weapons is combat the same its been a long time since i played ac 3 but im pretty site you already can whitsle to distract guards at the current game its yellow hope they fixed the grass ac3 looks good for its time i hated this game but im still getting this lmao they changed water to water whistle was already in the game what the fuck assassins creed black flag needs to be remastered look at all those views mate i think you know what has to be done how long will it take until ac 1 gets an remastered its not a remake so i dont expect things will change apart from the quality or hd of the game i love ac3 so im excited there was the whistle ability in the original smh give me ac1 remake please there was a whistle feature in ac 3 they introduce it in one of haythems missions early on here is my opinion fk ubisoft hopefully they change the full story its bollocks and the worst one one thing add a good portion of the cut dialog it actually was very critical in the story ie httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcymoclqog ac3 was the peakhands down but the original version pc version looks still better than the remaster version my penis is small and my breath smells bad even after i brush my teeth cant wait to play this wherever and whenever i want on my switch cant wait to play this beautiful remaster so grateful they did blackflag was the the best assassins creed game ive played imo to be fair i only played 1 3 blackflag and origins i find it kinda sad they said theyd never do a feudal japan ninja game then again now theres ghost of tsushima and sekiro shadows die twice coming out one of my main problems when i first played was how awful the blood looked when does it come out hopefully there will be an alternate ending to the desmond ending the original ending is lousy i just want to look like a normal 18th century man so i can blend in like haythom kenway outfit im looking forward to replaying the homestead missions again there is a whistle in the third one one think that i want in this remaster is to change connors hair after the final chapter it was horrible assassins creed 3 is easily my favourite so this is awesome that its getting a remaster they could hav added more combos to the fight scenes connor actually looking fly asf in that bayek outfit tho kinda looks like bayek himself from the angle the camera was at finally they release the e3 version it wouldve been dope if they just gave us the e3 demo or whatever that early gameplay was did they make it an open world so the screen doesnt have to load for a newly explored area they should fix the detection system too you get spotted by one guard and suddenly the whole city is hunting and chasing you lol especially when you are level 3 notorious you cant walk 3 feet without getting into combat with 20 guards who keep spawning out of nowhere there was whistling and low pro double assassinations in the original i hope they add multiplayer in the future ac3 was personally the best for me black flag remaster would be sick congrats on the 100k hope theres a crouch mode is it just me or is ubisoft slowly becoming a more reliable studio unlike bioware and ea ac3 came out when i was in 7th grade im in college now damn does time fly will the game be harder or have a difficulty setting cuz its always been maaaaad easy u never needed to progress and improve connor with better weapons equipment etc i hope after the end game you can choose which enemy to spawn in the red coats or the colonial army for reasons but you could whistle in the original aciii did they add white guilt my favorite ac game i stopped playing after unity i just want a japan ac game when i here remastered i think of a game being completely remade on current engines not the lighting and technical changes ac3 was just as good as ezio and its good that there doing this i hope for the next game they make the storyline more based about all of that good stuff because no one can remember there names whistle was already in original ac 3 toggle hood i got the season pass on odyssey so i think im supposed to get this if i remember correctlyi hope so guess ill find out in ten days they need to remaster the remaster of the ezio trilogy im just ready to try it on switch id love to see the entire collection on switch have to spoof my location just to play odyssey through the japanese eshop assassins creed 4 black flag remastered im confused this game got sooo much shit when it was originally released why is everyone fw it now its not not like youre getting a different experience as far story and characters i mean im still hyped cuz i loved ac3 but not too excited for hearing connors constant whining again i love the soundtrack in this game i cant wait to get and play mine im excited to play as my fav assassin connor again the whistle was on ac3 and i remember it because of the assassin turkey ubisoft be like remastered ac3 and make pc port ignore ezio collection remastered pc port and make it console exclusive they shouldve made ac3 into an rpg like the past 2 games ambient exploration music would be a good addition very well put together thanks for your thoughts red hood eek ive never played this game yet so im looking forward to the remaster ive played other ac games just not this one i personaly think arnos outfit was my favorate wat the issue with alexios outfit were is charles leeeeee already better than odyssey do we get the game with dlc that was released i think it was like madness of king george and one where connor was never recruited into the assassins but instead was a native wolf warrior wish added more history on haythem or a flashback story cant wait to play it the only issue i have are outfits i dont want to see that shit by default d it would be better as uplay reward did they get rid of connors ridiculous shoulder lean walk theyve also added in a whistle feature that was already in assassins creed iii though maybe ubisoft just added it to when youre hiding in brush so i have this game with my season pass but is it worth playing again this guys merch is asking for 20 quid for a shirt that says your nan is dead wtf there was always free aim nothing nothing im interested and cant wait to see it but im not getting my hopes up after rogues remaster because it is pathetic how little difference there is even far cry 3 just got a bit sharper but hey maybe my standards are a bit high but considering halo 1 and 2 remasters and gears of war 1 can you blame me a true remaster those 3 are and its disappointing for me when remasters come out that dont really do anything spends more than a year trying to perfectly remaster ac3 so what do you think about these new details im pretty sure the original ac3 had free aim already on pc im pretty sure i remember bow sniping patrols in the frontier also low profile double assassinations were already a thing i believe i could do walking double assassinations on guards in alleyways in new york that was 6 years ago now though really hope they removed the female voices with the males whenever you were in a fight im looking forward to this is it going to be on playstation 4 cuz im looking forward to this this was my first assassins creed game assassins creed 3 so i definitely want to give this game a try again i look forward to it thank you for bringing this up do you know when its going to be released hope they fix the ezio outfit by adding the red on his cape not an exciting news for me when i accidentally brought and completed original ac3 like last month i know why but id love to see ubi release a physical version and if they are disregard when ac3 remastered releases remastered version isnt an ac game what if they add floating damage numbers that would be very strange what is wrong with remastering ac1 will the different coloured outfits show in cutscenes now the mission structure and side content is still ass there better be some awesome blood effects when you kill an enemy i just wanted to say that this was one of the most painstakingly boring games ive ever played i actually gave up playing one time because i thought doing my quantum physics homework was more fun imagine that they should do assassins creed odyssey remastered a crouch button would have been nice its something that should have been in the game from the first ac i had the game on ps3 and i managed to do double assassinations just had to hit r1 square are they keeping the multiplayer though no one asked for this thats the point the double assassination and the whistle u can only call it remastered if ubisoft put some serious work into ac3 like capcom did for re2 i wish you could preorder for pc of all the games they could have remasteredupdated they picked this one connor is not an assassin hes a bitchy little boy with a temper tantrum fuck you bethesda fallout 76 was shit has nothing to do with this studio but still all i want is ratonhnhaktons original concept art robes and the dlc wolf outfit in the main game and i think bayeks master assassins robes would fit him well too bad better games are out this month so ill have to wait for a sale i really wanna know if the glitches have been removed if so im on this this ac3 was a very buggy game when it launched i think ill wait for digital foundry impresssions before i jump back i want 3 things fixed kind worried neither of them will be though 1 fix the fact one of 3 caravans can bug out for the whole game in its very tutorial 2 daggers and tomahawks have the same animation why i dont know i get tomahawks needed their own animation given the themesetting of the game but why even add daggers in the game if they dont even have their own animation daggers had their own animations for all previous 4 games yet theyre absent here sigh 3 if connor is wearing achilles costume in cutscenes where he doesnt have the hood on hes shaved zero regardless if he has his regular hair or endgame mohawk hair such an oversight i hope to god this is fixed the whistle feature was always in ac3 they need to hurry up and remaster ac1 the remastered graphics suck it looks like all they really changed was the lighting never liked ac3 at all for various reasons before however after having played rogue i enjoy it now due to the fact you get to kill haytham they should of remasterd brotherhood is it too much to hope for a free giveaway for those who already have it on steam like some other companies do they did had the whistle and high and low double assassination now we can look for charles lee in better graphics hopefully an option to carry a musket on your back wait theyre adding shays templar robes well shit no whistle feature in the original game bro if you didnt notice that it is in the original game then theres something wrong the only way they could add a new whistle feature is if they made like black flag and and onwards where you can whistle at any time while in stealth the only true remastered is resident evil 2 pshhhh been wanting this for so long connor is one of my top 3 favorite assassins not to mention my favorite robes so sweet and since oddysey has no legacy outfits thisll do quite well when are they going to remaster ac1 its just like the halo remastered collection its halo with cool cinematics ac3 bloom edition just let me play as haytham after the story and im happy there was a whistle mechanic in 3 it just didnt work when you were hiding in the bushes 60fps there was a whistle in the original lool the 2 ac remasters from a graphics point of view are pathetic and lazy attempt the free aim with the bow its a godsend can they please make the outfits appear in cutscenes if i buy the jamestown outfit i wanna see it in cutscenes time to go back to my favourite ac character haytham kenway 333 there was a whistle feature sure i never used it cause it tended to attract two guards instead of one but it was thereunity is the one that got rid of in favor of those stupid cherry bombs that hardly ever worked all they need to improve in my opinion is the numerous bugs and glitches and the almost luck based optional objective in one of the naval missions so they didnt fix or improve the story and the screenplay great i love them i did want to ask you what were your thoughts about the concept art arno outfit being added in as well i personally love that but i have seen many bickering about it they need a crouch button for stealth can you lock on targets during combat hopefully when you finish the game you can put the hood back on the best assassin is making a return hell yeah i really hope they didnt take out the blood effects like they did with syndicate i hope they fixed the bug where only the default robes showed up in cutscenes okay okay what about altair there is a whistle mechanic in the original ac3 game its not like ac4 but it was still there only problem i see is his walking style all these changes and they couldnt add a crouch feature hold on i like the ezio collection but its not a proper remaster ac 2 actually looks worse than it did on ps3 cant wait to use the tomahawk again not one of the better titles in the series but i still loved ac3 and connor is one of my favorite assassins and the whole native aspect i love how much work ubisoft puts into cultural details the game look great i know this goes beyond a remaster but i would have loved it if they upgraded the combat system closer to the last two games huge fan of the new longer learning curve and more advanced and diversified controls for origins and odyssey that would have kicked it up a notch for me not afan of the one button countersexecutions etc will they allow us to slaughter hundreds of foot soldiers onthe battle ofbunkerhill like they promised at e3 2012 so to wrapup mechanically its ac4 and graphically they implemented syndicates lighting system when does the remaster come out again its still the worst assassins creed tbh but its still a pretty decent game i just want all the bugs fixed in this remaster has haytham outfit will it run on 60fps can you buy it separately they had low profile double assassinations and whistling in the previous game what you on about for those who are saying that the new features they are talking about were in the original thats not true whistling could only be done around corners and hiding spots but not stalking zones free aiming was not in the original that started in assassins creed iv black flag double assassinating could only be done as a high profile assassination they added low profile double assassination in the remaster so you wont get spotted killing two guys at the same time i know this stuff because i played the original yesterday and i look forward to this remaster i think itll be way better than some of you guys think if you guys didnt like the original then dont get the remaster you dont need to complain about it to others who are actually looking forward to it its gonna be so weird goin from odessey to ac3 im calling it ubisoft will add in microtransactions i will say this so i am glad that they changed it out to free aiming on the weapons because any old versions you had to manually turn the camera on your character to what you wanted to fire at until the icon turned white and then you press the designated button to fire the weapon versus now on the remaster you can actually manually turn yourself and not just the camera also i find it kind of dumb that they added shays and bayaks robes considering they really dont suit connors character and what they should have done was add in an entirely new or unique outfit or two instead of outfits that weve seen in previous or current games as far as i remember there was low profile double assassination in the original connor and bayek look the same lol can we have a remake of ac1 not a remaster but a remake can i wear edwards robes since i want to do that during haytham boss battle ah after so much waiting your video came out did they recently add it to the original i was playing w backwards compatibility and that option was there we want an ezio trilogy remake we want an ezio trilogy remake will ubisoft remasterremake asssassins creed 1 i want to play as altair hey i need help on a topic not related to iii but to brotherhood in the ezio collection ubisoft are not getting back to me on it and what help i can find on the internet is old forums and sites that was for when it was on the previous gen simply i wanna have the florentine falchion sword in the game says according to games wikia that it unlocks after sequence 3 but im already up to sequence 5 and still cant be found its classed a secret weapon that can collected from that cupboard and i already have the scimitar unlocked but i dont want that one its 2019 and brotherhood was remastered apart of the ezio trilogy collection so is there any fix to this or is it impossible to get it please help i know the sword of altair is better but you have to complete all guild challenges to acquire it if its been available since s3 then i want it nowsh rather than the sword of altair please fizhy or somebody please help me here ill just put in my ac3 disc into my xbox wait i probably wont do that cause this is one of the worst games and i prefer ac2 and brotherhood unfortunately i was too young at the time to play ac 3 when it came out so im awaiting the remaster later this month to finally play it i wish i played the original so i would appreciate the new additions more this is a relief please fix the aquila story sequences to where youre able to explore the entire colonies coastal waters like black flag and skull and bones instead of leaving it like it was with a few dots on the map for sea voyages and only able to do those that was terrible compared to black flag ship game play ac3 always had the free aim with the bow whistle feature and the low profile double assassination no one ever talks about the major glitch ac3 had with outfit colors how they would switch back to classic white during cutscenes totally ruined the immersion making a good game into a even better game this was always my favorite in the series connor bayeks outfitbayek lockpicking improved not gonna lie ac3 was one of my favorites so im excited for this so all became yellow right yeah just wait and see that they will downgrade this humongously im not trusting ubifoot on any remaster i think its a good idea for ubisoft i would like to have a remastered black flag too though oh shit pretty glad about the double assassination addition actually free aim is a double edge sword game isnt really needing of it oh boy yay double stealth assassination its purpose was always on the move assassination but im more appreciative of this change ubisoft knew this game was pretty bland majority of the time so a simple remaster with a small graphics upgrade wouldnt really sell unlike the ezio collection im just glad that they took it a step further and fixadded stuff that the game needed i really wanted to enjoy the game but it was a let down due to how easy and bland it was im really hoping this remaster fixes that it would be funny to see connor in jacobs outfit fizhy there already was a whistling feature in ac3 what will the price be in canada i dont have season pass why am i actually kinda looking forward to this ughh i hate my self the only thing im worried is that liberation probably wont get rain like it did on some of those missions in liberation vita version whens it supposed to release cant wait to get this game 8th hand at my local cex thanks was wondering if this was worth my time least favourite not played liberation uhoh ac 1 is where its at im glad this is a positive view on the remaster i was afraid you would be like all the other assassins creed youtubers and be like uhhh well ac3 was a garbage game when it first released and no amount of remastering can fix that like seriously the original ac3 was great and finally offered my people some great representation in the form of connor and his tribe you should have seen my fathers face light up when i first told him how well this game told a story about our tribe and it kinda hurts me when people say ac3 is bad whistle damn auto correct there was a little in ac 3 i hope they fixed the gun glitch that would happen when you wear a legacy outfit it would either remove or change your 2nd gun this remaster would be better than odyssey rogue was remastered for pc and then that version was ported to the current consoles hey fizhy i hope they fixed the models so that desmond does not look like a clone of adam sandler lol ive noticed ps4 isnt offering any preorders to anyone who didnt buy the season pass i guess you just gotta buy it on day one with the ezio collection im just glad they fixed the missing audio in ac2 sequences 12 13 like when ezio meets the irish monk but can you have your hood up all the time the halo 2 remaster puts all the remastered ac games to shame the tyranny of george washington was the coolest dlc for the assassin creed games in my opinion i wonder if their gonna add difficulty levels as well i call this an update not a remaster did u guys know in ac 1 u could kill all mualim with one parry id like the first one to be remastered i hope well finally be able to see alternate outfit colors in the cutscenes also why do they call it alexios outfit if kassandra is the canon one smh they better fix the fact that you cant even see your outfit in cut scenes they made it to where you only see connors outfit in every cutscene in the original this shit releases in like 15 days how can u play the ezio collection were not remasters by any meansthe textures and models were weird and the framerate was still locked to 30fps im guessing because of the anvil engineac3 remastereds priority is 60fps with no excuses period they are releasing it on switch which is significantly less powerful than ps4 so 30fps for switch and 60fps for ps4 then it would be called a proper remasterto this day ac2 brotherhood and revelations are not remasters they need to do this to the ezio collection as well im refusing to buy it in its current state yeah im hoping it gets to 60 fps on ps4 though i highly doubt it because ubisoft fucking suck at remastering ill still probably play it because i bought the gold edition of odyssey for 30 lol i played assassin creed 3 for 5 years years and i know most of the game and they did have double assassination and whistle lol what about the multiplayer will the combat be just button mashing or have they changed that as well man i really hope that uou can put the hood up and down any time you want like in origins for example i hate how they add outfits to games from other games it makes no sense i would be sooooo happy if they would remaster assassins creed iv black flag becouse it was my favorite game back in a day p bruh ac rogues remastered was suppose to look like this atleast im praying that they didnt change the control system with combat im praying that they didnt change the control system i enjoyed walking up to a group of four and low profile killing each of them one by one while they just stood staring in shock i guess this wont be a feature in the remaster the only thing i wanted on the remaster was free aim so i am pleased but but why not edwards outfit hooray now i get to watch desmond get murdered in upscaled uhd how about manking the bow a stealth weapon that will be nice oo ooh mo goh ossossins creed 3 is such a good game ooh mo goh woot doo foock too bad they cant remaster connors personality am i right guys guys we wanna the fkn multiplayer is trophys different the best one do i need to buy the game again or can i somehow port the remaster to the vanilla game thats not true you can whistle in the original the free aim alone makes this worth it to me i remember desperately wishing i could free aim when i played the game when it first came out wtf there wasnt a whistle yeah im going to get the game now since learning this small changes however im still not looking forward to the ugly story excluding the first 3 sequences they better let you skip the end credits when you beat the game i hope they do this to ac1 remaster they should make a dlc where he meets arno i hope they add edwards attire the remaster seems amazing i miss this game too bad they cant remaster connor 112 thats the tomahawk from the dlc maybe well get the wolf outfit in the main game too ac3 in my opinion was one the bad games i found the story bland and uninteresting though it was pretty cool to visit some iconic battles from the revolutionary war im not gonna buy this right out the bat ill wait and see if its any good because i just flat out didnt like the game remaster ac1 already altair is best boi i hope in that one scene he smiles the game doesnt crash the only reason i would wear the alexios outfit is to pretend that there is a hidden blade in odyssey ac1 reboot would be so amazing like a completr overhaul of the game with the modern tech we have now but did they fix the bug where i desynchronised every five minutes after failing the starting mission how hard would it be for them to put the new style of combat origins and odyssey into the remaster of older games my dick is knee long seems that hell play more similarly to edward then edward could whistle from stalking zones and double assassinate yes you could certainly free aim with his pistols but im excited to have that feature with connors bow finally this remaster is needed i never liked the map looked a bit gay but like ac3 introduced the whistle i think i actually wanna buy this game i hope that ubisoft have fix the you have my everlasting gratitude sir line please spread my hams im worried it will have the ridiculously exaggerated lighting from odyssey um so we get an alexios outfit a bayek outfit and that movie one but why is it that he didnt get edward kenways outfit you know basically the grandfather of connor its odd how kassandra is the canon character but its alexios whose mercenary outfit youre wearing with a hood instead of a helmet no less i know that the answer is most definitely no but id hope shays outfit has a hood as i never understood why in the cover art he wears a hood but in game it doesnt and in unity the description suggests that it was assassin robes but worn by a templar then again if you played rogue youd know his templar uniform werent just his assassin robes just modified but if not its not a big deal i really like shays robes but i just always wished it would have a hood im also glad to see that they are indeed adding new outfits such as aguilars another favorite of mine i was never sure how theyd add more outfits because of the outfit rack in the manor as opposed to other games where you just go to the coat hanger in your ship or in the character customization and just select them from the outfits section im also glad to see that low profile double assassinations are in the game hope they improved the stealth and free running it could just be me but i remember the stealth an watch joraptor guys you could always whistle in ac3 and free aim am i the only one who wants ac viking game imagine snow boats u can be url and have your sity like in ac2 that would be sick finally i find a video on the subject that actually gets to the point anyways i hope the inventory system counts as an ui improvement it would be awesome if they made an assassins creed game that takes place during the american civil war the wild west and world war 1 since they used swords and knives in the trenches ubisoft nothing i can say about this remaster all i know is its going to be a thriller if you thought the alexios outfit looks bad on connor then the shay outfit in comparison looks absolutely fucking horrendous ac3 remastered is the only reason i still have odyssey i like this type of video can you make more lore related vids also im glad you havent let 100k subs go to your head and you still talk to the community ya buttttttt what about my boi black flag looking forward to the classic gameplay not necesarily a fan of the rpg esque gameplay the current games have what just wanna run into the huge crowd of british soldiers and kill them like it showed in the original trailer whistles and double assassinations were already there dumbass they need to remaster the sands of time trilogy it better run at 60fps on console rogue was an awesome remaster i was able to perform lowprofile double assassinations it was difficult but manageable for me their was an aiming system in the original but it really sucked if and when i get it i will try that system out i just hope my season pass on ac odyssey will let me get the game for free because that is the only way i can anytime after it comes out it doesnt seem like theyve going to add the ac3 alpha along all the added suits which is imo a missed opportunity anyway still happy to see my favorite ac game being remastered more like assassins creed 3 not downgraded version i just bought the original ac3 in the sale the other week can they add a crouch button there was a fucking widtle in the original game the whistle was in ac3 it was the game that introduced it but holy shit this looks better than i expected so what your telling me is that i can go back to my old ps3 plug it in and play some acc3 stil looks the same im very glad for this because i never had a chance to play three when i had my ps3 so i can finally understand why the fuck haytham is a templar there is a whistle in the original ac 3 im playing it rn and i just did it what i want to know is will there be a standalone disc version of the ac 3 remaster they didnt make a disc version for the rogue remaster and the only remastered ac games to have a disc version was the ezio collection i want the remastered ac games to have a disc version damn it connors got a big ass nose is connor a better character now no no never mind he is still shit for fuck sake im glad its not just shallow graphics tweaks looks like they actually improved some things gameplay wise also i hope that cutsceneoutfit thing has been fixed hate having an outfit different than standard and standard showing up in the cutscenes did they fix piticarn pistol glitch if someone play game in deep you should know this annoying glitch ohh yes and sword passing trough any outfit why does alexios outfit in this game look better than the outfit in odyssey how does that even happen im kind of disappointed about the fact that they didnt add the concept art outfit to the game call me crazy i dont care but i love this game is my second one in the whole franchise cant wait to play it again and again connors forsaken epilogue the deleted scene is one of the best things in all the entire franchise im looking forward to this i know connor was a miserable git but i thought the story was one of the strongestbest of the series keep up the great videos hey fizhy do you plan to do streams ac3 fizhy you should make another video about who is the deadliest assassin next game to remaster should be ac1 to acr in that order guys whistling was already very much available in the original version and not just from around corners but pretty much any hiding spot there also was free aiming i should know cause i played the ps3 original version just a couple hours ago and did all those things during my gameplay they should remaster ac1 change the voice actor of altair so he sounds like he did in revelations add some side content and wallah i hope they improve recruits ai and fix the horrendous glitches otherwise this looks sensational i see ubisoft learned from their mistakes this time ye i also agree they did a quite good job on this remasterd any word on the multiplayer would be nice if we could get another active communtiy going i just wish theyd fix the broken notoriety system actually i couldve sworn i had haytem and connor doing a low profile double assassinate in the old version does anyone beside me remember doing that there was a whistle feature on the ps3 version for quick look up go to zevik youtube channel and watch his walk through you could whistle in the original but only behind cover not in bushes im excited to play the remaster this was the first ever assassins creed game i ever played it will always have a special place in my mind and the remaster will only make it better i never played ac3 so im really hyped for this speaking of odyssey i found a gold edition in the clearance bin at my local target i wasnt planning to play it but i was like eh might as well its in the clearance section it must be cheap what deali scanned the barcode itits still 109 bucks in order to make it good they should cut connor rdr2 content son i hope we can change the color of the original robes and have it show in cutscenes i was hoping for a crouch button and the free run up and down good shit i told you were gonna pass james you idiot good job you only dislike this remaster cause you are brioh wait you had nothing bad to say old game had whistle too well something we can actually be cautiously optimistic about i want to get this but i already have ac3 feels stupid if i would get this since i already have ac3 should i get this instead or keep the original i just hope they fix the quiver i hope we can still have the hood up after sequence 11 i might get ac 3 remasterd for christmas or something ac 3 was the first assassins creed game i ever played and it was on the wii u of all consoles i play on the ps4 nowadays though but im not a playstation fanboy like jaytech tv screw that guy console and pc fanboys are big problem on the gaming industry in my opinion i play games for fun call me a casual all you want i wont care sorry for that small rant there ac 3 has my favorite video game villan of alltime haytham kenway he is a badass i like the new outro music you have fizhy id love to see a remastered ac1 but im not getting my hopes up maybe now we can see the full scene after connor catches up to myriam during the wedding mission socialism is communism remasterd pretty sure whistling was already in the game where is charles lee all of those stealth things were in the original i still havent finished ac3 now i can add the fucking speech yeah that alexios outfit is ugh but double assassination was already a thing dislike stop the earrape please i am not getting alexios outfit it looks fucking weird you fucking love connor admit it there was a whistle feature in the original ac3 im pretty sure that was the first game to have it as well i just want to be able to wear the actual naval mission outfit outside of those missions not the one with the weird white cuffs and trim that we got before i just watched the update video damn i really like the gameplay changes we can even free aim with our bow and thats one of the things i really wanted in ac 3 conors penis needs to shrink its too big for a brown guy also get rid of the midnight ride go left connorrrrrrrrrrr wow they have added free aim honestly im hyped i wish they did this kind of remaster for the other remasters even ezio collection wasnt like this and unlike ezio collection this is on fking pc i just wanted to tell you that i dont like mustard wait can we crouch now the only thing im worried about is if they didnt fix the robes on altar outfit sticking on connors legs yooo fizhy its been a while first man i love assassins creed 3is my favi cant wait to play it assassins creed brotherhood remastered please thank you ubisoft looks great cant wait to play it the third is nice but i would love ezio collection can you do assassins creed 4 remastered please that would be a dream can you put assassins creed rogue to the nintendo switch if you do put it i will give you alot of thank you because i support ubisoft fake fake fake alert game runs at 20 fps ooooooh what has nintendo come to please release assassins creed black flag on the nintendo switch please bring ac black flag to switch where the hell is your game ezio collection please when people tell you the switch is powerfull lmao it came out same date with resident evil 01 and 4 for switch but re price is suck ac3 is an easy pick for me original ac and ezio collection plz im so happy i hope theyll port black flag as well hell yea also i have notice the sounds of the game just sound muddy and awful and idk if that it is youtube compression fault but please wort on that too please and kind regards why is it age restricted wish it was black flag instead can you we have black flag now ezio collection next i can finally play this during history class pleasecould we get assassin creed 4 on the nintendo switch it have been released on wii uso it would be fair enough to get it on switch it would not matter at least we get to enjoy the game i cant wait anybody is aware what would be a download size for this game need to decide on preordering on the store or just buying physical copy is this free i think brotherhood would have been a better throwback an older game but still a really good game they fixed the framerate dont worry thank god they fixed the framerate i remember how i played assasins creed liberation on my ps vita black flag wouldve been the better game to put on the switch in my opinion the graphics and framerate are a yikes from me i think itll be the vanilla version lol this looks worse than the original how can you call it a remaster when it is by far the worst version of the game it looks significantly worse than the ps3 360 or even wii u version yet you call it remastered much lower lod worse textures worse texture filtering poor image quality poor framerate hardly any npcs wtf this isnt the psp theres no excuse for it looking this bad seriously delay it until it is finished theres no excuse for a switch port to look worse than ps3 every other game so far looks much better on switch than wii u and ps3 this game should be no different dont let shitty developers ruin what could be a great port out of all pf the ac you gave us the 3rd one the worst coolno ezio collection i was hoping it wasnt this or the first one ezio collection or rogue would better but this is an okay start glad to see ac on the switch finally fix the chase missions and then well talk why 3 assassin creed 3 isnt good compared to 1 and 2 next should be rayman 123 and origins thanks ubisoft that fps lol seriously it looks that bad and you let people see that on a trailer intended for people to buy that the wii u port looks so much better i want ac 2 and brotherhood so much please optimize it as best as you can i hope there will be version without liberation hey guys remember how aciii was on the wii u yeah me neither if they do a bundle with this ill buy it can i turn the blood back on in this version i hope ea brings soon frostbite engine to switch should bring us epic gaming experience idk why people are complaining i definately see a difference when compared to my ps3 version and im hype for the game o is this fake how much does it cost i hope they can put ac4 on the switch soon can you pre order it on the eshop at least theyre being upfront with the framerate please assassins creed chronicles in switch ahh thats hot thats hot now they need to announce remastered zelda games i think ubisoft forgot what remastered means wondering if the division 2 can be ported as well please ubisoft do the same with black flag next best ac ever imo sadly wont look nearly as close to ps4 lol asssasins creed unity should come out on switch i love that one yo ubisoft pls give your best at this in terms of optimization pls dont make this a lazy port would be so good for the series and the switch finally an assassins creed game on switch ive barely played this game and im definently looking forward to it now we need more ubisoft game on switch i will buy this game if they fix the shitty fps yeah i had to preorder loved this game when i was younger because no one asked for it 7 hour tutorial intro on the goyay hope it runs smoothly back when ac was even semihistorically accurate great start but if games like doom and breath of the wild can look and run as well as they do on the switch you can do better than this thanks ubisoft could we have a far cry on switch too please lol its remastered but you can still hear how crappy the audio is this was my first ac game though and i love it why not unity i played the hell out of this game on the wii u and ill do the same on switch 020 is that a potato you recorded it on if this is gonna cost more than 50 euros im gonna kill myself coming at you with 20 fps lol can i have the ezio collection on switch instead im excited for this ubisoft now all i need is the ezio collection on switch to feel complete assassins creed 3 on the go why not port it to mobile phones tho that should have brought out all the assassins games up to rouge on the switch omg that would have been amazing but i would love the ezio trilogy on the switch that would be a dream ubisoft can you please port black flag gotta love that 5 seconds per frame i did that purposly next stop gta 5 on switch i miss assassin creed 3 on the ps3 conner coming back on switch noice lol remastered more like low effort switch port for easy cash this looks so good on switch i dont care about the fps im going to get this game i just care about gameplay honestly why not ac4 a much better game now ubisoft has 5 games on switch i think this partnership with nintendo is really great but not great enough to get rayman in smash how could you betray us like that again yes after this black flag then the bat man arkham games know its far fetched but that would make my life complete this was and is still my favorite assassins creed i have a ps4 but whip out the ps3 to play this still im gonna 100 it in saitch whats the price cant wait for this release were was the blood boy the fps isnt looking so good isnt it will it have multiplayer its going to look like the xbox 360 but i dont care im so fucking pumped for this game on the switch i preordered the game on amazon im getting it its exciting to me to have assassins creed on the switch but i know it came to wii u but the switch is more popular the worst two games in the franchise pass port black flag and then you get a sale provided it looks and plays better than what this video just showed if rockstar ports gta4 or 5 then ill actually buy a switch great the worst assassins creed game yes now i can play this game when im popping ps vita did it before it was cool imagine black flag on the switch you just needed to give this port to panic button i would actually buy this if it included black flag ubisoft is so awesome now were talking only took you two years to put assassins creed on switch better late than never though breaking new ground in the portable space here as this will be the best portable ac game released to date still we expect more to follow ezio collection black flag and rogue make it happen thanks ubisoft i can not wait to play on my switch cool to play a assassins creed on the go but hopefully it will be on the cheap side paying 60 for games i have played 8 years ago no thanks never really played this when it first came out looking forward to giving it a try omg i cant wait to play this im going to 100 everything ubisoft hasnt released a bad switch related product yet so have faith and reserve judgement until the final version sad thing is no matter what ac game you port given how unpredictable the engine has been over the years and all this remastering frame rate can literally go up and down so even if they do optimize whatever they can you will still encounter issues once a lot go on screen keep in mind you can pay this on ps3 and xbox for 3 dollars ac 3 for switch the ezio trilogy for switch ezio confirmed for smash ultimate if i have bought the odyssey season pass on pc steam will i be able to play this on switch because i have finished botw and i really need a good game for my switch i dont think so since steam isnt on the switch but it would be awesome if possible also please do a black flag port i still play this game at least weekly please take my money normally if it was available for the switch i would get it but well its a small screen and its really pixelated up close why this game it comes out on the switch in may while it comes out next month for everywhere else ill just get it on my ps4 lmfao looks and runs worse than last gen consoles thats hilarious thanks ubi iwill buy five copies i hope this fps is just a trailer thing they rly need to fix it the last good ubisoft game omg wtf fix the fps thank you ubisoft first sick game for switch lol im going to buy the first day thanks ubisoft you are one of the most important on nintendo switch just give us ac 2 brotherhood and blackfag already for the switch i did not see any blood where is the blood nintendo will always be last in the generation of console gaming because there still on last generation specs of 1080p when other consoles gone 4k 60 hdr which is very sad for nintendo the only way nintendo can redeem them selfs is they need to make a 4k 60 hdr console ugh i cant wait that long why couldnt yall port seigewhy assassins creed 3 remastered will look better on ps4pro xbox one x and pc then on nintendo switch because on ps4pro xbox one x and pc assassin creed 3 remastered will be 4k60 hdr and on nintendo switch it will be 1080p on the dock witch the nintendo version will be the same graphics as the ps3 and xbox 360 this system was not cut out for games like these this is running at less than 10 fps cool i cant wait until its released framerate looks better here than it did on the direct this is cool and all but what about assassins creed 2 looks good but sounds and fps are bad wtf im glad i have my project scorpio running native 4k for this get it free after all with my aco season pass its the same story assassins creed 3 far cry blood dragon remastered next im hype no blood fair enough sound is bad where is the assassins creed china chlorise for android i can count the amount of frame rates in this video it is cloud base game so you dont get to keep it just rent it out for 3 years nintendo switch got last gen graphics ok but assassins creed 3 has already been on a nintendo console before put the new assassins creed on the switch and ill be impressed looks like the 20 in the year this remaster releases stands for the fps of this remaster oh no a bugged game nice ubi wow dayone played liberation on ps vitaloved the game but bad fps now i have switch and hoping the fps will be at least 30 thanks ubisofti am so excited for play this game on nintendo switch thank you ubisoft assassins creed 3 made me love this saga and now i would play it anytime and anywhere 3 wow i can actually count all 5 frames in this gameplay the frame rate is terrible assassins creed on the toilet im in holly molly i hope black flag gets a port as well my favorite ac game coming to the switch remastered with all the dlc i never played and ac liberation for free i never use this meme because its overplayed butshut up and take my money for how much make it a good deal ubisoft and nintendo if u charge 60 for this is a scam im 100 buying this thank you for the switch release i have never played assassins creed but i may pick this one up i think it looks pretty good and fun to play i like game but boy i hated the long prologue to get the assassin suit im not sure ill get the game because of that damn prologue i never played 3 i wish we got black flag but ill definitely take any assassins creed game for switch rn lol assassins creed 20 fps edition those were ps3 and vita games why is it so choppy it should run perfectly get ready for hot melted plastic in your hands can we get the ezio trilogy got to say i wouldnt mind if you turned down the graphics a little if that would help the performance but im still glad to see that theres finally going to be a portable ac game this is my face assasins creed game i dont like the dlc tho love your switch support please ezio collection rogue and far cry 3 next if the framerate wasnt awful and the pop in was less noticeable this would be nice on switch i mean i can clearly see that horse popping into existance 004 cool now give us all the other ac games as well d i hope the framerate is not like this in the final game now if we can get the ezio collection on switch that would be a dream come true but this has to do good first im buying a copy of this damn whats next writing the declaration of independence simulator 2019 with new funky mode hell yeah this looks amazing but i sure hope ubisoft is going to improve the fps before launch my favourite game in my favourite plataform i still have it for the wiiu didnt know they had the minecraft plastic texture pack in assassins creed 3 hmmm maybe its just a switch exclusive why not release on ios and android plz make rainbow six siege on switch wasnt gonna get this but ill probably pick it up for the switch remaster my bum its clearly is the original version not the actually remastered version releasing on ps4 and xbox while its nice to have it on the go releasing it after the better version comes out in march is clearly stupid and what the hell was ubisoft doing showing clearly unoptimised gameplay id expect it from a small studio but not ubisoft its obviously a rush job this one and just makes them look bad the switch is more powerful than last generation consoles so it should have no issues running ac3 smoothly port r6 siege to switch i appreciate that its on the switch because a lot of people cant get this on other consoles however personally ill be getting this on console mainly because ports like this one dont tend to have the best optimisation and first and second please say theres gonna be a physical version of the nintendo switch edition in germany you should have really shown that trailer at the direct though fix the fps and sound quality and ill be sure to replay ac3 on the switch hell yessss yeah another game i already played for my switch quick act surprised syndicate on switch and japan or vikings theme on the big consoles and il never ever complain again x awesome port will definitely get but if we could have ac4 since thats what everyone really wants ubisoft i hope you can read this im a huge fan and ive got a idea for a sword in far cry new dawn its called joseph our savor its a long sword which has one sharp edge and the other is serated its holy is shaped like joseph seed nailed on the edans gate cross i really hope you can see this and add this in a future update if youve read this thank you and i understand if you cant implement it hahaha this looks like a free mobile game switch version looks like the original version with a downgrade frame rate 10fps why rerelease ac3 for switch children and manchilds are too scared to play mature games wow man totally didnt expect it to come to switch or anything that music gives me so much nostalgia i remember getting this game when it came out glad to see a remastered version of it watchdogs1 will freak me out if someday it comes to nswitch i spent so many hours days weeks months years playing everyday on multiplayer looks like normal version on consoles wtf is thislooks worse than the original console version poor fps very low crowded city and it still has the fucking horses magically appearing out of nowhereall of this within 5 seconds of the video lmao im a ps4 gamer and on ps3 i remember the freerun was pretty well crappy im just looking out for the switch players here did u at least fix that about the game why if you want the janky blurry mess the ps3 version didnt go anywhere when assassins music was amazing lmao i see they took out the last super trash tree running part that was on nintendo direct well played boobisoft not fooling me ohhhh come on ubisoft not the switch u have now lost your sanity im so happy right now will this be released physically ew it still looks horrible oh well when the ps4 and xbox version comes out it will probably look amazing couldve done a remaster for one of the better games maybe like assassins creed 2 but hey connor for smash another 7 year old game that barely runs on the tablet that framerate needs some work ubisoft is this a joke the wiiu version looks and runs better than this trailer you have provided of the switch version it being supposedly the remastered edition they need a 4k switch 019 i like how ubisoft uses shays voice in the ship battle instead of haythams great attention to detail ubisoft start watch dogs 3 when i first saw this i was like wait what is true you should release ezio collection black flag and rogue too the wii u version looks way better its still fun to see how the game would look on ps vita im saying because of the graphics because the switch is amazing and can handle amazing visuals so low quality wow this looks rough and by rough i mean not good at all finally while i am super excited to get this for my switch i do hope they release a patch later down the line to fix the fps thank you ubisoft for bringing ac on the switch hopefully you can bring ac2 remastered as well the graphics are terrible basically is the wiiu version lul now i can play my favorite game thank you ubisoft very cool whos the name of this guy again rat on the carton i know its coming to ps4 but is it going to be standalone or is it only with the season pass of odyssey one of favorite assassins creed games ever made on a console i own and can take anywhere remastered with all the dlc you freaking kidding me count me in ubisoft where is shadows why does the gameplay look worse in the direct you think they would have made sure to not screw that up i will likely buy it but wouldnt have it id based it on the directs footage mmm the tears of haters in this comment section taste so good im pump for assassins creed 3 remastered to come out downgrade lol gotta love that 720p 10fps looks worse than the ps3 version lmao why do they only remaster ac3 and not other games why dont they also put ac odyssey into switch its their newest game no the switch version looks like the original ac3 while the ps4 looks like a true resmastered team switch all day butthat framerate is garbage i hope that its just the video footage that looks bad and not the game itself will multiplayer be here too i want the chronicles series on the switch what ac 3 and liberation those where the 2 shittyest ones why not ac 2 at lest the grafics might hold up and it wont have to run the ship combat please optimize the frame rate i really really want this game wouldve preferred the etsio trilogy but at least its something this is on the switch hello my excitement has been extended thank you ubisoft assassins creed iii demastered omg im sooooo ready i didnt really play too much of this sooo it will give me a brand new start thank you soooo much if it aint etzio i dont want back when ubisoft wasnt pushing agendas smh i thought this was a remaster not a port cant wait for the ac3 remastered but but whyyyy very excited for this is this a typo shouldnt it be called demastered please fix the framerate ac 3 new graphics remaster graphics switch release why couldnt they have given us origin odyssey or black flag any of those three would be more awesome than ac3 heck a remastered version of the ezio chronicles wouldve been sweet too im so going to play this game another 60 port ubisoft is starting to get smarter about making some money god that framerate this ac game is probably going to run like 2030 fps but it looks fine i guess i need to buy a switch for this buying this baby on day one on my switch thanks ubisoft i want to see more assassins creed games why so late what that is sick please add the tyranny of king washington dlc outfit to the main game as a reward for finishing it hell yeah an assassin game on switch one of my favorite game frenchaise awesome ty so much ubisoft love these games god this looks like it just got remastered from a ps2 game framerate looks terrible 60fps please one of my favor games from ubisoft awesome cuz i beat assassins creed 1 and 2 on xbox 360 now i have nintendo switch and im ready to continue the story in part 3 thats cool and all but ive seen some pretty demanding games run smoother than this hope they get that fixed before launch lol people complaining about framerate this is a console its only gonna do 30fps in games like this boi that res bad fps out of ac ac2 ac4 and brotherhood you chose iii remastered im buying switch right now assasins creed 3 was one of the best storyline games i have ever played this console versions of this game had blood effects right hopefully its just turned off in this trailer i can assassin on the go now i definitly need to buy an nintendo switch im still on the fence about buying it though but even i am not that dumb the switch has so many fucking awesome crossplay video games people thank ubi for this they just try hard to get easy money this makes me wanna get a switch just to play it early finally all we need is rdr2 o any rockstar games now i love you ubisoft i thought of this the other day and i bought odyssey gold so i get remastered on xbox but im definitely buying on switch wish

else have preferred a remastering of assassins creed 4 rather than 3 ouch that framerate yes thanks ubisoft switchport please give it to us fully on cartridge please optimize it as best as you can

up but then it makes sense its so meaningful how he tried to amend and make up for his mistakes by helping connor connor loved him like family and knew he owed much to him so yes for me i hope achilles deep inside rested knowing he did the right thing in the end and that he deserved to peacefully rest alongside his own family he missed always so so much that was hella sad shit when i first saw that achilles like how today was a teacher to luke in star wars to conor connor is now the old man on the hill rest in peace achilles the 45 fucktards who disliked this video mistook it for the downloading button imagine connor in a shay outfit coming to his funeral connorwhen gone i amthe last of the assassins will you be 313 eyes closed 318 eyes opened 326 eyes closed lol god the faces what were they thinking one ac game that actually made me cry harder than blackbeards death after this being in homestead always feels empty because missing something achilles held that hole now with him gone holes there the old man on the hill he was the father conner needed to go from the native boy turning into a man which outfit is connor wearing here looks like philly but cant be sure conor ill make you proud old man me goes to boston kill thousand soldiers shay throwing party somewhere when good people died rain poured the earth bcuz the world is crying but in achilles case a thunder and lightning crush mybe angry at him connors outfit is better then ezio and ezio is italian connor is indian it just makes no sense achillies was connors real father i initially hated this game but now ive warmed up to it despite its glitches loved connors story since i have native american blood in me so i feel sympathetic to the mohawk people and their plight did this funeral mission yesterday makes me cry a bit every time its my favourite ac game the story is so deep good and nice done im glad that of all the ac3 remastered videos this one has the most views if only connor knew what achilles did to shay ive never seen a game where the remastered version looks more graphically downgraded than the original i know this might not be related at all but i noticed when connor cuts his hair around the end of the game shays outfit also has short hair was this intentional or is it a glitch because when i replay a memory with shays outfit he still has long hair can anybody else check this out so hes with the other assassins shay killed best ac story ever connor looks far from 19yrs old how do u sprint my guy keeps jogging why does connor look so white until it comes time for me to join you then i will bother you once again im not crying youre crying altair and ezio are amazing but conor is my favourite one game is not enough for him there should be a sequel with the system of unity that would be an amazing game i used the tribal outfit of connor at achilles burial achilles never even got to say goodbye rest in peace old man peace in heaven and u will be missed but never forgoten i completed tje game and didnt get the mowhawk haircut i whant it so badly man even the remastered game looks atrocious i only played the original but i dont remember it being this ugly or did they only remaster the main gameplay aspect and keep the cutscenes as they were then again it is being played on an xbox go to afterlife hug his mother bother achilles again kick his father ass once again subtitles in the end werent synced to the dialog i still think that achilles is a big dummy dumb dumb holy fuck i didnt know this game had fast travel i finished the game traveling by foot and hated these missions so much because the distances are so far im not fucking crying youre crying that old man knowingly sent a guy to grab an artefact from a city knowing that it would kill hundreds of people via a massive earthquake and not telling the guy what would happen then he got all angry about it when people tried to stop him repeating it again and i fucking hate it when the good people die thank you so much because i fucking played the game thats not remastered and i got so mad what a fucking plane character one dimension what a fucking letdown after ezio connor has no emotions yours in brotherhood a are you indian in this game i never finished the game i was stupid back then that i thot i had to be the young version of connor but seeing the older version of him is a badass but anyone knows why he died its just i got stick with connor father but i hope yall understand lmao i dont know how ubisoft pulled it off but they somehow made the remastered version look worse than the original here comes the tear train why son of the bich why why you have given information in title glad to see they fixed the dyed robes in cutscenes bug the subtitles in this game are terrible not only are they slow they look bad imagine a conversation between kratos and connor i swear they will never say each others name this is so sad knowing that connor is like far dead and with achilles now in the end of a heartbraking video im getting a shitty ad of idle heroes p and boom shay comes out of nowhere to kill his old mentor what if shay killed him and haytham shouldve said good shay goodnow kill himkill him now this was my first ever assassins creed which lead me to play the first free and the new ones that came with time so i need help from the community is this remaster worth the money ive never cried so hard playing a character while digging a grave back when ac had good writing the best assasin in my book the plot the person he is and the choices he makes he fights for what he believes to be right and saves people as many as he can and yeah no hoes not yet at least finally a version where hes not dressed up as ezio did the fix the bug were he comes back to life and walks around the house also i beat the homestead missions before i did the game so he never actually died it was fucked up what a beautiful and sad ending if shay didnt let achilles live then there would be no connor and the templar continued its rule in american colonial rite how come the old man walked holding a stick when connor first came but was able to walk without any help 15 years later i will bother you once again damnconor is emotionlessimagine if your mentor who give you shelter and raised you died sorta like yodas death rip achillesone of the greatest assassins whos lived did he turn off the music or why was his death so boring i can feel connors emotionlessness lol from the thumbnail it looks like conor tomahawked achilles in the face haythem may have been your father but he was your daddy i make a mistake on the game and at the end of everything aquilles is alive when connor said he misses achilles just like he misses his mother that hit me pretty hard achilles actually dies connor now your outfit is mine along with your home bitch achilles did not die in the normal ac3 this looks worse than the original why did they bother with a remaster if the quality was supposed to be like this and people even bought this product they ruined the fucking character models man wtf lol but conners hairstyle didnt look like that in the other version pepehands not again this is without a doubt the worst remastered game i have seen the only thing that looks different is the lighting this is my favorite ac game and it disappoints me to see ubisoft still doesnt give a shit about their games want to play the game just get the previous version as its backwards compatible had high hopes that it would be good i hate how the screan blacks out everytime he enters and exits interiors in the original it was seamless no blackout you saw him open the door walk out and close it achilles might have redeem himself at the end but still he was the worst mentor in all of the assassins in the series the graphics doesnt look that much different from the original one of the heartearing moment after connors mother death the fathers prayer and connors goodbye seemed a little different than the original it seemed like few extra lines were added i could be wrong though why i missed this cutscenes i wish you weared shays outfit at russian version voice connor is better connor is such a wholesome character it would be funny if connor was wearing shays outfit achilles passed away it is beautiful old man hilarious good to see connor has his fathers and grandfathers humour this is ugly i once had a glitch where he wanted me to get the painting after his funeral i like how connor chuckled when he said he would bother him again why do the facial models look worse in the remaster sure the environments and backgrounds look better but the faces are noticeably bad i played this mission last night and it literally crashed my xbox i dont remember playing this side mission ever notice that you cant wear a different colored outfit in the cut scenes in the original game in game you are wearing the boston one but in the cut scene it will just change to the original outfit u know what sucks all of this is optional i only got these cutscenes on my third playthrough dudei was wearing the exact same outfit oo 304 wheres the music and this is why connor is my favorite character and why ac3 is my favorite game so much depth hidden behind those facial expressions some things arent blatantly stated but the eyes say everything that neednt be said out loud why are the subtitles broken thats what you get for calling achilles an old man man i miss you as i miss my mother that was fucking sad connor really deserved another game he should have been at least the second playable character in unity as he would have only been in his early to mid 30s what the fuck man the only thing i really dislike about the remaster albeit small is the fact that the animation of entering and leaving the house was replaced with a black screen to wait hey sorry to ask could you show us the achilles outfit this is better than the old version they fixed the glitch where dyed robes dont show up in cutscenes what are you talking about ac rouge remastered looks so much better if im being honest then the assassins could literally just steal the shroud of eden and use it on desmonds corpse which would resurrect him so what you wanted was a remake not a remaster when i played it haythem literally never told connor that washington did it i thought you could already double assassinations on low profile i remember doing that several times my real name is connor i should change my last name to kenway because i dont care what i spend with money plus i dont care about names i used to love this game i didnt notice until i got the remaster how bad the controls are assassins creed iii diplay more viually accurate image uing more light and material propertie to make the world feel more alive i wish that the navel combat got upgraded to assassins creed 4 black flag navel combat assassins creed iii remastered could fix everything it wont but it couldve then whats the point of making this video for god sake lazerzz cant you make the difference between a remake and remaster a remaster cant change the game completely ac3 odyssey origins it could fix everything by reverting back from those disgusting rpg games back to what its supposed to be ac3 was one of the worst for me but at least its still an assassins creed stealth game and not a crappy dungeons and dragons forced sidechore simulator with cheap snappy hack n slash combat but seriously all they need to do is reboot like what capcom did to resident evil going back to survival horror instead of action its a shame that colonial america was an interesting time period but ubisoft managed to f it up ubisoft ac 3 remastered audience hell yeah ubisoft more trailing mission audience wasting my money hell yeah why do streamers and youtuber always look like they live in an abandoned house and have the worst wishcom mics ive ever scene connor made fucking stupid decisions throughout the story i hope they changed it so that your different colored outfit will show in the cutscenes and not always the default one no to be funny but this was a really shit video pls do better im getting itbecause i bought the ultimate edition of assassins creed odysseyi felt remorse after 15 hours of gameplay still the only assassins creed youtuber ill watch thats a load of shit ac 3 had one of the best stories maybe the death of desmond was shitty but a shay driven story where haytham turns templar and has a child with a native american to have connor was great and connor then has no choice to kill his grandmaster templar fathergreat story every story except assassins creed unity was great unity was the only shitty story people who dont like connor need to fight me him and edward are the best assassins in the series lazerrz please just stop playing ac games i agree with you that ubi messed up and yes it started with unity being broken but you dont seem to even be enjoying gaming at all and your videos have just been negative speak up for fucks sake you demented lumbagide come at me biach connor having a personality no not yet that would probably be the worst thing they could do they need to get back on track after odyssey they need to get back to the original controls and mechanics with a good storyline before that make a remastered eventually a remastered would be cool but not yet this guy is so irritating way too much sarcasm if they full on remake assassins creed 1 they should keep the exact same combat controls an all idc what anyone says ac3 is my fav ac they just needed to add like crouching and outfit customization like odyssey oh boy trying to vamp up and provide more detail doesnt give it a 40 price as it was already made yes they are giving the dlc free but its as stupid as going on to the 360 and still seeing all the dlcs for 10 i wanted to like this game but i just couldnt get in to it due to pointless missions and starting off the game it is very very slow and i got quite fed up with it i hope they fix the missions and some of the broken mechanics that stopped me getting my achievements and playing it but at the same time i hope they allow us to do mission objects 1 at a time so you dont have to do it all at once to get the 100 as some of the missions would screw you over origins reminded me of street fighter and two other games and thats why after an hour of playing it i sold it didnt bother with the recent one as its just as bad i think this yr has me getting cod and this i played through aciii once when it came out and the thing that pissed me off the most was it was so fucking hard to make money i couldnt upgrade shit in that game i got the season pass for odyssey so i get aciii remastered free but im not sure if im even going to bother i say just enjoy the game and stop criticizing every fucking detail of every ac game just because ubisoft decides to not make every game the exact same so we dont get fucking bored but people dont give the games and chance and immediately criticize every game because the last one fucked up connors greatest flaw was coming right after eziothe cheesiest protagonist ever if i never knew my father watched my mother burn alive and had to keep the company of a bunch of white boring hypocrites in hopes of saving what is left of my people at the very least i would be a rude guy ubisoft messed up a lot in game design and storytelling but they actually started doing realistic and humane protagonists after ac iii wtih flawed ideology naivety shortsightness instead of overtalented godlike and pussy magnet genius with only one significantand inconsistent flaw for narratives sake no offense but you whispering plus the way you pronounce h makes me want to punch you in the face im looking forward to ac3 just cause im happy to see that its actually getting attention and the work that needs to be done on it all these years later the gaming mechanics in ac3 were shit in all honesty sidenote i really love ac3 but im still gonna criticize it even the graphics werent even on par with revelations which only came out a year before connor as a character was good in my dumb 13yearold self but now that i look back on it there were some things that made him really bland and dislikable he had potential cause he was likable during the homestead missions but for the main storyline he was just a sour baby i wish they could fix some elements in the main story cough desmond dying cough but i understand that once you release something it then becomes canon unless somehow ubisoft pulls a haha got you bitch you thought we killed him off but nope hes here and still alive but to end this comment off ill just say out of any game to remaster ok so i have a question why do people really hate this game and connor as a member of the mohawk tribe i think connor is a very interesting character and very good representation for our people plus the game was just fun you acting like a 5 year old like shut up omg i never got why they made an assassin creed rogue remastered when i first saw the trailer i thought it was really dumb im hoping theyll remove all those optional objectives or at least lower them down to just one permission or not fix them to where theyre not such an absolute bitch to do this is the adult i wanna be making videos with my wine in the frame revealing my crippling alcohol addiction this is just a joke and a remastered it was amazing normally itll just add a lot of microtransactions if he actually liked ac still he wouldnt get views thats why he bashes it so damn hard the funny thing is that after the trash talk after the hate you all gave to the series after alllll that y still are going to buy every godamn game that they make assassins creed has gone wild and y dont like it i just feel shame for everyone of you what is the point of keeping desmond it start become borin desmont using the animos then you recovery a piece of the enden then repeat so conner being angry was a problem he watched his people and his mother burn his entire people were being murdered his father was evil in my opinion his anger is completely justified and its fits anyway thats my opinion but it has always irked me when people say he was badly written great video btw it was very entertaining people dont realize that desmond was the last hope of the assassins ac3 is honestly the last game in the complete franchise desmond perspective dude you have to realize different people have different taste its called subjectivity you speak as if your opinions are objective and makes you sound like a know it all douche bag i cant do desmond death all over again i know you dont like ac 3 but i still think you throw to much hate especially since you are always saying other people hate on you for your opinion horrendous video and youre so boring just erase desmonds death that would be great i might get it on switch with the bayek outfit connor is not always mad the assassins dont need a reputation they live in the shadows what could he truly do to kill washington they made up to it with the tyranny dlc and that timeline is before that he got the info of the betrayal of his village id be tired as well man but lee literally hurted him when he was a child and was powerless same day also lost his mother hes trying to prove hes not weak he chose his target you want something big to happen to a characters development and meaning we got that in altair and ezios story but we got to remember its their game and they decide theyre trying something new heck even make remasters but notice how they didnt remastered the first one yet i think well get something similar like a ezio collectionbut an altair collection with bloodlines remake and something else perhaps giving ubisoft 2 years time means gg you should play halo it seems like the type of game for you i posted on reddit about the possibility of ubisoft fixing that uneventful ending in aciii by just ya know not killing desmond and changing the timeline downvotes became my closest friends 803 ac 3 remastered cutscene leak new facial animations i just wanna find charles lee dammnit crouching would be nice connor was angry at everyone because he was always being used by everyone he watched his mother burn to death he grew up with the main goal in his life being revenge psychologically that would most likely make someone always angry ac3 had the saddest story tbh and i really liked the idea of connors character type but they didnt execute it well desmond needs a story choice at the end but if they dont kill desmond than the world is dead and ac4 wont make sense since they dont have a annonymus ac3 was my last ac game until origins the death of desmond and the conclusion of the modern day plot ended the series for me right there ive no problem with ubisoft bringing back old ac games like the ezio collection and 3 remastered but they could have better marketing if they held off on releasing the ezio collection what i mean is if theyd focus on remastering ac 1 and 3 back then instead of releasing the ezio collection we could have gotten the assassins creed the desmond chronicles title is a work in progress that way we could have had together ac 1 2 brotherhood revelations and 3 remastered might be too much to have all 5 games on 1 disc but this way we have all ac games to date on the ps4 xbox one and pc yeah desmond aint coming back man i miss your ac vids thanks for uploading and good job i want desmond back in the new games much better than the girl from the last two or the faceless person from every ac after 3 can you preorder for pc sees the alexios outfit theyre putting in the remastered edition me hes not an assassin hes a wannabe assassin that the fandom for the most part hated calls the doctor yeah could you do me a favor let me go back in time and kill this game called assassins creed odyssey ac 3 ruined the series story wise imo according to the actor who played desmond he was getting kind of boring so ubisoft decided to go another way its unfortunate as the character had a lot of potential to become the ultimate assassin i think the real cause for the series to go downhill story wise was kiling lucy it was dumb that she was a templar the character and desmond had good chemistry but they offed the character because the actor wanted more money the creative director left the series after brotherhood so it would be interesting to find out what went on behind the scenes did he leave out of frustration or was he fired because they were frustrated with him the desmond character unfortunately was a casualty as the actor laments ubisoft should take 4 years off and stay away from assassins creed then make a good ass game come back drop it and then rest again imo remastering old games is a lazy waste of time plus quick cash grab again just another scallywagger who cant take an l from the usa look man i understand that you really hate ac 3ac 3 is amazing but i respect your opinion but doing videos where youre hating on ac 3 is just wrong and stupid you know that some of your subs like ac 3 rightby hating on ac 3 in every single one of your videos about ac 3 just makes you less likeable to some of your fans just like i said you hate ac 3 its your opinion and we all respect it you dont have to make videos hating on ac 3 to say it couldnt you just inform us about the remaster without hating on a game some of us absolutely love yes remake the serie you can disable hud settings in get this the settings hey haters stop hating they work hard on stuff to make things better and be more grateful ac 4 was my favourite actually revelations never played ac 3 myself it and syndicate ate the only ac games i havent played but i will be getting ac 3 as it comes with my odyssey gold edition so im not trying to be rude at all but wtf is your problem with ac3 everything you said was cool and all buuuut where is charles lee well they still can not fix connor the only way you could do that is by changing the whole story and connor himself 930 id genuinely not realised that desmond is going to be in the remasterive tried to just forget the modern day i hope they let us use the aquila outfit in free roam the one you get to use on the ship missions not the shitty dlc one with the huge bracers yo ac 3 im happy honestly unity is better after they fixed all the bugs i hope they port the ezio collection on the switch connor being angry makes sense becuase his mother is deadhis tribe all his friends dead hes in foreign territory id be angry ha this man is made out of pure sarcasm he is gonna sound sarcastic on his wedding and on his deathbed beautiful mate i didnt know laurence mckenna had an assassins creed youtube channel you are mentally retarded go see a doctor love your videos i was one of the people who loved ac3 and i thought it was great i think what people see as anger in connor is really just coldness honestly it fits with his character development he lost everything when he was a child 7 or 8 years old someone who goes through something like that would be angry at the world trying to prove something so to me it makes sense and doesnt bother me he wouldnt be like ezio or kennedy in that sense heard his jokes and i was waiting for the sienfield music to start playing slightly sad that it didnt we need an alternate ending to ac3 and then an alternate series that is closer to the original that way everyone gets what they want a close b close im close to deleting this game james i have an idea how they can fix the franchise we see the scene where desmond dies after juno leaves his body behind kassandra shows up and switches out the bodies with isu powers and revives him remember origins microtransactions odyssey made me miss them the ac3 theme is so good lol when i heard theres going to be some improvments in ac3 i wasnt the only that thought dont kill desmond i did like ac 3 but those minor things you mentioned for example haytham revealing washington was behind the whole plot to burn connors village things like that definitely needed to be adjusted as it seemed a bit awkward how connor reacted i would agree such small changes could have changed the game in a positive way but i am happy with some of the other improvements im hearing about we shall see out of all the remasters they could have put effort on they chose ac3 i love ac3 because what i felt when i first played it but oh my god what a funny video i laughted so hard watching this despite my love for the game and at the same time i think you gave really good ideas that would improve the game so keep going dude great job you dont like it because youre british i dont know about you all but i trust ubisoft in making the best assassins creed games for this generation and the next one and i clearly dont care about what any of you think because when odessey came out you all complained and thought it will be bad game and ubisoft proved you were all wrong about it and i didnt even think for second that odessey is bad because i trust ubisoft and i am not gonna listen to couple of fools who hadnt tried the game before it came out and became one of the best game in 2018 so for the better or the worst i know ubisoft will make better games in the future its a remaster not a remake lol this channel has gone from delivering news updates and reviews of ac to a listen to my ac rant and why i hate very small details at times and hate the whole franchise for it it gets really annoyying and its not because i dont agree with you but how you pin point the most vague details at times and instead of sharing your opinions it feels more like youre imposing your hate on your audience you legit are just complaining in most of you videos since quite some time be more optimistic or best just make your own game and play it dammit i loved connor and my first ac game was ac2 so yea james sorry you can stop being an ass about it but yea stop desmond being killed and hopefully we can not have odyssey by this mentality yes please but origins has to stay looks really promising but i doubt itll fix everything lmao btw i like your channel have taken a break from it for a while though but i have a suggestion i would enjoy a lets play on my current favoritgame kingdom come deliverance it has gone through multiple patches since the release one year ago contains 3 dlcs as well you could even play as an medieval assasin there people love to hate ubisoft connor is angry all the time because hes native american cant you tell native americans are angry its just part of our culture anyone who hates conor must be prejudice against native americans lazerzz drink less coke its not healthy for you everytime i watch a video your always drinking coke no matter what they do to improve ac3 theres still two problems 1 connors terrible personality 2 the death of the modern day story also lazerzz i thought you dont make assassins creed videos what happened to your ethics seven years later and i am still mad about desmonds death haythem im sorry wut need to watch more of your live streams but when ac 1 remastered hopefully they dont kill off desmond in assassins creed 3 remastered i am keen for this ac3 isnt the amazing but its good fun great video lazers keep desmond alive the ultimate retcon best ac ever if you think otherwise eat shit and die ubisoft fucked up when they lkilled desmond i bought odyssey gold i preordered it was a bad decision i no longer play odyssey i cany stand it but love 3 just make the video like those pauses you make are funny every now and again but it gets annoying after a while cause you do it wayyyyy too much also dont kill desmond and then remake ac4 with desmond lmfaooo not a fan of ac3 just wait until you play assassins creed unity 1139 what do you mean weak sarcasm you made a 30 min vid of just sarcasm and it was great king richard iii quality content as always you literally have a conan obrien style going on impressive lol it actually was the first i played ironic one of my least favorites though remastered is already out i have an australian copy of the game i subscribed im gonna be honest with lad youre not very funny and i disagree with pretty much all you say but i dont want you to disappoint your family so im gonna help you out i will be getting ac 3 remastered because i got the season pass for mercenary sht odyssey that has by far the best dlc in any ac game i would rather not drink my daily gallon of clorox than buy anything with the words assassins creed 3 in them assassins creed 3 score is best score will we get edwards arnos and jacobs outfits or only the outfit from that shit movie it would be nice playing as desmond againi would of loved a full modern game with him but it will never happen my children could eat this month that kills me i hate when your talking and a ad comes up and cuts you off kid sentence jesus people really disagree with u seeing the graphics difference from the original and the remastered version now is just phenomenal honestly im exited for ac3 remastered for only 2 reasons that being as followed 1 haytham kenway 2 freedom usa usa usa usa usa usa hey lazerzzmany of your criticisms in this video are understandable i think ubisoft should be made aware of them but despite that i still plan on playing the remastered version of this game when the time comes if its anything like the remastered version of the ezio collection then i might enjoy it but mostly i will enjoy playing a character at one of my favorite to read about time periods in history i have my own reasons for liking this please respect it connor is just such a boring character who shows no emotion and makes bad decisions for himself but i will still get this game just for the gameplay and combat ac3 was in my opinion the best ac odyssey isnt even a bad game can you do some more assassins creed what if or lore vids plz im the 666th like lord satan shall make it so ac3 remastered nah fuck that ac3 rebooted bam desmond is alive boom every after doesnt exist i hope the pc version actually works i tried the original ac3 on pc and it just had the weirdest glitches assassins creed 3 is one of my favorite i appreciate the time and efforts you put into your videos lazerzz dont let joraptor see you talk bad about the ubisoft store hell cry in helix credits what do you guys think is a better game ac3 or odyssey personally id like to off myself for thinking about those 2 games again your trying so hard to be funny but its not working lol wait you missed one point as you said dont kill desmond but i say dont kill desmond but do kill connor liked ac3 except the far too long prologue but never played rogue cause i didnt want play as a traitor to the brotherhood who figured control and world domination was better then fighting for the freedom of humanity 929 i was waiting for that the entire video once again another british person hating on ac 3 because of the reveloutionary war get over it america has won its freedom assassins creed sucks major donkey dick worst assassins creed game ever i uninstalled odyssey a while ago im getting it cause i was stupid and got the gold edition of odyssey oh boy how i wasted my money on that utter shite 703 and thats alsoan opinion ive tried playing through ac3 twice once when it came out and last year never made it to the end either time found it so bad that i stopped buying ac games but i dunno if they release the remaster for free i may make it to the end he needs ubisoft to make more remastered assasins creed games so he can fap more to its graphics btw the reason why connor brushed off the fact that it was washington who ordered the burning of the village was because it would not benefit him or anyone his main focus changed course from vengeance to a general conflict like helping the patriots freedom if connor goes after washington major conflict will happen and more problems will occur connor wasnt angry all the time omg lazerzz listen to me right now stop streaming with your girlfriend for views or i will unsubscribe your doing this just for the money and i dont like it conor needs to rape heathen im surprised of how much theyve done by ubisoft standards holy shit your a fucking moron and you should stop making videos fuck you very much desmond still lives in the grey isnt the game free if you have the season pass youre good at confirmation bias the remaster isnt even out yet this is hilarious bit far fetched but but at least you have hope idk why people hated ac3 i liked it a lot aside from desmond dying i never played ac3 before so its cool that i get it for free with season pass and the other ac3 remake there was a turkey assassin this game is already perfect just with a turkey assassin the best ac youtuber i really wish we got a remake of 1 like with side missions and less repetitive main missions but then again ubisoft would only port it over to current gen and if were lucky update the graphics a bit 134 where did the switch go u get so many views on ac vids lol finally remastered time to see why so many people like ac 3 also wont make it next saturday ill be busy the whole day and also ima play the game by my self new plan remaster every game so desmond doesnt die im a fucking genius i have the season pass of odyssey so i get it for free assassins creed 3 remastered the only thing i could see it fixing is gameplay really ac3 wasnt a great game lol lets rememberassassins creed 3 remasterednotassassins creed 3 remake alright you are skeptical about the game but i havent heard any positive things the only positive things you said good thing they are even making remasters otherwise please dont buy the game i dont get why people buy games only to be toxic if you dont want to enjoy the game dont play it its like talking to kids i laughed at 204 i love watching your videos i love assassins creed as a franchise and your videos give me insight on them and like you i lo e debating like adults ac3 is still my favourite game ever i dont know how but it is they do have to be assassins creed i feel like they could put in a clip of desmonds conscious is still their but became trapped in the eye so that they can do a similar thing with juno and give him a new body with the dna samples they have of him in abstergo but ubisoft most likely wont it better youre such a prat honestly im playing from ac2 to ac4 in a row completing ac3 for the first time we need a assassins creed 1 remaster but why assassins creed shit first i need an explanation am i getting it absolutely fucking not james imagine if ubisoft thought about the fan base for once and changed the present day to desmond not dying and they continue the desmond story line in the next assassins creed i hope theres photo mode in ac3 remastered there should be a four pillars subreddit james is a funny guy who agrees i thought you said your not an ac channel anymore i hope they remaster ac1 like this too adding more features to gameplay i actually did some concept art for if desmond lived for the rest of the series feel free to check it out on my instagram millsteadart a close b close ubisoft just gave us the toughest choice in odyssey yet assassins creed 3 wasnt a bad game connor is a likable character but obviously too each their own they do need to add the epilogue when they make gameplay changes i hope they allow full duel wielding like in ac 4 instead of the main weapon and side blade i dont know everything about you laz but its obvious you dont like the route the franchise took starting with ac 3 i enjoyed ac 3 and had varying enjoyment from the previous games i also enjoyed ac 4 however i only had mild enjoyment from unity liberty felt pointless rogue was ok and origins was great however odyssey is a mess honestly probably unpopular opinion but i feel like the game would have done better if it just removed all the dialogue choices and had choices be action based only or just remove choice all together present day timeline after desmonds death was interesting in ac 4 in unity it was eh in liberty it was worse in rogue it was ok and in origins whoever the chick was i dont like her now hearing that sweet soothing voice james do asmr videos you better fucking enjoy it because its the last time youre gonna get anything from ubisoft that resembles old ac formula theyre making a shit ton of money from microtransactions and they will never return to what this series was ubisoft remasters all the other games apart from the first strange i got my first mafia city add on tvis video i know dead meme but it was my first and it means alot to me enjoyed the video james i personally like ac3 but i recognize its faults and the criticisms you present has he said anything on how he would fix the franchise if so where im not talking about bringing back desmond but where it stands now how could they fix it the series went downhill with desmonds death lighting shit in 2017 does anyone remember 2014 lmao did james even film himself back then ac iii is incredibly underrated ubisoft doesnt have the balls to do it to much retcons but i would love the changes youve mentioned me when the assassins creed 3 soundtrack starts to play huhhooohhhooooouuuuuhhh huhhhh uhhhhhh ohhhuuu uhhh your more sarcastic than i am stop it thats my job all i want is ac 1 to be remastered i dont want fucking rogue and 3 well this was a bit of trip to the old days not that ill play it but the info from my 1ac youtuber was nice but i could have not had any reason to watch this and it still would have been worth it for that oddsey intro what a great lough your jokes i mean what u consider as jokes they are not funny assassins creed 310 i love ac3 not for conner fuck him not realy tue story either but the time setting its one of my favourite time periods after the crusades cos well knights and shit oh look another negative video about ac by none other than lazerzz look as much as i dont mind where the series is heading despite the shit dlc i really think you should try making videos about the more positive things you like in ac fizhy made a video about ac brotherhood which i really liked you keep making way too many videos shitting on how the new ac sucks and it is starting to bore me we get it lazerzz you dont like the current state of ac its not like you told us that the first 100 times im actually looking forward to ac3 remastered james do you believe any new ac games will be transported on to the next generations of consoles ps5xbox2 edit great vid by the way keep it up a close b close presses close option takes you to the store anyways this game is such a mess honestly if everything youre reading off is true that i remaster could be pretty sound hopefully they run the naval missions of the ac4 engine i kind of want them do that now hell have layla use the temporal bullshit staff to go back in time tell desmond have him survive and rewrite mistakes in the series buff u laser u onli hat asasino creso tree becuss u ar britis butt in realiti it is da best asasino credo gam evar mad dont understand your point of removing connors only characteristic that make him different from the others protagonists from the franchise he dont trust anyone and when he does they fuck him up hes a introvert in society good work on working version seems 7 years too late but you know ubisoft needs its money plus lets relive the fact desmonds modern day that has been the peak of storytelling it couldve been but ubisoft does the norm and screws it assassins creed 3 remastered is the epicest assassins creed since assassins creed 3 why dose he keep moving his mic how about ac4 remaster damn i miss these old games where is charles lee ive always loved ac3 and always will you really dont like assassins creed 3 huh lol whats the point of remastering ac 3 like actually someone give me a reasonably response please ac3 remade the whole series remade just burn all of the other games make them part of the alternative reality shit please i hope everyone has a nice day gamers since when where ur videos actually good btw ac3 soundtrack dope its decent not so greatnot so bad i miss the early ac days i wish ubisoft would fix it but there gonna this is ubisoft were talking about we need that cut off connor speeach are you implying ac3 isnt perfect unsubbed excuse me but ac3 is a masterpiece and connor is the best character you ezio dickrider you just hate it because youre british i have been waiting for james to make a video in ac3 remastered yay microtranscations in a single player game good job ubi james could love ac 3 he wont but he couldve 204 facts sorry lazerzz but ac3 doesnt need anything fixed but ubisoft being the company they are have further improved the game in a way i never thought possible ac3 is a superb game the way they it is and the plot needs no improvement whatsoever quit being an ezio dickrider and accept the fact that ac3 is the best ac game to exist yesi remember me in my ps3 playing ac 3the fps drop was hard back in the dayhope its fixedanywayi cant wait to play it a video about my favourite game of all time and the only game i have ever played in my life epic cant wait to play as a native american spartan in american evolution cant wait hey james do you think you could ever make a video about how to do a podcast kind of showing how you and tyler set things up and stuff i think it would be cool great video dont forget its ubisoft were talking about here theyll find a way to mess it up the pigs will make everything better i dont understand its coming to mobile right anyone please tell me iam excited i need my zelda and mario skin in this game assassins creed mam miaaaaaaa nice work ubisoft now can you port the ezio trilogy please fuck this game l want the witcher 3 and gta 5 on the nintendo switch wtf the 20 fps fix it the graphics on ps3xbox 360 are better then the nintendo switch very nice thank you guys we must support this game please if we want to see more on nintendo switch thanks ubisoft im going to buy the first day i like everything in this remastered version except 20 fps please correct i bet theres only gana be 1 ac game on swich nintendo switch no remaster still waiting for ac1 remaster how high is the frame rate then probably 30 right i am sorry but this just looks same as original i hope on pc it will be better why do it look even on ps4 pro worse than original pc version with ultra graphics graphics look really bad on this glad i got it on ps4 already still cool its coming to switch though im playing liberation hd right now and optinalization is terrible on my gtx 1060 to have 5060 fps i have to play on low and draw distance is set like on 0 textures are loading in front of my face even when i turn graphic on ultra still loading textures is shitty thank you thank you thank you thank you this was one of the games that i most wanted for the switch the game i really really really want for the switch would be far cry 3 its a genredefining classic and could easily be handled by the switch pretty please oo ac on the switch first its ubis optimisation then its the actual switch everyone be ready for a constant 20 25 fps and 60 while looking into a corner why 3 why not ezio collection or 12 i mean 3 is known to be the worst ac on the desmond saga its not bad at all but ezio games were better plus if a new player is interested in starting the series on switch why should heshe start with 3 it makes no sense at all i suppose all the answers are related to sales and numbers but idk i left the saga on 3 i would rather prefer 4 since the main plot ended on 3 or a collection to revive good memories assassins screed odysey on xbox assassins screed on switch switch is becoming a great console love to buy one so this is the reason for downgrade im playing dark souls remastered on switch right now and im satisfied with it should i get this one on switch too well fck my life i dont have a switch or even a ps4 or a xbox one or a pc when do ubisoft make good graphic game on mobile dear ubisoft this game sound awful and looks unpolished barely running at 30fps which weird to me since this a old gen game even 360 and wii u run this game more stable and with better sound at least as far as the trailer goes thanks you ubisoft what needs a remastering is not the game but the console all these graphic whores in the comment section this trailer is better httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9iupdcucfk4 you can see the differences between the old and the new version you can see the framerate drops it feel more fluid never played it being a nintendo owner will be buying ac on the fucking go the future is now ubisoft how about you actually put some effort into this and spend some time to ensure the game looks and runs well because this trailer doesnt impress me games like warframe wolfenstein and doom have proven that the switch is more than capable of handling aaa titles so for your own sake have some pride in your own work and release something good youre already somewhat of a shitty company with all of your rehashes millions of different editions and microtransactions so i really think you cant afford screwing more things up this game could be the make or break for the future of ubisoft on switch graphics look like shit i am going to buy for the switch and for the ps4 thanks ubisoft love your games not to be negative buuuut ac3 was a train wreck when it launched and now they putting it on the switch lets hope every single bug will be fixed i didnt know that nintendo switch is actually that powerfull to run a game like this nice action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming action is coming big pokemon fan here comsidered to buy it because gen 8 is about to release this year also a big fan of ac man gonna buy switch for both of them almost sell my switch and this shit arrived where is ps4 023 how this is coming i have played in ps3 not there i am buying it honestly i have been saving money for a year i really hope they dont mess up this port or cancel it just like what happened with steep i just want a portable open world assassins creed game that runs and looks well assassins creed 3 yellow edition ahaha only remastered games for this console hey nintendo players did you buy skyrim xd assassins creed 3 is one of the best the series offers 480p 30fps low settings well i already got the odyssey season pass but otherwise i would buy it this is the news whete i was waiting for hopefully can assassins creed odyssey can release outside japan for the switch thats even better i dont understand why many people hated this game it had a really good story yeah the protagonist wasnt as expressive as ezio but i didnt mind conor the gameplay was very fun i loved the combat stealth and the parkour the world might felt like its missing something but it didnt take away from the enjoyment this game provided i will rather play original game that pay for a remastered we need more beautiful game like assassin creed in nintendo switch i love you ubisoft cool ac on the switch a dream comes true hopefully it will be better than ac liberation on ps vita last gen games runs rly well on switch where is ezio collection can i get a pc version free switch are the worst port also switch plebs only plays nintendo games btw box art is awesome time to get this game for the third time fellas nice 30fps low pc version damn this is ugly as hell nice play ubisoft i knew it assassins creed iiirecolored if it was black flag i wouldve gotten a switch this week that looks like 30fps to me im really interested to see how this nintendo switch remaster compares to the original version ps3 graphics already pre ordered via odyssey the masterpiece is coming back look how this is gonne cost 50 euros and be like 15 within two months this looks way to rough to pay anything a above 20 for thanks you no dont port a good ac game port the worst one ubisoft whats with the growtopia server that is getting worse and worse it have an online mode very good the game dude this game so old no blood on this version sigh edit as the guy in the comment under me says its an option in the settings my bad nice and next all consoles am buying it for the switch on the go stop showing trailers for something we already know give us some skull and bones god sake whyyyy may i guess im buying the ps4 version great news for nintendo switch

will you play days gone when it comes out just so you know brad odyssey was freaking lit on pc loved the graphics and everything sighthis was when ac still had a good flowing smooth combat system how can ubisoft call this remastered in my opinion the graphics are worse than when the game first came out 7 years ago you said if you finish this game so how can you title these videos as a walkthrough cmon brad lets be honest and stop bullshitting here youre only titling videos as walkthroughs for the views just like sekiro its your first play through of the game but its a walkthrough really u are welcome you should colab with h20 delirious i watched him and wouldve watched your videos if i knew of your videos back then lol when will u play part 18 wouldnt be spotted if you were in stealth mode whenever i heard finch it reminds me of australian cricketer aaron finch theradbrad 1034 you failed it because multiple interruptions will fail the eavesdrop i think him turning around and spotting you counts as an interruption 1006 also warns you so scribe to my youtube channel watch my new video in my old video right now dont forget to like the video do you know when the new wolfenstein is coming out i was excited to see arnos outfit then i saw its brown wtf his outfit is dark blue amazing as always yes it has been a great experience why is the thumbail from ac unity why do u use arnos

are the best youtuber because i never felt bored watching your videos love from earth brad use the snar on enemys its a wikid death broo the thumbnail looks like arno dorian in his outfit i remember

like those horses they are why out of proportion another part plz really enjoying this trip down nostalgia lane ac unity outfit with ac unity lighting in ac3 love this game it all went downhill since ac blackflag came out in my opinion doritos representative watching video this kid gots the dorito spririt hire him its crazy how much ac has changed over the years and somehow everyone still loves em odyssey became my favorite even though its so different 25 min more or less is perfect for a video you got and do shit perfect or near perfect thanks brad to every pig or turkey have some doritos fam i love u brad upload the next video im hooked on watching you play this can you please use the rope darts because that weapon is epic wonder how any of the fear games will hold up they were such a good game hey if you guys can check my channel out it would mean a lot why is the unity suit brown btw i havent watched these vids i just wanted to see what arnos outfit looks like how do i activate the assassins creed 3 remastered from odyssey after i buy the the season pass you need to make shirts that says oh how convenient lol i remember the prison and everything you should run around the city by the rooftop the parkour is amazing if your tailing someone go above and tail them the next ac could be viking related excited i was bored and found a new video for ac3 how convenient finish this with a one hour special ps cant wait for days gone dude when dat merch coming out who likes this game thumbs up doritos where you at remember when i used to watch the original series all the time

the day and loved it and even though ive seen thee game play before i love seeing it again reason why i subbed all the way back then give us a other for the day if you pause at the rightime you can see him back where he started the video at 1126 thats what the blink was what the fuuuuuuck actually it keeps doing that idk why since hes so good at walkthroughs he should do one on how he uploads them and with what in specific what up brad as you know im a huge fan as you can see i found your youtube channel when i saw you play spiderman last year great series by the way hope you continue to love gaming for years to come put out like a survey with a list of games and which ever one has the highest percentage of votes you replay or play the game for the first time did anyone clock the fact that he used an ac unity thumbnail for ac3 just finished watching sekiro and then this ill take it its not bayek its baiek as they say throughout the whole game i cant wait for the last of us part 2 im wandering when there will be a release date but my guess is this summer or end of the year i really do hope you finish this i was starting to worry when it the day and a half since the last video but here it is did i hear him open a soda can at 312 310 how about that soda your videos are booty finally brad i love you no homo btw yeahhh was waiting when brad lemar will start posting ac 3 remastered game keep on posting man glad that your doing the full series i forgot how good the story was before u watch this im hoping he starts killing when countering editalso 338 you should learn to counter kill you hit circle once then square it will insta kill if you have hidden blades do u plan t6o play any indie games whats good what are youtube fans you guys are the best of the best i love you guys so much thank you so much for subscribing to my youtube channel that means a lot or make one viking or anglo saxoned themed i think they should make a whole saga on ac hey nice vid i do the same thing on my youtube channel hi there you are so far away but it will have good life can you say my name on the next assassins creed 3 remasterd epesode me and ma dad live your channel we found it when u did spiderman still watching and enjoying your vids assassins creed one of my favourite video game in the world and i still play the game the game is awesome fun and cool i hope they make the new assassins creed video game with the real graphic because its 2019 so scribe to my youtube channel watch my new video in my own video right now like the video i want a vesion xbox 1 hurry up and take that shitty outfit off it doesnt suit conner happy this part came out you should do ac4 again awesome vid this is my favorite ac game brad are you planning to play world war z love you from egypt drop these series faster plz youre actually a savage if you read now your 2019 is full of good luck like to activate k this and ssssuuuuuuubbbbb to me and your bles hello i love your vids and the most or your videos is ww2 only 7 second and there is 7 views holy balls im early for once i do goods 3 hows there no first yet but why assassins creed 3 why not ezio trilogie but assassins creed to go wo be amazing 3 we must support this game on nintendo switch please because we need more games like this obviously the framerate playing on the tv wont be as good as it is on the tricequadruple as powerful machines but hey lets unplug the systems and check which has the better framerate afterwards can you make rayman origins and assassin s creed origins for nintendo switch where is assassin s creed oddyse for switch sorry for bad english as soon as this was announced every vita out there started throwing massive tantrums about how it is not fair that switch is not only having the ac it dreamed to offer the world why ac iii the hell with the framerate and audio people complaining about framerate and graphics when your phone is most likely faster than the switch this will not handle ac3 100 the bugs and lags are going to be unbearable im actually not going to buy this and just re play the original version the characters arent as shit well done ubisoft only you could make a remaster worse than the original so this explains why the remaster looks shit and sometimes worse than the original and you guys cant even optimize your ac games on pc fck off thats saw just like the original version i cant wait assassins creed on the go doesnt look as good as xbox or ps4 assassin creed on the go so this is why the remaster is so poor on pc and bigger consoles those frames though nice thanks to share 4003 is that arno dorian doing a full sequence in one video smart 4440 tho what is it like playing on the switch who thinks hathams combat skill is better than connor this video really shows how good a remaster this is can u kill civilians like in the first one great video the remaster looks better than the original game i got more of this game uploading now i honestly am having a ton of fun playing it so i appreciate all the likes and support youve been showing these videos hmmm nice outfits but my original one is the best for me what sequence do you start being connor anyone eles heard the music in 217 spill the tea why is this video private 218 its my time to shine lower your notoriety 1824 them legs though homina homina homina homina i like bayeks outfit a lot better than alexios wtf why is part 12 private super mario assassins odyssey where mario stealthy murders bowser and pets dogs you just gotta run up to the enemies and right vefore you stab them you just stop running bitch means female dog in britian play terraria ur such a good commentator pls keep it up you were so funny in this vid the fact that he wont counter attack gets on my nerves at 2033 i tought stephane said i will match your face to your bagguete hahaha cool this is the first vid ive watched in a few months and i absolutely loved it in the first minute kids asking for money brad im surrounded wheres the part 12 why dont u just counter kill the enemies my one and only favorite gamer this is the latest video that i heard brad laugh a lot and have shit loads of snickers i dont know why but i like brad being goofy lol its so funny xd ive been playing assassins creed rogue along side u playing this its cool seeing achilles as a younger assassin and stuff brad fix your vid i cant watch your part 12 its in private conor turned pale after wearing that outfit wtf its really grind my gears to see you parry instead of counter the attacks haha hey brad part 12 where it is wheres 12 aww why did you change costumes the pig feed is corn brad brad i need part 12 where part 12 tutorial to how to not fight in ac game hi radquick tip if you dont already know if you dont hold the parry button and you press it when the red triangle appears above the head of the enemy and then you press the kill button conor will do a realy awesome combat movealso great videos the thumbnail looks like a spartan giving him head 2252 connor got backhanded lol hey man you have to press square after counter for you to automaically kill them funny your just keep on throwing them the only sensible thing to do after you butchered a group of redcoats is to feed the neighborhood swines doritos you know i probably didnt know about kill counter too when i first played idk if i did it too or not when are you going to use the bow and arrow bribe the town criers to lower notoriety easier then being killed man his commentary is so good when hes having fun it shows go brad just bribe to get the notoriety down brad dont know why you still dont counter kill the enemies or do chain kills smh do you know what a parry takedown is lol feeds pigs ignores children you couldve loot their bodies tcb in this bitch lol that shit was funny you have to give some money those kidstill then they are sure to irritate you jacob fryes outfit is my favorite for connor so far sense u recorded a few hours and if u have the time it edit u should post a few of these videos today hmm please just use the og outfit the ezio is kinda wierd for this game dude just counter attack the enemies things i like about brad never hate animals in games always try to pet animals and give them doritos never gets so insane in any game like others who always say what the fuck i hate this game or go fuck yourself brad youre perfect the nonaggressive gamer and friendly gamer ever discovered brad could you try looting more bodies instead of throwing enemies in combat or parrying themjust counter attack and itll much be easier theres that thing called counter kill they need to remaster black sail omg look at setphanes face and pause it here omg 606 its like one of the only things that ive seen that are bugged in this remaster is this part with stephanes mouth or face i should say and why is the 13th vid private is it demonetized brad for dear god get rid of your level lol please put on edward kenways suit conor looks goofy as hell in that ezio outfit how convenient that if you press circle to counter and then press square it will kill them instantly quit pressing circle circle doritos thats whats for dinner brad to a pig tear down posters or pay the criers use otger weapons or the rope dart in fights to do aome nice combos each weapon has a combo guage on hiw many you can kill at once im to scared to play this game two years later so thats what you look like odyssey is better than this fuck im not going to buy it again because i have the original ac iii on steam brad for the low profile assasinations you have to use the hidden blade yaknow alexios outfit fits perfectly in this game because it adds alot of flavor into this game doritos thats what for dinner boys can you do the origins outfit tcb in this bish yo when u are in combat and someone attacks u just press o then square it will much easier for u u have zero experience in assassins creed i feel like this is brads relaxing time away from heart pounding sekiro lol use smoke bombs for stealth kills my dude it annoys me that you throw them after a counter rather than just kill them the music glitches in this game whenever you go to a viewpoint and synchronize i was hoping they wouldve patched it by now you can tell that even when connor enters combat the same music plays instead of switching to the combat music give us more assassins ceed 3 we need more hey brad you cool men brad your cool and all but your gaming skills are so slow and uncoordinated hey brad instead of throwing the enemiesyou could just kill em with one hit if you do a counter attack brad playing sequence 12 of 12 still trying to get a feel of the game dont have any future plans of finishing right now no other assassin looks good in altairs outfit except altair himself brad you can counter and kill by pressing o and then square the misleading thumbnail made me think brad was playing odyssey again why are you not using counter kill what its not cool to do it anymore 1310 killled me tcb in this bitch its late at night right now btw brad when are you gonna do the odyssey episode 3 since you mentioned it yo u are best stephane looks so weird in the cutscene in the tavern hey brad in battle why dont you counter kill its very awesome u kind of block defence and stuff pls try it man damn the gta3 nostalgia what a great game lol loot the bodies brad dont say it do it do it do it do it do it do it brad my favorite b horror movie is event horizon which is what dead space is based on actually dont know if youve seen it but worth a watch ummm sorry to ruin your day but the thumbnail looks like a guy givin another guy a bj just watch any horror movie on syfy the thumbnail makes it look like alexios is getting head from a roman soldier do a resident evil revelations 2 episode 4 its been 5 years plzz do a resident evil revelations 2 episode 4 its been 5 years plzz good bad horror movie watch this crazy train movie called drive thru it takes the freaking cake how can u play so fucking shit jumps from the top of a house to kill brad wasnt that low profile lmfao look at connors legs with alexioss outfit fastest way to lose your notoriety just flipping bribe those guys shouting at the street in the thumbnail it looks like the egypt guy getting head from the helmet loving this series brad would really like to watch the whole game keep it up brad pleaasssseeee stop throwing your enemies just kill them after youve blocked their attacks just press circle once then press square the radbradplease do call of duty 2 i like it much please i shall be very thankful to you please theradbrad are you gonna play borderlands remastered after block press lmb dont throw them i dont think the character even does a proper safety roll keep it up bro also add my psn alphastriketeamz have you ever thought about doing a stream one day just to see what youre fans will do and experience it keep em coming b rad tcb in this bitch i love the game play keep making more till you beat the game tcb in this bitch plz wear he original outfit new place sounds like brad has been doing well with the streams good for him youre pressing the circle button twice on your console while youre in fight so you throwin away the the bad guys when he attacked you press the circle once then press the square once when on combat counter then hit square for a quick kill i think in 1026 you assassinate first guy with right hand and the second guy with left hand u know if you just hit the attack button after countering u can insta kill normal guards tap r1 and x while in combat to perform special moves from the thumbnail it looked like someone was sucking his dick hey brad when u counter u can press x to assasinate brad what i did fr low refine was just go until up to them early and stab them lol hey a little suggestion to keep your notoriety low try to knock the enemies with barehand dude with one of the best quality videos but such a bad gameplay actually brad is just a noob why is he not countering and finishing enemies off i dont understandit only take to push counter button at right time and attack button right after he uses the counter key twice thereby throwing the enemy off every fucking time when the red coats are after you you can just take poster down to lower ur wanted level im pretty sure you can multi counter brad really wish theyd redo his voice acting the game is my fav ac game too but his voice is emotionless no matter what goes on in the story brad dude there is a trick to kill enemies quick u just click othe button to attack and then just move from enemie to other clicking the button to attack its super easy to kill them like thishope this helped u love ur vids i actually prefer connors suit can someone explain why this remaster looks like horseshit i dont get it after you counter them you can just press x to kill them off the first time brad played this game he said that if hes really tired his voice gets lower and now years later his voice is lower all the time if you press o then press square you kill them instead of throwing them thumbnail looks like the guy is getting head although that outfit looks good from odyssey it really take you out of the emergence of this particular game since it is not time specific at least when youre wearing the classic it does yet anyway this odyssey out it just really doesnt look right and like i said it breaks the immersion of this game what i find interesting is the guy doing the voice for desmonds father is john delancey most remember him as the infamous mischievous alien q from star trek tng i did told youwhen you counter you can press squre to instant kill him and can also chain kill by just direct your analogue with another enemy brad when you counter an enemy attack immediately press the square button to kill them instantly dont keep throwing them just take out the posters and give some bribes to get rid of the notoriety on usimpleu see the icons on the map that look like ur notoriety counter thing is where u do thateach action has a different effecta poster would take down a single lvl since its the easiest and costs nothingthe bribe takes 2 and going to where they print the posters cleanses the whole thingbut it costs morealsoopen cheststhey house from 500 all the way to 7000 worth of money in some cases where u gotta lockpick emdo some side missions off camera tto get some moneyits easy to get rich in this one since u had to spend on soooo much stuffalso look into crafting a bitu can house more gun slotsup to four i thinkand there is a gun that shoots twice before the reloadso thats 8 shots before u ever gotta reloadmakes the game alot more funlook into thatand keep up the good work why is that thumbnail looks like that guy sucking the other guy penis just keep posting more videos love yours gameplay and specially on ac series plz put on connor the shay cormac outfit what the hell why dont you just counterkill there is a bug in the game after you go to the waypoint the music wont stop and i heard it while you played too this guy really need to learn counter attack the thumbnail tho i thought someones giving alexios some head the game is harder on console lol dude if the kids just stand in your way you can give them money if you want brad you know you can bribe some dudes to reduce notoriety right is it just me d or does it bother everyone that he is worried about wanted level 2 but cant figure out that he can lose that level by going to that wanted level markers on his mini map he just passed by them i neeed to chilll love his videosss brad u need to look up how to fight in the game again cause idk what u are doing not even fight just playing the game too notice that connor is a redskin but when he puts on the alexios outfit he looks white connors outfit is best projects from school wont stop me well brad u the best game player i hav ever seen on youtube u r funny too this game is just awesome but i want a ps4 to play it and other games too i dont hav playstation or xbox to play and not even the cds but i love watching your videos tho dont stop making them i really love your work and sincerity thank u am i the only one who 1st saw the thumbnail and thought is alexios getting head the outfit looks so much better on connor the running animation looks wayyy better than it does on odyssey i love it animals in game exsists brad hey buddy tbh i liked costumes in ac3 more than remstered they looked nice and more of a assassins type clothes brad dont throw the enemies just counter it they will die instantly why dont use counter kill hey dont know me but did you ever played attack on titan 2 or you not in to that really enjoying the walktrough brad keep it up i never really tried any ac game but this one really has my attention i might give it a shot later on cheers and throw a chair or something jajaj kinda miss the chair jokes brad you are the most watched youtube gamer and still you play horrible when you press circle to block the enamies attack press square to counter attack them ezios hood looks sooo bad on conner or is it just me you should try house of wax you can lower notoriety by following the tutorial that you did with sam adams posters town cryers propaganda you know the whole reason why you were made to do that tutorial as for combat if you parrykill rather than parrythrow circlesquare again this was also part of a tutorial but obviously you didnt seem to listen lov it when radbrad plays it i want more of it wow keep playing this game brad its amazing absorbing and fun to watch brad you pushed wrong button in combat block and execute dont block and throw away d brad bro u played almost every ac game but rogue brad you do know that you can counter the enemies attacks heyy brad great series man i love it just a tip to defeat enemies quicker if they attack press circle and then square after that it triggers a deadly counterattack instead of throwing them to the ground the running skills on this game is better than all assassin creed games hey brad loot convoys to get money ac games dont need to be remasteredthey have best graphics like if u agree you seriously have to counter and press square easier way to get kills lmao but anything works i like watching ur vids please do the full series please pay the people shouting in the crowd to lose your wanted lvl man i really missed you feeding doritos to the animals more pig eat doritos next thing you see thet became an assasin the thumbnail was the one i came for we are always hungry for more brad i love your videos you helped me out on several games thank you so much your the greatest game youtuber ever 305 am watching dis 334 am i finish watching knowing that i have to get sleep for school knowing that i havent finished the essay knowing that i for a sure fact i will sleep in my classes why you never do the counter man you just throw that enemy and hit him brad i remember back when i first played iii i killed guys super fast with doing a counterkill circle then just square did they remove that or something hey brad dont tap the counter button twice press it once when the prompt appear and then attack youre throwing the enemies instead of counter attacking them when you perry just kill the guys the picture looks like someone is giving him a bj if you need money in game gggo to a shop buy a map of chests and just pick lock them you get easily rich you can counter killthe enemies why do you never counter kill them tcb in this bitch they need to remaster ac2 brotherhood and revelations ubisoft please yesss this series is so interesting keep it going brad omg ac3 was so hard i played it before or remastered so hard bro when you fight with someone instead of pressing counter two times press counter and attack any one notice that stephane chapheau has the same voice acter of arno dorian from unity dont forget you can instantly kill your opponent after countering by pressing square love the vids man bro those xx are your notoriety reducer thingies bradwhy dont u take off your poster from the wall to decrease your notoriety level brad see a pig here is the time for me to shine boi and then feed the pig youtubers posting one video in a month radbrad we dont do that here there bread crums the kids are homeless why dont u reduce notoriety i think you need to see tutorial how to be anonymous again you cant just run with two star like that lol but i like your video cant wait for another video ac3 remaster my favourite youtuber playing my favourite game cant get any better than this use the story outfit keep this series before they hit you kid circle square if this man passes another person that can lower his detection level i thought he was getting head in the thumbnail what about arnos outfit i mean its really cool brad you should press triangle then square you kill the enemys quick instead of throwing them ps gotta love the vids keep playing this game it brings so many memories back because this was my first game on the ps3 brad use counter kill its painful to watch you throw them around i wish they remaster ac 12 or black flag brad you do know you can bribe the town criers just bribe the people holding the posters and tear the posters of the walls to get rid of noteriety petition for brad to start using face cam another amazing one the combat style in ac3 and 4 is so good but they fucked it in syndicate and the newer ac games you should check out the movie dumplings brad can you stop throwing people and start taking them out on counter its much esaier brad keep playing this foreverrrrrr you should hit a different button when you parry its good to see him laugh yes please the full game the story is getting good the thumbnail had me siked this series has been amazing cant wait for more my brain he is giving blowjob in thumbnail doritos chicken am i a joke to you 1148 i got a little scratch on my nose acts like absolutely nothing just happened favorite part has to be the animal interactions im so glad they kept that next time a group of kids asks for money try not to run away them be way more hungry then them fat pigs u feed i got assassins creed 3 re and im already in sequence 5 and i love both of the versions not liberation why do you always just throw them when countering you can just instantly kill them when countering by pressing square alexios outfit in assassins creed 3 remasteredhow convenient like your videos everytime is this game free in ps store i love bradbut come on he is sooooooo dumb brad to kill the enemies quicker after you counter with circle press square instead of circle to throw pressing square causes a quicker kill and when you are running if you hold r1 and x at the same time you vault over the fence the fence has to be short not tall love this game lets do a full series play full game plz your thumbnail is looking a bit sus brad the old combat was so much better it is looking more like ac unity bro props for playing this in full keep pumpin out the vids on this hey

it againu r the best gamer available on youtube love u bro you can finish instantly while countering and pressing the attack button right after cant you counter attack every time they strike at you by pressing square immediately after circle in regards to the thumbnail my dumbass thought the dude was getting head from a guy in that helmet smh brad do remember the game remember me loving the series keep up the good work brad solid black suit looks really good too but i alexio suit looks better if you pay off the news guy you can go incognito that thumbnail tho i thought something else 1700 that

attack instead of throwing them have u seen assassin creed the movie your welcome your videos help me when i am stuck on a mission playing the games i play or perry then press x more lol all of every

block hits you can just kill them with square except the captains and big guys i mean when will u play part 12 im sorry for this comment but changing outfits ruins the process of the main outfit lol the thumbnail looks like the dude is getting head why every animals ate doritos you guys should watch the cinematic trailer for this game its total badass id rather see liberation gameplay hey brad

edwards outfit 1824 is the outfit showcase thanks for continuing this game i am enjoying this series and am sad when the video ends when u counter press square not circle dont keep throwing them loving this brad please keep em coming omg i forgot about the mother dying scene ugh it brought tears to my eyes the stories my grandmother use to tell me about how bad racism use to be back in the day my dad when he was 5 watched a cop kill my great grandfather in cold blood when i wanted to become a cop out of college he hated the thought and told me the story about what happened all i can say is we have come so far as a society and the media definitely tries so hard to put us against each other and why its so important to have games and communities like the stuff on youtube to bring is together i just bought it so i can play through it and get the achievements you dont lol love your stuff bro press circle and square when you fighting please this game is really good thumbnail looks like he is getting a blowjob from a soldier keep making ac3 videos and try making them one hour long def need to upload ac 4 black flag one of my fav acs the thumbnail of the video legit looked like the guy was getting head from another soldier lol hey brad friendly tip hold counter button then press square to kill note you have three options after holding counter button look at your buttons too left while fighting finish the seriesyou wont its a buggy game why dont you bribe try to parry it and finish with one button attack can you do a house tour your videos are very addicting to watch quick tip brad so when they are about to hit you and you block it dont hit x hit square it does like a kill instead of a push did anyone think he was getting head at first in the thumbnail stephane

great work i wonder if he noticed this comment another episode how convenient hey love the vids places play the whole game 12th comment first element in the periodic table is hydrogen can i get a heart from you plz keep it coming brad i love this series hello early peeps not first as one of the first viewers i want to say brad thanks for all that you do you are the coolest guy on youtube dont stop doing what youre doing wonder how many first we gonna see first first lol first anyone else think the combat here looks so damn smooth and is better than odysseys combat is it me or are the jgers taller than connor so connors skin was bleached he was pretty dark in the original game thats is veeery easy honestly shays outfit looks the best for conner out of all these legacy outfits yall keep crying about the new rpg stuff when in the old games all u had to do was spam the counter attack button and then attack and thats it u had a killat least now u have more diveristy and variety of weapons plus the gameplay finally is a bit more challengingi loved the old games and will always love them but ac origins and odyssey are beautyful in many ways i started rogue yesterday and been playing it ever since finishing ac3r and king washington dlc i hope you could make more king washington dlc and rogue gameplay king washington dlc has unique spirit animal powers that looks cool i already got a few tricks ive learn on my ownkill enemy then travel on top then death from above either by swords or using the bear or eagle kills rogues gameplay is a better version of ac3 and ac4 tbh so smooth and clean but i do believe ac3r has the most brutal kills doing killstreaks and finishing combo is so much easier and satisfyingonly need one kill then you can either continue the killstreak or do a weapon tool finishing move etc how do you get this outfit ubisofts assassins creed needs to go back to this and stop doing to rpg thing question time pirates of the caribbean and nice video btw man looks hilarious this only shows how much darker alexios is than connor very very very nice how do you do stealth kills with your tomahawk cause when i try its only hidden blade insert comment insulting oddysey ed try these metal gear solid 5 final fantasy 15 tekken 7 they are old but great which outfit do u like the most if i buy you mirrors edge catalyst will you make a walk through of it at some point in the near future answer endgame btw check the spelling of playlist first line of description i have assasins creed 3 but he not can play whit ps4 so i play whit ps3 i love you videos if there was a gamers hall of fame mredxx would definitely be in it good video my favorite movie is star wars return of the jedi what is your favorite movie ed kassandra is better and you how can connor become white in remastered version this game looks so awesome i cant wait to play it i wish this game had the bounty hunters from rogue i think my favorite movie is assassins creed the ac3 battle theme is similar to cws arrow theme or never cease to amaze us ed love your videos and all your assassin creed one to that outfit looks disappointing just like odyssey my favorite movie is tied between 300 and the dark knight rises 624 lol that guy shot his teammate so alexios travelled through time lost his powers picked up a new fighting style appeared on the other side of the planet and joined a creed of assassins it seems the jagers in this remastered is lesser than the original favourite movie hard to tell i dint watched a lot of movies id say the good the bad and the ugly one of the very few western movies i really enjoyed i like comic movies too why does he have a big head in alexios outfit mredxwx check out my two ac3 vids on my channel tell me what u think thanks i want to play ac unity multiplayer with u man i love your vids and i completed unity at almost 100 thanks to your vids considered that all redcoats are sided with templars you should make videos of you playing days gone wed really like that love the video mredxwx the gameplay is so smooth i cant really see it in this video but did ubisoft released a patch that took care of those plastic faces and bad character face animations nice vid btw the assassin master at it again question time heat yes im early that outfit is ugly who else clicked on the notification immediately but im bbg to vryon who k this and b to me rpy whn don of all the ass creed games to port why did they pick one of the worst in the series thats sandwiched right between the only two decent ones itll get better visually and performance wise but will it be 60 is this even legit if it was legit it would probably be uploaded by nintendo right frame rate is choppy as fuck what the fuck it looks considerably worse than it did on the x360 more like demastered it would be cool if they added connor to smash ultimate with different costumes good job porting the only objectively terrible assassins creed game remastered this looks awful lmao cant wait to go to the toilet while playing this gross the wiiu looked better this looks like a vita port wtf ubisoft and wtf nintendo for allowing this trash on the switch this looked a little rough and choppy considering it was last gen it should look better and play better on the switch i just want black flag and the 3 2d spin off games i cant wait to try this game out i got it when it came out but i just havent had the time yet to play it he looks so tired when he sprint lol is this game still free with season pass odyssey oh yeahthe best assassins creed player is rolling againno one can kiils himhes fast and skilled and i want to be like him you inspire me so much mredxwx i am going to make a similar channel i will be doing ac3 free roam on switch syndicate free roam on xbox and unity heists free roam and coop this channel entertains me everyday great gameplay brother wheres the blood i like how you copy pasted the des ription of ac3 and just put a remastered besides it now the whole description doesnt make any sense how you easily defeat jager im sick to defeat them always desynchronized mredxwx please teach me play origins lmao 024 stealth system is such a joke in this game yay finally ac3 again best youtuber on the world stupid ubisoft wont patch blood falling on the snow thenk you mredxxx is nightwolf mk11 the uwas a epic great bro please assassins creed 1 combat please i dont know nothin much im a little worried about being a slut very impressive the combat manoeuvres in aciii are the best great video as always ed and to answer your question ac odyssey actually surpassed my expectations and now i really enjoy it though more for the aesthetic over the gameplay keep it up brother you are the bast are you going to play the new call of duty why is it always evening in remastered as much as i love the redesign and lighting of the game kinda wish the music really didnt take over all the other sounds but other than that pretty good you spelled playlist wrong in the description it says plailist a game i didnt expect to enjoy but ended up liking is detroit become human or fortnite i still love that fighting theme we love the asasincreed 3 thebest the leap of faith is almost sickening with the remastered version of assassin creed i love that weapon nice one klick and nine likes welcome to youtube thanks for watching

legendary love from india please realistic first connor wants to get drinks for his father haytham first real first oh hell yeah love when you post my man 1 like 1 comment and 4th viewer notification gang first so connor is edward kenway grand son 240 connor you have done so little to help me wat about saving your skin wen u wer sent to the gallows i was you i connor always benjamin church was in died in 1718 this is very wrong he was a colonel and he was also a ranger haytham sounds a lot like jamie lannister doesnt he this is how many times he says how convenient in this whole play walkthrough i i v the rabbits walk around like their impaired cool connor looks like haytham funny thing is this is my first watch of the game and im glad youve been continuing the series so please keep up the good work brad i love u man but please know u can counter im suprise abraham lincoln is not in this game hey brad new movie in 2019 1453 whatta hell is wrong with his voice mercenary you are my son after all no im your dad son part 18 still doesnt counter kill lmfao wow connor wears upcoming kenway why are there a bunch of private videos episode 12 and everyone after this episode is private brad where is the next gameplay ive watched all of your videos now its time you listened to memy young fellow i dont like subtitled movies or anything of the sort if they cant speak the crowns language that is there problem ha william miles is voiced by q dude why are yu not uploading prt 18 do haytham boss fight with edwards robes its crazy seeing connor wearing his grandfathers outfit i dont know how someone cud die in this game fighting is like a god in ac 3 keep doing brad i love this 3 i love how brad just pushes people away except when he sees a dog then hes gotta pet the dog dogs how convenient the penultimate mission should be interesting the guns are not for show you know only ubisoft can remaster a game and make it worse than it wasutter piss taking an actually suitable outfit on connor praise be all of them have looked shit on him since his actual first one until thus ac4 outfit with stronger enemies counter and break defence easier to kill rad brad cant you even kill a few stupid mercenaries without losing half of your life i love watching your videos but i am begging along with everyone here to just counter and press the attack button to counter kill i am begging you again and again and again please you think maybe you could sqeez in two parts a day or am i being greedy lol during combat press circle once and then press square right after for instant kill imagine a ww2 ac game where you have to kill hitler as final boss i only came to see conore wearing his grandfathers outfit get the animals spirit one why is conner so mean to achilles how would happen if ubisoft make assassins creed tokyo use the smoke bombs with multiple opponents they already remastered 4 it came out on ps3 first and then they upgraded it to ps4 i would like to see more of the game with the grenadiers you tap x x then square to attack them plus counter attacking is simple you just tap circle once bro then hit x hey radbrad why do you keep on failing each time in your video failure isnt rad you should start learning how to be discreet how to unarmed your enemies as an assassin you should kill haytham while wearing edwards robe 2318 this game gives me that every time by that bug nobody ubisoft remasters aciii and degrades everything u may use smoke bombs when enemies circle u its efficient just try it you can use harbormaster as fast travel hey brad unlock the combo moves ti would be much easier fighting theres a such thing as double executions i want 10 subscribers only fam explore the place already and put the power source its important well played 2221 this happened in the game when you dont know how to actually fight in the game dont get me wrong you are suppose to perry those attacks then attack what are you doing and then you call yourself king of walkthrough on youtube the video clealry tells me that you are recording more than one game very soon just focus you will enjoy the game too man what the hell are you doing love you his name is ratonhaketon not connor just saying huhha i hope in the final mission he were the default suit just because brad i started the dlc of this never played dlc before dont know about you my brother like your videos keep up its remastered you bastard p lul connor wear his grandfather outfit brad just hit counter button and immediately hit the attack button lol wtf was that movement at 112 if this was like being in a history class then i wouldnt have failed history my friend youre playing ac3 remastered do you think you good at stealth video games me sure im the stealthiest man on the planet my friend tell me some earlier games you have played me doom wolfenstein just cause do not parry when youre fighting instead when someone attacks you press circle and then square to instantly kill him hey radbrad why sound like baronvongamez connor is actually wearing his grandfathers outfit please upload faster bro and they cal this remastered with snow popping in and out and they have the balls to charge 4099 for this game assassins creed iv black flag will always be in our hearts and will last longer than the judgement day even gods will never forget it although im a fan of the viking era i feel like its going to be another warrior type game like odyssey rather than assassins it could end up being good if there is vast forests like in ac3 or tightly packed towns with good free running if we get unitys parkour or something similar i miss the real assassins creed i actually wouldnt mind seeing a assassins creed set during the viking era but at the same time i also like to see a assassins creed game set during feudal japan you surely dont know how to play can you improve your skill by just not only attack u are awesome oh wait rebecca is looking even more sexy can you play son please game nearing end brad doesnt parry i can beat 100 people at the same time in this game and he is having hard time beating 4 guys read the fcking comments everybody explained to you the combat system hey man did you know that there are cups that are gold that can give you some new missions and a plus outfit when you complete the full cup side missions my friend theradbrad you can change outfit in the homestead try to use rope dart when you in figth it will help you alot i always used it when there is to much enemies ran of the school u should play ac3 liberation finally another video how convenient assassins creed 4 is remastered already you van get it on xbox one its even came in a bundle haytham meets his son wearing his fathers outfit the missions where you team up with haytham were definitely my favorites of this game though when i first played i was always under the impression that haytham didnt know he had a son so i was surprised when he instantly knew who connor was ac 4 is already available on ps4 why dont you use the bow im playing ac 3 remastered on ps4 as well but for some reason i cant sprint connor wont sprint but instead hes jogging someone explainhelp me please upload the next part as soon as possible anyone wanna let him know that he can just press o one ever when the red triangles appear then press square and he will immediately kill them i doubt hell read this though mysteries of mankind 3 what happened to malaysia airlines flight 2 is there a god 1 why brad doesnt press square to kill after a counter can someone tell this man that he can attack after he counters an attack bro i been watching you since dead space 1 you know that in the end you have to plug the power sources in right brad i doubt he even knows that keep those videos coming really enjoy watching them why dont you ever just counter the attack instead of just like blocking it it will save you more time from getting hit and you could do two counters when two of the attackers turn red oh my god dude you died that it im done watching your channel for a while you fucken killin me jesus christ bread at the end of the game have you ever heard of the block button or dodge in get sliced up like that pull your head out your a i think you should stop riding the horses man start running through the trees because i feel like your missing out on so much the game has to offer anyone else here misses the old days where brad played scaryhorror games he is at his best and funniest when he plays scary games love the new outfit they already kinda remastered 4 didnt they by releasing it for ps4 still giving copies away my fav is ezio trioo where is the dead space 2 you shouldve done dead space first than 2 than 3 so do the first one than do 2 better that way bro haytham be like you wearing my fathers clothes you need to start using other wepons like swords and different axes can you wear the animal spirit outfit no think we will see acbf remaster anytime soon since it already released on ps4 but might expect to have a remaster for ps5 save up get the map of all the tresure go around get the tresure bam allways have mony bruh press circle to counter you should try using the rope dart especially for chases in a fight when ur getting attacked with that 3 attack thing instead just counter and press square to counter kill the guy and make the

homestead and aqullia missions do more batman arkham knight you havent played assassins creed rogue its just like 4 but provides a lot of backstory keep up the good brad so youre telling me that edwards outfit reminds you of black flag what a strange coincidence naval combat has to be my favorite thing about assassins creed thanks for using the assassins creed 4 outfit brad brad please play days gone when released you need to learn how to counter hoping they remaster the ac2 series ezios storyline was where i truly fell in love with the ac franchise ac 4 black flag is on ps4 you can also play ac rogue which is both a prequel for ac 3 and ac unity for the love of god please just counter then press square you make this game look so hard its frustrating to watch love the vids tho just not this ac series brad press bx to counter and strike rather than ba to parry its much easier to kill enemies love your vids keep it up we gotta teach you how to counter kill no cap love the videos though hey bro remember how you said you were scared to run into people in red dead dont worry were all with you i just died to a whole town turning on me i remembered playing these fatherson missions years back i lost my shit when i played them ps im still losing my shit when your legs dont work like they used to before 17 parts in and he still cant counter unbelievable brad you know you can attack right after a block instead of perying every single move its easier press circle to counter and press square to finish them dont hold circle all the time love ur vids no offence but i dont like connor or ac3 can you try and use some of the other weapons upload the next part by tonight brad use the rope dark during combat pretty sure its unlimited use and gives you some good range for fighting i have a ps4 and it is awesome plug in the god damn power source they already remastered assassins creed 4 black flag plz play it next all you have to do is press the counter button once and then press the attack button your lucky manwish i had this many supporters lol maybe one day ill be able to grow my channel to a reasonable size but its really a struggle now a days on youtube he has the bow and arrow the rope dart the poison dart the gun he doesnt use any of it in combat i like watching his gameplay but i hate how he doesnt use his full arsenal theyre there for a reason im doing this play through on my channel as well its my first assassins creed game and im having an awesome time playing it makes me wonder why ive been missing out all of these years hey rad for a combat tip try to block and immediately attack them instead of trying to parry pulling them what a shitty remastered that ubisoft made look all these gliches i reckon i should play through assassins creed iii again i just finished the first and second games so i guess ill have to play through brotherhood and revelations first feels good to be this early please do the animal spirit outfit next its not a radbrad video until i hear so guys or alright guys why would they semester ac 4 its already more of a remastered ac they wont remaster ac4 because its already on ps4 and xbox one 2219 you know what i

little bit from gameriot goddamn it brad make these videos long after a long day of work i just want to enjoy some of your gameplay in my bed for gods sake xd just counter kill them omgeodnsnsiamdbsyqj when you counter theyre attacks press square please spam grandpa edward must be so proud of his grandson brad dont hold the parry button when combat press circle to deflect then square its easier assassins creed 4 black flag is out on xbox edward kenway poor guy its sad on what happened to him big fan spider man here bro how convenient edward kenway is so badass please replay black flag its already remastered it was the first assassins creed that came out around the same time the next gen consoles came out i dont like the way he fights you need better weapons heavy weapons are good but it takes time to use them effectively a sword or better tomahawk are useful in situations with multiple enemies hope to see more dying light videos rad in combat to make it easier when you counter press square and you can do an instant kill on some enemies brad when they attack you press b and then x its and install kill its weird for haytham to call connor son since he is literally wearing haythams father and connors grandfathers outfit theradbrad just press circle and squareit works with most enemies hold circle when they attack and you will be able to damage immediately back you will go into slow motion and you can do multiple different things like attack back throw or disarm the enemy how about you start uploading 4k when u counter u press the counter button then the attack button right after u counter haytham attacks connor for wearing edwards clothes brad youre awsome keep doing this i dont think they will remaster assassins creed 4 beacuse its already on ps4 he

channle love the series keep it up best ac game in my opinion firsttt whoever sees this just please remember you are awesome you are great always smile look on the brighter side of things have a great year my goal is to reach 10k this year stay awesome wish me luck i dont know why they havent remastered the original assassinss creed game yet 1148 their gameplay well sorta i want ezio back this footage was looks the same but honestly this game still holds up to this day and its basically just a port to newer consoles this generation of games only consists of remaster absolutely ridiculous all these chumps complaining about the graphics on a game thatll be on sale for 15 before you know it yet they probably spend 15 hours a day playing repetitive ps2 quality battle royal games i think maybe ubisoft chose ac3 because of its introduction to naval gameplay i could be wrong or it could be one of many reasons what do you guys think is it 1080p 60fps jesus christ the graphics are so bad luckily they got through the tutorial ac3 with sweetfx can anybody else not find the game on the psn store i have ac odyssey gold edition and have not yet found the ac 3 download from brazil i just want the free dlc packs i couldnt get on the 360 106 a reference to the order of ancients from ac odyssey and ac origins nothing pretty much change the faces are very scary this remaster doesnt even look any different from 2012 tho its still the same graphics but with poor lighting on the faces oof why i cant buy the game on pc hahahawitcher 3 hd version with reshade presets does a better job than this crap the intro was the best thing about the game i think i better play original game it came out today right so how do i download it or am i just trippin again remaster sigh when does it come out i purchased the odyssey season pass to get this but i dont see it in the store looks the same to me sure the lighting shaders and textures have improved but the character models still look the same i mean look at that ape man you call him desmond literally reselling the same game with barely any graphics improvement higher price the original is the same with cheaper price so thats a no from me i remember when everyone thought the world was going to end that day on december 21st am i the only one who thinks that the remaster looks worse than the original because when i look at the opening scene and compare it with the original i cant help but think the moment was more intense on the ps3 because despite the lack in quality it was still far superior to what ubisoft has done to it now im starting to really doubt ubisofts ability to handle remasters and just thinking they should stick to just making new games and stop waisting their time trying to milk every penny they can from their previous games i cant tell if this is remastered or not its been a long time desmond heydid they changed the walking animation it has been 7 years already i got the oddyssey season pass its about 2 hours after release so how in the hell do i get ac3 remastered ac3 is my favorite ac game waiting for the switch version of the game hopefully they didnt botch it the voices show moreinterest idk if that is the right word 1610 is he apologising for edwards death thanks for this i just wish they could used more of their time to make something like resident evil 2 remake but its ubisoft anyways so what to expect i literally had goosebumps when i heard altair and ezios name in the intro man i miss the old ac 18 minutes of assassins creed 3 game play playing 15 minutes of game play tutorial ac3 my favorite game in ac series 720 look like johnnydep from fantastic beast hope they remastered the first one only took them 7 years why does it look like they got no facial expressions edited nvm its looked like it in the first start of the gameplay what happened to their eyebrows those textures on the characters faces are atrocious is it just me or there is something wrong with the characters faces a bit overpriced at 3999 eh stealth games are my thing but this franchise is the only game that ive been trying to get into but still i dont find it interesting tho im a bit surprised they havent remastered the first game why ac3 how do you get it with season pass is lucy stillman my fav ac cant wait mines still being shipped will come tmrw im so glad its a proper remaster still havent fixed the light coming off on that first slide i remember being so pissed because i was playing as haytham and not connor i really wanted to just get straight through the whole haytham part just to get to connor and when i did i was so happy lol still say that the 2011 version looks better i forgot desmond and uncharteds nathan drake are voiced by nolan north lol let me see the greatland and connor whens this being released i miss the multiplayer i remember xmas visiting parents eating taking a few shots tequila and i wanted to go home cause i had gotten assassins creed 1 with altair and wanted to play i will never get over what they did to desmonds face like yeeeeeesh love this game though and so excited to play it again the year and title ac died and tge year after when the franchise went downhill cause black flag was the last really amazing title anyone notice the 12 21 12 ended becoming the symbols for assassins creed games the eye for origins omega for odyssey lastly looks like japan why arent the charackter models better they look the same like the original and even with less color in the faces any chance of multiplayer returning man i miss when ac had a proper modern day story back when assassins creed was almost a religion this was my favorite assassins creed and now is back better than ever cool first 18 minutes of gameplay being 15 mins of cutscenes now i just want a assassins creed 1 remastered with this look in 4k now that be awesome i do not understand the point of remastering the games waste of potential haythem said his father took him there as a child and edward is his dad and took him at the end of black flag i think thats so cool people like to eat this if theres no multiplayeri aint buying the facial graphics still look like the original one so what did this remaster do remastered why assassins creed tutorials should not be a thing people have played these games before and if they havent then they can freaking figure out the controls im tired of the hand holding tutorials that treat you like you just learned how to read killing desmond was the biggest mistake childhood desmond creed has changed plz come back to be honest this remaster looks pathetic even if we not compare to re2 really facial animation are very bad the texture on the characters looks so off and downgraded the texture in the previous version is much better than this superb remasterneed to own it pc gamers be likeive already plays ac3 remastered i was hoping seeing conor in free roam haytham was better than connor change my mind back when ubisofts storytelling were at its best addingshadersandunlockingtheresolutionto4kdoesntmakeitaremaster the most important did they remastered the main character conner aka ratota ratata ratatouille cause if not i will not be able to force myself trough this game again wheres switch gameplay the dumbest assassins of all series yeah imma need this after putting in 30 hours to odyssey and realizing how awful it is they couldnt even make it 60fpsgdamn ubisoft oh look assassins creed 3 re released i was shocked when steam automatically give me a refund we want to know when this remastered come out hell yeah my favorite ac game is remastered already completed this game 1141 wtf this mans hairs if a british guy doesnt quote through the looking glass in the first five minutes how can i tell its supposed to be dramatic or not is there a multiplayer oh yeah 2012 end of the world was a thing extremely ridiculous to look at those years news and reports now lol weird how the graphics improved desmond slowly started to look like xpac in revelations to colin moriarty in ac3 jeeee it looks sooo mad well i think it looks bad not sure about you guys not really noticing much of a change they should have done acdesmond legacy who else thought that the world was really going to end on that date just remaster prince of persia how many fools can i kill today too many to count dont get in my way i hope they added the desmond missions after completing the game wether its a remake or remaster we all want ac1 am i right people 1622 after more then years i still feel da door that kid i kinda see s difference 710 but that my opinion and we can all have one i got hit by a car in the 6th grade pretending i was ezio from assassins creed revelations got a 3 day weekend out of it so id say it was worth it wow only ign can do it 18 min of gameplay does that even makes sense do 15 min or 20 min why 18 min oh man so many feelings about this i miss u so much des a remastered game literally nobody asked for dangit they didnt fix desmonds face what a weird choice for a remaster would have definitely preferred ac 2 or black flag ive got no interest in going back to this game what about the faces the graphics have become terrible i feel like this was how i remembered it character models still look horrible im so ready connor is my favorite assassins creed character uwu we come from the same tribe arent they coming out with a remastered bundle of all the ac games this was my least favorite ac game why not remake 2 or brotherhood or both together id even take the first game remastered over iii aciii was where i stopped playing ac games other than black flag it doesnt look like i missed much this was one of the first 3rd person actionstory game i played as a kid i remember i loved it got really invested in the characters so they remasters the game without updating the graphics oh how i missed desmond in an assassins creed game i played every assassin creed but this one an i like this era im excited i still have this game on my laptop and it hasnt finished yet assasino assasino in my worse italian accent does it drop at midnight tonight for ppl who have the season pass question can we finally skip the intro this time or maybe the credits best ac in the seriesperiod sad that multiplayer wasnt added and those days you try to walk like ezio 1659 waaw he almost caught him so close looks better then the trailer they released i miss the modern day storylines of the older ac games i actually liked desmonds story the modern day stories on the newer ac games are just forgettable wtf haytham looks like fkin playdoh i never realised that when he said he saw the same play as a child was in reference to the end of black flag did anyone else find the opening depressing and disturbing back in 2011 its look like a max setting in pc who can name the science fiction show the man narrating the beginning of this gameplay video was in as a big character that was in 3 different versions of the same sifi universe 1624 those are some nightmareish eyes this game made me play all othey parts of assassins creed desmond looking uglier than the first game wtf 7 ads came while i tried to watch this youtube is a joke man ign loves ads lol ac3 is where the series started going downhill issue with remasters is halo 2 anniversary set a bar that barely anyone reaches when it comes to graphic updates the beginning of the downfall then blackflag brought it back a little then everything after that desmond 3 years to have you killed off and waste juno with her ended up being defeated in the comics smh what a waste i remember being so hyped to get this game as a kid man does time fly subscribe to whydotas it really does not look any better 228 the three logos what if the first represents origine the second odyssey the third an upcoming japanese ac game i enjoyed that obstacle course when ac games used to put emphasis on parkour 228 japan next what can i say to get top comment again is this downloadable today i never got to play this last gen im excited to pick it up this time around this was my first and favorite ac game until i got origins bruh i can use sweetfx and make orginal ac3 looks simular to this still gonna try it out tho i would play it with bad graphics as long as the loading screens arent as prevalent y not ac 2 its amazing how they threw away an iconic character desmond miles but maybe there are still more secrets hidden in assassins creed universe that us veteran assassins still have to learn im currently on assassin creed odyssey my journey has brought me 2 the battle between athens and sparta im still unlocking and learning new abilities for each ability is a gift and a treasure knowledge is power to a stop the templar order apparently is going by the cult of kosmos this go around out there will be more answers in the future but does they added shay to the story and btw they shouldve remastered assassins creed 1 this game was wack i dont like it the remastering has just pushed all the characters over the edge and into the uncanny valley i want a new prince of persia this year in this remastered version they should allow you to choose the moses path this is what assassins creed is hoods hidden blades parkour cool combat none of that odyssey trash ubisoft messed up desmond with this one i will never forget nearly cost his life how ironic im liking this kenway guy looking forward to playing the whole game with him bring the online back ubisoft should sell prince of persia franchise rights to some studio oh look a ruined franchise classic ubisoft no 60 fps many people hate this game and connor to me personally this game and connor is great i like the story also connors character is really interesting hes not a soft person when hes angry youre dead the man is a one man army all of his finisher were brutal af this kinda remaster is a step in the right direction wtf graphics looks same as ps3 are you kidding ubisoft i guess it looks the same anyone else hasnt even played original nope i really enjoyed ac3 the only thing i didnt like was how long the prologue was but it was a fun game i remember playing this on ps3 i was enjoying haytham all the way up to when you find out what he truly is then i couldnt wait to kill him edit wow thats alot of likes xd remastered version are only official graphic mods haythem has done plastic surgery wow if only they did the same thing with far cry 3 classic edition bruh camera angle at 1627 looks really old like 2008 or something why isnt it on the store yet i do love that intro narration by john de lancie remaster black flag please best ac game for me it dissapoint me nothing change actually desmond is over rated hah weirdpeople these days complain about everything i plyed dis game on intel celeron with intel hd graphics 2gb ram i like this ps3 gameplay but when do we get into the remaster oh this guy sounds like nathan drake is it 60fps on base ps4 or not whats the chronological order of the ac games something ive never played properly but want to get in to what if they remaster all ac games and put them in one bundle are we still waiting for assasin creed in feudal japan dammit ubisoft if its not broken dont fix it i mean looks the same with just a bit more contrast and saturation i does not look remastered isnt a remaster suppose to update an older games grahic machanics etc 555 assassins creed assassins creed 2 assassins creed brotherhood assassins creed revelations and they choose to remastered assassins creed 3 i think that iam gonna go to to gamestop and buy this and come home and play this for almost an month after my exams and did did you notice that i added two to and two did you didnt almost why dont they just remake james bond nightfire i hate when ubisoft games have that low quality sounds ubisoft lazy cash grab why is every company now just trying sell you a old game at 60 mass effect andromeda 2 so far the visuals look a little bit disappointing nonetheless im looking forward to being able to play assassins creed 3 again assassins creed remake next 30fps great gemplay on nitendo switch please sick of the new mechanics cant wait for this is multiplayer in this assassins creed is boring omg did you see that kids face this looks exactly the same gkt the season pass on ps4 cant findit anywhere the best assassins creed is back hahah the creepy kid looks weird d so remastered means more vibrant colors i cant understand why they remastered 3 and not ac first i would love to play that with updated gameplay and graphics ezio altair and desmond is all i cared about as a kid the worst of the series hmmm im guessing ubisoft really needs some money they may also be interested in possibly making an assassins creed game like these instead of just another rpg like odyssey 116 lol is it just me or this guy looks nothing like ezio xd sure that this is a remastered it looks like the same ps4 pro is 4k no one ask for this no oneeee but why tho remaster the ezio trilogy literally nobody asked for this but ok who else didnt even know they remastered ac3 until they saw this vid i didnt know they were gonna make a remastered of assassins creed 3 lol my favourite assassins creed the faces look hideous still my memory returns awe desmond assassins creed hasnt been the same without you im upset that the ezio trilogy remasters look half assed compared to this remaster yes assassins creed is going back its roots it looks upgraded and downgraded lol this is exactly what people wanted not ac 2 remastered no this right will there be mp first i dont understand why is my update isnt 103 its still 100 i realized that the update was appeared but it doesnt shown 103 is there a way i can fix this problem fuck this game lol ill just pirate original game ubisoft should fire everyone who worked on the remaster do not buy it no blood in the snow the original looks way better i shit u not no blood in snow is this game even getting updated on xbox i havent seen any on it yet can someone help me for some reason i cant update assassins creed 3 remastered any gltiches that anyone encountered im creating a petition as a way to pressure ubisoft to fix the bugs in assassins creed iii remastered httpchngitgr8n4fgqkc do you want to sign wow they improved the lightning i will only play this game if i got it in playstation plus too latefinished it alreadyplayingrogue remastered now for some reason im not receiving the update his mustache disappeared i remember him with a beard in revelations ending they improve the remaster so the made it like the original right bitch its too bright is the picture too bright like im in a fog in the whole game in the dark like youre a cat when i set the light for this game on samsung tvu i can not play any other game because then those are black nothing too see i do not understand the goal of that light how do you sprint in this game on ps4 well the first release felt like some kind of sick joke and even after the update its still a really shitty remaster the faces looked more detailedalive in the original ive seen hires patches for other games way better than this made by one or two modders in their spare time shouldnt ubisoft be able to top modders as they have access to all original resources and so on no just slap a filter on the textures and call it a day the lighting is way improved but thats about it fuck them still the original looks better than the remaster it is oike they screwed up the materials for each 3d model making the faces look lifeless 033 white stuff huh they ruined desmonds face in ac 3 so dey added warm tone before update snyder cut after update joss whedon cut lol still shittier than the original ubisoft should just make a new rayman game that should be on switch just a excuse so he could be in smash still looks like complete crap just like with the ezio collection somehow the originals have the better cutscenes than their remastered counterparts trying to play this in between dlc episodes of odyssey was an exercise in frustration and futility blech let sleeping dogs lay never liked desmond face of assassin creed 3 i prefer older face they should update your appreciated game this whole remaster thing was still such a fucking waste imo maybe the ezio trilogy deserved to be remastered or even remade with some mechanics from the last few games but i honestly didnt touch ac3 after i first completed it i was surprised to see a big update for the game it could still use a major improvement so they just switched it back with original textures clap that looks so much better ubisoft remasters are trash if you want a good remasted game look at gears of war ulitimate edition are you fucking serious i already beat the game like 80 times then they drop this shit i completed ac 3 remastered in 1 and a half days 240519 until 250519 i dont know how they dare call this a remaster if all they did was touch up the graphics how about a real improvement like updating the combat system or getting rid of those fking god awful qtes that make that make certain elements of the game nigh unplayable so they just move the light sliding adjustment up a little bit fuck ubisoft they can take the time to update assassins creed 3 remastered so it looks better but cant fix the view point glitch in assassins creed 4 could use an update for ezio trilogy too too bad this company doesnt understand what a remaster is all games should learn from modern warfares remaster awesome ive only done everything in the game you can possibly do but thanks for the update two months later ubisoft basically everyone looked like clay models before the update and now they look like clay models with better lighting great i always skip cut scenes in every game is the remastered just being messed upon couldnt they take their time and do it better can we all agree that ubisoft is not good at making remastered games did they fix the snow problem ac 2 trilogy good desmond ac3 adam sandler why are you blurring the thumbnail its not like we are watching asian porn lol that blurred image used as clickbait assassins creed 3 is the best in the entire franchise great story to it and an awesome storyline between haytham and connor they did it good connor is the best assassin ubisoft is the best for making that game ya of course after i beat the game come on ubisoft your better then this it should have been done in the first place ugh now i have no excuse to play it again because i completed 100 a few weeks ago yo bro have u seen the last exotic weapon in the division 2 its called eagle bearer lol it seems kasandra making stand in ubisoft games hahahahahah i have a voice prob when connar is riding horses people in the streets an just little sounds i can just barely hear faint sounds on ps4 anybody didnt the original have more weapons to use like heavy ax other hatchets staffs swords and i think spears also the original had a lot more outfits too like you can choose the hood then body then pants like theyre individual pieces you buy white stuff on his face or somethingwhat are you trying to say jor ubisoft cant do shit right let me tell u something dudeu insult ac franchise by making a video with that voice when this game game clit the graphics were relatively good anyway if anything they should have completely redesigned it and made the graphics like odyssey i mean the graphics in rogue is beautiful its lighting not lightning having lightning on your face usually results in death look how they killed my boii good grief what happened to haytham at 225 the original is ten times better shouldve been this way with the original release ubisoft put zero effort into the characters and that is really disappointing since people paid money for this and someone signed off on this mess at least they attempted to save it odyssey new update gave the heros sword to those who did not burn the farm and its in the visual customization thats great that they are showing it some attention but i wouldnt give this game a replay i didnt like it that much on my first playthrough when it was current is that the switch version so when i first got the game i turned off the subtitles in the option menu and still had to turn them off again in the pause menu did they fix that so just once is enough tbh i havent played the remastered version of this game only the original so i really cant notice the difference until i get it as someone who actually never played the original and just watched a play through it is still really disappointing to see this comparison as ive never realized it till now stop saying assassins creed so quickly annoying if not for this video i would have completely forgot that i got this game free glad i forgot though sounds like they did a halfass job on upgrading the graphics since no new games looked good so ive been in limbo ill download this sounds fun did this come with all of the expansions glad i waited to replay this did they fix the 100 assassin glitch cant clear the game due to this ubisofts fix was to play the entire game again 015 ah shit here we go again hey jor is ac3 included in odysseys season pass nothing can improve desmond god i feel sick just remembering that he existed ubisoft recently released a new update for assassins creed 3 remustard i kinda wish it was called that now haha makes me wish they never ported ac4 eh these changes seem very insignificant tbh they are only graphics if i got the season pass should i also have the ac3 remastered yay they fixed some lighting problems sarcasm still a ton of problems with mechanics why the original one looks better love this game but man ubi made a really horrible job at brazil part nothing looks like my beloved country and some voices used wasnt portuguese from brazil but portugal so embarrassing haytham still looks shit got the platinum trophies many days ago and i dont care about it any more iii is the worst one in my taste shame this update came out after i finished the game really want to play this but my storage is almost full every time i open the game its always raining something is really wrong with the business that they couldnt even release a remaster properly jor this was such a bad clickbait im disappointed in you upgrading lighting in cutscenes is not greatly improved graphics everyone hoped they actually upgraded the ingame graphics youre getting greedy its a shame thanks for the information jor i have ac3 because i own ac odyssey season passshould i played this game or passcomment below is the xp glitch still in ac odyssey big fan of yours from pakistan thanks for covering this i had no idea that such an update was released now i might be tempted to playthrough the remaster for the second time desmond looks so bad even in the original lol nice but too little too late most of us finished it when it came out it should not have released in that state with the lighting it was a pure cash grab there is no reason why they couldnt delay this a month to fix the lighting other than them wanting money quickly blood on snow not show no bubbles details on water lighter was sick same dont know why but they changed desmond face so much in this one that i felt it wasnt the same character and i never finished it its crazy that the remastered version isnt even remastered its the same frame rate and everything else right its just a rerelease 100 hahahah still the original looks better lol the character models looks so waxy desmond looks dead in assassins creed 3 meanwhile we have rockstar downgrading rdr2 graphics for the shity online so they fixed some lightings and no other notices such as audio bug fixes too bad i finished the game a month ago white stuff on his face lol nice ubisoft normally you increase the graphics from a remastered version by release not when i completed the whole game hathan looks like shit now lol the original clearly is better i so wanna get this but you cant convince me to buy a remaster where ppl are legitimately questioning whether the remaster looks worse than the original which was out like 10 years ago or something ball is in your court ubisoft too bad i 100ed the game already are any of the facial animations improved some of them definitely lost some nuance during the remaster and it kinda sucks to see those performances just become almost emotionless 224 im sorry my face is tired hey jor do you think they will release assassins creed 1 remasterd in the year when they are not releasing a new assassins creed game is this update also for xbox has the dead eyes look been fixed that issue was bothering a lot of people i hope they fix the problem ive been having almost every misson has no music even tho i know that there should be some playing as i have beat the game 4 times before this remaster is it worth it to buy the game now i got a deal for 30 bucks glad i havent started playing it yet since its the last of the real assassins creed games i have left to play and theyre probably not going to make any more im taking my sweet ass time before starting it rip assassins creed long live loud clunky warriors creed cant wait for vikings its shocking how the original looked better at alldidnt they say they rebuilt parts of the game while updating the graphics i still want to see assassins creed set in the civil war with the main character being a kenway tea bag glitch does not work any more it has been patched you now just auto recruit them when trying to tea bag it sounds like he says lightning when he says lighting lol 223225 the original was better before update i already finished all the game i dont wanna replay it x couldnt they have done this bofore they still need to fixed box text getting stuck on screen snow glitching freezing in cutscene especially in the dlc and performance issues love from india jor i always watch ur videos as soon as the notification hits great fan first not first dont care

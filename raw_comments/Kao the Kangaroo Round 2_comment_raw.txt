since today i thought it had been a fever dream because i remember really vague snippets of it all i knew was that the game involved me playing as an anthropomorphic animal and there was some kind of chase level i cant believe i finally found the game after so much time so its like a rayman clone right boy thank you for going through the game and not having a voice as i am an aspiring translator from english to russian and thank you for the nostalgia thanks for the awesome videoalready subscribed however could you tell me if i can replay any mission after completing the game this game is on steam now ddddd i want kao remastered in 4k whit unreal engine graphics this game is a masterpiece my friend and i can not for the love of god pass this part at 15610 we just dont get it can someone help 1018 great now you know how to throw nuts i have 3040 fps in this game xd i remember i win this game in a cereal box when i was young i was so scared when that fucking beaver came out the last boss took me 42 tries i totally hate this game but you know this is poland game yes i love this game and im so happy that its finally out on steam now but listening to the english voice acting was painful wow english dubbing is sucked original polish is better in my channel there is a video where you can download this game its free this is like australian rayman news theres free game on steam kao the kangaroo round 2 high resoultion support oh hey i love rayman and daxter go download it on steam for free only this day my heart get stop when that old man with hammer comes i remember playing this at a cyber caf when i was a kid they uninstalled it and i played sonic cd instead it looks like a good game a compination of rayman and jak and daxter my first ps2 game damn bro this is the game that got me into gaming thanks for the video my only problem rn is that it doesnt support win10 do you know any way i could use it how did you start the game i was scared so much by the spiders this one was a great game this is a game ive played when i was younger and i absolutely adored it way before ever playing mario sonic crash and spyro hello friend can you tell me how to download this game ive seen it after a very long time hello everyone for those who have windows 7 or 8 or 10 can finally play this game from here httpsmeganz29hnjtsda7siiosbkwyd9sdsh8asfpkw3uotgkd4wnodt2rc dont thank me thank lenonbaby d sorry to bother you but how can i buy kao on pc game is because ps 3 oh god the pc voiceovers sound like a really shitty fandub compared to the console port how did you get it running on your pc i was unable to do so on w7 and w10 alike my childhood game always loved to play it now i cant because it doesnt work on windows 10 please reply this game how can run windows 8 please help i bought but i cant play my childhood love this game i love this game that game do part of my childhood i also have this on play cedarverry good i dont know if you are skipping the very first dialog but if not that im very sad about tate interactive because they cut the best parts of dialogs in english version i used to love that game as a kid thanks for sending it awe this game is a part of my childhood i just love it i absolutely love this game i remember playing a very long time ago and im glad to see it again after all this time childhood game i tought it was so forgotten so there will be no digital version ever it is unfortunate because even the childrens video games can be purchased digitally for download i could imagine that minimum age ratings for digital games are pegi 12 and esrb teen so kids games should only distributed throughout phisical media but with opportunity to order them like this online by the parents after looked at them with their children together fortunately i have the cdrom version for pc i could imagine android and ios based tablets and smartphones that would support phisical media and it would be named application cards appcards for short and those apps wouldnt take so much space on these devices if either the kids videogames are available via digital download then the parents worrying about safety of their children using electronics will be even more reasonable when the time goes by also it increases young addicts our youth was way more safe on computer and video gaming how to can say ultra setting how do i play it with usb controller everyone sounds like a peasant how can you say this is ultra settings xd there are no graphic settings and you do not have any graphic mods on it xd reminds me of a crash bandicoot game that i always play on psp can you change the language on this new pc release i have so much nostalgia for this game and even more if i get it with the spanish voices 048 as they are yelling so much for childhood this is an actionadventure game and the sequel to kao the kangaroo it was developed by tate interactive and originally published by jowood productions and atari inc and tate multimedia developed and selfpublished the game now and it was originally released in 2003 for the xbox playstation 2 gamecube and pc and the steam rereleased version of kao the kangaroo round 2 was released about last month of 2019 the original release of kao the kangaroo round 2 received mixed reviews from critics the reviews for the steam rerelease version however were very positive this game was similar to crash bandicoot and rayman 2 the great escape this sequel follows the titular kangaroo hero kao after he was rescued by the parrot now its up to kao to save his animal friends from the clutches of the evil hunter and his vicious henchmen i got kao the kangaroo round 2 on steam for free about a month ago and it was and fun and awesome game i really wish they used this dub in the steam release that being said theyve been super generous by offering it for free even though it was already 199 collsrorybei oj i remember this especially this first section here fuck i miss this shit d hope god remaster my best game when i was a little boy i play it all time with that voice tararam from coins and trampoline i love this game pls remaster this game with the box gloves omggg i beg u pls remastere i know everyone need a remaster for this game i love it a lot great platformer please how did u get that on ps3 please tell me i am invincible engame flashbacks lol kao the kangaroo 2 is a good game i praise the voice acting gameplay and its boss battles except for the final boss but my criticism to the game was a lack of characters no ending cutscene and a lack of music what made me disappointed was the final boss had no voice acting and it was more easy than the others i feel like the game was alittle rushed but the game is still great id give it a 6910 whatever video game company has the rights for kao should remaster or revive the series for nintendo switch what is the world rcord but on the steam versin 4709 looks like a scene from 2001 a space odyssey how did u get the polish retail version with all the glitches i have the game on steam is there a way to change something in the settings to get it hey is it possible to do this speedrun tricks on steam version a n d i t t o o k m e three years t o f i n i s h t h a t g a m e why every speedrunner play on polish version this game dont have english or another reason it intrigues me a lot because im from poland and wonders why foreigners are playing this version you made 2 slips and 22 micro slips which stole about 3035 seconds despite this great respect and congratulations for what you did im your fan sorry for my english i love this game is my favorite game ever dude that was awesome i loved this game back in my childhood i was so impressed by this speedrun when you fight hunter on ship you can avoid every shot by coming close to side when you can hit him with booms without any dmg btw u destroyed my childhood with these tricks and glitches jk gz man very good run congratulations i always played this game with a friend nice run dude mmm polish version 3 beutiful run i was trying to put up my jaw which felt down and crashed into the floor while watching this i played this game like 20 times and woah i feel stupid now xd cool very nice run of a underappreciated game i remember loving this game to bits its a shame i havent played it in so long if i can get my hands on a polish copy id definetly be up to try and get into running it although are there any major differences between the different platforms or is it mostly load times hey where is the pirate boss that boss is right after you collect the gold what happened beautiful run shame the english version loses time kaos voice in that version is the best darn thing congratulations good luck with rayman3 and i hope you will try beating kao2 or kao3 100 355 what the fuck the darkness 3 xbox 360 torrent did anyone else play this at a young age did something to serve the game on the xbox 360 or only put up and ready what kinda hardware you using to capture this footage its really clear and crisp especially for xbox original really like your channel btw worth mentioning here between january 9th19th all the proceeds from this games steam sales are going to wires nsw wildlife information rescue and education service inc to help with the australian bushfires if youre making the comparisons to rayman 2 im pretty sure the giant thorns are the same asset in both games adored this game as a kid and saw the title and thought hmm im sure ive heard of this game bringing back memories i didnt know i had this game is basically rahman ty the tasmanian tiger and has a box cover art of a conker game in the boss level you must headlock a dog and avoid being punched by the aussie man they just updated the steam version now it has the us dub loved this game played it for like a year then my parents got me rayman 2 for the ps1 and rayman revolution cause someone recommended the rayman and i dont think i ever played it again if you know anything about those games thats funny in and of itself but yeah this game is like a toned down mixture of rayman 2 and 3 141 he did it again rofl love dat rayman cosplay some things survive on pure charm whats that anime the original design was drawn by a kid who won a magazine competition an he still hasnt got any credit for it till this day as a child i didnt understood english and didnt know how to play it i never passed the first level but is one of the games i remember the most the same as spyro and medal of honor spearhead the reason i got interested to begin with is cause my name is in the title lol i just realized that this is made by the people who made superman 64 neat am i the only one that just doesnt like rayman i tried playing it but i just really didnt like it i love kao though everyone says that kao is very similar to rayman but in my opinion its very different maybe some ideas were taken from rayman but this game is definitely not similar did they change kaos voice in the steam rerelease i feel like he sounds different there but im not sure i found the game because it was 100 off on steam and now its on steam picking up steam again on steam now for 2 bucks picked it up just cuz why not lol update kao round 2 is now on steam and is dirt cheap httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp1048540kaothekangarooround2 is anyone else back here again because kao round 2 just got released on steam today the game was released in steam and only for today it had a 100 discount so i give it a try and i loved it is a really good game if all my friends had steam acounts i will tell them hey get today this awesome game totally for free its free today on steam its free kao the kangeroo round 2 is free right now on steam get it while its free its regularly like 2 bucks now on steam bringkaoback hey nitro have you heard that this game is getting somewhat remastered on steam and it releases tomorrow kao round 2 will be coming to steam on june 1st 2019 with an hd upscale kaoround2 nitrorad well you sure got me hooked on that obscure kangaroo game had to order a copy right away actual combat boomerangs dont come back the ones that do are only really good for scaring birds i an nostalgic for that box art okay dont you dare insult that masterpiece i fucking loved that game as a kid and i really nned to get another copy if this game for the nostalgia 832 i heard that this game is from poland maybe thats why it is so bad do atlantis squarepantis i found my ps2 version in a charity shop along with a couple of old gamegear games 142 dat ytp editing though i wish nitro would play dog island on wii since he likes cute things so much im from kazakhstanformer soviet union country and to buy a pc gamethere were no ps and xbox after soviet union broke and before too you need to go to the bazaarplace where people buy and sell all kinds of thingsfoodmaterials etc pc games wasnt exception and find a stand where one man sells all kinds of different cds with games on them most of them were pirate copies of the original and you always had to buy at least 2 games because you never know which one of them would go well and which one is not even start to install on your pc yeah that kinda gaming you had after soviet union broke and the most amusing part is soviet union broke in 1992 while other modern countrys at that time could freely play games made in freaking 80s where did you get that thing with talking to a firefly to select a level in a hubworld that only happens if you use the option back to hub in a level and therefore stop the adventure you normally talk to a beaverenter a trainenter motorboattalk to pelican whatt id like some of these characters to come back with their own games blinx blinx the time sweeper ty ty the tasmanian tiger kay the legend of kay glover glover ristar ristar conker conkers bad fur day banjo and kazooie banjo kazooie earthworm jim earthworm jim jersey devil jersey devil voodoo vince voodoo vince and a bunch of other games or game series that have just been left to rot i play this game everyday following ty the tasminian tiger it all debends on taste your critic wont make me stop playing kao hahaha why do i get the feeling that the hunter voice sounds like waluigi with english monotone language yikes what happened to his voice holy crap ive never seen a sequel improve this much over its predecessor before the first game looks really awful but this game actually looks decent and seems to improve on the first in every way basicly im proud those games are from poland im polish does anyone know how to do that damn low tail attack without jumping i practiced and practiced and i just cant hit the x and o at the same time or am i doing it wrong i never played the full version of it only had a demo for pc he did it again aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa even the intro is ripped from rayman 2 i liked this video because of nano no other reason really sorry ah i see the designers of the us box art went to the same school of marketing as the nutjobs who designed icos us box art there was a kao 2 and 3 i only knew about the first one this is just amazing better than the original makes me wish there were a ds port 041 did you photoshop the terrible box art onto the xbox game box logo thingy or did you find it somewhere or did um where was i going with this i have this on gamecube still i loved it what he can stretch his neck lmao they must have had different voice actors in the us version i have the pal version and the voice acting is nowhere near as good the parrot has a really annoying voice and kao sounds almost exactly like rayman i still find the game fun though wait heck they added angry eyebrows for kirby on the american boxarts damn i always felt like there was something weird about kirby whenever i looked at his games in stores ive played the hell out of that game at the time so cute i hate anime but this is like the best part 241 i remember playing the game cube version of this back in 06 i live in the uk btw the uk version has a different voice cast and it did come out on xbox in north america kao is soooo cute it makes me want to play the game for myself not all boomerangs come back specifically hunting boomerangs generally dont turn back just leisure ones 130 yo was that a kid ninja with a minibatleth shit the klingons are using ninjas now and recruiting them as children run fucking run this game has always been a vague memory from my youth and i never could recall what this game was called im so happy to see this review since it helped jog my memory love your vids btw even the graphics look similar to rayman 2 xd i honestly think both boxart look like shit kao is cute but while he looks overly edgy in the us boxart he just looks creepy and badly drawn in the pal one even though im polish i have never heard of this series up untill now the first game coming out on dreamcast is definitively an odd thing to me most older polish games used to come out mostly on the pc but i still find this whole series really cute because of how small it is but you can tell the developers still tried to put some personality into it like the idle animations and stuff actual combat boomerangs are not supposed to return hey even the beginning scream rayman 2 d i played this game i hope they remake my favorite i actually like the title screen for 2 better then 1 ive never played these games but it looks like 2 is a huge improvement over 1 and if i do ever have a chance to play the series this is where i would start can you review the games based off monsters inc boomerangs actually werent meant to return originally they were a throwandretrieve hunting weapon at first but then wound up being made into a toy that had the famous return to thrower property 826 wait wait wait wait that looks identical to the dingodile boss battle from crash twinsanity this is the game of my childhood a bandicoot a thylacine and a kangaroo seems to have been a trend or something to have marsupials for protagonists back then xd i dont find a lot of games as a rip off a rip off would be a reskin of a game or the game but the main character and title changed rip off is a word used very loosely these days because learning from your past using tactics that are proven to be fun how is that a rip off i remember this game on demo shelves i love it so much now this game is my childhood favorite game from my childhood oh man i had this game when i was a kid fun fact kao sounds different in europe and he doesnt have an australian accent dont know about the other characters though how fucking dare you play an anime girl clip without a warning god lord that voice it hurts i just remembered i used to play this as a kid on the gamecube thats it thats all i have to say about this game cant even believe i remembered even the opening of the game with kao locked in a cage on a pirate ship is lifted from rayman 2 these bgrade platformers were shameless m how did you get it running on your pc i was unable to do so on w7 and w10 alike yeah kao 2 was not released on xbox in north america it was meant to be but was canceled last minute i wonder how many people thought rayman 2 copied kao 2 i swear to god that the voice acting is different in my copy of the game i take kao challengersround 2 over rayman 2 and im totally nostalgia biased 3 i feel that kao 2 is a better game but lost what made kao unique and made it a generic gamecube era platformer kao was very popular here in poland hell i have a copy at the family home as well i dont know if they did it to all the charachters but they changed the voice of kao in the pal version of the game and i hate that voice this game is rather inspiring for newbie creators its a major improvement in every aspect over the first one and thats just rad i mean they copied the shit out of rayman 2 but still there seems to be quite something here i grew up with this game l i k e t h e h e l i c o p t e r h a i r i n r a y m a n 2 that cover art looks more like conker than kao haha this was the first ps2 game i ever played it might even have been the first actual console game i played also wow that was weird in the european english version the voice is completely different he does not have a cute australian accent he just sounds like a normal guy expand nek technically returning boomerangs were just used to scare prey usually birds out of hiding to that hunting boomerangs which are not designed to return because they are meant to hit and kill would be thrown as actual weapons thus this game is the most accurate portrayal of hunting boomerangs as weapons in gaming plus even a returning boomerang only comes back if thrown with the correct angling and wrist movement this has been the tux with a your daily allotment of inane trivia the more you know jingle side note loving your videos and would be quite interested to find out what you think of psychonauts i always wanted to play this but i never did i have that same sweatshirt heck even the beginning is like rayman 2 hero trapped on a pirate ship and rescued by a friend will you do the rayman legends series i played the xbox version all the time as a kid i loved it so much hold on darker ominous intro screen pirate ship protagonist friends are captured side character comes to save protagonist someones been playing rayman 2 d also havent you noticed that its the second game of the series and it takes a lots of elements from rayman 2 even the frickin story kao vs ty which series is better funny i had been looking into several 3d platformers on gamecube this included and i was surprised to find how many of them didnt end up as bad as initially thought at first glance even though it seemed like they easily could have been they turned out to be worthy of at least one playthrough at least to me i suppose ill list some while im talking about the subject animaniacs the great edgar hunt disneypixar ratatouille ice age 2 the meltdown looney tunes back in action madagascar over the hedge ratatouille scoobydoo unmasked taz wanted the haunted mansion interestingly it usually seems to be the cartoonbased ones that fare off the best not really share why that is is it just me but this game has very close combat rayman 2 and 3 i througt than polish dubbing sucks but english oh boi i got the xbox version in australia will you check out the nicktoons 3d platformers they came out on a decent bit of consoles and are a bit obscure i recommend attack of the toybots and battle for volcano island itll be worth your time so im a newish follower and ive watched a lot of your videos already we seem to share similar views on a lot of games i grew up on 2d platformers and the jump to 3d is what kept me gaming into me teens and twenties id be really curious to hear your take on the sly cooper series i myself have a lot of gripes but a lot of love for the franchise at the same time itd be cool to hear your what you think i love that nichijou edit honestly yeah ill just be honest i prefer the american box art of kirby because i just find pissed off kirby so goofy and cute trying to be all menacing really random question does anyone know what the anime at 241 is i got requests from people who didnt even know there was a first game me how do you do that could you possibly review the simpsons hit run or futurama the video game please american box art european box art i just came back from your test stream kao 2 electric boogaloo oh my god how did you find out that it was similar to ray man 2 and i find it funny that you like kao character design so you furry character huh with that hoodie on you look like a human version of rayman game has diferent plot character design graphics uses common gameplay from plataform games reminds of a another game wich uses the same inspired game mechanics its a rip off so fucking stupid ajshajsh hey nitro rad why are you cosplaying as rayman in this video lol i was about leave a disappointed comment about the lack of neck but it hath been delivered thank you 835 jesus that reminds me so much of refluxs battle in rayman 3 why are you never going to review the kao game that was never released in english you dont need to know english to play games bruh 1113 how could you not notice that that one was similar to rayman 2 as well its similar to the laser avoiding part where you had to hit the switch this game is my childhood well this is going on my bucket list of platforming games wait they didnt even use the cartoonish font in console releases thats pathetic 149 titus thats the wrong name for the company im from poland and i played both kao 2 and kao 3 like crazy when i was a kid these games are sort of cult classics in my country but then i discovered rayman dear lord almost everything looks ripped from rayman 2 straight down to the storyline and those boss fights they all look like they were taken from rayman 3 the king knaaren that underwater sub in this game is a squid those minigames look like they were just taken right out of rayman 2 why is this game literally just a rayman copycat all these late 90searly 00s platformer reviewers are just bringing back a lot of memories of seeing ads for them in video game magazines on the shitter aaaah this was the first game i ever played that american boxart tho xd still not as good as ty i absolutely love your hair how did you get it like that so ininja is the best game ever made actually kao one was fucking appalling it was a very very shoddy attempt at crash bandicoot you couldnt jump without falling 900 times down a hole or into lava and thats just the first level haha do the duel masters games nitro you should review viewtiful joe that bossfight looks very similar to the first reflux bossfight from rayman 3 hey nitro rad have you seen the rayman cartoon i found this httpwwwmediafirecomfile8bxdsm6ua8y6v18kao3translationzip can you change the ending music i find it obnoxious also it is funny how you are dressed up as rayman i love this game so much rad can you do a review on the game called fur fighters is that a rayman hoodie im surprised you havent mentioned how kaos name is literally a pun of ko because what else do you call a kangaroo sporting boxing gloves love the rayman hoodie btw nice review rayman by the way do you own the copy of kao 3 i might help you in getting one since its more common here in poland apparently its the fault of all americans that the box art is different will you please review the platformers youve mentioned such as ratchet and clank banjo kazooie crash bandicoot etc you could also review anime seeing that kill la kill poster in the background is great and id like to see what you think of series such as jojos bizarre adventures the neck expanding thing is kind of disturbing lol 140 to be fair though it also has to do with marketing i remember hearing that the more tough side of kirby is what appeals to americansalso nothing wrong with being edgy but misrepresenting a game with inaccurate box art is bad have you heard of the pc dc and ps2 game fur fighters viggos revenge you should give that game a try but there are 2 versions 3 if you count the ios version original dc and pc versions has some rough textures similar to sonic adventure 1 dc version and it has gibberish voice acting the ps2 and ios versions have cell shaded graphics with english voice acting and bonus levels i remember when we played demo of this game over and over and over d thank you for reminding me since youre a sucker for cute characters have you heard of blender bros for the gba hey nr do you think you might be interested in covering graffiti kingdom at some point its one of my favorite old ps2 games and it doesnt have many video reviews i think youd probably enjoy it and enjoy making fun of it though it might take a bit of scavenging to find a copy at a reasonable price i know you like to cover the entire series so for reference its technically a sequel to magic pengel the quest for color though the stories arent at all connected kind of saying in advance but good luck trying to understand polish pls do fur fighters cuz tere arent any reviews on youtube how could you not mention the great soundtrack kao the kangaroo the great escape oh oh i know in rayman revolution remaster of rayman 2 if u got all the lumsin a level u would unlock a bonus level which was the same for every level and all u had to do was press 0 and x to win a race against an enemy they even copied that in this game xd i hope u notice this nice video as always btw another obscure 3d platformer is animaniacs the great edgar hunt for ps2 xbox and gamecube so if u ever come across it i recommend it nitrorad you should review katawa shoujo its free online i remember reading a review in nintendo power for the gamecube version of the game theyre usually pretty forgiving but with kao 2 they werent gave it a 25 out of 10 looking at it now i dont really understand why it looks like fun to me however there was one thing in that review that really stuck out and contributed to that low score because of its absurdity so i figured id ask if you encountered it in the volcano level is there a part where youre jumping between ice platforms that are floating on lava lol if soyeah i dont know what the developers were thinking there im a rather recent sub i just want to say i enjoy your content really well done wait boomerangs tttttttttttttttttttttttyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy hey if youd like come join us on the officially sanctioned nitro rad discord and discuss the video httpsdiscordggwwfhsys yo that title screen and intro is str8 outta rayman 2 if you ever get a patreon going youll be the only person i donate to you deserve it one of the best gaming channels ive seen recently i just think its kind of weird that a game about an australian marsupial that boxes would only have its 3rd game available in poland guess it might be a mess and they dont want us to play it i love these informative and high quality videos over platformers great work keeping up the quality nice ill never think kao will look cute main reason being his eyes rest on top of his head rather than being within them and so my imagination gives way to what his skull looks like and now i cant look at the guy as anything but an eldritch abomination from the dark depths thanks brain somehow i want to see a death battle between kao the kangaroo and ty the tasmanian tiger whos with me you should check out the pacman world games theyre worth a shot any chance youd review the suikoden games you should cover the psp game as well it was a solid platformer i used to play as a kid wearing a rayman hoodie while talking about a rayman ripoff that was actually quite subtle i wish i hadnt sold this recently this game looks fun conversely i had no idea there were any sequels to the dreamcast game dude youre gong for that rayman haircut it suits you but i couldnt help but notice when you held the box art close to your head i somehow knew this would be similar to rayman 2 and ive never even played that game pause at 127 to see a possessed nitro rad why are your videos so good like seriously there so freaking entertaining and i dont understand how you dont get more views this video make me want to rewatch nichijou wtf lol i thought for a moment you wouldnt mention the fact that a third kao game exists but you caught that and now i am curious how the third game is like why are you dressed up like rayman xd looks at the cover and is instantly reminded of conker live and reloaded yeah this was around the time call of duty became massive i can tell you that cant wait to see you play the gba port its something all right damn watching your last video on the first game and now this one back to back i like how much of a step up things look visually had me laughing with the comparisons to rayman 2 towards the end p kao the kangaroo round 2 electric boogaloo so this is your zero punctuation resistance 3 review then this is game is pretty good i especially like this one bit where you do this and wait a minute thats ripping off this other game i really like except not as well oh my god ps whatever negativity implied is unitentional your reviews are the big dogs biscuit that boxart thing is such a shame the original looks so good that moment when you remember playing the second game and thought it was the first then find out its a trilogy anyone recommend ininja to james yet games great and it falls in line with the kind of games he reviews so we have a tasmanian tiger an australian kangaroo and an american wolf ruff trigger when are you gonna cover a platforming game with a canadian moose mascot wait were you even wearing the rayman hoodiexd ive come back to correct the description of oh yeah i remember this game in a nintendo power review it got 25 out of 10 hey nr big fan love the videos i dont know if you can edit descriptions but than ripping of crash bandicoot of is a typo when i first saw kao in a cage in the dark on a pirate ship i immediately thought huh getting a little rayman 2 on us arent you kao little did i know how true that would be i remember an xbox game where your like the daughter of god or something and your dad is this big clock face looking guy and a bunch of bird men call you mama i would like to find out what this game is called and if anyone would cover it id hope it would be you this channel suffers from a serious lack of subscribers when your done with kao the kangaroo could you look at tak and the power of juju games for a few moments i thought that you would not talk about the rayman 2 comparisons p hey nitro will you ever review the jak series whats the story with that chicken hat in the background and where can i get one well i do admit ive seen more copies of kao 2 on ps2 than on xbox or gc 144 keep doing this in every video love it something that you didnt mention that always bothered me with his game is at the bosses straight up told you how to defeat them mate why play polish games from 2005 reasons that i love your videos solid reviews good skits and nichijou hey nitro you ever heard of a game called brave the search for spirit dancer its another obscure ps2 era platformer for having only average games they sure got a lot of mileage out of kao fun fact these games were made by the same people behind superman 64 its a wonder theyre actually decent for gods sake you need more subscribers third game is ratchet and clank rip off kind of i knew i was getting some rayman 2 vibes from the moment the video started 825 is pretty much a 11 copy of the first real boss from the donald duck phantomias game 554 what the fuck thats an old friend of mine did you really found him in a shutterstock photo hey guys did you know that there is a rip off game of lisa now it is called escape from detroit that voice oh my god its rouge the bat my favorite voice actress lani minella was in this d that box art looks like they were working off of the worms armageddon box art if youre gonna rip off a game might as well be my most favorite game of all time rayman 2 good video ive never even heard of kao the kangaroo before it looks like a good game even though round 2 like u mentioned in this video its sort of like rayman 2 ill have to get this on the gamecube this was the first game ive ever played i was three good times 144 confess it already omg you are into youtube poop you cant deny it i can feel the poopiness flowing through y wait that sounds horrible ps wtf nichijou aaaaa 3 i really enjoy these your a hidden talent from nrs rayman 3 review hey krome maybe you should have ripped off of rayman 2 instead of sonic adventure 2 wish granted this looks like what ty would be if the series did that nitro you gotta check out metal arms an amazing hidden gem on the xbox original made up a big chunk of my childhood kao 1 babys first crash kao 2 babys first 3d rayman kao 3 babys first jak daxter 1 one thousand two hundred sixty third kaos neck stretching makes me uncomfortable im german and i actually had the european xbox version as a kid the comparison to rayman while valid is symptomatic of a larger issue i think i mean rayman 2 was and is one of the best if not the best 3d platformers out there there wasnt a lot of room to improve gameplaywise the lava tower the rocketriding the tight distance combat all of that stuff ended up in future platformers in one form or another thats part of why they dipped in popularity platformers were starting to become interchangeable i mean most of the platformer games youve reviewed have been judged on how much they can stick out right when yooka laylee comes out do a review on it please to the jeez american kirby is hardcore is one of my personal favourite tropes that opening sequence is pretty reminiscent of rayman 2 too with it starting with a darker sky view then zooming in on your main character trapped in a pirate ship oh wow it improved every game like opposite sonic i remember when i was going to this one doctor he had a ds in the waiting room to play so i could pass the time and there was a kao game on the gameboy advance i dont recall which one its been over ten years since then but still i remember that i wonder if this next game will be the one i kinda sorta not really remember that aside kao round 2 looks fun may have to snag a copy 240 nichijou my absolute favorite comedy anime i really like your reviews i think hopefully not alone that the art of the platformers are stillunderrated keep on running and jumping yoooo that nichijou clip only watched 230 minutes in but nitro please trust me the original polish voice acting is much much better than this also as much as i like this game i wish it wasnt a cakewalk getting 200 or 250 dont remember stars and turning into sonic the hedgehog is worth it though pls dont play the gba game its shit and its not even tates fault i think it was titus who developed it the people who made superman 64 yeah im back baby surrender to kortext holy shit ive seen this game i remember i saw some kids play it at a boysgirls club haha that box art was so edgy just upload that off review already you hack fraud 333 you always take time to look at the whole series no matter how obscure the game in question is as someone who tends to play games in order to the point of ocd i really appreciate that that and rpg maker reviews there is never enough rpg maker reviews and this is one of the very few places on yt where i can get my fix theres also the basement but jordan broke and still kinda off what do you use to capture game footage it looks freakin beautiful do you think you could have a look at spongebob squarepants battle for bikini bottom i honestly thought the dreamcast game was the only one i didnt know there was a sequel i played all 3 of them i am polish so i am lucky i fucking love the wew and yey edits youve been adding into these they catch me completely off guard and made me burst into laughter ya mayne you should try out darkwood seeing as it fits your channel you can get kao trilogy for basically no money whatsoever in poland ofc loving the rayman jumper oh god the nostalgia aaaaagh i played kao challengers im pretty sure its just a port of kao round 2 the art cover screams conkers bad fur day lol nitro rad i just discovered you like a week ago and i already binge watched all your vids so basically a blatant ripoff of rayman crash and mario 64 where do you live that this upload time is even remotely acceptable let alone doable babys first 3d rayman gotta prepare those babies to play two bleedin games still cant get over the fact ubisoft abandoned 3d rayman in 2007 wow this came quick ok you the one i lve classic games is that a rayman hoodie your wearing god i remember playing a demo of this on my xbox in the uk i swear his voice was different in the uk version and for some reason remember his name being pronounced cow by in game characters i played it as kid in poland and only recently ive read its polish i liked it a lot nitrorad youre the most underrated reviewer ever im so glad you make those rpg indie horror games you and jontron are my favorites punch punch kick its all in the mind first this first

this work on nintendont a gamecube emulator for wiius vwii thank you for the memories you gave me with this video good job with the gameplay when i was 8 years old i bugged lava level xd can you do a lets play of kao the kangaroo 3 mystery of volcano where can i get this game actually hunters name is hunter this is more obvious in polish version where instead of owca they call him hunter 144 ha ha ha you are really stupid come one i figure out when was kid 247 yeahh doesnt work yhym yeaa okey maybe you not understand gameplay of this game or mechanics i know this game is for kids and maybe in this time that game is too hard for now kids but game suppose to give a challange 150 well it was mentioned in the first level in the part where you push the button and while you can just punch it im pretty sure stomping was the way to do it if young me when i was like 6 or 7 figured it out i think you should be able to do so too additionally didnt the giant plant that wanted to eat you use that mechanic as for melee combat rolling often made dodging easy and i didnt get hit nearly as much as the first game for instance for the dwarf enemies you can roll into them while you jump then hit them while vurnable it always felt pretty smooth to me to be honest for the ice mechanic if the cooldown wasnt there you could easily cheese your way by constant jumping and moving one inch every time without any risk whatsoever mario style again even though young me often died there he never found it a really bad thing for the flying mechanic oh for infinite flight so you fly over the whole level coming to mind pointless limitation the part where since there is now an english translation patch for kao the kangaroo 3 you might also review it id be glad if you did when are you gonna review the obscure poland exclusive 3rd game i remember this game i lent it to a friend then i moved now its gone rip kao the kangaroo round 2 why did you leave me senpie the level of polish d 326 rare breed indeed a titus game which actually isnt awful huh personally i thought music in the 1st game was much better soundtrack here sounds boring i dont want to say something but that parrot piss me off nie chce nic mwi ale ta papuga mnie wkurza 810 i love how you just ignored the trapped beavers theyre all screaming eyy help me mane i dont wanna dig crystals anymore and kao just disregards them like lol bitch gtg fast where did you get the english patch wow this is a great speedrunninggame i like how they left the maps pretty open for unintended shortcuts why every character except lightbug is dubbed by the same actor there is one boss more than on the pc bad thing played it on computer this game needs to be a bloody remake thatll be awesome good game remember this i was playing on original xbox we want reamsterd is there any way to play it on windows 81 951 dont remember this boss when i played at as a kid thank goodness this is a kids game that octopus suffered a serious death i dont remember a witch boss wth is my game a copy the perfect game kao the kangaroo round 2 all bosses final boss gamecube ps2 xbox psp bosses shaman railroad octopus pirate the hunter this game is dope this is my childhood hmmm i remember this game being much better to be honest rayman 3 confirmed i only just got the pun of kaos name whoa whati dont remember the witch bossi had this on gc and pc used to love it also kaos voice is different he sounds more child like in the us versions i played ti a h before best game ever soooo after making a very shitty gba game the company decided to make a sequel for consoles well then at least this looks better than the first where every boss took about 510 minutes do you have the nicktoons games like unite battle for volcano island and attack of the toybots did you get the eternal night and a new beginning yet if you recommend this game to anyone who would it be hint it can be anyone thanks bro record defeat hunter without getting any damage i knowremember all this game had always had and always will have a special place in my heart for a brief time when i played it in my childhood days i instantly got attached to it so right now 7 years i had to be apart from it and now when it was finally re introduced on steam i can happily welcome back my old friend in to my life i played kao 2 as a kid but ever since today i thought it had been a fever dream all i knew was that the game involved me playing as an anthropomorphic animal and there was some kind of chase level i cant believe i finally found the game after so much time i could never play the first one i was very sad but i kept trying again and again then i see that round 2 is for a cheap price on steam so i buy it and fuck yes it is so good bruh kao is on steam now this is awesome round 2 is great but the first one has a special place in my heart kao round 2 is the best while it has not as much good mechanics as mystery of volcano it has the most levels 314 kao the underwater giraffe round 2 i just finished kao the kangorou round 2 on steam and damn its a great game x trying to casually enjoy this game and then this plant comes along the memories omg this was the best we need a remaster its a bear and its casing meohh mamma bandicoot here we go again lol omg the memoriesawesome come on i couldve asked my cousin about this since he has steam dang i have missed out on the opportunity to do that game of my childhood d is that rayman soundtrack in begining d i contacted the devs about kao 3 and i try to believe they will see my email btw i pirated this game on a unknowed site and i found it and i played it after i see this was released on steam my face falled down well if we buy that game on steam im sure that will help keep the franchise supported manz got kao the kangaroo round 2 for free on steam from the getgo it was certainly worth the privilege i would like to support the franchise by putting money towards paying for their products but for those who plan to own all versions this saves money on at least one copy of the game out of all copies in their collection wow i never would have download this game if it werent for u ocg ur always there for me thanks until it will go back to 199 glad that i clicked on this video i hope they makes a remake or a new game of kao the kangaroo my childhood i find it quite interesting how even after

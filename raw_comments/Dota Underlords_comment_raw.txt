that was a great match and coming second was a solid outcome and the late game strategy was good with rng there is always an element of surprise like when one side delivers massive crits early game to critical squad members causing the entire squad build to fall apart if possible it would be cool if peeps checked my own playthrough out defiantly not as enjoyable or classy looking as this one but it gives a different angle of a match strategy so it could be worth the view and of course your free to skip the boring bits httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkcmkrvugq game dota underlords ads auto chess info news httpswwwduniakahficom201908dotaunderlordsheadtoheadupdatehtml finally my kind of game def wouldve won imo if you didnt make the swap at the end do you have a plan or you just go with the flow in game with some tanks and dps wow undoubtedly boring streamer was doing some coke off camera dota underlords is a really fun game imo mobile version please so this is an auto chesd mode that got no different except that you must have battle pass this is a mobile game as dota autochess spammers we have 2 weeks of being better at purge at a game before starting to watch his guides and calling him senpai looks better than autochess imo isnt this so random look at that phones screen layout i dont play dota because im awful at multitasking but i still watch your videos however this underlords mode was easier for me to interact with for like 5 minutes i was like swap out the kunkka he aint nothing but a boat i hope you play this more is this a closed beta or something i think you need rest look your eyes like black holee rest please keep healthy pure garbagedota 2 auto chesss ftw me open dota2 underlord vid auto chess ads started playing dota2underlords am i a joke to you this is trash the fact that theres an autochess ad right before the video is just epic marketing strat you can actually build now with the item drop being not so rng nice to see some game makers understands that too much rng is the cancer of any pvp experience always yo non stop also i think those global buffs stack so if you get 2 strange bedfellows demon buff its 30 30 and if u have two demonhunters thats 50 more pure damage and thats not even counting the base 50 pure demon damage totaling at 160 more pure damage lol my lvl 2 tb consistently did 8000 damage every fight whereas others topped at 23k id imagine other buffs stack too like inventor explosion 2 buffs 20 max hp as damage to 40 if a unit has 15k hp he would deal lets say 700 dmg thats like laying a lvl 1 techies mine so good far more variety and possibilities in this version of the game and its balanced because a lot of stuff is great should have checked the opponents board first final round opponent is mage type so goblin mech isnt good wp still from 6hp to 2nd place kunkka is definitely great dont just look at the dps its a huge aoe stun too uhh oh if this gets popular league of legends might steal this next waitis this the new dota chess recreation me can valve not releases something that is dota for 5 seconds valve good question first there was warcraft orcs and humans then there was warcraft 2 tides of darkness then warcraft 3 reign of chaosfrozen throne after that the universe of warcraft divided into defense of the ancients and a mmorpg world of warcraft world of warcraft eventually got a reboot in card version hearthstone defense of the ancients got a remake and got called defense of the ancients 2 after that some unknown group of enthusiasts created a very addictive board game based on the heroes of dota 2 now valve company that created dota 2 is stealing their idea and turning it into a standalone game i expect that in 20 years there will be no trace of the original game left and nobody will remember where it all began but they will still produce more and more new games based on that universe hello purge im a huge fan just wondering if you plan on making a guidetutorial for dota underlords or if you can recommend an already existing guide thanks another sad game like artifacts i dont really dig the graphic style but im interested since i like the mod is this dota chess haha 322 gold earned i see this game seems very stupid you were offered so many knights i dont like the graphic style thanks purge so they basically copied autochess never heard purge more happy than when he was saying yo the only feedback from me is that the battle phase is just too fast to see anything its just plays at crazy speed all heroes cast spell simultaneously which makes it hard for the player to see what spell is cast and when it is cast so decrease the speed please with todays updated ui game looks way better am so used to amaz autochess watching purges playstyles made me feel kind of weird focusing more on interest rather than synergy hmm it just like auto chess omg it looked much better in dota 2 looks like cartoon child shit purge with the 2 mages strat in the midgame xd what is this game is it like another take on autochess much more satisfying than watching artifacts 322 total gold earned kappa yo bloodseeka and drows buff is an aura in this are there no item recipes in this game i miss that i also liked the manual upgrading because you had to micro and think about space buuuut maybe the game is better off without that i have no clue on whats happening in this game i dont know how this works but i like watching purges videos is it possible to use the cosmetic items from dota main to this spinoff game or they want players to buy another arcana lol enlighten me pls that ui is so ready for mobile porting holy shit is this just an official version of dota chess seatech how does purge feel about his unintentional asmr fame yo how to get this game who would get a lot of player autochess by drodo or dota underlords yo i havnt playedbut judging from thisit look pretty goodnice graphic for mobile definitely gonna download it in my phonecannt wait for the finished productthis beta version look very promisingi gv it 910valve made great decision make this game to go straight in to mobilethe future is here oldman no you should have taken gyro out and the final board would be 6 goblins 3 mages and enigma that might have secured the game the mobile game is better why do people save gold so much these graphics sigh the more i look at it the uglier it get im hoping that they improve this use the real dota 2 visual geez valve and only let this trash visual for the mobile version the matches are too long to play on phones and this ui i really didnt like its good for mobile but for pc need a lot work is this auto chess wtf dota 2 inspired with league of legends graphics the game looks nice but it would be better to preserve dota 2 original theme nice video purge omg the black outline i understand what sunsfan was saying now it looks awful hey purge long time silent fan thank you for making regular content about relevant things so i dont have to watch baumi it has black outlines which sux imo i just realized purge always goes by pudge only a 1 letter difference hmmm is the undeadheartless bonus so bad that it justifies not taking the abandon or pudge to go with drow instead of the duplicate clocksomni auto chess tutorial for dummies please purge 40 mins 36 rounds too much time for mobile users more content in this game yooo survived with 6hp im not good at this game it feel so weird comparing to the original one idk if i hated or love it this looks unfinished and rushed at least artifact didnt look like shit they really need to scale down the interface by a ton this was clearly made for mobile and just mindelessly ported to pc without giving it a second thought yes master teach us is this the official version of the dota autochess gamemode please play this lots kpg send feedbacks to devs guys well time to go out and yo some dudes this is just bloody auto chess yeet edit yo way too slow and redundant could have done it in 30 min why is this shit played so much i really love your videos because your introductions are so clear you just tell us what we need to know no blah blah greets from germany quill18 i did very much appreciate you took your time and showed an entire game i was hesitant on this game but your video helped me change my mind downloading now this is the same as tft was before the new season quill18 did play at your own pace option get removed in the new big update patch nice thats it i found the required patience to watch the whole game and i get it now super simple to approach this is gonna be a great i got 30min to spare game thanks quill yea i hate how theres no tutorial mode anymore at least that i can find lifesaver i would have gave up on this game because i did not understand it i had no idea this existed im downloading it right now i just wonder if and how they plan to monetize this in future that was a great match and winning is the icing on the cake with rng there is always an element of surprise but it was mitigated well also spacing out the units comes in handy for fighting teams with high aoe damage mine is a little different as its a ranked match so it may offer some insight into playing other people directly if possible it would be cool if peeps checked my own playthrough out defiantly not as enjoyable or classy looking as this one but it gives a different angle of a match strategy so it could be worth the view and of course your free to skip the boring bits httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkcmkrvugq very good tutorial thanks the most bullshit game ever made how is this different from autochess then you say the button is a little confusing and you dont know what it fucking dies i cant go back ive invested to much precious time im now considering looking you up what your physical address is where you reside i cant control my rage im 14mims in you just hit round 2 and still have not talked about xp button who plays games like this lol shits trash in this game particuarly he should have locked the shop cus he had 3 heroes with same aspects of region every american convert to a lmao its a gold d nice tut btw you get cards then between rounds the game offers you more cards you match the colours if you can if the game doesnt even give you the ability to make compositions you lose not much to it really exactly like card games but instead of having to think about moves you just sit there watching like an idiot that tusk bot will fucked up your game belive me bro pdk hi what is the final round in this game and how to rank and level up dat solo pudgie thanks for the tutorial enjoyed your commentary me when i lose at any game 5157 somebody help me when i find match it always says that im already in a matchmaking even though im not it always says error already in a matchmaking your voice assures me youre the gamer who knows what hets doing pure gaming nerd respect my og getting day9 vibes p troll warlord thats insane the rngods hath blessed thee just started out in underlords and even though i already knew the basics and dont usually like long videos the reasoning in this kept me hooked and helped a lot learning unity with your tutorials for months seeing this cool game clueless tho searching for a beginner guide here i am love ya i have no idea how i would have learnt all this stuff by myself thanks no dollars in this game though stupid that you dont attack the same person attacking you nardwuar the human serviette when dota copying league this game is salt generative great video man literally teaches you everything you need to know i also prefer playing it in mobile interface anyways it was a very good tutorial and it helped me a lot to get ahead in the game and btw i really do expect more from valve they profit more than that mobile legends and league of legends and fuck they end up with auto chess mod like seriously fuck me is that offline you should create tutorials and understanding guides as a profession man though now a days i suppose youtube kinda is that but still just so well done thanks for this tutorial this tutorial is amazing im linking this video in steam because i think you did an amazing job of explaining this game thanks for the great tutorial sounds similar to majhong i cant believe i just watched an hour long tutorial great help though oh and keepers laser horses got me xd you have no idea how much this tutorial helped me before i was getting destroyed by the bots but now im destroying them good personality keep up content subbed bud i am bad at this game ill get a team of mostly two stars as for example humanbloodboundmagetrollwarlock with good equipment placement and ill get roflstomped by most others sigh edit i take this back since posting this i won 4 out of my next 7 games p worst choice ever picking vicious intent over skull basher hey quill just wanna say thank you because of you i play better at this game thanks great tutorial but im addicted to the game and this doesnt tell me how to stop also what wtf there is no quit game button in mobile view so annoying have to use task manager evey time to quit the game or go into settings and turn back to pc mode to find wuit game button 2254 is a bit scary its gold not dollar you ignorant yankee this is the best tutorial out there ive never skipped everything you said was very important i enjoyed it best tutorial for thsi game thank you so much i learned sooooo much a question i had is what is the white bar below the hp and mana when you showed the damage at 2744 minutes the bat troll had a green and blue damage filled what did the blue damage come from or mean is that different from green that was really helpful 1 gold at 1 2 gold at 2 3 gold at 3 4 gold at 4 5 gold at 5 1 experience point per round 5 gold gives 4 xp assassins always teleport behind lines demons dont lose buff if they are the same character it is usually better to replace a tier 1 unit with a tier 3 unit when both are 1 star aim to lose consistently without dying or win consistently without dying round 15 minions act like assassins dont plan on getting level 10 thanks for the tips quill18 thanks for the guide this had a tangible impact on my play i went from fighting my way through the early ranks to blasting through grifter in a day with several firstplace finishes under my belt i hope this stays non paytowin its rare to see a game come out especially on mobile that isnt i havent played it yet i just havent seen anyone complaining about it ur very good at explaining stuff thanks for your help understanding this game just by saying that to combo classes i must get different heroes from the same class it made a huge difference in my gameplay i wanna download this game but idk if i should woah what the hell when did you blow up man this is such a good quality video it really helped me understand the game and made want to play multiplayer before i got destroyed now im placing top 3 thanks for the video so im on 4049 in the video probably i got it wrong what you said or its a new update or you mention it later but the count for the interest is by the start of the fight so if you buy a hero or upgrade after the start of the fight you reseve the interests before the fight so if you start the fight at 50 and then you buy something lets say for 3 coins so you have 47 but after the fight you reseve 5 interests not just 4 because you bought it after the fights starts i actually had no idea about the store lock button this will be useful im trying to get used to this game since the pc version of the chinese autochess is on epic forsome reason and these games eat up my phone battery its gold not dollars lol what does the lock button in the shop do i cant figure it out sometimes the fights make zero sense and they make me angry lmao thanks for nice video and good tips in game i really didnt get the purpose of this game willing to watch your video in hopes of understanding what the hell i am supposed to do for all of u out there can u tell me which shld i check dps or attack if i want more damage this looks so much more polished than tft atmmight just have to jump on this until riot sorts their shit out thank you for this i learned about this game a couple of days ago and your video has made it much easier for me to jump into and give a try very informative video glad i watched it i was so confused when i started playing definitely more confident now after watching this so helpful if i could like multiple times i would go quill18 why dolar it also can be euro kidding great video thanks man thanks for this very well explained and perfect pace i know kungfu ty so much learned a lot about economy truly useful video thanks learned a ton thanks why are you swallowing so hard into the mic and smacking your lips sounds like you just walked through the sahara desert for a whole day with no water disgusting take a breath dude youre going way too fast for yourself dudequit opening windows during matches 4225 maybe i should cut video because people are going to see like 40 minute video and be like oh this is not a tutorial yeaah you kinda went already past 40 minute mark there d great tutorial thanks learned so much thank you for doing this huh so its a ripoff of teamfight tactics but without actual champions very useful vid i just got this game and looked up some guides and this helped me a bunch so thanks is there any reason why my units arent damaging my opponents health 4 fights in a row my 3star slark destroyed his army but his base health never went down thank you for the tutorial the starting on pc and switching to mobile is quick and easy assuming youre connected to steam through the game already on the phone once you start up the other device youll get a big reconnect button to push then boom youre back in goodbye summer nd hello another addictive quill game lycan tusk and kunkka is a really powerful combo usually the frontline i try to get with those 3 units you get first tier in 3 different alliances human warrior and savage crystal maiden is also a unit i always take when given the chance she is so powerful with her ability to replenish the mana of all your units she makes units like kunkka and keeper of the light godly you can spend gold after the round starts and even then earn the corresponding interest because the interest is calculated from the gold of the beginning of the round it is good to just save up to 50 gold cuz u gain interest for each multiple of 10 gold that you earn in every round being a little frustrated at the game so i found your videos i love your excitement and im looking at the game in a little brighter light now you should always have 1 demon it cancels out your enemies demon alliance too thanks quill this video is ammeeizing i already know how to play but im just here cuz i saw quill was making a video on it series plz awesome tutorial man thanks for helping the new guys out one my first match after watching your tutorial never knew i could lock units ty very much valve needs to add skins and interface to this gaem otherwise how they gonna make money lol watching this video was a whole treat this new genre of games are really cool glad theres someone out there that can show how to play one of the many games that are being made with this genre subbed in the tutorial it doesnt teach you about 2 starring and 3 starring if you dont buy 3 of the same unit that ended with me not understanding why i got dead last every game dud can u pls speak like a normal person great video you you cleared up a few things that i wasnt sure about but the interest is calculated right when the fight starts not at the end of the round correct thats why its often times advisable to spend your gold during the fight after the interest has been calculated guys can anyone confirm what is the logic of the random heroes you get to purchase at the beginning of every month are they capped are there only 10 tiny heroes or only 10 terrorblades or are they unlimited i played the game 10 times already and cant find the answer and sometimes i feel like i am rerolling heroes but the one i need will never come because someone else has it other times i tell myself the hero wont come at all because others have it too and then a guy completes upgrade 3 right under my nose what is the logicrule regarding this thanks hey man this video has been most helpful i just one my first game because of it and it was awesome d i usually distrust mobile games but i just discovered this game like 2h ago and my pc is in bad shape so i am very pleased to find that it is on mobile something to kill time before i fix or replace said pc d i watched the longest videos in my youtube life thanks ive watched the whole video did try to learn as much as i can and try to apply it on my own gameplay i recommended your tutorial to my friends and subscribers thank you so much quill18 hey quill thanks for this video it was really helpful the only thing i didnt understand is how do i defend against enemies what should i be looking at when i watch other peoples board also is it good to keep tier 1 units at the end of the game even though they are a leveled up if so how do you exchange them please make a follow up video thanks dude this guide is super helpful i didnt know what in the hell i was looking at at first super helpful video thanks a ton out of all the tutorials this is probably the best super good tutorial bro only thing when your playing pvp you dont get enough time to make an informed decision im really digging this new game genre very similar to the card games i cant say enough thank you for this 3 manuh not monuh every time i hear someone say monna it makes me cringe it sounds sopretentious jeeves fetch me some monna and a basket of tomottoes anyway thanks for the vid this game is confusing at first great tut thanks i tested the interest stuff yesterday and the interest applies with the initial amount of gold at the moment that the round begins so if you have 50 gold when they start to fight and 40 when you finish you still getting 5 gold interest sorry for my english a bit on the long side but overall a good guide i have started playing and found this useful anyone figure out how to actually exit the game when you are done with your matches besides altf4 i have 4900 hours in dota 2 but this game just dumbfounded me thank you for the explanation on everything great video holy shit you take 15 minutes to give up 2 minutes of information thanks for this yeah great video thanks well now i cant unsee the missing i in mechansm thanks so much best tutorial ever found how long do rounds last on average round 1 could have been used to explain the lock mechanic you had the trinity of bounty clock and tinker in the shop buy clock lock the shop then pick up the rest turn 2 i hate multiplayer when do i get my solo ccg thanks dude i love how the whole moba dota type games all came from an original map editor design now we have multiple moba games it is technically the most popular genre of games in the world and now we even have a new genre of game thats basically a mod of the original moba type of game how crazy is that think of how stagnant and uninspired a lot of games are these days devs with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions pumping out garbage games while the community sits here and comes up with incredible new ideas that turn out to be massive hits in an ai game i got the 4 inventor 6 scrappy bonuses so i was invincible surprisingly addicting game im enjoying it quite a bit how come the exit button disappears on mobile interface haha holy shit this video is 15 hours long currently on a ten losing streak hoping to change that the tiny image wasnt glitched it showing the picture of the 2star tiny who is bigger tiny is one of the few pieces that changes as he levels up just like in actual dota literally watching this just to understand the other videos on this channel thank you for this this is great thx dude will have to pick this up looks like a lot of fun downloaded its so easy easy enough to require an over an hour long tutorial won my first game on mobile quill plz play more of this game this is an excellent new player tutorial i am excited to play a few games now that i know about synergies and how to better manipulate my gold gains well done quill18 how to equip the items why did you put the broach on the knight 19m thanks for the guide btw v useful i had no idea what was going on in ur other vids so quill any plans to make tft content loved the tutorial damn it quill i played my very first match because of this vid and got 2nd place i only expect your quality teaching to get me to 1st no exceptions learn a lotthanks wouldnt the attack rate be the lower the number the better thanks for this explained a few things i didnt quite get by just watching people play i love watching all of your autochess now underlords gameplay videos and even having learned a lot about the game i still enjoyed this video a lot please keep them coming just to add to the guide on interest there are two timers in each round the one before the fight and the one after the fight interest is calculated when the first timer runs out and the battle begins which means if theres something that you want to buy but you dont need it on the board immediately its better to wait until the fight starts then collect your interest and then buy the unit that you want a good way ive found to counter assassins is to intentionally leave a space for them to jump behind you and put a tanky guy back there almost always for me anyway 12 of the assassins start hitting the tanky guy its saved my bacon many many timeseven just a beastmaster is enough it seems like tft has much more viewers on twitch now than this gameand the original auto chess mod is already dead that happend fast thanks quill subscribe for more videos here httpbitlyholyhexor submit your epic dota 2 clips here httpartofdota2com watching with autochess ads well its looks uglywith that league of legends graphic ewww just like a mobile graphic need to play iy on mobile this is better more informative especially to newcomers this is really cool and easy to understand unlike the mobile auto chess no offense it is free ow my godvalve just made a cute version of dota chess i like it valve can i copy your homework drogo yes but dont copy exactly valve dota underlord same skills tada valve btw i disable your custom game server drogo wtf man the theme song monkas but pogu its will be free like watching some crappy flash game from 2010 who even came up with this stupid auto chess idea as if its going to be popular lmao the ui looks like it has mobile in mind noice auto chess ripoff cool is it a nintendo game or a pc game seriously lollllll valve is so out of touch they fail miserably and killed off their card game within weeks then they take ideas from the community because theyre so reliant on dota and csgo valve please bring dota underlords mobile version nice i got auto chess ad legion td chess xd this for pc the music of the game is beyond amazing how to get it i cant wait to see valve releases the mobile version and see which one will die faster should have made this instead of artifact d is this pc version bcoz the layout looks like was meant for mobile why do the graphics look like league bloodbseeker is a fucking human lol where do i download it what is the difference from drodo fuck u and your ads when this game will be released maybe they should make a mobile version of this how the hell does a hero upgrade ive fought enemies with 2 stared heroes the game doesnt really tell you any of its mechanics at the moment lol what is the defference of auto chess to dota underlords who so many dislikes looks fine to me idk man but if this is on mobile maybe i will give it a shot not that autochess mobile by drodo which i think sucks because theyre more fun in the dota itself anyone trade my disruptor set of collectors cache how many auto chess do we need honestly i am looking forward for this game is that mobile game or not phone game valve has tons of resources and yet lets play some hearthstone damm it hurts to watch you play this game i started to think its ign channel sees other same hero doesnt buy it link to get this game i wish theyll make this game as a separate game on steam people always find something to complain about i think it looks great like heroes charge event and its nice these graphics looks terrible use that godammit source engine 2 to upgrade this use this visual only for mobile version jesus why the pc version of the game looks worse than artifact beyond that you cant screw with a formula that already is proved to be good if it will be free2play not a pay2win like artifact im on board looks better than drodo autochess mobile any rewards for battle pass or just to play another game and waste your levels whats with the ugly hero icons i mean come on i hope there is mobile version its better then autochess for reak tho omg im loving this already how many version of auto chess do you want valve yes why is the ui like in a mobile game wtf is this borderland 3 new expansion m i the only one who didnt understand how to play auto chess is it free to play because it looks great compared to artifact shots fired what i love about valve is its understandable ui cant wait for it only compedium players or wht nice try but suck gaben puck is a dragon pepega where to play original autochess league of legends autochess mobile autochess and now dota itself new autochess are u guys serious what the hell so they just ripped it off these greedy fucking copy cats same with riot it looks so damn good i fckin love it pimp my peon castle fight nexus etc been around since warcraft 3 way better games it was pain to watch this stop spending all your money and use the interest mechanic thanks for showing off the game i am downloading it to give it a try nobody should support this game it is literally just a complete rip off auto chess the abilities and everything are exactly the same even the effects support the small guys not valve no thanks looks boring lol interesting concept but not for me theres zero customization feels pointless to play to me i want some goal to work towards matches are far too long too first i hope you play this more now that you posted a video on it love these videos instantly got hooked on this game xd just got my first win also found out that ogre mages are kind of insane when you have a bloodseeker with you i dont know how it turned out like that or if it was just buffs but my ogre had 600 attack damage and his attack delay was something ridiculously low killed most things in about a second xd considering the current memes you should do a name change to boomerreflexes ive found hobgen and scrappy alliance is good there is a skill build for him that consistently puts out over 10k damage dang what the heck i thought it was going really well too i am not an expert at autochess and i mostly play tft now so i am certainly not an expert on underlords now it actually has underlords however there are some general points i would make 1 econ econ is vital to winning autochess type games however by tft standards you econned way way too hard especially when you had multiple 3 stars you could potentially finish i know underlords has a higher econ game but still you should not get to 50gp and stay there you econ up to then spend down at the critical moment to maximise your chances of getting what you need or to level so you reach that critical moment sooner the fact you levelled from 8 to 9 when you had nothing of worth to put in was especially painful you could have done that as an allin if you also sold pretty much your entire comp and then rolled for high tier 1 and 2s maybe it probably wouldnt have worked but it would at least make some amount of sense gold in the bank is as worthless in terms of actually winni i dont know what was going on with that pudge in the last round homie was unkillable with that insane hp regen you tried too hard on legion commander she came in way too late to be able to scale well enough and just butted into a team not made to exploit her advantages things really started crashing down when you sold the qop though what were you thinking she was practically the only member of the team actually dealing decent damage 127 martyrs boon mark my words that icon will be changed cutters will rise up legion commander just isnt worth it honestly her damage output is extremely low and tiny kept throwing her dueling partners out of range of her to fight them i cant see the difference between your and enemy units anymorehooray for colourblindness tiny and tusk are really op right now it genuiely feels like a new game now with the underlords finally added moaaar the game is supposed to get another big update this month this looks so different from the last time i saw you play trying to watch this from a tft mindset and im so lost i have no idea whats going on o why dont you play the different autochess games like tft or the new one in heartstone seems like they are actually on their game with updates and etc just wanna know your motivation hi i almost finished watching this video and that was crazy i have a question why when like last 5 or 6 rounds you beat him every time yet he got no health decreased pudge is the highest hp hero in the game he is a great hero in the rounds after 50 what makes it so the attack is repelled and the player doesnt lose life just another last game of today this was fucking awesome jeff did you know that techies mine is physical damage which matters with armor lose you passed so many razors and cms they definitely need a proper win screen felt so anticlimactic winning the first time and basically just getting kicked that final headtohead match was nervewracking really thought a doom 3 upgrade would be the one to close out the game i was also hoping to finally see roshan on round 50 but apparently theres no roshan in underlords yet hehe wow what a match what a rollercoaster of emotions this is amazing chess rush is the best one in his kind i cant say more marina tho 1326 how did the natures profit magically level up to 2 when he did not have other copies to make this happen underlords or auto chess i have beaten u once if that was a legit molt name anyway ggwp make guides please i want to improve she is mirana ffs not marina i got auto chess ad you definitely misunderstood the global aura regarding the healing reduction try the druid savage build it is the first combo i build then troll warlock build defeat me please help to improve it enchantress prophet trent lone tusk lycan pudge doomkunka last 2 necro and nevermore ps dont get nevermore if you have doom you seem like a pretty cool dude you got a new sub in youtube and twitch ps im ranked big boss iv right now and i had never seen the divine rapier omegalul ah you find a none payable game knight and hunter is the bestt is it pvp competitive chess what is the world coming to i cant even win a tutorial in this game is it that hard or im just a noob i cant wait for the next video dota underlords love this game so much molt try teamfight tactics from league of legends to see what you think about it im liking it a lot 3215 was so much damage due to their dragon knight 2 insane damage with dragon buff just play league of legends teamfight tactics it will get you views try the knight mage strategy its very strong right now play underlord pleasee marina shivers and whats that origins game you talking about this game on steam or what a little tip unlike in the original autochess interest works a little different here it adds up with the gold you started the round with example is when you have 39 gold in the beginning of the round and sold a unit while the fight is going to make it to 40 gold the interest you gain is still 3 gold just a little reminder since that was also mistake by me when i started playing this how can u get full heartless the heartless hero is only 5 right now did u need to get 6 six hero heartless to get that max but is only 5 dude ftw am i missing somethign dont put ur players so far back either xd not dota player playing underlords auto chess vs dota underlords i like the item selection of this game and other aspects like the winloss streak fire but i still prefer auto chess for some reason idk why really enjoying the auto chess matches i just got my first 100 life win in auto chess all cause of you molt thanks you for your uploads in auto chess and all your other games i watch them all btw i won with gob mech beast warlock once i got to level 9 and had all 4 of those boosts it was hilarious to watch my opponents melt before my eyes thanks for the videos you inspired me to make my own channel finally and i just love these new genre im also going to try this build out maybe ill get lucky keep crushing molt molt you from my side of the woods lol this guy always giving a positive vibe keep it up molt good job why is this game so popular and legion td2 not feel ashamed xd are you still going to play origins this game feels like a ripoff but with more realistic graphics heartless reduce only 20 armor of the allies and there are some difficult heartless to get and also to upgrade the tier 45 are quite difficult to upgrade warriors and knights are much better warriors give your warriors 25 armor at 9 warrior units i know its more difficult but 6 warriors is enough after that going for one of the species that your warriors have example sladar have scaled which fits with medusa that gives all of your allies 30magic resistance with that effect you dont need to worry much about magic damage so you dont have to get those magic resistant items in this match you were lucky to get fall from grace which counts human as heartless without it its impossible to get 6 heartless because there is only 5 heartless in the game i dont know if you know about this but you gain 1 more gold if you have 10 gold each the limit of gaining extra gold from saving up is 5 so in early games you should save up to 50 gold by the way nice game i am already i got 2800 trophies from 2200 to 5000 trophies in clash royale im using a deck that i havent seen before i used the same deck the whole time i have never seen somone else using my deck and it only tokk me like 1 month and i dont play that mutch if somone want to know whats in my deck just ask and ill tell why did you quit brawl stars thats my favorite game you played there are 5 extra units in this game so making 3 stars is harder other than that early game is all about your front line late game is all about your back line in my rating it always come down to who has the better carry with the better items game is not as balanced as dac some synergies are so bad huntersmages broke af right now how much blow does this guy do before he starts recording molt you should play ballonbattle again btw im getting abit confused when ur explaning things based on another game that i dont know off have no interest off man so tired so worth to wait i prefer watching underlords instead of origins if there is a learning curve for you it makes the videos a bit more entertaining molt i want to learn this game please make a guide on dota underlords origins please i think the dragon knight is counted as heartless all the timejust replace necro plz love the vid can u and nick play brawl stars hey i dont know if you already know this or not but try saving 10 gold so that u have an extra gold for the next round if u have 10 gold by the end of the round youll get 1 gold interests and if u have 20 then itll be 2 gold interests and so on the maximum is on 5 interests which is at 50 gold coins getting 60 coins wont make it to 6 gold interests tho what about full inventor at minute 7 you stated that there are things in both games that are good i am sticking with the game i know best auto chess origin just asking whenwill you play brawl stars i really enjoyed when you played brawl stars hey molt i think u need to try arc warden strategy basically its arc warden at least 1 cm maybe 2 good elementals with it as tiny enigma razor which can help with 3 mages bonus good tanks and maybe couple warlocks to mix things up keep up a good work p s personally i like underlords more than vanilla autochess waiting for devs to add new heroes tho he says marina instead of mirana aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i will follow the upload video you post and im sure you will get use to it keep it up molt i could be wrong but i think that buff only applies to actual heartless the humans that count as heartless for the synergies do not contribute to the removal of healing but that would still mean that once you put the necromancer in you then reached 100 heal cancel try bandit executioner tornado hog log lumber jack skarmy electro wiz auto chess is little bit more easy to see the characters when playing on mobile android i cant see the names of the other players instead of the name there are just 3 dots like this does someone know how to fix the lag in the mobile version i dont understand underlords so i want more origins u picked cloak over embarrassment of riches oh wow i didnt know its available on mobile i just deleted auto chess and switch to this game im a dota 2 player and molt playing this is so awesome i dont even understand no matter how good of a roster i have im always getting stomped on late game by the most weirdest combination of alliances so far the only thing that has worked for me was humans knights and mages with the chivalry global item i like the game but its just frustrating when youre trying to build something specific and the game just refuses to give you what youre looking for dragon night was a human meaning that he counted as heartless hurt my eyes when u didnt see that i thought the title meant you stomped without showing mercy hence heartless victory xd i sub to your channel molt add me as a friend in steam so we can play data underworlds together the beta version is in android i like dota underlords more then auto chess its okay molt youre doing fine bro edit woah youre insane bravo full heartless is so nice so happy to see you love this gameits the best anyone miss molt playing bloons td battles like if you agree it seems like you really dont understand this game i prefer dota underlords than auto chess simple question which one is much better auto chess or this when is coming to mobile anybody know not sure why everyone hates this i like this version a little better try arc warden cm strat if u can d i thought it was auto chess video bad copy of autochess ranked is there a ranked normal game difference wheres the button whatever you like most but i think that dota underlords is better this is more fun to watch instead of auto chess mobile in my opinion can you make combo lists for auto chess pleasee i really need it hi molt been playing autochess and i rolled an ashes hell knight cost was 15 is there an update this game got me watching your videos again as i kinda lost interest in clash royal always go with the additional item choice and 1 rank higher item if those shows up on the reward items here is way more important than auto chess or an original version teamfight tactics league of legends who else is here this late like if u are too keep the double uploads cominggreat work and cant wait for the next auto chess upload to be perfectly honest i enjoy underlords a lot more than auto c chess mobile because it is just so much cleaner in terms of ui graphics and even just grammar i just find auto chess mobile quite annoying molt u doing great this game but i have 1 tip for u the interest point in this game was different from auto chess in underlord once u start the round fighting the interest point lock in for example if u have 29 gold u can buy all heroes on the shop after the round start fighting and if u win the round u will get interest 3 as i know 291 30 it doesnt matter how gold spare u have after buy all of the heroes u still got 3 interest but its a gamble if u win the round u got 3 interest if u lose the round u get interest 2 because its lock in 29 gold i hope u understand sorry for my bad english auto chess is for me underlords is so much more fun to watch compared to auto chess it would be cool if there was like a clash auto chess please more underlords love your videos molt i like the the other one better molt i am moving from autochess to underlords its good to have the hero names back as it should be and much better graphics and animation good video has always molt im from portugal madeira island and i watch your videos since the clash royale beta always here supporting you btw i prefer dota underlords than auto chess i installed it and i cant stop playing it would like to add you in the game and maybe someday play a match with you keep up the good work molt support from portugal i miss when u play battlelands molt love these vids man keep it up also just my two cents i like autochess better than dota the one i like more is the one u prefer more plz more i want more more auto chess please in my opinion auto chess is better auto chess broooo are you talking about the guy from the last comment section that was being a jerk can you exlpain to me how to download it on pc rn just play the exact dota2 just upload auto chess its 20 times better like so molt can see can you please play btd or brawl stars please grapes why do i have 1389 subscribers from grapes who else clicked fast af hello first viewer first first i want this game back me fails to see the problem gg that infinite copy and it was at this moment they decided to nerf the heck out of aw lol now this shit reminds me of star wars when chewbacca was playing something on the table heal heal heal and heal indonesia fck that is great rip arc warden nerf lol os frogg lool arc warden 3 star is so fukin oppppppppp thats hilarious lol and then you have full shaman and primordial synergy so all who opposes your arc army gets chickenified or disarmed is one of the lowest tanks why am i always winning great question p im happy to say that this is not clickbait all the focus on the arc warden combo for this vid but the kunka and doom roll on round 13 is whats making the difference in this match such huge rolls right there two top tier tanks that can easily protect the backline with an upgraded tiny to boot nuts luck to be honest haha we need earthshaker for echo slam d wow long time not see you ab was a bit skeptical about the thumbnail but its true 23 aw in the end lul arc warden starts at 3310 i love you admiral ur the best 3 reported how come your game is so smooth mine was so lag you gave me some good laughs liked and subscribed your voice reminds me of the guy from preach gaming channel very similar voice and attitude 19 3 star is the world record confirmed why are all your opponents named megacuck seems like a rigged game arc wardans of hell the hardest part is getting the refresher orb i hate how he says help in any video no matter what holy shit miracle and you both have cancer arc lol zet is a real deal hahaha thats broken af it just works seriously the stars came together i collected the same heroes and the refresher orb the enemies just did not have a chance thats an entire army hahaha dont know if its asnwered interest applys at the round start not the end of a round so you can after fighitng has started but before that round is over spend as much as you want and still get the interest you wouldve gotten before the start of the fight i think the logic is since you cant change a fight that has already started it not a big deal if you keep what interest you wouldve gotten that turn wow no clickbait oh shit that thumbnail wasnt clickbait boi that arc warden is broken f for bounty hunter for thinking he could take on arc warden in the final round this is so broken what the hell hahahha i thought the thumbnail was photoshopped111 o oh my god wow he found a game he is actually good at for this to happen everything has to go right and the enemy seemed like shit anyway this is gold kotols food its a broke shit dude 35 dmg last round oo bulldogs laws of arc warden fission i feel sory for the 2nd pos guy i love thumbnail sweet victory well played icefrog i have to play tft this week because i lost my phone and i cant play underlords your just lucky no ones running a good assassin team co that is so fucking broken lol its a raid xd does he understand interest now lol i just starter watching rn and havent looked through comments yet xd anyways interest is when lets say you have 10gold you get 1 interest every 10gold like if you had 20 gold you would get 2 interest and get 2 coins 1 interest 1 gold if you unlucky forgot about this game did the same thing at start i like it like god damn its like cancer when u win u get 1 gold instantly so u can buy any unit 1 gold off so dont sell for buy unless u lose cooldown 60s in this patch bulldog how many clones can you make arc warden yes monkagiga nothing new here gaben i got arc wardened earlier today and got 32dmg from it i guess the only way to beat this is hunter with 2 medu 2 and moonshade i thought that was click bait but holy shit it happened i thought the thumbnail is an edited clickbait and here i thought the thumbnail was photoshopped the second i saw your video thumbnail i thought it was edited then i watched the video and i realized it wasnt ah shit here we go again guys can anyone help find song 910 in this video please i need it thank u i really dont understand this game another clickbait not infinite naruto looks so strange in this game another one and another one and another one like for no clickbait wow like a cheat wtf is this lancer bulldog pick arc warden sunddenly the games broke icefrog pls fix it hahahaha pepega i thought the video cover was photoshopped i was wrong holy shit that thumbnail wasnt clickbait i really thought the thumbnail was a clickbait hahaha click on random time stamp in video hear oh hunter fren seriously the dota underlords is so unbalanced it looks like it was made in 1 day wo any testing at all you can feel they rushed it so hard because they wanted to launch before riot does with their game my 1st hero antimage and then later in round 30 my antimage still 1 star love it when the title isnt clickbait after 2 months in development here in valve we hope you can fulfill your expectactions with this new and totally balanced game enjoy video starts 3128 you would loose to either of these 1 lvl 3 slark with mom this is the most ridiculous thing ive seen so far in the game it destroyed my 6 scrappy medusa tide enigma giro all my units were lvl 3 timber and techies had blademails medusa had deadalus alchemist had radiance enigma had refresher and tide had assault cuirass well the slark also had some lvl 1 warlocks around him the guy with the slark had only 7 units on the board while i had 10 and all of them were lvl 3 it took him a while to take my underlord from 100 hp to 0 i tried repositioning everyone and swapping items nothing helped 2 lvl 3 medusa with divine rapier warlock synergy i got that once and the game ended very quickly 3 strats built around kolt basically they wipe whole board before anyone is able to do anything unless you have 4 scalesaka naga and pipe or 4 scales 6 scrappyaka goblin i can feel the new patch of mana reduce 23 arc wardens 3330 and onwards lmao 23 arcwardens were at the end for your pleasantly arcwarden hei how many clones i should make admiralbulldog yess my friends have been doing the arc warden build too it seems very op right now this is insane what a way to end the game balance in all things 3129 i was quite sad that you didnt picked the shaman buff but still refresher makes more sense wtf rape yeah the worse is that each arc warden counts for the damage its disgustingly good its on 3259 noobs no need to thank me assholes and now people will pick cm and arc warden only 3313 at this moment bounty hunter knew he fked up full of 3 star arc warden lol 3330 is what u guys r lookin 4 pepega what the fuck d that last fight was glorious does it increase battlepass lvl 6 mage lineup easily counter this meta so easily other line ups not so easy lich king and keeper of the light what are you finally bulldog has reached cancer level shadow clone jutsu what the fuck actually not clickbait omaigad thats so many arc warden lol thx to this i uninstall it until beta closed owo i love that even osfrog did nothing on this game everyone still blame him thumbnail not exaggerating 2812 nobody puts maiden in the corner the most balanced fucking hero in game gaben clap you know hunters are op when it takes an infinitely selfduplicating 3 star rare with a refresher to beat them nothing wrong here and here comes the removal of arc warden earthshaker required oh shit this vids just gave me a flashback to the old times when arc clone can carry rapier it still haunts me to this day 10v9 player reaction seeing 10v9 but still lost in the end httpsgiphycomgifsareyouseriousinsaneni4cpi0uukd6u wtf is making that yo sound 3310 for those who want to see how osfrog rape someone in autochess he said it boys 2910 cmonbruh 100 balanced hero imagine when they add io and there is 2 3star arc on the field lul question for more experienced players cant arc warden be countered by the likes of enigma lich and razor after this vdeo icefrog will fix that i think omegalul thanos balance as it should be thumbnail is not an actuall clickbait poggers lose bettors sobayed valve ok tnx bulldog ill fix this remove arc in underlord so your chat claiming there not weebs why did they use the emotes then last round for cratz omega monkagiga ive never seen that strat played 20 hours in underlord havent even seen arc warden being used but bulldog just unlocked the most broken strat team razer how many sponsers he have now loda how is that balance lol the game is brokenvalve gonna fix this soon ahahahahahah omg actually broken 35 dmg on the last round monkagiga sad that he got ot at the last round fill half of the board with 3 star heroes nothing wrong here this looks fun d admiralbulldog i only have 10 hero spots arc warden yes not broken btw by pure luck against this in last 3 i managed to defeat this with last ditch or whatever its called and ultimately came first one of those how did this ever make it in the game things if you have access to the engine source you can model these games with billions of different combos and see whats plainly broken last round the second guy took 35 damage which is more than one third health bulldog is the kind of streamer who will rate his units 4 jesus i thought it was a fucking jebait but it was true all along that what they call checkmate the entire chess board covered and it wasnt even 1010 osfrog henrik stop weirdchamp actually omegaossfrog gaben clap boat choo choo bulldog 2019 1608 arc warden bunshin no jutsu nothing weird here just

if you would like to support me in my passion to bring a brighter and more informative videos on auto chess to our viewers across the wo well played imo youre bland and too clever while other streamers have more followers cause theyre fun and shallow which most people are learned a lot from this vid thanks underlords became harder when it became fairer i kept on ranking down dont really get videos on how to increase mmr hi can i ask why you buying hero before round end wasting interest any tips i dont know why but you make me smile with your positivity thank you 3418 3435 you are so smart holy shit u were really unlucky but u can utilize every chance so smart i like your vid its very chill and how you explain your decision making thought process subbed nice keep up the quality content man big boss v isnt actually the highest rank its the lord of white spire check the underlords reddit page how ironic matt you didnt saw trollwarlord on your rolls even once lol that was a stretch grats matt can you show when u ranked up to lord can you even lose rank in underlords i got to boss without losing any congrat u are the best autochess player ive seen on utube so far how many bb5 are there high five can anyone tell me why im playing vs big boss while im only smuggler iv this game is mattjestic super fucking pog matt was on the edge of my seat watching this congrats on bb5 and hope you do more underlords content congrats was curious on round 9 945 you didnt give any attention to tb in the shop would you consider running him over wd as the 7th for a bit seems solid with the dh bonus progression in underlords is brutal ill stick to my mobile dac until they reconsider balancing it lol congrats matt congratulations still ur 5 to go heroes i just started playing and i heard warriors arent that great late game is there some way to actually get decent rolls on heros i never ever ever get shit what does it mean to see something lockable why would you choose these 5 only if there isnt anything lockable gloves of haste is actually slightly better on tusk than on tiny i would pick swim in a vaccuum great im loving these guide videos great guides thanks for sharing wheres the artifact content pepega are goblins like bounty hunter not an option anymore to dominate the early game it would be nice to have a top 5 of overall heroes in a vaccum heroes that you can always pick for great value regardless of comp like cm kunkka or techies so every best hero is a 1 cost how come no higher cost which there is more variety are on this list all i really hear from this video is buy every warlock and ogre magi you see yo tft when love blood seeker early game wow such a great video straight to the point and very comprehensive you helping out so many new players like

below prizes will be given to the winners httpsdiscordappcominvitessuhytd he is rooting for matumbaman but his team is having a hard time in the qualifiers so many mistakes dude spending your gold way way way to fast your set up on the board is also pretty week and go simple on the allience allow your build up to slowly build great channel btw she is not naga she is medusa lol nice video bro thx i kinda hope they let you walk around the board as a character later its a small thing but i kinda liked it and even the league one lets you do it quill the videos are in the playlist twice this game is looking good i think its better if the tiles is hexagonal the new look sucks how to install this on android or is it not yet released on android oh thank god the clunkiness of the auto chess mod stressed me out really hard this seems so much more sleek league of legends is also making an autochess game one of my problem with this new version is that the battle is mostly too short you rarely enjoy the feeling of am i going to win nah wait a minute yay youre the weiner curse you quill i was off the dota chess dude now i gotta go back in how to download bro i want star wars auto chess damnit this game looks horrible valve can only make mods and games based on mods so ha ha ha half life 3 ive never made it through a full autochess video but i just watched this whole thing in one go definitely a much better impression than autochess gives wouldnt complain if this one returned so trash drodo already make one similar the battles seem quite fast the 2 second warrior item is busted in these conditions i meanfluid but i hate how fucking mobile it is like why is there a giant circle at the topleft covering 13 of the battle screen just to show you your profile silhouette level and health the same info thats literally not 2 inches to the left of it i think auto chess mobile good your the weenir thanks for the preview i agree it looks like itll make the dota mod obsolete the ui is probably great on a tablet and it is well designed giving me the 50 degree fov feeling though that claustrophobia like nervousness not gonna lie i really didnt care for auto chess but you are making me want to play this game or at least watch some more vids of you playing it p it really really really looks fun do i have to have dota 2 installed ie playing from inside the dota 2 game or is it a stand alone game separately from dota 2 it will be meta to lose every round when will this come to android the artifact team must be weeping looks the worst out of all auto chesses im liking this concept it seems that u not really good in chessdoodtoo many sloupock momentsu need more practice you got the passive to treat humans as heartless but in the buy screen a human didnt show that it would count as a heartless i hope they fix that cmon put the damage on units that attack faster looking at the medusa or windranger that said refresher orb did work my big gripe with this is the ui it reeks of mobile and suffers from in on pc valve evidently not making the same mistakes as blizzard did with dota tbh i dont like how this looks style wise looks super mobile style which i hate man this feels so smooth well done by valve autochess is just like another form of warcraft 3s holy war or legion td looks lovely will definitely switch from drodos app this looks great d from the looks the assassins insta jumping like everywhere makes it seem like they move to back lines fasterwhich might be why quill was getting so wrecked just a guess oh sweet if its stand alone then i can uninstall dota 2 then thanks valve d so basically squadtd but not as cool imo excited for this game to go open beta stop and think about a touch screen laptop itd probably be really nice and slick for that too also is it just me or does the omniknight look like mark hamill where do i find the game looks great need more balancing update tho wow this looks like garbage compared to the original at least ui and visually speaking its obviously designed for phones primarily oh man this looks good and im actually understanding whats going on too would love to see more of this from you quill just looked really fun to see you play only thing i would recommend they do is make an option in the menus to have mobile or pc graphics the graphics are bad the ui and everything is amazing but the graphics man just bad holy crap this looks clean love it hopefully it has ranked play etc do more of this game it looks awesome offline pls reply after rewatching at 025 you didnt click anywhere near the second dagon must be a bug the mod imo has more personality somehow tho this seems like a big improvement i dont know the original mod seems way more visually appealing than this version this one looks too much like a cartoonish mobile game imo i know it is a mobile game but they shouldnt make it look so on pc although the ui upgrades are great its way easier to see whats happening i especially like how are the synergies shown really looking forward to when this goes open beta it appears that the interest for that round is calculated when the battle starts so if you sell during the battle you dont gain the interest that you would in the original auto chess we have a lol version too i cant wait for blizzard to make heros of the chess board i tried getting into autochess but its usage of keybindings and such for simple mouse based actions turned me off i typically like to play just mouse based games cause of an injury in my shoulder so this intrigues me given its entirely mouse driven that being said i dont see how this genreidea has enough legs to sustain two or three different games tearing at the same player base though could very well be a good idea that gets devoured from too many people trying to eat the pie first the english autotranslate captions gave me a good laugh thank you for all the advice good game to keep your brain exercising swim with the latest changes to losing streak where it caps only at 2 gold is it still worth going on lose streaks or is it better to try and get a win streak here and there and preserve some health to push mid game a bit farther before having to dip below 50 and rolling hard to stay in the game everytime i watch your videos i have to take a fat shit your content is great is it possible to force the line up you want to build 225 how do you do that wavy eyebrows thank you you talked about out a lot how many out you should stop rolling thank you this is useful why there are only japanese subtitles is it a joke thumb down for this fck u add subtitles in english please brazil needs your tutorials my friend 3 nice guide but lets assume i am on a lose streak and i wanna keep it to max out my interest asap right by round 17 im level seven with 50 gold now my hp got to a critical state like 30 ish on the other hand there some tard sitting on top 1 with his pic on flames with 100 hp and 50 gold now even worse you cant fit 2 good alliances at level 7 right so you tryna keep leveling atleast to lvl 8 you find yourself level 8 or 9 with 12 hp now i know what you thinkin its now or never boom 0 gold you spent all on the shop the bad case you didnt change much by wasting 60 gold and probably gonna be killed next round or you wasnt fast enough to waste 60 gold between the rounds due to your hesitation if to buy it or not to the good case you start to reroll and actually get stuff after stuff and massivelly upgrade which allows you to make a comeback also in that case there is a chance you upgraded your army ultimately but still you cant win that 1 brat even tho the upgrade i might be done with underlords it seems that only a quarter of the tags are interesting and going for other tags so youre not drafting the mostdrafted guys leaves you with weenies im tired of playing warriorhunterheartlesssavage and meandering into demon because you can hardly avoid it or trying something else and losing the weaker lesspopular tags should give you some options but they seem to be completely useless amazing content i understand the game much more thanks to you thank you these are really didactic and comprehensive guides can you link your tierlists in the description please the day9 of auto chess man i dont comment often on youtube videos but now i just have too i started to play this game quite recently and was looking for guidance youtube helped me to find your channel and its super informative so far thanks for your efforts keep going dude please you got to stop picking your nose and face while on camera the content is amazing but i cant watch your face gets so red this is another good video keep the quality content coming he didnt touch his hair this video cool insights one thing im still wondering about i often sit at 34 lowtier heroes at late mid and early late game who are relatively close to 3 stars at least two 2star ones of each my intuition tells me that aggressively rolling as long as you stay above 50 gold is the way to go then especially since the chances decrease while the level rises however i often times end up not getting anything or ending up hurting myself hero 1 finally appears but i have to throw hero 2 out to get it in so i throw the one away who is the furthest away and the hero i just threw out turns up in the next one so i end up not really achieving anything and sit at being close to it while my health drains and drains this happens fairly often recently should i just give up some heroes completely and switch to a 45 tier one or what is the strategy here patience isnt really an option when you are losing 10 health each round use some donations to fix that hair great content all around always great content this was the best so far really enjoyed the roll value analysis i honestly feel like its almost always id say around 85 of the time a better idea to go for lose streaks rather than win streaks in the early game lose streaking is far more consistent because you can always guarantee youll lose but you can never guarantee youll win and especially in the early game its incredibly easy for a really good board position to turn to a really bad one if you dont get any good rolls for 23 turns and the other players manage to complete multiple 2 units in that time not only that but to win streak you need to be constantly spending gold on upgrades almost every turn if you want to maintain a winning board whereas when youre lose streaking you can go multiple turns without spending any gold at all by lose streaking instead you essentially trade off 40ish hp for the guarantee that youll be able to hit 5 interest very early potentially even earlier than people win streaking depending on how much gold they need to spend to keep up their streak i was lucky to get brawny huff and warriors dont die early so i get 4 brawny and 6 warriors i got the 2 buff savage also forgot humans be heartless i won as level 8 against level 10s but to be honest i got 4 3 stars swim is the pool shared like in auto chess sometimes it just doesnt feel like it does great guide when doing a composition guide could you add a section how to identify we are going for this comp dude your content is so great quick question where do you get your outro song from its really relaxing hey swim when are you planning on getting new glasses i got a new pair last week in preparation of switching schools next semester this is it so much auto chess content is just chatter over gameplay glad to finally find someone breakdown the structure of the game thanks for the awesome guide swim do you consider the boards your opponent is building in order to determine the effectiveness of rerolling in the late game since hero pools are shared is the possibility that opponents are looking for the same outs as you a considerable factor in making a decision whether to play for the short term roll yourself you should make videos for tft as well like hearing ur thought process through the games this guy needs to get more out abaddon is a female moltie try not to snort like 20 lines before you fire up a stream this boy is crazy lol

overlapping edit im a sniperforgetting idiot hey matt not sure if youll read this but i found a very helpful tactic when going for losing streak if you win round 1 and then sell down you can start collecting interest on round 2 all though you miss out on one free roll this more than pays for it self as you can often get to 2030 1 or 2 two rounds earlier and if you lose round 1 trying you lose streak anyway so no big deal im new in underlords i dont understand can anyone tell me why he didnt put any hero at the beginning round 50 epic game 645000 damage dealt 24 in the world leaderboard

informative videos on aut how do you play this updated underlords mattjestic when you check for other players units please do it with the tab feature so we can pause and see all boards at the same time i appreciate it in advance thanks for your videos can we go 4 star hehe nice game may i ask why you did not decide to go for a level 3 naga pick up the techies and not place pudge in the front and have all unit place one line backwards so pudge hooks fire while before the fight and is a 3 star alliances better than the 2 star legendaries comp and would it be better if u went blink dagger early game instead of troll buffs go for blink then give it to legendaries or even axe late game to blink and silences enemies even a pro in any aspects of life could make a worse call than an amateur once in awhile but the long run is all that matters matt is still the best of all these chess game your position is to suck use ur 3rd star to tank them then follow up with 2 star i dont know what you think if u dont have that beastmaster u will lose easily play to much but ur iq drop to 20 taik kambing punya player ketawa memanjang pelaq woiimprove ur iq bro dont be so moron shit to slow lu anjing you can get 1 more unit and double vicious intent damn thats scary af dagon on the brawny to stack kills would be so nice matt mattjestic i love your channel and i love your content but personally it gets annoying when you repeat words too much even your subfollow alerts say welcome welcome its part of your charm so im not saying never say welcome welcome but maybe tone it back a bit 1 unit can have more impact than blood thorn even level 1 tide wth naga main tank in front of everything i dont get those ppl saying you made a lot of mistakes maan this was insane epic game gg man im learning a lot from you keep it up the good content greetings from brazil hope to find you in a game anytime soon peace round 45 you should have picked desperate measures since it give you more attack damage and faster mana gain making u ult faster then the enemy dagon late game is bad because of how long it takes to kill enemies and also most of the tanks wont die fast from it also round 50 the crit on troll is insane also dagon should be on the tanks not on squishys since they survive longee late game for the cast to go off quick question why not take the roster spot when ya was evenly matched just won maybe my hardest game double brawny buff is op but i couldnt beat my 9 ninjas triple dragons expanded roster and desperate measures for the win so many mistakes could barely watch rounds 45 50 was pretty cool to see the last creep mob tho just came here to see roshan u had retaliate but slardar was backline any reason is that hard to pronunciate r correctly 1 unit lich or cm would have won undead helped with all your physical dmg you had heal nerf cm let him cast faster 5545 the game help him picking the best item for him lol he deserves to lose because the brain dmg play picking the unbalanced tier 5 item for dagon just its like hearthstone good game but it all comes down to your luck is he going to play autochess i love how he hyped the shit out of 9 warriors and then proceeded to get absolutely shit on god this game looks like shit sooooooooooo boring make more auto chess vids isnt this going to tencent now which ac do you think is going to be better me backseat gaming stop throwing away tws artifact failed so they jump ship dd so you dont do nothing just watch ehh another point and click game just play auto chess mobile looks like another failure like artifact this game is pretty fun when will we be able to play it such a boring game modeseriouslytoo stressful to really come up with great optimized builds thanks to constantly being under time constraintsand not interesting enoughtoo long for a quick session i like autochess but the whole 40 minutes per game is why i left lots of other competitive games hey do items stay on pieces after they go up tiers ive finished watching the video 5 minutes ago and im still upset about 2 star troll warlord just imagine the potential with the last crit item and 3 star trump i dont have any carry doom am i a joke to you damn he is so uggly this game is lame i want dota 1 back with 6 blade mails on axe like a real man id love to play this but i have no idea how to win and the turns go by so quickly i have no clue what to do he said puck and i thought i heard something else o o i wanted that level 3 tide hunter lol it would be cool if you can use your skins in dota2 to underlords is autochess worth picking up this is such a blatant clonehow is this legal who is excited fro team fight tactics i hope there will be the retired dominion map d i put so much time into dota 2 from beta to 2 years ago the memoroes wow am i the only one who finds this a super lazy copy i thought they would atleast come up withs ome own idea but it really is exactly the same thing as the mod just a bit better looking and with an item choice after every fight you suck at stomping you shouldve went for 9warriors wtide or lich but you keep switching between them wasting rounds then went with both losing your synergy and more rounds those lost rounds couldve gotten you multiple 3 stars instead of nonsynergy 2star legendary which is garbage is there any way of playing this right now dota underlords so would that be considered dota peasants why are they malking it for mobile i mean why someone would ever play a game for 40 minutes nonstop on their phones lol what on earth was he doing at the end lol i got this perfect synergy going lets destroy it for random lvl 5 units am i the only one that thinks this looks awful compared to the auto chess mod played auto chess a ton started underlords yesterday couldnt stop opened auto chess back and it felt weird underlords is really good at thinking of the player perspective all these neat additions make it better for me thank you for giving me tips and making me want to play the gameyou are teaching me a lot with just this video love the auto chess ad while watching this vid lol wow this actually looks terrible the auto chess from playstore right now is so addicted that i just realized that i stop playing hearthstone for a while i dont like the pc version of it but damn the app version is so insaneits free to play and rng based strategy gamei hope the upcoming valve and riot will be the same its gonna be nuts how are all these different games allowed to exactly rip each other off loving the item changes much more fun and fair the way interest is changed though is lame this looks really bad and being optimal did not work for presentation but i take that is the game horrible ui and weird timing for interests and decision rerolling etc love the unique item system cant wait for release guys just want to ask why my setting is not like the one i am watching on other players my buy hero menu is different and i cannot see the full screen during battle any tips or setting i missed thank you in advance anyway nice video sir looks like its improved on a few things over the moddefinitely gonna look out for the release looks horrible both with ui and ingame compared to the autochess mod the ui is far to big for my taste tbh ive never seen a final fight like that i preferred the design of the original auto chess but this does have several quality of life improvements the item system is way better for one thing but theres already an auto chess for mobile first there was warcraft orcs and humans then there was warcraft 2 tides of darkness then warcraft 3 reign of chaosfrozen throne after that the universe of warcraft divided into defense of the ancients and a mmorpg world of warcraft world of warcraft eventually got a reboot in card version hearthstone defense of the ancients got a remake and got called defense of the ancients 2 after that some unknown group of enthusiasts created a very addictive board game based on the heroes of dota 2 now valve company that created dota 2 is stealing their idea and turning it into a standalone game i expect that in 20 years there will be no trace of the original game left and nobody will remember where it all began but they will still produce more and more new games based on that universe where are the couriers it feels worst than the original oh yeah definitely a good choice to encourage rolling while the fight is happening i mean who wants to actually watch the game this feels hollow i think part of the appeal of the original is that you can physcially see everyone else why not jugg over bm in the early rounds you could have had orc and warrior bonus would have won you round 9 valve steal mods instead of making games thats so valve of them to do whats riot doing is juggernaut not a warrior here this somehow looks uglier than the custom game was it that hard to just copy and paste the original dota models this looks fugly now i understand this was made so that the mobile port would be easier but come on treat the pc players better youre too busy to talk always late to put items to your pion i really dont know whats going on exactly but this game seems like literaly everything i have ever wanted we are all still waitting for darkest dungeon mobile game lol that aint it chief how does valves autochess look worse than the fan made autochess this shit goes by way too fast to learn much as someone who has never played an auto chess game how did this end up being a shitty version of auto chess starcraft auto chess be like gimme someth gimme someth bzooom gimme something to shoot this game is for mobile or pc to all complaining to the graphics heres the reason simple mobile focus and not storage consuming they are focusing on smoothing out in mechanics and bugs there are room to update the graphics lets wait they are prioritizing mobile right now but im sure they will update the pc ui version i am never playing mobile auto chest i was 4 warrior 3 druid by turn 15 w 4 2 star pieces and spam texts accidentally made me click on them closing out my game i have 2 people as my contacts i cant imagine how an extrovert would play i actually dont know what the 9th warrior is is currently getting hit by a kunkka ship tfw mobile port i wish wed get a proper pc version yo can you so another vid on it i loved this video and its way easier to watch than auto chess plus with tf tactics coming id like to see some actually watchable auto chess gameplay in order to wait for it to be released trump keeps talking about how good magic resist will beagainst the line up that does mainly pure damage oh look another game that valve will abandon pretty much immediately is auto chess the new battle royale that ui looks horrible really enjoyed this please play more autochess in regards to your first comment i dont think valve is seeking to rival dota auto chess i think they actually collaborated with them to create underworlds why would you play this instead of regular autochess eargh mobile autochess has a better looking interface and character models though i expected better graphics for some reason i like autochess more xd broken af itemsdrop rate the fact you can swap them and the fact a unit can only keep one shitty race names feels like playing alone due to the confined board as the drodo mobile version i mean he literally played the entire earlymid game without even caring about what buildunits the other players were using gg as if the lack of courier and the interest change didnt bring enough of a downgrade in terms of mechanics and skill ceiling in the mobile version they added random non balanced units way more broken rng and proceeded to remove all the last man standing feels from the game 2d units on the bench and you cannot literally see the screen while rerolling the only thing they have going for them is the unit movement rofl i used to play lol and autochess on dota guess it will be the other way around now why is this called autochess this whole autochess phenomenon leaves a sour taste in my mouthespecially with riot coming into the scene drodo as a chinese company is bound by a lot of regulations and they chose to not do business with valve but did not object to valve making its own iteration of the format due to the very limited scope of chinese mobile games this is all well and good but it seems like there is so much business happening that there is no passion in the products being delivered autochess lost its appeal quite quickly for me because they neglected to expandimprove minor frustrations of the game choosing instead to add more characters seemingly without methodology i dont have a lot of faith for any of these games coming out interesting interesting mobile ui and graphics suck can a dota 2 player help what are the 5 heroes you think of when you think dota 2 for lol its probably ryze katarina garen master yi and ashe looks like crap 2d units on bench 2d units on battlefield good job valve looking forward to the riot version i bet they feel stupid putting all that effort into designing artifact creatures should be able to hold more than one item can i get this game a courier is really needed i love trump but i disliked that video it was painful to watch trump made so many poorly decisions ui reminds me of dota 2 beta im sure valve would improve that if the game perform decent trump at the beginning mentioning all the autochess games except the one that recently sponsored him lol dota versus lol ah shit here we go again based on the latest game valve made i bet underlords wont be free to play and you will also need to buy the units with real money instead of ingame currency once it launches whats another warrior im missing literally fights kunka next wave d and valve is going to somehow screw this one too is there a tutorial when you first get this game im following along for the most part but many of the things dont immediately make sense and the timer makes it seem tough to pick up i hope valve are supporting the original makers bc else isnt this just theft it look really cartoony compared to the auto chess in the arcade mode and the one in arcade mode is so much better and appealing riot will win in my opinion its hardly a fight this looks pretty bad valve clearly cant make their own games so heres a small mod of a mod turned into a small game i hope they add the ability to party with friends really want to play with them the ui is way to dull at the moment rather just play auto chess this feels more single player than 8v8 that game look cool but after winning what do you get there goes my losing streak trump when you are on a winning streak lol i mean they thoroughly flopped the card game so might as well cash in with the mod like they always do but this just means more trump auto chess so im not complaining warlock synergy with radiance that lifesteal passive item for warlock literally unkillable i personally really like the graphics and the style of the ui i just wish it was smaller because it makes it feel too much like a mobile gameport dota underlords is ugly graphics are like cartoon and looks shitty valve fucked up another game again original mod version is way much better than this visually speaking this game looks like dogshit very dissapointed by valve looks very poorly optimized for pc what im going to play a 40 minute game on my smol mobile phone wonder if this will ever be a fully fledged pc title or will forever be unplayable trash p id rather see trump playing drodos auto chess beta tbh may as well support the original developers instead of valves lazy cash in sooooo are all autobattler games going to be nasty mobil games with ugly pc ports if that is true league auto chess better be good and not made for mobil because these developers are making this game genre look like a joke of only mobil trash i miss the courier character tho dude they just straight dirty went and ripped off that mod thats fucking scummy okay so dota was originally a warcraft 3 mod and that became dota 2 so they modded dota 2 to make autochess and that became this wild did he buy the battle pass just to play this game without playing dota2 at all assault curryass xd wait riot made an auto chess trump do u like this game more than the one from riot games the mod looks much better and easier to play this looks like a generic garbage mobile game to be honest also why couldnt have they kept the names of the races like orcs instead of brawny another thing ive noticed that you can move items from unit to unit which is nice but one unit cant have more than 1 item at a time which isnt worth it this guy cant play this game is brain is too slow holyyyy crap some of those items are going to be overpowered if they fall into a strategy youre already partiallyfully going for that dragons hoard item if you maintain 50 gold for max interest returns would give each dragon a 50 attack damage boost each dragon 50 thats freaking huge thats not a good thing imo it will suck to lose close well fought games just because the stars aligned for someone that managed to get a strong tier 3 item for a strategy they were already going with try red tides it better auto chess its really exciting to see all these players competing for the largest slice of the pie cant wait to see who ends up on top im honestly hoping league wins out and just dominates the market by taking inspiration from a mod you know for the memes this is boring god i hate this game trump acting above all the other players while making misplays smh waiting on starcraft autochess its hard to believe how fucking braindead trump is at autochess cant watch this retard fest blizzard has lost their way hey look another case in which a huge company decides to ruin something by making it a mobile game awesome cause this is a fucking mobile game lets be serious honestly the ui is very bad compared to the mod as others are saying its clearly aimed for mobile usage the ui is somobile egghh i imagine riots autochess will be better for viewing picking cuirass over moonshard and daedalus benching juggernaut all the early game removing beast bonus over the do nothing slardar this video was painful to watch funny no voice from characters makes it less fun to watch hmm this looks good but the fact that you cant stack units is pretty bad at least a max of 3 items for each unit would be nice valve lets promote our game via influencers kripp that does not play auto chess cuz he is shit with the controls and blames the game trump that is known to do the shittiest plays i have seen in the scene everyone pls more pepega items sound sucky ayyy i missed autochess good to see it again artifact reborn a tip for the future never ever play lvl 1 aoe heroes like shadowfiend or razor alone on the bord without the support of mage bonus or another aoe hero it does so little dmg on lvl 1 and you just charge enemy abilitys faster the player who gets to use his abilitys first has almost everytime the advantage i feel like the old version was better this game is actually fun happy to see valve still being in the business of making games this aint league of legends auto chess its a trash copy of league of legends auto chess love the neutral rounds system rewards seem much more fair the graphics being more cartoonish gives it a vibe of borderlands so it kinda feels okay too wow this looks breathtaking this feels so greasy that riot and valve try to hoover up the next generation of custom game that takes off who needs action when you can roll a dice am i right hearthstone thanks i hate it looks like another generic mobile game now great i miss the dota 2 health bars is this going to be a mobile game ui and graphics look like theres an intention to have a mobile version of it riots one is gonna be way better imo looks like a mobile game pretty disappointed tbh valve are losing their touch the ending battle was amazing this looksbad use your lvl 2 axe and jug not am and lvl 1 beast my eyes cant take it im not sure if i really identify with violent crime so im just assault curious hey trump dagon is prodounced dagon hard a not soft a i know its just a fantasy item in a video game and its correct pronunciation shouldnt mean anything so feel free to ignore this but if you would change your pronunciation i would greatly apreceate it thanks this reminds me how dota separate from war3 deja vu i guess italickappa love this trump 3 great introduction from the only eloquent trump its a shame the ui is all mobiley things like having units on the bench and being able to scroll around to see other peoples boards made the game feel like its own little world now i hardly tell that youre playing online i hope they adjust the ui for pc and not have it be a mobile port regular auto chess is better i want my god damn carrier the quality of life improvements are so good showing you if you have x warriors and x of the same hero already watching trump play this is hard on my cringe this game looks super potato idk what they are thinking sand king has returned pog mirana costs 4 treant back 2 ogre back slark is back furion who that nature prophet various new units 5 cost lich back and old ult ooo i get its in beta but how can you be so garbage at this dota auto chess has been out for literally months now and its not like its a hard game i dont like the toony interface wtf good thing there is no courier though it was pretty annoying in dota autochess i also like the item mechanic but why is every hero only able to carry 1 item instead of 6 also really curious about autochess now that this is online will it split the dota community these new sc2 arcade games are gettin some fancy models love the simplified look normal autochess looked way to complicated to me but this seems very approachable even if theyre literally the same game are you playing this on computer like not on emulator and did you try to increase the resolution because it looks like shit he had assault cuirass on the bench for the last 5 rounds dota devs seem to be under the impression that the people who play the game are little children the ui here and on artifact and the retarded dragons are stupidly childish and unrefined hell yeah another one give us another one are you still using nox emulator or others did trump really buy a battle pass to play this lmao this looks amazing oh my god at least in this video hes allowed to says the phrase auto chess auto chess looks better this looks like some mobile shit which it probably is but whatever they are really milking auto chess dry huh drodo valve and riot what about that shitty chinese mobile dev you promoted theyre in the game too s i know this is beta but damn this needs some polish the toonyness makes me feel like im playing sly cooper but not necessarily in an endearing way wtf is this choose your prize feature what is the defference of auto chess and dota underlords remember the last card game valve came out with where it was 30 bucks to buy and then 2 dollars per game visually this seems like a big downgrade but it seems a lot easier to control than the mod outside of that its mostly the same game as regular dota auto chess which is a little lame im excited for riots take on the genre to enter open beta so we can compare all the major autochess games ui and character design is crappy and the right side display looks too complicated this doesnt look near as good as the original custom map that was painful to watch jesus the good news is that with all these auto chess games coming out we will get a good one and if everything is shit we can just go back to the mod on dota 2 god help us that it isnt teamfight shittics that comes out on top how about trying actual dota man i love trump but hate when they act so pro with this mini game this looks pretty alright i really dont like the bs picking itemspassives whatever the fuck that is at the end of the turn tho i prefer it being random like it is in the original really hope valve are the ones that succeed or anybody else other than the scum piece of shit company riot games cant wait to watch movies and porn in the dota underlords section on twitch id rather support valve than support the crap chinese shills who should out for egs wow artifact looks lit drodo dont you mean epic games heh choose your prize may as well announce a 1mil prize tournament now i dont like that change yowch this ui is very icky lets hope valve actually works on this another disaster from valve after artitrash count me in the ui make me feel like im playing a bad port of a mobile game i hope they change it in the future i cant believe that all those insanely successful games sprouted just from warcraft 3 dota 2 lol smite and later autochess x 3 blizzard really lost a lot of potential money by not recruiting the mod devs and letting them work for valve really close to 3 warriors trump after having juggernaut on his bench almost all game i dont like the interface at all doubt this game will last omg more of this please 3 hi my names niiiiiinnnnnooooo wow brand new game kappa hey you know how we keep saying this isnt an auto chess video lol thats sarcasm stop it what the heck is there even a reason to play auto chess now is that even legal i mean the changes are so minimal and the game looks my cartoony not much difference from the current one lmao prepare the forts to be opened dota underlords beta auto chess fresh from valve rise of shadows hearthstone ahm sorry what didnt know this is now hs lol hearthstone rise of shadows also second comment in the future id love to see a guide on items that shows the best chars to use those items for instance i know mask of madness is pretty decent but who are the best people to carry it etc this is the best of yourbguides in terms of detail what i like is how you explain the early game comps 46 units and what units are applicable at that points i think end game comps are important but learning on what u build on the way to those end game comps matter this is the first of your guides and pretty much the first of all content creators to explain very detailed and i hope that you continue to produce these the quantity and volume is really high and the quality and detail is getting better and better i have to say that the druid assassins combo is very strong like you said i was forced into a lose streak the last game i played and i end up trying out the six assassins to druids and by the end of the game i made it all the way to 2nd place at 24 health by the time round 30 132 winner win by sounds good able to understand the naga and other terminology thats not from underlords with a bit of thought time to give it a try tried it once insta win nice d and early game is more easy with tiny morph druids and 2 other assasins then going streight to lvl 9 is what i usually do tough i might be wrong will try to play without tiny when i get a chanse where is tiny i use him as my 9 unit and tidedusa as my 10th pick ive been using this combo and got like 1 to 3 everytime i saw you using this one on the stream thanks for the indepth video do you mispronounce brooch on purpose great guide but in future guides could you try to use the underlords terminology i didnt play dac and it took some guessing to figure out what beasts elves naga etc are good ty for this channel i actualy found it i hope with eour videos i can grow up from lieutenant 1 to the big boss 5 just had a flawless game with this build great guide this build doesnt work would be easier to follow if you use a calculator comp builder to showcase the passives slark would make a good mom carrier building up damage and attack speed while attacking an enemy unit swim i must say that youre one of the best channels out there your videos are amazingly informative top quality guides and gameplay i learned a lot just from watching your videos specially that one about gold management so a big thank you and keep on with the amazing work excellent guidegot my first win on multiplayerkeep up the good work and good videosstreaming yo swim i was playing six mages plus sf and nicro and then i got a lich so is it better to take off a 2star puck instead of taking off ogre or should i keep ouck coz he deals magic damage keep in my mind i dont have a strong front line thank u wow won 3 games in a row with this didnt play with his hair this clearly is a clone i loved it awesome guide i will try this build right now thanks i noticed every gwent video has been deleted just won my first game finally cause of this thank you great vid you should do one on positioning im on my third day playing this game and after a few tutorials i landed on 6 nights 2 dragon and 2 warlock combo and ive won 5 in a row even at under 30 health mid game transitioning to 6 knights has been so easy this is super informative and high quality nice video great video really helpful information and the whole playing for interest thing helped me so much yo informative content as always keep it up bro the real benefit of the assasins is nobody picks them in the land of knights you can expect 34 3s by the end of the game why not replace the morphling slark is still a good unit overall and maybe even better than morphling if you put a skull basher on slark and he does survive the fight and steal some stats he is an unkillable monster while you can not really spread out with morphling into primordial there is no naga in underlords do you builds take the latest balance changes into accout i found that knight troll is pretty stong rn but i have only like 25 h played so im

liked it back when we had the 5 second death immunity helm was pretty fun having bloodseeker wreck it all as long as it didnt get stunned but now he heals much more on kills aswell havent played since the big update and this meta seems lame af mastermind matt good job i once faced a 3 star bs with pike and about 170 kills at the end he almost lost to mom slark 3 though funny how you mention placing one unit down on round 1 i literally just started seeing ppl do that today and was puzzled by it until i thought about it i feel bad for all the australians dealing with the fires and smoke cheers to you for being such a good sport about the whole ordeal which formation can beat 6 assassins someone help answer pls top build base on how op 1 troll glass canon most speed early game weak mid game average end game unbeatable note kills enemies before they can cast anything 2 demon demon slayer glass canon most damage early game average mid game unbeatable end game weak note most damage possible in game 3 warlock survival most heals early game weak mid game unbeatable late game average note wins game by living longer than any other composition 4 assassin glass canon counter build early game unbeatable mid game average late game weak note wins game by disrupting combos i guess nobody play artifact huhor heroes of the stormdont hear nuthin bout them two nomore yall need to try wild beyondgreat moba is this game freeis this a computer game why is his face superimposed or floating atop of on a video of his body in the background i wouldve sold the witch slayer when u upgraded ur beastmaster to tier 2 so u can get 10 g and collect 1 g interest wtf does he call kunkka was it really the 6 locks or just the the naga racial and tide stun simply let you live long enough to chip a win out i miss the long 30 min hearthstone videos its better than tv there shouldnt be anything that can beat thisgets beat every time i see your thumbnails now i think its an angry joe video holy shit u r boring not the vid the vid r great but u r so boring lol he could have lvl 3 medusa if he wasnt ignored it woooooh content what do youmean it always works for me especially in the lategame i have been so addicted to this game not sure how to download tft so i may never play that one really enjoying these full game highlights its good to watch how your strategies evolved over the course of the match confused why dusa wasnt behind the drow for passive buff they are both gonna compete you mean tactical team fight will have 150k viewers on twitch while dota underlords will have about 5k you call that a competition lol i think it kinda sucks that the lategame rounds last so short like 5 seconds per round where everyone just gets 1shot is just dumb really good game and great video would love to see more underlords content keep it up i dont want to be sitting for over an hour with this game is it possible to stop and start or star with less health love this game and want to learn more from you its a leaver game ffs ppl leave for every little mistake that s the way luck based idiot games work why techies up front they looked to die almost immediately every time in front 2359 did enigma do damage there looks at healing no how can warlock be a tank if hes got 0 armor even the drow ranger has 5 trollwarlock can be pretty amazing aswell crazy sustainability the real unsolved question is how do you exit the match properly without getting the abandon message or we cant yet auto chess is clunky and shit underlords 6 locks is dope as hell early but i fell off hard due to bad rng this video gives me hope haha love the underlords videos but would like to see some rania edits just had a 30 lifesteal from warlocks and a 2star gyro with daedelus insane warlocks would be much better if 1star veno wasnt so bad like it already cool youtuber the one thing i dont like in dota is the visual man the characters look so weird when played in the game i cant understand wth is happening geez how does this look so similar to drodo autochess even the unit designs look similar edit even the pirate captain ship is the same where is skipperino tft seems just better rather watch you play that why dont you consider playing the original drodo auto chess kripp one week earlier enigma sucks kripp this week venomancer sucks what did poor venomancer do to you tho hes great great vid kripp only problem is your watermark in front of your gold count 4x 2 star on round 10 streamer luck lmao damn kripp youre so bad you will get better tho no worries video was great i feel like the whole auto chess genre is pretty fun how the heck can i play this game i cant find it anywhere i like the idea of you trying different starts in undwrlords and seeing how it plays out this tinker guy looks like a shameless ripoff from gazlowe dislike and look at batrider 100 carbon copy from falstad i wonder if blizzard is aware if anything this video just demonstrate how op rangers and shadow fiends are medusa was constantly top damage with no damage item on i really love the game but man the balance is really not here yet even after the hunter alleged nerf full length underlords gameplay good any kind of lol graphics game bad please dont go too much into the lol autochess its horrible to spectate anything in that god awful engine of theirs more full game highlights please super cool more of this please there shouldnt be anything that can beat this nobody can just deflect the emerald splash lol dota underlords board looks like artifact should have been d tcg but with a tactical board like in duelyst p time to stream underlords much more this genre is neat and valve is doing great job improving drodos concept cheers i really like new games on a channel oo i dont get why this is considered the pinnacle of streaming i watched the video in the background and all i heard was the tutururu of the round starting and clashing of swords it was super distracting and confusing compared to hs wonderful sound design and atlas reactor which i was playing keep up content besides hearthstone please very much appreciated and length doesnt matter kripps way too bad at these games holy cant watch these gameplays kinda should focus just a bit more i think in the beginning passing ogre magi was really bad him and warlock are the only ones of their tribe and it would have been really cool to see that its strong btw tft looks so much better in ux wtf is this interface i love you kripp therefore i love these videos please play arena of evolution its a much more fleshed out auto chess on mobile i am used old kripp had 45min vids every day lol i love the new auto chess content on this channel also im a big fan of full game videos keep up the good work c yes we like this length of a video tft better add in damage dealt from units after the rounds it clarifies things and makes it easier for you to adapt without paying immense attention i like underlords a lot but i think they should zoom out a bit from the board or make some effects smaller its so claustrophobic and its hard to see exactly everything that is going on this is the best autochess game how is this dull crap ever fun ill never know you pick your team then watch them fight while you afk just one step away from mobile idle gaming the longer the beter when f2p kunkkaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa read this in tidehunters voice kripp i never say anything on your videos and ive been watching for a long time this new autochess genre is the truth weave it into your weekly video rotations i found out that 6warlock 4savage is pretty nuts here are 3 codes for the game 4arbvj3dqbj627m 4arbvli82xm8wd7 4arcnxlvr0yv96h more chess krippers did enigma do damage there opens healing tab nope yes more please this game must be on androidios son what are you doing im watching kripp getting his ass kicked if you upload autochess genre videos 100 upload the full game to much happens in a game that is important really enjoyed this can this guy play whatever he want without people dislike it thanks for more underlords content kripp im really enjoying those seekin triple screen autochess gameplay krippo maybe quad screen but not a big fan of cartoony autochess from original creators you literally cant lose with a techies 2 and an enigma 2 who has a refresher literally no chance of losing better than riots autochess there is really no reason to be behind their stupid event ticket unless you are really into dota 2 its a nice bonus but there is no damn reason for anyone to pay that cost just to test this like both auto chess vids youre one of my favorite streamersyoutubers so the more content the better has anyone ever brought up how this genre of game is good for streamers its literally impossible to stream snipe every thing can work please make some more dota underlords im sure it would be very interesting for your audience judging by me here some my evolution in videogames war3wowdota all star hon dota 2hearthstone now its dota autochess waiting open beta of underlords i think many of your subscribers have same interests with me please thumbs up for good content thank you when this game will be release hey kripp i like the fulllength videos do more of them thanks kripp you lose to much gold on rerolls beyond 50 you no need so agression rolls this game keep doing these kind of videos out of character for feedback sake i dont mind longer videos i watch you at 20x or 30x anyway dont make too many of those tho coz some people might not be interested i am very attracted to tft graphics chars design and also colors more than underlords hey kripp u ask me for years hows it going and i never answered so im in my final exams right now and im very stressed keep up the good work d greetings from austria personally the whole reason why i liked league overall compared to dota2 was just because on how clunky dota felt to me and how half of their champions either have 1 to 2 abilities and they put the rest into either passives or have an rng chance to do a bonus and whilst i did had some fun goofing off here and there it just wasnt my cup of tea i dont know maybe im not seeing the big picture with dota with league on the other hand it felt a whole lot smoother that only a very few about of champions have 1 passive or boring ability in thier basic abilities and thats it i legit think that the only champion that has 1 passive and thats it is teemo with his e and tristana with her q if anyone could tell me on what im missing or what im doing wrong please let me know and i understand that i was an idiot in dota2 i cant even beat bots on intermediate and i get that its suppose to be user unfriendly to truly challenge you but i still felt that there something i love this video and i would love to see more dota underlordsteamfight tactics dont get me wrong hearthstone is good and all but sometimes you have to mix things up great video keep up the good work kripp there should be nothing that beat this gets wrecked is it just me or do the aesthetics of underworld look too grey and bland i miss auto chess setup with the river and different landscapes for each player i still cant believe after all this time in both dota and now underlords valve has yet to fucking fix character portraits theres still some that are way off camera or not at all in frame or weirdly placed in frame or missing parts of their model do they just not care or feel its not worth development time i like the longer video underlords content is good stuff your interest is calculated as the round starts not after units are locked you rolling midcombat was lowering your gold gain for the next round just fyi some notes on the gameplay and info i dont rly know if kripps gonna read this but i rly wanna see him succeeding in this genre all beginners can feel thought of through this too 1 abby ck were offered early and would have helped you through the early game 2 if you have a qop you want to centralize your team and put her directly behind the tank line with the tank line being way in the front you dont want her jumping around nor taking damage 3 veno is good if you have a mana item for him 4 you use position the drow very well 5 dagon only gives mana in autochess not in underlords 6 you actually should play sf over qof cuz its a overall better unit and it stays put 7 slardar hits real hard for some god damn reason must be compensation for his skill sucking major ass 8 lich is kinda sad without mana regen 9 dooms skill is doom haha it silences the strongest opponent unit for a long time and applies a dot 10 you dont use lich for damage he does this game actually looks very complex at least much more so than what you initially see even with the missuse of dusa and techies and the kunikka thing with kunnka i still liked this video much more than the tft game its not only the familiar faces and mechanics of the mod it is also things like the size of the characters and the solidity of the arena it feels a little small tho riparian here but this time hey cuz instead of hey guys this video should really be called you can put any garbage in if you have a good hunter base with dusa in the back was he calling kkona to the kunka xd this felt like watching a foreign movie without subtitles i was strangely entertained but had barely a clue on what was going on these vids are the good shit keep them this long this is great i love underlords content from this channel im looking forward to the future of this kind of content i really dont see the appeal extremely boring to watch and sound just as boring to play this used to be a wow channel pepehands im a huge fan of full game highlights thanks so much for posting it id like to see more long videos are pog champ this looks bad compared the arcade version in actual dota 2 guess thats what to expect when companies rush the latest trend i really enjoyed that video im sure these auto chess games are fun for the player but they are absolutely nightmarishly boring to watch someone else play and just from one perspectiveits like you turn on tv to watch a golf tournament and they just follow one person the whole time and once they finish the 18th hole its announced someone else won by 6 strokes great video i love the underlords content that youve been doing on twitch too big fan of the longer videos the longer the better because ive got fuck all else to do with my time lol i may of lost this underlords battle but i will rise like the phoenix to beat krippers i like the video but id rather see more tft might just be me though i like the new autochess content on this channel keep it up honestly i keep hoping you stream more underlords it was fun to watch i hate that gaming community seems to hate dota underlord just because its a valve game hurr durr half laifu gaben suck this is easily one of the best version of auto chess right now so much improvement and qol changes especially the removal of some lame synergy effect addition of intersting units and the item system drodo auto chess is too safe for comfort they didnt even bother to innovate or improve on their own formula that enigma i went with a trollwarlock strat and just had a slark pounding on the backlines worked out pretty well loving these vids krippo autochess genre is better than anything rn rly if it becomes your focus just like amaz or smth regular like savjz it will be awesome hs became just a side game for me eventually and i think it is also true for a lot of people but maybe not the majority of your subs i enjoy these auto chess videos keep them coming kripp idc hearthstone so i dont watch any of kripps hs videos or streams so i must say hearing the classic intro after so long feels pretty good xdddd six locks is new meta omg try the official release version of teamfight tactics once it comes out six lock more like sick lock love the long vids please continue doing underlords videos i enjoy them a lot if you like it lettuce know i like it kripp please more dota underlords okay i have to know how many kripperionos are exactly here i love the game and i love those vids too no views club todays fact the dark region on the north pole of plutos moon charon is called mordor this is the full game based off the highlight from earlier today httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi7joboxr7vw i had 10 ogres you have to get to 8 and then wait for 2 to show up in the shop at the same time why did he keep benching the ogre and why couldnt he find another one bad luck fix yo glasses ho i hope they never fix the size httpsyoutubeszfas9bhxd8 check this out man id like to hear your thoughts that is not 13k dps but 13k damage donated this prick 20 for a haircut he goes and buys more hairpulling lessons how do you have no selfreflection over broadcasting to 120000 ppl in half a month looking like a fuckin retard literally should retry this now with the bloodbound item and keeping ogres 2 and 1 does not work anymore onions have layers ogres have layers the cake is real and its layered 3615 thats damage youre looking at not the dps bro how do you keep them from becoming 2 stars hes not literally the size of your screen the try hardidness is so cringy jesus im very happy for you bro a really cool build but damn i had to mute the audio so obnoxious is that dota day 9 3004 item heart of the tarrasque 2 health regen srsly stop those spoilers at the beginning its so bs he hits on a good point and that is even when you win in this game you still dont usually feel like a winner they need to jazz up the win screen hearthstone is a good example of congratulating you when you win in a game with 8 players it should feel more satisfying holy shit the game gave u 2 warlocks at 4037 this means that u would have 1 3 star war lock and a 10 1 stat war lock which means you can get extra units after a 3 star if u would have bought both why r u playing on rank 1 such a pussi safe game i recently got a win with double 2 star tiny with double brooch of the aggressor and a crystal maiden in my team and it was the funniest shit ever few warriors in the back to save maidens froma ssassins your tinys will throw into aoe stun after just one punch sometimes even just right away then walk up and repeat this basically if you get one good throw enemy units wont be able to move or interact anymore d you have to try it its total damage and not a dps clickbaiter i hope youtube had an option to report for that its all ogre now not to burst your bubble put that is not dps the game dont count dps it counts dmg as in total why does he bench orge everytime he roll this guy is dumb and annoying you almost got 10 warlocks 4037 so much salt in the dislikes dps is damage per second this was damage per round and you were one warlock away from getting a lvl 3 warlock and 2 more warlocks appeared in the shop so technically its possible to have 10 units and you could have even more if 3 warlocks appeared in the shop when u were 1 away from lvl3 nobody dps is damage per second warlock is your mommy 4053 ohh ogre youre so big staight outta shrek porn found the most annoying neckbeards u talk too much you inbred lmao this is worse than mages at 4037 you couldve combined to a 3star warlock and there wouldve been another warlock in shop so at least you couldve shown if game allows to have one 3star and a 1star i just got the exact same build as you are marvelous won me the 1st place thats not dps btw thats only damage can you say literally one more time holy fuck i laughed so fucking hard at this you know whats great about this build late game its really resilient to fighting off variance if the wrong units die first theres still 1 or 2 beefy blood ogre or warlock its irrelevant which of the 4 warlocks die first damn you shoulda sold the rest of your units and downgraded them to level 1 you were on a soccer team i play underlord a lot and one time i rolled a tinker even though i had a 3star tinker on my board so cool one thing i think its dpr rather than dps though awesome video overall i almost win with this draft but accidentally upgrade my warlock to 3 star n fucked up eveything xd imagine if you have 2 lvl 2 ogres and 2 lvl 1 ogre ez game haha its all ogre for them wtf u had 2 2 warlocks and 2 1 warlocks rolled another 2 warlocks which proves you can get 10 warlocks okay this is funny brilliant man i had so much fun watching this you had a chance for more warlocks when you had 2 available so you would get the 3 star and a 1 star and rolls would still give you more you can get a 3 star 2 star and 1 star of the same troop and thats the peak but he got 2 warlocks in that roll buying 1 would make a 3 star what would the second one do would that have made it able to keep rolling warlocks its beautiful nice to see swim in my feed sadly cdpr rekt gwent imo maybe you could have one 3 star ogre and a one one star ogre if u waited for a double orge roll on ur 8th ogrelike u had with the double warlock roll why not buy the warlock then you could end up with 4 warlocks on the board you obviously stop at the 8th not the 5th its not dps shiitso annoying its all ogre now im sorry but your ogre does not deal 13000 dmg per second i dont think you know what dps means what are your settings why does everything looks so big on screen what happens if you have 8 ogreswarlocks and you find 2 of them in the buy menu at the same time will you get 10 and then trick the game with your one star unit into letting you buy more tried this build but i went up against 3 mage players and i have no bkb sacrificing 4 warlocks for the power is this game really about skills or luck cuz everything is rng i believe u could actually found another warlock if get the 9th warlock and the extra one you could theoretically get more than only one 3 star ogre when you only need 1 more ogre for a 3 star upgrade you just need to wait until you get multiple ogres in your so you could potentially get 2 extra units on top of your 3 star edit i just played a game to confirm this is indeed possible i got a 3 star and a 1 star ogre at the same time it may not be very likely but it is very possible has this been patched i need to try this once the warlocks are dead its ogre ill pay whoever counts how many times he says literally not even one minute in and i heard the word literally like 5 times and each and every time it shouldve been figuratively jeez is that annoying like literally oh ogre youre so big duh he has 2 heads phenomenal content here imagine this with additional units of heartless or heartless humans since he could choose the global trait or if there was a dazzle with shallow grave can someone explain me what happened with the gwent videos i loved them 4037 i wish you bought those two warlocks it would upgrade those to star 3 but you had 1 extra 1 star warlock to buy i wonder if it would work this guy looks like the definition of incel i guess you could say that the ogre build has layers that benched vanguard when the shadowfiend was there literally giving me an aneurysm how to explain this build ok we put our squishies up front and our tanky units in back our entire dps is a single tier 1 unit its melee and we put it in the back line because we want it to take a while before it deals damage also if we level up our key units we lose i figure this cant release quickly enough there was a roll that you couldve bought 2 warlocks while you had an 8 one is it possible to buy the 9th one and them an onestar given that the were in the same roll not onlt ogre i dont see drow too in auto chess we can still get them after got 3 right ermmm technically dps stands for damage per second and i think 13k was the over all damage done in that round which was more than one second why are all your nonartifactdota vids private now do i need to pay to view now or is something else going on swim i curve my bloodbound into heartless usually drow abbadon pudge necro this gives you 2 in warlock as well this build will be wrecked when countered with warrior level 2 and hunter level 1 tried this ogre bloodbound build just doesnt work everytime why did they have to auto combine its all ogre now you know at 4036 he got 2 warlock which means more than 9 warlock more than 9 ogre is possible but i guess it needs to come more than 1 in 1 roll wow subed imagine if bloodseeker was a bloodbound unit instead of human i mean i know im getting triggered for something completely forgettable but dps means damage per second and that is raw total damage done 4053 i think this is proof that swim is a memer episode 1 for one punch man httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfhrbw99fimafeatureyoutube swim its not a meme build also swim i want my guys to die as fast as possible i need to create a layered cake of feeding everything wants to die already know the titles wrong and baity before watching 13k damage not dps 1700 comment proves that swim is in fact a meme player ok ok you can get low tier items on level 30 i got this on lvl 30 after loosing to creeps with 3 health and choosen aegis because i wanted one more chance i feel like aegis could be a better item if open forting comes back into the meta since you arent putting any units on the field for the first 10 or so human rounds the opportunity cost of picking aegis over any other item would be reduced i pick aegis because i know im trash and it would make me last a round longer how does anyone think this item is good it has 0 impact for 20 rounds one difference between aegis and generic tier 1 items that i think deserves some consideration the tier 1 items will have the most impact in earlier rounds when you are playing against many opponents and when lucky or unlucky rolls have a bigger effect on the game aegis comes into play at the end of the game when youre playing against a few opponents and youve had lots of rolls to smooth out the variability in your board composition so if you get better than average rolls at the beginning of the game then aegis becomes more appealing youre going to win most of those early rounds even without a claymore especially since there are lots of opponents and half of them probably got below average starts but later your opponents have had a chance to recover from their initial bad luck and now the claymore that gave you a crushing victory as opposed to a dominant victory in the early game is feeling pretty lackluster in a 10v10 fight with legendary and epic units good guy aegis got worse when winstreak got nerfed it was never very good but when youre offered a bad pack this item can preserve your winstreak if you drop a round to a surprise or bad rng bottom line its not good but sometimes its the best option in a bad pack especially if youre midway through a winstreak ageis should give 1015 health and move it to tier 4 i mean when it pop it should add health this make it legendary having claymore is gonna help u win few rounds maybe its gonna help u win 1 round out od 100 rounds if ure lucky just got a win thanks to aegis i didnt get a great selection but i was losing a lot of games early due to no level 2s and it was definitely the best item i could have got youre misspronouncing aegis its pronounced as ayy jis from ingame dota 2 tooltip if your early board is significantly weaker that half your opponents a 21 damage claymore could potentially hurt your gold gain by making you win 1 round before you get a lose streak going if you are playing for a win streak and have the board for it then aegis is a significantly worse item than any of the other early game dominance items its a very situational item in a 5050 end game situation aegis is worth more than 510hp good video swim the mathematical argument i think you are looking for is lanchesters square law that states that a small advantage in power in one side leads to a disproportionaly better outcome to that side i think aegis is not that bad sometimes when you have a poor draft at the beginning picking a claymore doesnt help you you need to lose to keep the loss streak so what is the purpose of having 45 instead of 4 sometimes aegis helps you survive one more round from 24 to 25 helps you save 5 golds no need to spend all the money when 50 and 5 golds after the 25th round 10 golds i really think aegis item choice depends on the situation i think everyone just uses it wrong the best way to use it is to avoid using it all together buy out before your aegis procs and you probably survive for much longer and even get first place so i should pick aegis and message you on steam to tell you about it you know if they just make the item dc you like silver lining was doing that will nip any purchase in the bud from ptsd alone who has meta deck couse assassins druids are dump anyone know how to compare our board with enemies position like what swim did hard disagree on this one i watched gaara who no offense is a significantly stronger player talk about aegis a couple days ago and he said its op guaranteed top 4 is what he said about it most important aspect is that you can stay on oneshothp in late game and keep econ with 50 gold you could never afford to do that without aegis and its invaluable late game you are nuts if youre calling aegis a noob trap and suggest picking tranquil boots over it is this like a massive jebait so none of us ever pick aegis against him and pull out a win would love to see a guide on transitioning from a composition to an end game setup with high value heroes another great video i got to boss rank from watching your videos bro keep it up you are a god amongst men this makes so much sense i used to think aegis was good because once it helped me go from 5th to 1st but youve converted me i would only think to pick it now if there was no other option agree with this heavily you have to think about opportunity cost its not just about what an item will do for you at a particular stage of the game but also what it does leading up to it tooth and claw is kind of similar in the opposite sort of way its really really bad late game so youll wonder why youd want to pick it however it can get you to the late game in a fairly dominant position so you can easily swap out your midgame units for better ones with your comparably higher health and gold pool aegis is a protected minority you bigot its clear that envy is the reason why aegis has been kicked out of like a hundred boards its time to stop the unjustified hate towards this peaceful and multicultural item reported for hate speech aegis is very good i like playing with warriorswarlockmage composition so i isually play from behind claymore wins you rounds aegis wins you games aegis lets me contemplate my mistakes for one additional round great value aegis is basically 1015 life when your losing its not great but sometimes that extra round makes all the difference poor but pickable i dunno swim but honestly aegis has been securing me top 4 in my every game no matter how worst my rngs great game i kind of get a trend of quills playstyle have a working combo and win streak than sell some of your units for something different and start loosing give kotl the refresher aaaaaaaaaaaaa gets three star at end defeating quillho ho ho now i have a machine gun isnt this game dead i would love to see this daily goodness knows it might help my play he took a noticable lose streak after he sold the sven your units cant do anything if theyre dead especially when he sold the disruptor he didnt even need so happy youre playing this game again i love when you play this game does io not combine anymore i dont think were going mages though looks at video title uhhuh 4848 old man reflexes quill you could win this slardartidekunk void 6 mages also dk is very good with mages his breath and splash are amplified and you had the shard for him wow uploaded 29 seconds ago we got closer to completion for our tiny swim 2019 time to eject my load swim 2019 you may have missed the fact that selling upgraded units yields less value than invested whichs very important early game to not invest on heroes you intend to change also you can also cheat the store when your bench is full by moving your units into to the board after the battle finishes very useful when you have lots of pairs meaning high chance of upgrade with a reroll amazing video very useful and informational keep on that great content comming you look like ted mosby in college this works won a game just now went down to 4 hp but beat a guy at 96 hp by not losing after round 24 if you buy exp on level 4 and 8 instead of 5 and 9 then you get to roll for better units one round earlier you level up before it rolls reuploading from another channel super cool it kills me how much mistakes ben was making i beat my dogs jeff gerstmann 2019 totally not an out of context quote i know absolutely zero about dota or or auto chess and i have no fucking clue what is happening here should i give it a shot i guess this is the one ill pick up fuck you well just steal your idea just so everyone knows in this version of auto chess the gold is calculated at the start of the round so if you want to get interest but buy a unit you can buy it after the round starts to lock in your interest gold ben messed that up a couple of times haha press f for the benched tiny this is my second favorite auto chess right now besides the dota auto chess mod within dota 2 it seems like with enough new features this will definitely be my favorite anyone else thinking what the hell is going on league is already in a desperate race to rip it off wow wheres the teamfight tactics video ah yes a spin off of the lords management genre played about an hour of this earlier feels super unfinished im not too sure why this excists when the original auto chess is basically the same game the word for looking for is hiest heads up its also out on android i tried to think of a dota pun but i couldnt think of one sohi ben i was not aware this is on mobile i guess i have to download it to my phone now wait how can he download it on ios its not in my store maybe because im on german store whats the deal k say i see someone going spirits or primordial if i buy these and then sell them for the gold will they be gone say 45 razors if i buy him twice and then sell him is 4345 or will it be recycled 1 game i had 2 dooms and wanted a 3rd one and i saw that 1 player had 5 and the other one 4 so i waited for them to die then both died so i was heads up so i decided to roll all my 50 10 from the exact round the died gold away to buy 4 5 units and found no doom so 4 rounds later i sold those 5s to roll farther and still didnt find anything though would have found a 3rd enigma if not going for dooms so thats 40 rolls 50 gold 55base 5 interest240 for 0 dooms while 13 maybe minus a few that my heads up opponent blocked should have been in the pool is there a known bug which causes units to not be put back into the pool sometimes this was though provoking and informative i loved how you had a real example of you doing this to great success for ideas of future videos i would love to hear more of your thoughts on when transition your current midgame strategy for a more powerful epiclegendary unit lategame strategy hey swim i was wondering if youd do a video on the thoughts behind alliance items not necessarily ranking them more like if you get strange bedfellows what should your thought process be to build to that and when do you abandon the item if things seem to be going poorly like if you get coordinated assault but can only seem to field tier 1 1 star trolls thank you swim you beautiful specimen another great information video keep it up homie i learn a lot damn thanks swim can you make a positioning guide make unit tier list please i am boss and i didnt even know there was a shared pool i just aquire gold and stay low leveled while i stack up level 3s then toss them all on the board i want to see you edit video those infographics are really crispwhat software do you use to make them thats so informative thank u i didnt know everything inthis video just some in underlords have some counter or not maybe when enemy use haunter or anything else i should go to any aliance thanks hi swim could you do a video on positioning what happens when you sell a unit does it return to the shared pool the game that opened my eyes to this was that match where there wasnt enough legendaries because many other players had higher class of criminal so the shop would offer 4 units instead of 5 in your rolls more blood bound videos please would love to see updated losing streak and build videos can you make a video on how to make 3 star units and also a game closeout guide i have trouble with knowing what to do when i have like 50 gold and no 3 star unit possibilities at level 10 and i start to lose how do you know or how do you curve from your earlymid game compex some warriorsbloodbound to your late game complets say those 6 assassins please do a quick video on obscure things like the hero pool just to bring awareness to people like me that didnt know about them because i had no clue about hero pool until this video that part where he mentions in commons when i see multiple people going same units i try to avoid it then he says there are 45 in the pool i am like welp it doesn t matter much now that is basically what i do 1cost 5 total maxstar heroes in the pool 2cost 3 and 13 three 3star 1 2star 3cost 2 and 233 or 23 19 4cost 1 and 23 one 3star two 2star 5cost 1 and 19 one 3star one 1star hey swim how can i see the enemy board vs my own before the round starts like you do in your videos to check the positioning for anti mage and tidehunter hi swim good editing btw thanks to editor also before asking im a desperate man who stucked at tier boss 5 i have some questions about shared pool mechanics recently i noticed that some players are finding more oftenly tier 4 and some others cant find the game gives to a certain player alot of chances to find epic heroes but while each players at the same levels and they all have the same chances to get tier 4right i mean unless if you dont have higher class criminal buff why some players have more luck to get find tier 4 compare to others sometimes im suffering after 10th round to find some rare or epic heroes but others sees 3x epic heroes at the shop screen and the funny part is sometimes they have less level than me dont get me wrong its totally understandable its all about rng sometimes you get sometimes you dont sometimes the game gives you 3 disruptor while your drow ranger is 1 star but it should be equal for all players who reac thank you for this interesting video could you maybe also make a video about how to think about what units to upgrade next or generally how to manage the bench i often find myself in a situation where my bench is full with several half completed 2stars and 3stars and i cant really efficiently complete anything because i cant decide what to complete firstsome tips and tools to help making these decisions and maybe even prevent such completion dead locks beforehand would be great hey swim nice video mage comp guide when got to big boss thanks to your guides havent played autochess so it really helped my learning curve thanks would you update your guide on loosing steak now that many components of it changed can som1 plz tell me the command for comparing boards to see enemy board on your board be4 fight starts would a good strat be to buy into someone elses strat and take the most important unit for them and not use it good stuff thanks im glad i havent tried to force the same composition every time d but im glad you went through how i can get my gold upi didnt understand this at all s and not worrying about 3 stars on low tier units 3 this big help for me im new to this game tnx for the tips great tips halogames thanks for the video welp looks like im a complete noob this helps a lot damn i loved your video you explained this really nicely i found myself guilty of nearly all the mistakes damn thanks mate please dont listen to this advice t5 units are not a viable strategy odds have been nerfed this is extremely helpful more pls yo whats the print directly behind you of the black and white one got my first 1st place right after watching this im only on the second tier of ranked but considering ive been playing this game for all of two days im happy i just started playing this game tonight and i was making all of those mistakes thanks for the video i really found this game addicting i am still learning everything so this video gave me a lot of insight on mistakes im making right off the bat nice video bro your youtube is very professional my type of thing that i like keep it up holy shit this is mindblowing thanks holo again for the great tutorial as always very well explained and easy to understand cant wait for the next one come out summary 1 dont re roll before lvl 7 2 play for interest 3 dont enforce team composition blindly thanks holo more of this this is a good video lol good guide thanks a lot for the tips now i can finally get good and be able to play at your level d there is only one tactic for this game that brings win start with fighters extend to savage extend to life steal if you do not get at least one upgrade till level 5 you can quit the match if someone already has 2 upgrades you can quit the match if you do not get any decent options till level 10 you can quit the game basically game is 1015 times quitting for one time win when cards get in your favor there is no strategy in that game hunters are useless against knights assassins are useless against fighters with knights combo you saved lots of moneyand got stomped dude the bench misplays hurt but honestly you went for econ way to hard selling that qop was dumb why dont you cover your rangers was gonna outside during the summer then quill gets me hooked on ye another game thanks a lot quill damn cant wait to play this medusa is amazing lose twice medusa gets sold wins a lot oh theres our medusa back loses bad rolls at end but yeah this one is your fault for that bad bench nonsense looks fun but can someone explain the mechanics of it its a bit confusing for me xd the mobile version is good too quill not picking kunkka is killing me me you missed at least 2 to that point you seem to still live pick 1 reactor is totally forcable i have never commented on any of your videos i have watched over last couple of years but please more of these i feel like quill gets really focused on a couple of builds he can see ten turns in the future so he shoots himself in the foot in the midgame instead of letting his future builds evolve a bit more naturally round 10 you had a 2 tiny and what came up in the shop arc warden and shadow shaman use all three and you would have the primordial stun and the shaman 6sec instahex just chainmail tiny and put him front thats some good early shutdown i love watching this game form yourself keep it up i wonder if its a bad idea in this game to base ones build on what type passives and heroes you get on the first few minion rounds quills attempts forcing of some specific build he thinks is above average feels like it should be bad coulda shoulda woulda is the name of the game here is your description updated the open beta next week thingy hoping one day qill will see my comment to put qop in the second line so her aoe hits more enemies 1 interest is not better than a purple winning streak lol u would of got to 50 the turn after and kept the streak qop was doing crazy dmg aoe wheres the doom skips like 4 dooms skipping the kunkka hurts skipped like 4 kunkas my ideas on hunter builds 36 hunter gives 2535 chance so not really worth it slardar is a good pickup for warriorscaled bonus with medusa alchemist works well with pyscial damage and with heartless savage and also work well with hunters tusk lycan are both savage warrior lycan is also human good if you pick up kunkka humans are even better with the heartless item tidehunter can replace slardar later gyrocopter as temporary pickup especially good if you have sniper deadeye bonus troll warlord disruptor shadow shaman is also a good trio core drow ranger insane passive pudge medusa any hunter hunterheartless bonus early drow ranger pudge tusk any savageany warrior mid drow ranger pudge tusk medusa slardar warriorscaled bonus any hunter hunter bonus alchemist optional any savage optional savage bouns with tusk final build drow ranger pudge medusa tidehunter sniper any hunter kunkka ult warriorhuman tusk lycan human savage war me does everything that people with hundreds of hours in game tell me to do gets beat by someone with a fully starred crew quill blindfolds self walks into a labyrinth appears on the other side with treasure and a maiden always stay around 50 gold you dont get increased interest any higher than that so any spare gold above that invest it into levels or rolls i think you could consider leveling or rolling a little more aggessively to keep your winstreaks this game hates me every item i get that buffs a particular unit type i never get that unit again no love for qop i looooove these videos man hope the series continue at any and all points in this video what are you doing quiiiiiil still loving this cant wait for more skipping so many kunkas after picking the humans count as heartless that hurts xd wont you play civ vi anymore theres been a new update and your playthroughs are so fun to watch quill there is a base damage for a loss equal to the round divided by 10 which im not sure was present in the base mod i think you should have reconsidered your placement first hey everyone so this guide is a tad out of date if youre looking for uptodate guides click here to go to that playlist httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplmnkzaojbnstevjrrsajnrv86kkhikg79 thx for the tips boss i went with this srategy sometime ago and its no lie it works there is a huge but though if by chance you dont get the troll warlord if m remembering his name correctly this build suffers a lot and by a lot i mean all of your suffering so far can go to waste knight buil is so awesome magic build is best as for methe last rounds will be coming a lich and also if you have a lucky man as items i know what you mean troll knights are really strong together but i dont know somehow i didnt ever got a full troll knightslike i dont get shadow shaman til the begining or troll at the end hi i made another come back today with 2 left today im using primordial all 5 of them with 2 arc warden with venomancer nature prophet lycan lone druid maximum summon set with your strategy in keeping the cash without reroll made it til the end thanks very useful strategy no aegis this round thanks it works even for the latest version i was last place and left 6 life then i made a comeback and won the game i am a fan of troll knight and i got them all i use to matched them with necrophos too but this round i didnt manage to get him so i got arc warden instead and thanks to arc warden with chain lightning i have 11 units instead on 10 i realized aegis is important to play this strategy no global item is needed and the other players will start panic once they see me come back and none of them manage to reach level 10 great game and thanks again shit man i just fucking crushed everyone with this strat thanks much subscribed it use to work really good but it got nerfed or something if you try this tactic now its rare to get a win its possible but u need to be lucky got my fist win thanks i really hate losing in this game got unlucky choices i dont even know when to level up and what heroes should be picked i know theres an update and this strategy might not work is this strategy still works until now because i just lost multiple times i dont know if anyone else is the same as me or maybe its just me who is wrong on doing this btw im sorry if my english is bad d i tried and it works like charmmm thank youu such a beautiful video thank you dude i had like three warlords one had mask of madness while the other two had moon shards only have 1 life left and won the last 7 rounds with this strategy its my first win lol thank you sir playing that strat for more then 2 mounths now that is pretty strong but in this new meta i think its little bit better to get 6 knights viper necro witch doctor and you can get troll if you get it buts its ok to duplicate any knight on the end if you have dragon knight lvl 2 with any tier 4 dmg item he will deal more then 10k dmg in every fight 11 games trying to do this build never once did get a warlord is it just me or when i starting to do crazy reroll like what he did near the end of the vid troll warlord never appear i won i won but that slark so fucking op killed it all hahaha it works bout to try this goodluck to me editit worked but 5thplace got my first win after try this method wtf thank you and also to rng god very effective thank you for sharing it worked thank you alex really works one of my favorites but i prefer the primordialwarlocksand the trolls d its the most monster build i ever made i am a noob in this game or should i say i was got from bottom to top in final rounds and won everytime this is the old warlock synergy warlock now is different tho i tried this build 2 times got the first place in my third try my trolls wont show up until 36 so i ended up using my 3 star abbadon and 2 star dk as my main dps at the end i got 2nd place loses by 2 star of level 5 heroes build well now that they fixed the troll global perk busted op before this build certainly took a big punch but it is still strong the only problem is how much you will get countered at high rank games not only are your core units a high contest but players will also just buy troll warlords and dragon knights and bench block you i think sf trolls is op as fuck i tried it yesterday and it was an easy win but unfortunately everyone uses this now because almost 58 people in a game uses the same kit and i cant upgrade my heroes simple and easy to learn no need more times to watching its really headache watching and hearing more than 30mnt and still dont understand 1 subcribe delete this shit now lol i just won the first game using this strategy and i didnt dip below 95 health also does anyone know if coordinated assault stacks cause i was offered it after neutral rounds 3 times and i picked it up every time update proceeded to getting my dick slapped and knocked out in 7th place the next round just bad rng right right holy sht this is awesome its working really well i won the last 3 rounds with over 450 000 damage i pay u to delete this video and thanks btw yes the knight alliance is really powerful i won from last to first with full knight army 8v10 the top 1 player i won without knowing the synergy with troll hello this is underlord manager delet dis jokes aside holyshit dude i got 1st place 3 games straight with your strats are you sure that it doesnt just work because your upstart 4 lol i tried this strat 4 times and i always got first place shout at me louder work with warrior troll and warlock too if you have no luck on knight for frontline btw ps octorine on necro is nutty healing on alchimist enjoy thank you anyone know the background music name you get right to the point fucking love it the strat worked almost failed many times especially at the reroll part was stuck at level 9 with 2hp and every player started grabbing doom and blink dagger very intense games this strat brings still won d ppl are smart o or i just have very bad luck lmao only tried it once so far but it panned out almost exactly like this march lost almost all my health then went on an endless winning streak til victory and there he goes folks 3k plus and counting bro congrats it still kinda works even with warlock alliance effect patched knights damage reduction is just damn good the work arround for the missing lifesteal can be replaced with mom for troll some mekans or any healing to mitigate nukes but i think any tier 45 weapon at late game is good enough i just won a game even with 1 star troll with everybody else 2 star and a 3 star omni but my account is still low level tho might be different on higher levels mate works a dream first game with this i won with 1hp left d cheers bro i mean cmon dude this build has been used in the game since original autochess and right now it isnt even top tier since it relies on tier4 units to do any substantial damage either troll warlord or dk troll warlord is usually heavily contested since its also being played as a core in warriors which makes the dk route much more reliable although it kinda sucks before you get him to 2 stars if you play in high ranks 2 out of 3 games on knights are gonna end up as dk line over troll line especially since it has more flex slots much easier to slot in enigma if you face against mirror or nagas if you face mages 4 undead for anything else assuming you have fallen from grace heres a list of builds that can beat knights 1 anything that has a flex slot for tier2 enigma pure damage from eclipse melts knights despite shields and you have to clump them due to how knight mechanic works 2 3 warriors 6 hunters assuming tier2 tide and tier2 dusa are reached which isnt please delete this video now that i know it everyone will be using this once they tried it once isnt coordinated assault bugged soooo whats your rank mister i win everygame it is 100 i already tested it you sir are a genius was in late game with only 9 heros and still steamrolled sry for the stupid comment before i played around a bit more and it really is an amazing strategy thank you for sharing this was a bit skeptical going into this video but i tried it and it does exactly what you say gg ez win omg this strategy so smart af axe 7k health is the best just him that is all maybe 9 other healers might work i need a strategy guide alex make the 7k axe 9 healer strat nice strat man tested and won i hate this strats so much lmao its sooooo good and everyone trying to get this pieces in my game which make the hero pool kinda off thanks for sharing the strats man 1 sub bruh alex playing the drums in the back will try this thanks bro the videos keep improving man keep it up and get a tan you pastey kid hahaha 3 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvngk6yekq0i0 check mine alsothankyou can someone tell me the sub notification song name i just had the worst game in my life the entire game where i didnt even get a 2 star

these auto resolving games are addicting cause its none of the hardship of playing a regular dota game and zero stakes team fight every minute where most things die and its very flashy which keeps attention on the game and that dopamine kick so this is why im getting so many people spamming arc warden lately top 1 guy is a mag and yet no one go naga or disruptor pepothink yesssssss feelsgoodman all hail mr claritas what does it mean to save gold in this game yo psst im disappointed not to see the level 50 mob game needs turbo mode because its not good for me to play one match over 40min that

twitch live stream link httpswwwtwitchtvmattjesticgaming follow my twitter at httpstwittercommattjesticg for the latest news on auto chess new guides fun challenges and queen ranked replays please click subscribe my f seems double gyro ult would be a lot better than a little extra damage like 6070 of the damage he does is magic damage from his ult you could have doubled that damage but instead you chose to marginally increase his physical damage and give him some magic immunity he doesnt need because hes on the backline dont understand this choice at all have you twitch channel keep witch doctor in line up for 5 warlocks pain to see that in late game each unit deals more damage than it is in early game i love this game but warlocks need to be fixed too many games decided by who gets warlocks now makes it much less entertaining to play so one 2 star unit 2 damage but this game also adds a damage per 10 rounds so after round 10 if you lose youll lose 1 health the number of stars still left on the board after 20 youll lose 2 health the number of stars left on the board and so on you were at round 42 so you lost 4 health the 2 stars that were left on the board thats why the games end up being so much quicker than autochess was this game drove me so mad he only had 5 warlocks not 6 disruptor is a shaman not a warlock why didnt anyone tell him came for hearthstone stayed for underlords love you savjz they need to nerf warlocks and legendaries the late game is becoming very boring and alliances lose all their value pretty much your biggest mistake was buying units then selling them only to debug and replay them later to be pro you must commit cheers hope that helps guys big boss but doesnt remember round dmg lol every 10 levels is 1 dmg this is where i critique you for not figuring that out after so long dmg is taken by counting units left levels rounds round 19 0 dmg round 1019 1 dmg round 2029 2 dmg and so 42 round so 4 damage 2 star how do you compare your opponents board with yours come back to hearthstone 3 6savage 4trolls is pretty good as well with global more stacks and a mask target you still get warlock and warrior bonus cons are lack of aoe cc and can die to strong mages but if you get troll global you could do 2naga2troll instead so units that other players get are less likely to show up for you when the game give you dks you play dks did i hear at 4134 4807 i dont think savjz understands how the loses work i hope hell see this message then you lose as many health as the total of the levels of the enemy units alive if he still has 1 level 1 unit 3 level 2 unit and 1 level 3 unit youll lose 113213 plus a certain amount of health depending on the round youre in actually depending on the ten youre in for example on round 43 the ten is 4 youll 4 more hp on round 26 youll lose 2 more hp and so on at 4807 theres still a pudge level 2 alive plus youre on round 42 you lose 12units alive4the round6 demon build is really great specially with 2 global strange bedfellow and stacking more demon units it hits like a truck fcking gg hey bro im from indonesia ill ask about hotkey to view formation my opponent next round ho do this click s it feels so bad savage summoners is my favorite build by far but even with both globals its just not very good i wonder what they could do to buff it i think the summoning stone could definitely be buffed pretty substantially and maybe make one more unit with the savage tag so that you can drop tusk or sand king or whatever the weakest one for your comp is i dont think veno is that bad especially with his buff that makes him pop out more wards with each level lmao father of savjz please come back to hearthstone man 2136 but yeah like the dick is hard isnt this dead yet you forgot the round damage reported for toxic masculinity confirmed flexin on em ty won the first ever game after this tutorial video ty sunsfan axe worst unit in the game its brownys broo would you be interested in a coaching series i am very bad at positioning why do you care about ranks in an rng game bruh why would people dislike the video haters gonna hate nice gameplay i hope you have learned something now so you can have an educated podcast contribution for once do az challenge again was the best series how is this different than artifact thanks for this useful guide i had some really good games with bloodbound and bigtime contract ogre magi sacrificing himself in frontline made my warlock and terrorblade antimage unstoppable tb made 1522k dmg per round great video as usual but some of your opinions about the items have changed compared to my item tierlist video reason for the blink dagger is obvious 50 mana octarine essence got more higher than before and i guess thats because youve figure out what to use it on but what happened to fall from grace and smuggler they were on top of your list before do they really got so bad i think that exactly is the point of aegis being in the game if ever they fuck up and make something too op to potentially do like 4050 damage to a player again it may get you from 8th to top 3 if you react and get it instead of something better does the blight stone work with luna glaives and does summoning stones stack i think tinys ult is magical damage no great vid one thing to add is that blight stone scales good with a summon build aegis is good imo meta is fast everyone is always low on hp one aegis could mean a 3 place instead of a fifth i will not pick it over say an arcane boots if im winning if my game is slow i will insta pick it swim brooch is pronounced broach the sound is like bro not brew if they put mana gain per use on force staff where would you rank it then what do you mean by early game being really important nowadays damage stacking too fast are losing streak strats still viable aegis could be the difference between 5th place and 4th place blade mail is god tier if you put it on a brawney with forged in battle going up to 10k hp and having a couple warlocks or druids healing it very situational and rng based tho blade mail is awesome against tomato and potato they basically kill themselves attacking a tank with this item very helpful thank you i dont understand why it takes my kotl literally 2 rounds to cast his ability ty swim for this guide this is probably where i struggled most in underlords i have a big bloodbound package thank you swim tranquil boots is a fantastic item to have on ur scrappy alliance its hp regen gets doubled with this item a 1600 hp 2stars tinbersaw can take up to 26k dmg before it dies thats 1k hp value of extra tankiness who do i put aegis on you should try straightening your hair nice vid dude after patch the game isnt as fun and i absolutely hate how the gane has sped up so much i dont like the patch keep up the badass work is it possible to join the 18th gay club even if youre 88th gay d nice another tip from a veteran second and swim when you will create new video about meta deck after new putch hello swim i am have a very very hard time figuring out what to buy in the early game i am hard stuck at outlaw any tips i watched your videos its just not clicking for me what do you recommend i do when it comes to figuring out what to buy i did this but i couldnt get many 2 star units even after rolling and lost in last place tips this wont work well if youre playing on a mobile device like me touch controls are a bit clunky and when switching from lose to win you will be unlikely to pull off the apm necessary to set up a good board wjthout taking additional losses ill give it a try but i cant imagine it working dont put your face in the video i have a question here by the time around 1345 would it be a bad choice if you choose enigma for 4 elementals synergy for somewhat tankier frontlines since there were 2 dooms rip this video seen few people tried this in big boss lobby they always lose mid game to druidwarriorsmagesarc due to just how much those lineups can do damage in a very few rounds it is not extremely reliable but i think it can be viable against some players that run lategame mageknights lineup w the right amount of luck and probability counting though i think managing loses while still maintaining lose streak is the better way like trying to go early game assassins buyout then eco till 50 u still probably can get enemies backline while still losing to their frontline would not recommend playing this against a strong opponent but i can see how it can be abused in lower ranked lobbies this seems like strategy to be the 2nd as you are giving free wins to others who might start win streaking and keep their health using this tactic 3 times and 3 times top 1 played primordials build 2 times and war trolls 1 time also if you get 1 extra gold for losing on first minions round its auto win if you didnt think creeps were weak before you sure do now ive been playing this way from the start until im actually on lieutenant and everybody will know my strategy now smh ive noticed some people on my rank started doing this and now im almost always using the strange bedfellows strat hey btw what rank are considered to be high on this game is my rank lieutenant is high or am i need to be a boss or big boss thanks no why my gwent videos i want to watch the old ones but they are gone why hey man do you know mbti personality test you seem like an entp d i wonder what will happen if two players face off without any units do draws make the lose streak be gone hey swim offtopic but are completely out of gwent i am not into autochess dota and other stuff you are posting next level swim metagaming influencing other players to lose on purpose hight risk hight reward watched video tried video win with 16 health by forcing demons with strange bedfellows due to massive economy 3 star antimage terrorblade chaos knight queen of pain shadow fiend 2 star necrophos 1 star doom this is a very good strat i managed to get 2nd place because of it my lineups were 1 tiny 2 razor 2 lina 2 crystal maiden 1 kunkka 2 kunkka 2 beastmaster 2 juggernaut 2 arc warden 3 shadowfiend i was hoping that i could get an enigma for the full primordial buff but rng hates me also i got the forged in battle buff in round 10 that kept me alive for a while just tried this and won i bet they were pissed i got down to 38 health and did the druids assassins alliance i remember you talking about this strat on stream it looks like a lot of fun i cant wait to try it soon this is a very risky strategy another great video well done man cool guide as always can i eat your ass though how to lose in real dota and dota chess farming gold until end game xd i watched this video and immediately tried it i ended up at 30 health then never lost a round after that until taking it all in round 34 probably beginners luck i had sets of savage warlock warrior heartless and one demon dont you want gloves on tiny dude not trying to be mean but whats up with ur hair thanks for this guide ive been using this tecnique wrong if its a viable strategy as you say it would have been better to see it against actual players but still not a strategy i knew existed the explanation behind it is interesting at least yes keep these coming my dude tombstone is not really good choice vs orcs in long perspective i think they buffs so much with creeps nice game yo savjz just started dota underlords last month and i am a big fan of instructive videos like these i was never able to run a good bloodhound build till i watched this loved the shadowfiend contract combo the disruptor and tidehunter for double stun and primordial shamans for damage got first place with a very similar team thanks and keep it up mate lmao punch them in the facei mean verbally punch them gonna be a goodie yo lifes good when you have 2star arc wardens tbh even though you can play it on mobile you are at quite the disadvantage i tried it but you just cant roll that effieciently as compared to pc absolute massacre with a very fun build this is why i sub primordial shamans with 3 warriors or 3 mages with a blood bound contract for ogre wins games is the meta get one level of every alliance now aint lina better than puck i mean dmg overall puck deals more but lina deletes enemies i think its better if you replace kunkka with dragon knight to get the dragon buff cmiiw is ogre magi good feel like at 2 and 3 stars he can carry if you have the right attack speed team wheres the 3 star doom and ta vid it was so good to see it live remember folks these guides are not metaspecific and are explaining the core comp obviously as metas heroes change so will the core comp change but only very slightly and it will ultimately be played in a very similar way to that described in this video with these composition video guides we are really trying to simply dive deep into the main 5 comps currently in underlords but if those change or something new emerges you can be sure that we will make a comp guide on that too tidehunter isnt a hunter anymore replace him with lycan to get the human buff with kunkka for the silence and you can change kunkka here too against tusk to get savage is this a reupload damn it man off topic your intro sounds like love in this club remix always teasing me to listen to the whole thing nice guides btw ive been watching all your video guides upstart lvl 2 here improved from finishing last to 4th super fantastic guide and stream much appreciated also you look and sound like you are related to nerdjosh the fgc guy lmao something you missed you want sniper and mirana swapped there mirana is a good pudgebait hi swim with the items in your example should you not put blightstone on medusa to debuff more heroes also i would hide medusa to the left of the drow i just tried this comp and i won the game thanks a bunch swim however i had trouble countering qop who kept targeting my medusa i tried placing beastmaster next to medusa but it didnt work i also tried leaving the last row empty with only beastmaster adjacent to medusa but that didnt work too what could i have done differently what do you think of axe with a dagger for the 3rd warrior i think the taunt is really good on him because it gives enough time for dusa to ult as soons as he dies would you reccomend that was expecting the blood bound compositions that makes you are obsessed with thank you for the guide by following your videos ive been placing first most of the time still new tho only grifter 2 but i feel like i can do more with your help thanks swim to play this classic hunter build you pretty much have to lose streaking in early ten rounds because in mid game youll need to high rolling in order to complete the comps a lot of people design around 10 units err no one does that if they are anything above upstart lol this is a pretty solid build heres a hypothetical question assume you are level 9 sitting at 50 gold with 3 warriors and 6 hunters in the late game your bench is empty there are multiple people still in the game and youre at 30 hp so not a 1 shot all your current units are at 2 stars but you do not have a tide hunter so beastmaster is in instead you roll and you get a 1 star tide hunter do you a switch out the 2 star beastmaster in exchange for 1 star tide b level to 10 immediately with all your gold to slot in the tide c level to 10 slowly while keeping maximum interest and then slot in the tide d roll all your gold trying to get a 2 star tide and switch the beastmaster if you get it e roll your extra gold while keeping maximum interest until you get a tide 2 star and then slot him in over the beastmaster f something else there are no mage players in the game so scaled is not a factor i think its kinda still playable but i think 6 hunters fall off pretty quickly in this meta i bet this video was recorded pre patch how do u create test lobby thank you so much being a total newbie these composition helps i appreciate your effort thanks again more guides like these please d this was uploaded on egs channel right kinda outdated since the recent patch petition to remove the left

subscribe my f spirits are trash in 99 of games just started playing this game and i just cant understand it like you do lmao youre crazy 3552 thanks me later viper 3s last match was hilarious d i just started playing recently so this may sound like a stupid question but at the 514 mark how do you bring up the window showing enemy units i take it this was before the 6 sins and 3 ember spirit nerfs what are your thoughts on the new hunters i might give them a try with 3 war 2 trolls or scrappies poor slark kept coming back one of my favourite builds climbed up to big boss with it ember so imba when he is 3 star tho good vid as always first like and also first comment i think also that viper was the mvp hey guys we decided to put together a playlist specifically for guides so whether youre just starting out or perhaps an intermediate or even more advanced player all of swims guides will have a specific style of thumbnail and title to differentiate it from the longform full gameplay videos you can find the playlist here httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplvz6dguv5v5ydgz5cvbdztwxfugut1k can you make a new video now that demon hunter as an alliance is gone and some other changes you look like leonard from big bang theory main alliances assassins 6 elusives 6 hunters 6 knights 64 trolls 4 mages 6 scrappy 6 warriors 6 you dont want to go to 9 because you need to be able to combine your main alliance with defenseoffense whichever its lacking support alliances bloodbound brawny deadeye demon demon hunter dragon druid heartless human inventor primordial savage scaled shaman warlock again combine a defensive main alliance with an offensive support alliance and vice versa hey you are a chill dude who is easy to follow and listen to thanks why not warlocks would somebody please explain i really like shadow fiend with alchemist witch doctor warlock etc with the healing ability why isnt that a good alliance thanks i really really like underlord its competitive but relaxing thanks for the guide maybe its just me but when i start to play a new game i like to explore everything by my own and not go into technical details because when i start to learn how much one char hits vs another armor and all numbers game becomes stripped off its symbolism if thats the right word to say and does become boring it is off topic i guess and i understand the purpose of your video its made for professionals or people who wants to aim high mostly so i do not complain just thought came to my mind i wander if other people feel like me thanks for video thoguh really nice video it helps a lot full knight paired with trolls warlocks and one assassin is great checkout my video here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjtigeufwqhct27s what happens when i put 2 daemons in the game will they put off the efficacy of daemon what happens if there are 2 daemons and anti mage hero protip go for 9 assassins trust me i think having 9s of specific alliances is actually pretty strong in most cases you get extra alliances as a byproduct knights troll warlock imba 1159 hahaha xd come up with a catchy sign off man cant wait to hear it whos playing underlords mobile here i think you can separate the alliances into these simple tiers primary alliances you want to build around and are consistently good in the meta warrior knight mages secondary alliances that synergises well with primary heartlesswarriorknight dragonknight mages humanwarrior knight tertiary alliances that synergises only somewhat with primary elfknight warrior demonwarrior knight troll warrior knight humanmages independent alliances that is strong on its own hunter deadeye in most matches youre going to want to play around all of the above alliances its the meta and you should just accept it other builds are garbage in most scenario now theres a catch all of these builds are counterable theyre good against most other lineups including their own but it is extremely bad against one specific combination eg warrior falls to mages knights falls to demon mages falls to scaled and so on but generally in most lobbies you want to bu if you get two inventor exploding skills stacked and build inventor and scrappy its so cheese lmao yo swim can you at least just try to go full 9 elusives and 1 viper for burst if you get that item that makes them invisible for 3 secs dont put a 10th unit i swear its low key op just get cloak and hood and pipe when you can and druid global that heals thats all you need if you get to pa or ta 3 its over i swear forged in battles axe juggernaut is really tanky can you do a video on the best mage comp my dude thank you for the breakdown i think i understand so much better now youre analysis is really good how do you not have at least 100k subs well ill do my part to get you there watched these vids and just got 1st place from having 2hp with 7 remaining great series where the hell is gwent on this channel o yo you say to exclude viper from your assassins build but i feel like taking viper or puck is super helpful in those because then you can grab a dragon knight and that dragon form is just plain broken atm im sure this will be fixed but still in either case you can grab 1 extra knight with the dragon knight and have a good defensive supplement if you have mages which includes cm and puck then grab dragon knight and omniknight i think it works really well as he just spams the heal while dragon knight spams his dragon breath lowering the enemy damage with assassins you can go more for the abbadon to work on the heartless buff to increase the dmg of your assassins while pairing your knights with dragon knight and giving the extra defensive ability of the shield these are some very nice and informational videos regarding how to end them what a lot of other content producers seem to do is find a fixed phrase to conclude with or use outtro musicgraphics oh yeah theres scrappy really nice video happy someone makes good underlords content and is not dedicated only to tft subscribed best underlords streamer so far yay i have a feeling this game is gonna stay love your videos won two out of my first five games from your strats keep up the great work i dont usually comment but thank you for making such good videos your videos are great swim probably the best underlords videos your guides helped me get much better in the game keep on the amazing work thanks for the video bro its really helping im almost liutenant right now i just watched a fortnite video from the gamer couple you both have the same intro song looool this has was something i have been wondering about i didnt want to take the risk of running a new comp so this helped a lot lately i have been running knights with assassins or mages and i find that works really well it is so sad that you delete all your gwent video as a new player to underlords i love this content but id suggest moving away from saying elves instead of elusive and similar carry overs from auto chess it can confuse people who may not have figured out what they mean content is hella good but hey man chill with the ads i really enjoyed the ending i want to see you go 100 coins with the dragon item what about a warriors and primordials combo youtubes caption at its best httpsimgurcomdtgrqj1 i find that unlike tft underlords synergy bonuses arent as good as standalone units a 2 star kunka would be better in your comp than a 2 star beast that gets you beast synergy most of the 5 cost units are worth losing synergy bonuses to put into your team i always switch out my entire team comp for 3 mages 2 warlocks and as many 4 cost or 5 cost aoe units as i can late game and this works fairly well at big boss 1 trading 3 of your 6 mages for kunka enigma and tidehunter and you find that those 3 units are doing 50 of your damage anyway just got first using trolls and knights thanks man i hate ur normal stream but these are good wow 0 dislike guess haters havent woken up yet nice vids btw you did not really talk about 6 mage who would you pair them up with thank you i really appreciate the time you put into this like your videos watch you from time of gwent giant dragon kappa i really appreciate your guides and i will look forward to them glhf love the vids keep them comin im new to underlord and that gave away to find you point is you were very helpful

to everything ended up not being good enough sadly or perhaps it was i who wasnt good enough visual representation of world war 2 at 3806 can u stream on youtube i cant login twitch its like everyone was sniping your stream and did what you did hahahahahahaha too many ads in your video you fuck dont clickbait us like that there was no 6 human silence cuz hearthless and u cant call strongest lat egame team in lobby game where ppl play only humans what a build bro minus only 1 more enigma is there a limited number of heroes in the game great challenge tremenda facha papa misleading title thought this was gonna be in a real setting but good build nonetheless im trying out humans to see if theyre actually a viable comp some body can give me free key how do you psst we more of this i hope they make it for mobile game ill pay for it what is the music title in start of the video valve just hoping everybody forgets about how much of a flop artifact was so they released scuffed auto chess omegalul i kinda miss the epic looking high level units refresher pepega desperate or ff would have been so much better still waiting for the mobile version chat babyraging over a game that is still in beta lol and whoever say that the mod is better than this version is pretty rarted the controls are 100x better and way less clunky graphics is pretty good and im actually quite fond of these kind of graphics graphics is opinionbased though and just like the mobile drodo auto chess version they show the alliances so thats great unlike in the mod where you have to constantly manually check on heroes to know what you have which is pretty dumb but it is a mod so i guess its understandable the new features are pretty pog too although i agree on gorp that being able to have only one item on each hero is pretty meh although i guess its kinda understandable because theyre going with a different route with items and you dont really wanna face an assassin who have daedalus rapier and moon shard at the same time the real auto chess he fkin played 7hrs for dis shit when at the begnning he said hell just try this out in the morning lol ahahah can you play this on android the graphics is trash tbh viper is a dragon confirmed pepega i got an auto chess ad over the dota auto chess game lmao dota underlords with autochess ads feelsweirdman everyone in chat such a baby xd windranger looks like she went to rehab but relapsed and somehow has 5 children everyone in chat such a baby xd auto chess mobile better than underlord pepega monkas nightmares of nonstop auto chess posts imo the og auto in workshop is the best what is this shit game i have a friend that work as a janitor in valves hq last night he msg me that he is afraid of valve abandoning this project because he will be the one to fix it if it fails like artifact he is also one of the two people that got told to fix dota bugs please valve my friends wife is missing him she said that she cant sleep alone and at this point im afraid she will cheat on him please dont overwork my friend let him go it this game in dota 2 arcade or in steam did they partner with auto chess creators or did they literally just yoink the concept auto chess ads lol is this game on steam i just wanted to try this out in the morning 7 hours later alright its been 7 hours time for some food psst but in all honestly this doesnt look that bad add some better music new units a map design and this could be good why is the music so loud i cant hear him talk properly scrappy and final flash lul never forget lmao got a fckin auto chess ad when the auto chess mobile is way better valve never fails to dissapoint play the mobile version its also good the name in the playstore is auto chess the auto chess mobile graphics is way better than this what does he mean by psst he really spent 8 hours jebaiting the chat that he was gonna go solo queue the hud is so bad they could have things taking up less part of the screen like in autochess when buying heros for example fonts dont fit the style of the game too where i can get it i really want to play fuck i cant get first comment we need morokai for poor battle pass owners we dont need another auto chess this doesnt look as good as i hoped artifact 20 almost first if i didnt piss the models are trash lol sup fuckers any chance you could make like a sheetpicture of the combs you think are top 5 atm kinda like a cheatsheet for best combs definitely looking forward to the hunters comp just got my ass knocked to the 2nd place by them gyrosniper impossible to play against thanks for the quality content boss 1 im coming for you excellent video with great editing swim you and your editor have been killing it with these guides keep it up which items would you say outvalue unstoppable this item felt incredibly op to me when using a warrior build giving kunkka time to still let his boat out giving two extra seconds to protect the squishies by blocking the path etc the value felt much higher than on any other item but that might just be because the effect is more visible thx for the video liutenant 2 yesterday ranking up booois hey you ever heard of a haircut hey can you make a video on how to counter assasins cuz i just got destroyed by them they also had two tanks in front so i couldnt just turn my deck around any tips and my main comp uses these 8 heroes doo kun pud slap tiny tro i guess you dont play mage much often ever since i got into this game ive seen mage powerful but no team composition guide or strat do they cost a lot is it a hope the enemy doesnt have mage destroying items sladar i generally love 4 scale and 6 hunters by level 8 this generally always destroys the bots on hardest difficulty but i play this on my phone at work what about coordinated assault isnt it good for this build awesome guide like always im wondering if a brawny version can work with forged in battle swim how about for the main variant level 9 i always look for tide hunter or medusa isnt that stronger than putting a level 2 doom or troll warlord amazing work as always swim thanks for the great content just remember hes a vigin dude i got 2nd place twice today losing to 10 warrior stratmy strat was 3 warriors 2 deadeye 3 hunter 2 warlocks need more composition guides like this as i am a complete newbee and have never played auto chess copying these builds and positions helps me a lot i hope you read my comment and make more guides thank you very much for your effort appreciate it highly and back to bb1 in two games keeper of content pumping out the guides keep it up fall from grace makes this comp ultra crazy you can get dragons and knights in along side everything with enigma over necro if youre lucky could the last two units if you get 10 be sniper and gyro by far the best underlords team composition guide ive seengreat content thanks for this homie just got myself to big boss i off a hybrid of the two approaches as i lucked into both retaliate and fall from grace i gotta say i was surprised how hard a bunch of beefslab tanks tore into the opposition with four heartless dudes out p thank you very much for your guides theyre a fantastic resource that helped me markedly improve as a player is pudge the tip of the t to abuse how tanky he is or also to get his ult off ive been placing kunka as the main tank or beside the main tank to get his ult off asap to decrease damage to my units is this not good lieutenant 5 atm if rank matters for unit placement how do you get 3 star characters havent been able to get warriors to work vs the domination of knights ill give this a try next jo swim love your vids alot how about you try something with 4 batriders d i like the beast version better with fall from grace to get 4 undead amazing content bro keep on the good work learning a lot im still having a lot of trouble forming good comps yaaa another guide thank you why do you pick warrior over knight good thank you you are my savior strangely but it is spelled eedgees this guy proves that literally anyone can be lord provided they nolife the game for a few weeks aaa shit man i was laughing so hard at 1458 i mean that am is not even disarmed how did he only do 600 dmg and then the expression at 1520 am i losing again just killed me 3620 yeah totaly not buggy that human global item casually 20 sec stun on kunkka clickbaits clickbaits everywhere wow axe 3 actually looks different from axe 2 lol i hope they do that soon for all 3 star units sometimes your decisions are so frustrating lol wouldnt it make more sense to give pudge the blademail since he has way more hp omg im here actually i think juggernaut is buffed it seems so strong to me in this update cmon we want to see the gigant hp of brawnies at the last round i played troll demon this morning its cool httpsyoutubeg1hhdk8otpw now u know how i feel 70 of my games yeah definitely the worst kappa lol best brownie game ever xd cant believe you were going for a level 3 disruptor u could have rolled for level 3 beastmaster alliance item have been showing up so much lately for me it ruins my games sometimes we need final hp totals for the brawnies that kunkka shooting into the air at the end from tide and then coming down haha get frustrated this dude hahaha i think that you are playing bit wrong this patch yes it good to save gold but key to victory is having tier 3 heroes overall you could roll to get early pre 15th round tier 3 am and tier 2 brawnies but you didnt and kept switching heroes that moment when savjss worst game is like eons of skill ahead of your best not first i prefer tft than this great heroes brother i want to play this game so badly on my phone right now shitt best assasin team i can dream of does suns fan stream if so where where can i play this one yesterday i was happy cause i got 3 heroes 3 stars lol at least u realized that the elusive wasnt in yet haha but yeah i also considered savage after u missed the initial elusive but id go elusive as well i believe its amazing for assassins 3708 im yelling dont put another morphling put the anti mage for elusive bonus omg it drove me crazy well well no chat such a shame is this by any chance the am tournament move to uk its finally raining almost everyday game of luck 3 stars bkb assassins buff more lvl of items wtf arc warden wouldve been so much better than razor qop slark is the top 2 assassins bs is equal to slark only with madness and 3 star morp is the weaker version of sk bounty is weaker than pa ta is useless viper is impossible to roll ridicolous display of luckyness i frickin hate the rng i was havent any 2 at round 89 against 6 2 team and that that had the highest networth with 10 gap with the 2nd highest networth and i had rolled out like 3640 gold just to find a single goddamn natures prophet to make it 2 to complete my 4 druids and what i hated the most is the match system why the fuck i have to face 1 enemy that i cant defeat like 4 in 7 round really need to do improve like really really a lot about that poor rng system thats insane dudee btw mask of madness slark so op when slark is 3starts before watching this i honestly thought that its impossible to win with majorly assasinlineup how to kill dino after newest update damn they r healing 3643 morph 1 imao would love to see more like this especially if you get some good builds or fun games like this just had a fun game myself disgusting frankly 6 scrappy 4 mechs with 2 scaled tankiest motherfuckers ive ever seen got scrappy buff round 1 for gold advantage and the scaled global round 2 whose dps carried me with slardar while i greed the fuck up with 2 bounties and timbersaw won literally every single round in the end had a 3 star tinker slardar bounty timber and clockwork 2 star techies cm tide alchemist with just 1 techies from a lvl 3 too was fucking furious the coward died before i could see it for the first god damn time so all your luck from opening chest went here instead suntv where is viper viewer you skipped it many times viper for 3stars lol was this before the primordial nerf where is artifact cheater maybe its time for a separate channel fantastic way to open a video 3 why was one drow ranger on your bench for such a long time that was a hell of a game wp tinny how can you play this game so much and not open fort for loss streak and what is your thought on position you should put alchemist in front enjoyed to watch the round looking forward for more unexpected comebacks d good game man come from behind win gotta love the comeback wins so satisfying to beat all the odds and come out victorious haha who needs anessix when you can just buff up your terrorblade with a stonehall pike instead nice comeback you were unlucky with the rolls this game but damm never seen you do that many misstakes beforep amazing game man show of real talent honestly man im so thankful i found another good

my friend hey pal im a bit concerned since youve been having these throat problems for a while im not a doc or anything alike but it may help to somehow to make the air inside more humid i guess its very dry and some good air moisturizer may help btw keep up the great content i had to delete the game unfortunately got too addictedim awful with games xd did you maybe mean 4 savage 4 warlock in the title and description not scaled what a balance team i feel jealously cool combo matt d have you tried brawnybrute with either jullboth versions or hobgenlets go crazy misses a lot of things that are important in the genre like levels letting you put more units on the board and giving you access to stronger units plus it misses the risk vs reward push your luck aspect of holding onto gold for interest andor spending it to reroll the idea of getting multiple of the same unit to level it up to make it more powerful and so many other small nuanced things that could have easily been mentioned in a summary video like this great strategy game so dota was a custom map of wow and now we got autochess made of dota heroes i was wondering what dota underlords was thought it was something else not their version of autochess thanks for the lesson 257 i rlly dont like this this is so riotlike thats what they did while copying dota as well making it easier to comeback when you are loosing i think that shouldnt be the case uhh wait so what do you actually do should have researched this more and delved into the history and some important aspects of gameplay like interest on money the push vs pull and risk vs reward and push your luck style of gameplay you also didnt mention arena of evolution red tides which is a great autobattler with some interesting stuff idk how to change my auto chess like others mobile legends dota 2 i love the genre been addicted to underlords alot since it has mobile version havent played tft but thinking about changing since its more popular and i played lol alot before and riot is probably gonna make a mobile version where to get the pc version wtf is autobattler can i let 2 units aclick behind each other and call that autobattler i love this genre score esports did this already months ago dont watch this watch video game dunkey why dont riot make arcade mode to make prospect games instead of copying others the hell dota 2 is timeless i am wondering how they make money skins in tft just another quasi genre not amused my fellow gamer dudes looks difficult its the way valve to milk us more auto chess is the best been wondering what this is its terrible might as well be a cell phone game auto chess is an insult to the true kings game chess change the name no mention of clash royale cmon ign what exactly is auto chess a horrible game that just popped up i didnt need to watch this could of watched dunkey and it would have been funnier who knew those chess nerds from school was on to something its funny that he mentions that so that he doesnt get screwed over the copying the models from dota when its the dota who did the same thing from warcraft models inch away for getting sued haha exactly my thoughts underlords is the shallowest hmmm nowadays as much as they want to ripoff old w3 map ideas they will never have the diversity needed to keep the game running longterm thats why pokemon defense is still after 15 years way better than any of these games when the lol copying dota meme was dying thanks to the countless amount if times auto chess ads pop up everytime i watch a youtube video i absolutely despise this game especially the annoying repetitive music thats now stuck in my head suddenly forget about auto chess from dota 2 wow which is exactly same auto chess mobile version but than made statement like it is headed toward pc which also mean epic store which is very ironical as auto chess is still in dota 2 auto chess thats crazy i should make a video about this for a future video on my youtube channel didnt mention that underlords is on pc android and ios and team fight tactics is only on pc id say underlords is the best one to get into if you want to dabble auto chess is going to be a fun genre to watch if you understand i dont know why but i prefer drodo auto chess than dota underlords ive just started playing dota underlords and its surprisingly addictive thanks for this one ign oddly enough a lot of people were talking about how to play and get better at auto chess but no one was doing a simple what the heck is this video i just recently got into auto chess on mobile like literally three days ago and only four matches and find it very rewarding i think it will appeal to casual strategy and moba gamers but it smells like something that has esport aspirations which seems to be the trend latelysuper casual games becoming serious esports what is auto chess the next battle royale artifact failed but underlords survived if you like tcgs auto chess is like draft its way better though as an underlord player it really does pain me to say this but i agree with it being the least complex out of them all its still visually the most pleasing though and the lack of item rng makes me rage the least compared to tft all i know is my exboyfriend used to love playing chess with me he was such a perv its a game mode recommended for us by dunkey what exactly is auto chess what artifact should have been damn last year is battle royale now is auto chess auto chess ads ign talking about auto chess ripoff auto chess looks awesome too bad league is gonna have more playerseventhought their game is a lazy one lol he didnt get 2 gold on his losing streak strategy 530 give this game 6 more months of developent embarrasing so glad you made this video been wanting to know about this game blizzard needs to do this their units are much more iconic going for warriors and then not picking half of the warriors lol good explanation how can you be games journalists and be so bad at games missed out on an awesome warlock bonus you could have combined with shadowfiend and some other warlock like you shouldnt be losing this much building up gold just warriors or just assassins is bad you need damage hunterwarrior for example is op you could have gone warlocks with sf or grabbed slark to go with slardar for high armor and magic resistance on all units so much synergy lost to let get more armor lel you will die to techies if you not to sf or razor you just need damage my dudes is this kind of like a mutation of those afk clicking games i know its from dota2 but having only limited control of this reminded me of those kinds of games this looks really interesting will be downloading that guy with efukt name xd im really excited for this game next week free open beta just started checking out this genre am digging it more fun than it first appeared this shit was lowkey so hilarious love the banter guys looks better than artifact visually cluttered and messy compared to autochess mobile seems weird to me that a game with a tiny little screen has more readily accessible info on the screen oh man just remembered you guys support these industry damaging gaas scams ugh has valve made anything original at all since half life even portal was made by some student as far as i can remember that actually looks pretty great how are you even funded

my friends can you play some ranked most of these comps are super flop in ranked boring casual games play some ranked love it nerfed warlock still heal much i kinda feel like rolling in the end would be better the 3 star unit is roughly 2x times better the 2 star that means one abaddon would be equivalent to upgrading to 10 units he would also propably get bat to 3 star and there was a chance to get three more dks thats theoreticly 3 more units vs 1 more2star i do the same mistake sometimes overestimating the 1 unit over more upgrades its so temting to upgrade if you have the money my bloodbound terrorblade made 21k damage but i still only got 2nd place troll bkb roll down for 3stars replace cm with viper or luna why sometimes you buy the unit after the round have started i thought that having dragon for 2dk is really good for his splash damage and makes him a huge dps source while giving him extra safety im no lord player but i think i wouldve ditched cm in favor of puck so that thered be 2 big damage sources dk troll 738 stay close to each others you noobs omni runs to bat lmfao when your carry gets hookd classic doto why wait to buy after round starts oh maaan giff old outro back hey savjz could you do a tribe overlay for the stream just something for the more casual viewers to keep track on whats going on yet hes so unlucky with bat and abaddon stuck on the bench everybody wheres the classic outro me no savjz in thumbnail tt cm for what this patch is so fun several wins with 2 hp hahahaha troll 2 got beaten by a pudge savjz if you see this arcane wardenwith the extended life helm item is absolutely positively hilarious if the another warlock is necro you can maximize the board full of heartless and trolls but saddd and also octarine essence on witch doctor is too good versus bkb i got roughly 24k damage with a terror blade in 1 turn have screenshot if anyone wants to see it 2 lvl 2 dragon without dragon strategy smh troll bkb win epic is knights 35k health 50 reduction comparable to scrappy 3k with 9 armor somebody do the math savjz i havent had seen any lunas also savjz has luna in current shop i laughed so hard at the batman theme the outro please the cuts during quiet sections are reaaalllllly off putting especially when hes buying and sellling units also no outro riott knights is my favorite man and ive always thought they were better or at least more interesting front liners than warriors i had a demon game recently though that was probably the most fun team to put together can someone tell me how tf the brawny alliance works my brawny units are getting kills but still at the same level hp previous patch got me 25k on a terror blade amazing plays as usual exept some fails i want u to watch in vids i have the worst luck ever everyone is getting the things they need and i getting nothing good maybe its because im 10 your new outro reminds me of celery man do you play tff guys if you try giving him advice at least go to twitch chat where he can tell you how wrong you are leaving a youtube comment telling him what to do is pointless he is a lord player and nearly 8k points im pretty sure he knows how to play the damn game 2714 when you nut but she still sucking troll got hooked everybody panic now i saw that disruptr ultimate and then you went noooooo disruptr u dumbass i actually laughed my ass off better with some other like puck or viper 2 dk with dragon form is much better rylai useless 337 that throw was insane rip outro october 9 2016 july 31 2019 came back to underlords now that i dont have to play ranked anymore really enjoying the new patch so far although i fell prey to bugged brawnys immediately i think its better to put bkb on troll instead whats with these new thumbnails is a new editor doing them they look great back to hearthstone new cards most mistake here is not use another dragon to enable the dragon of dk today i used this strategy but with enable the dragon of dk and no one can defeat me again wheres outro leboscky where is the real outro just lost to a fukin pa3 with mom he only have 3 assasin and 4 druids with1 kotl for no reason so the only 3 star he have is pa3 the rest is 2 star with 1 random 3 star from druids only 8 heroes until round 38 i had 5 3 star bs qop morph lina and omni got sk2 dk2 cm2 and viper2 9 heroes still lose to that op pa3 he only have mask of madness its suck so over powered i thought i only watch you in some starcraft 2 games god damn it lowko now im adicted to this game its already on mobile yes but a bit buggy and not all smartphones can log in into steam yet ps use more often the dmgmeter instead of the perkbuff page if u can buy the characters for 1 and sell em for 3 isnt it better economy strategy to buy anything u see and after sell what you dont want to use you should play dota 2 it exactly like heroes of the storms 11026 well good thing youre a streamer and have the victory screen saved in a video d you didnt warp in a single pylon i am disappointed lowko more of this please 3 more ohhhhh i get it riot copied dota autochess for their latest mod lowko i cringe a lot man good luck man and have fun hahahah so this is just 50 of starcraft arcade omg dude did not see this coming lowko playing dota auto chess hahahaha xd lowko i love you bro appreciate to all your good works to the gaming public community keep it up brother you also played tft ps in early go on lvl 2 buy nearly all cos lvl 2s are much stroner in early and there are a lot of good youtubers out there who make rly good videos for example maxim or dadosch but both are german so you need your german skills xd league has auto chess dota has auto chess is auto chess the new thing try mage human combination around tinker lina rylai lowko it burst down all the healing druid and hunter combination wrong autochess game lowko antimage should be at front huhit actually looks like a cool gamei still have my doubts thoughsince the game is free to play do you see a lot of microtransactions in the actual game or is it healthy for now at least top 10 things i did not expect to see on this channel and i love it there is no download button i got an add for autochess on this video and now it is 0025 my eyes are red and i am tired xd congratz on the victory though tft is on pbe for3 days i think hey lowko play league of legends autoches it is more fun you should talk with baumi he did a lot of autochess before it got made into underlord and even did some videos on underlord you should play dota 2 turbo with me haha i am trash anyway plzzzz dont play this boring game now thats something i didnt expect to see from you im surprised whats next dota gameplays i can dream lowko there is a little bit of rng oh my sweet summer child wasnt this a mod for dota 2 did they really just took something off the workshop to profit from lowko have you played dota 1 cuz you said the old name of nature prophet its on ios already dota underlords by valve httpsappsapplecomusappdotaunderlordsid1465996312 lowko play some dota just for fun new names for dota2 heroes by lowko treant protector the tree enchantress huntress sand king sandy boy natures prophet malfurion how long does the second level 2 druid sit there not being used hmm a bit of tips from me yes synergy is important but as the rounds increasing you should also consider choosing strong unit with strong skill aoe stun aoe silence aoe dmg and also try to balance ur synergy unit in defensive and offensive formation ehe you know whatnow i really want to see loko playing dota 2 lol oh yeah really wanted to see dota 2 and its beautiful art assets completely ripped off from warcraft 3 but its from a wc3 mod111 yeah good excuse good vid so far lowko see ya on the streams bud eyyy lowko plays underlords would you consider also playing dota 2 which this was originaly a mod for just for laughs you know we like to watch you struggle second firstsecondfirstsecond first like of the day once more i always take any global on rounds 13 hi savjz how do you bring up the opponents board to line up against yours when i click on other boards it just shows me their perspective instead of putting it across from my own thanks you got crushed because of positioning has savjz stopped playing hearthstone i havent seen his hearthstone games on youtube i crushed a game last night by getting 2 strange bedfellows unfortunately the game knew it was super unfair and refused to give me any attack damageitems had 3 warriors 2 warlocks and the rest were demons you is a verygood good win good win facepalm lot of misplays this match step it up valve i want my sven now better to go for early levels and secure win streak or go for economy waif on the backround is kinda cute savjzlucky d how does he see the opponents and his boards at the same time i fucking love you savjz you are such a good guy am easy control disraptor and tide and all orange was she playing final fantasy looked like it always good to see you having fun savjz gud win there gud win shoutout to savjz for not having ads anywhere in a 42 minute video now thats more like it so when are u switching

click subscribe my friends if you would like to support me in my passion to bring a brighter and more informative videos on auto chess to our viewers across the world please support me on patreon httpswwwpatr i finally hit lord of white spire recently i like to think your vids and streams helped me improve my game keep up all the great work everytime i get 2 summoning stones a very good early druid start along with savages theres always that one guy who destroys me with elusives i hope valve adds in an mkb to counter that shit late game i almost one if my lich hadnt died instantly to pa u lost your free refresh at 14th round it could be lvl 2 luna or puck now i see u still have it at 15th round its possible to cumulate free refreshes every time i go for 9 elusive i end up as 8th or 7th d nice game and explain thank you matt thats a so much better tittle like it my personal favorite 10th units to pair with elusives are arc warden and dragon knight if you get a summoning stone skull basher early then 2 star arc warden is a good stun lock against tankier boards plus every time your opponent attacks the clone instead of the real one it buys you a lot of valuable time if you get a daedalus or are working toward a 3 star puck then dragon knight is a good choice as well i like 9 elusive with slark i like 9 elusive viper he gives assassin and dragon great game matt luna and mirana they are not the same you should have transitioned to damage type of heroes tank heroes will not be as effective in the late game at round 25 just like in dota after the failure of artifacts valve brings you auto chess he is a pay to win player cant do that shit here hahahah he casted the boat right after the silence ended dude disruptor is so trash bro all he does is make every enemy ult at the same time when they leave silence xd i think less rerollls and more xp then the win was there but hindsight is a wonderful thing am i the only one here that notice the frame skipping for the game but his video dont the mobile version is super laggy you should watch claytano play autochesshes definitely doing the right way to win you can learn a lot from him bring back royale me breaths moltyour not allowed to do that whut pc and mobile came out the exact day i think cuz i downloaded it on pc on release and same day for mobile didnt find it in the appstore and googled underlords and got redirected to the appstore again from the website maybe it wasnt meant to be like that xd cool that i can watch you again now cuz fags royale was the reason i was watching your vids which i stopped playing a long time ago d after the update which made the legendaries lvl higher edit sorry for my english skills i got 11k healt with beast master with that strat what is the difference between this iand normal auto chess that brawny buff is amazing with hunter synergy try it discard the phone users they not only play games on the phone they even eat from the toilet bowl omg you are one of the most annoying persons iv ever seen on youtubeguess it was going to happen one daydamn i went off with warlocks and trolls it probably the greatest comp by far 3425 how is he not taking any damage is the healing life based or flat if it is life based that explains it d this guy is so noob lol he just got lucky at the beginning is this that legendary more than 2 but less than 4 valve game no offense but he has absolutely no idea what he is doing he has no clue how to economize and fyi a losing streak can be just as beneficial as a winning streak you are 20 gold and you buy np before the prep round was done do you know what you doing bro you realise had you waited 3 seconds prep would end you would buy np and still get the 2 gold interest lol you just clicking away with no clue on what you are doing no wonder every game has 10 warrior build rofl this is the best valve can give us when we ask for games humans op af should rename myself human supremacy league you like global things well i love you mort aegis is pretty cool but i wouldnt grab it early itll make it so your next loss doesnt reset your win streak and also doesnt take your life away this guy is an utter scrub dude knows nothing about dota this dude is so bad at this game yet he acts like he knows what he talking about he put a proc item on his slowest attacking unit with his vanguard on his fastest attacking unit smh cunning and tinker is fun af and quite broken if you can max them both so im 1st to play that game but he is good i also feel like the rng is garbage in this game most if not all of my games im sitting their with a full bench waiting for upgrades into 3 stars and it also takes forever getting two star units dont reroll until later in the game under lords came out today could you do a video on mobile for us that dont have a pc aegis of the immortal in dota 2 is like a second life in underlords it kinda gives you a no damage if you lose the round effect aegis is the item itself ive got jug with 70 kils with this passive item d so yea its broken jug with 10k health d hey everyone i just uploaded my new video showing me playing and beating the entire princess draft challenge on clash royale id love it if you could show me some love 2121 he rerolled the disruptor which is the unit he just said he needed lol molt the games not toxic you just need different strats everyones shop takes from the same pool and theres a limited number of heroes so if many people are going warrior then there are less warriors in the pool if you use different strats then youll easily find the heroes needed first game thats valve has bought to mobile and its crossplatform do more btd battles he got the boat after the silence duh aegis is just the name of that iteman aegis is a shield but it negates the next damage you take in any upcoming round that you fail to defend you wont take damage that round and any win streaks you have going will not go away play fortnite post any brawl stars video babyy its kinda bad u dont know anything bout dota and playing that game is kinda harder we cant see the gold and shop button molt in clash royale i have your name which is molt if you want your name feel free to dm in instagram which is usernamecyrus i tried this game on mobile and its not that fun but thats my opinion daedalus jugger moonshard treant maelstrom lycan win im totally excited this game come to mobile d medusa is op thats for sure just play one creature and freeze your opponents entire board for the whole game yep thats cool calls his stratitems broken in the title ends up losing i just randomly happend here searching for underlods content but this video really cracked me up i mean there were so many ways he could have won that game but the misplays he made eventually caused him to lose he had a really good setup at the early game theres no question about that but 1 he missed disruptor at around round 18 or so 2 he put the maelstrom at the lowest attack speed hero treant 3 he wasted a huge amount of gold on just bullshit rolling and didnt keep up the interest for the extra income 4 he didnt spread out his pieces when he saw that his opponent was using aoe which is actually the best counter against his tank team comp 5 he took a freaking daedalus over radiance in a team comp when he was talking about the tankiness of his beastmaster for the entire game radiance would have done 10 times as much especially because the opponent also summoned some play the mobile version molt the shop on underlords mobile is a lot shittier than the original one they didnt fix it on mobile they made it worse its out now so install it guys the ages thing means when your hero dies he will respawn a strange but great come is 2 cave clan and mages you need to work on your eco game best auto chess game is still totally accurate battle simulator i think u need to play dota2 first so u can easier understand every item and hero wish my phone could handle this next time can try to put some damage item on beastmaster to help him get more kills nice play you should play the game dota first to get a gist of this game wow steam is slow af theres an unofficial auto chess in playstore having 500k downloads imagine dota 2 a known franchise worldwide hope its not too late seems like a missed opportunity to me moltplay some more auto chess its finally on mobile some of your understanding of mechanics dont work maelstrom is a procced item so you need someone who attacks quickly to get the most out of it and you put it on treant who has the lowest attack speed also the way you say the heros names cracks me up how can i play this dota underlords i download auto chess but i cant find dota underlords yeah this game is bullshit when it comes to rolling molt you should have put moonshard or maelstrom to juggernaut molt you should do a video of both autochess games on mobile so we can check it out and see whats different also aegis usually references something that is protective it was first associated as an attribute of zeus in mythology another example would be the united states aegis missile defense system the in game one essentially gives you loss forgiveness and protects your win streak for a round if you lose hope that helps love your content and fam molt when are you gonna post brawlstars molt can i get a heart gahhh maybe because its still in an early state game just seems very boring i just dont get exited with this one ill still give it some more time is that john wick fortnite molt you should play a gaming app called rivals its a really really great game its about commanding and conquering a certain amount of land by taken them over with your forces its fun you will really enjoy it its definitely a game you would play and have fun clash royale clash is best have you try frag the game is awesome aegis of immortal is a thing in the game dota 2 which is now kept in dota underlords as well in dota 2 if we have a aegis of immortal and we die well get another chance and well spawn instantly with full health and mana and i guess its the same with dota underlords where can i download this version where is the clash royale who else like the other game most another one haha so many upload ty molt your the best and i love the games you play because i play them and their fun no i tried to be firstttt im the first just finished downloading this one yoo first that doom love this update love your videos tinny can i watch these tournament finals anywhere do more games i realy like watching you doom needs targeting logic as great as it can feel for a clutch doom to win you a boardgame losing to it feels garbage especially when like 89 targets dont matter your doom was your salvation judging from afterwards i think putting refresher on doom and then swapping shadowfiend for void spirit would have helped losing a lot of tank and heal but getting more than double he never dooms a doomed hero does he chance for that moneydoom might be very worth oh tinman almost had you i just could not roll a fking gyro apart from that you earned my respect silence here learned a lot from you over the time and was rly honored to play a game vs yoi doom save the day that doom lol nice game y not pipe at the end there so buff to legion nice link to the tierlist httpspuushdmziv4640b87dcdpng do people actually pronounce brooch like swim in this video ive always heard it pronounced as broach as in the piece of jewellery we need updated version d t t we need an update youve helped me a lot learning underlords thanks man was the scythe of vyse mentioned does anyone know if radiance actually stacks it doesnt in normal dota but i dont know how to confirm it here interesting fact dagon on arc warden gets multiple dagon shots recruiter should be tier 1 or 2 free reroll item in tier 5 would even be bad in tier 1 only 20k damage on bat lmao 27k with triple bedfellows terrorbladr artifact tier lmao would recruiter even be worth it to take if it made all rerolls free ac is rated wrong in my mind you only look at the buff ignoring the debuff in my opinion its especially good with assassins they maybe do not cluster like hunters but they jump into the enemy army making one huge cluster in this situation ac is as useful as it would be on hunters because the debuff is as good as the buff a comment on shivas if your primary opponent is assassins you can spread out throw it on lycan at the back and just melt their entire dps core i feel like vicious intent is underrated by you because people normally think that their health is not in the one shot range when its low and therefore decide to keep their gold high for the economy and theres a high chance of them getting knocked out with loads of unspent gold its also great because in the beginning of the late game power spikes are greatly affected by items and lvl 5 units and if you are currently stronger than your enemies its better to not give them a chance to turn the tables i also get very anxious when 4 guys all have 2025 hp or some one guy is really low and you just want him to get eliminated so you can secure a higher place and the ability to one shot those 20 hp guys is just unique rewarding and very satisfying really well researched organized and presented quality content i combine 3 warriors 6 assasins 2 primordials and i have won 3 out of 5 games with that combination whats about tier 2 item aegis of immortal elves are kinda shit right now really now man try running full elves with viper its insane dude really pipe would be your answer against mages and get those cloak and hood when you can and youre good radiance can just burn them away its antiknight meta really mages would be the only problem but you can easily burst their back line with pa and ta really not to mention am great guide swim but theres one thing that isnt really answered in this video when is it justified to take a t2 item over a t3 item for example would a blademail be better than a chain mail are good tier 2 items better than bad t3 items it seems like it but im never sure if the armor calculations work like in dota a chainmail increases your physical ehp by 4060 48 on a 5 armor unit ps and battlefury is a utterly horrible item you can keep the divine rapier in the inventory to not lose it you dont get the benefit from it but you can use it when you got your board online recruiter should get changed to something like moneybags gain 30 gold immediately so it will do the same thing in terms of improving your economy but wont take 15 rounds after you collect a tier 5 item in order to do so love your videos super informative but you keep mentioning naga with retaliate wtf is a naga you talk about slardar and medusa sick but what is naga 2320 batrider with radiance 20k dps so in 20sec fight its 400k damage sorry for nitpicking here swim keep going great list i appreciated hearing your thoughts you earned my sub i dont agree on higher class 9f criminal and vicious intent both are crazy good in specific situations also desperate measures are too high in the list hey swim i have had massive succes whit blink dagger on shadowdevil crazy good brooch is pronounced broach like a pin you wear when blademail says reflects 30 does it mean that it prevents 30 and deals 30 in return or only deals return damage i suppose the latter but the wording is not clear batriderradience is fixed isnt it also there are some class booster stuff like age of chivalry brawnys etc plz create new meta alliance im leitenant 5 and i played 2 games with druids assassins and i took 5 place thanks for vids thanks i think blink dagger is not as useless as you think it is great against magehunters comps just throwing techies in their squishy backline can win the game alone tier list of heroes next assault curious cuirass heroes and alliances ranking when ps venomancer is objectively shit blink got me 1st place me on tinker2 when i had two unstable reactors i had mage build bruh arc warden refresher is insane silver lining is good on early game when punishment is not that high but late game is sucks so hard so putting it high up is kinda miss for me 3818 artifact tier monkas i like how you talk trash so much about elusives i have no problem whatsoever winning with them perhaps youre just trying to dissuade your wouldbe opponents from choosing them because youre scared i hope to play against you soon haha great job very informative but i cant believe you rank a higher class of criminal the lowest among tier 3 in a lot of games if you have some early advantages picking a a higher class of criminal and going to level 10 relatively quickly will result your board be filled with 2 star legendary cards i think this is a very popular game winning strategy and a lot of people even claiming a higher class of criminal is op wow what a indepth video skadi good for both tanking and slow if you use it on an assassin since they draw aggro lvl 3 arc warden refresher is the beast amazing video swim always happy to have more of your guides compare some of the items accross tiers such as radiance vs heart or basher vs battlefury because we get these options in the shop all the time artifact tier rip yeah i was gunna watch it but the way you said item just fucked me on up blink useless you know nothing of the blink dagger shadow fiend what do you think if recruiter granted free rerolls for the rest of the game would that be op you forgot to mention arcane boots is good to place on heroes that charge mana fast like slardar batrider 1 or 2 hits and the arcane activates swim howd you rate recruiter if it instead gave you twice the amount of units seen while buying 10 instead of 5 to buy from permanently even when rerolling though i was thinking tranquil boots were better for tank at early because for early round we need survivability i guess silver lining listed but no aegis would be nice to see the tiers stacked up against the one right belowabove as often you will get a mixed set of up items from 2 tiers this was kinda hard to understand at first because most tier lists are structured with t1 best and t5 worst it took me a few minutes to realize youve just separated the items into their ingame tiers and ordered each tier with the strongest at the top and the weakest at the bottom was wondering where this video was at and then it came up almost instantly when i refreshed the page thank you for all the advice hi lowko whats your music i like it whats the dream build today still 6 mages6 humans combo i mean star craft 2 is clearly the better game lowko i just had an amazing game where i got to stack full heartless and 6 tanks with humans counting as heartless its pretty cool you should try it out in one of your future games the silence lasts a couple seconds but heartless lasts forever and its epic i even got scaly at some point with medusa did you have to ask if your weird 2908 i just hit that tiny so hard thats what my ex gf use to say druid demons build i win everytime seriously try it u need that antimage dude though i love watching u playing dota underlord actually i just love watching u playing any games nohomo anyone do an all demon meme build love your starcraft content and this keep up the great work lowko dont forget to use the lock function it saves your current purchasable i love how lowko is impersonating biased people yaas i love the underlords gameplay also the big clear glass bottle of water rng was amazing on the first game why cant i get your luck when i play this game do the assassin synergy i am surprised your games seem to be bug free despite a 100 ms ping time i get almost 5 second delay on clicks making it almost impossible to upgrade or equip my toons one battle replaced one of my toons with another toon but it was fixed next battle i would lose matches that i actually just won ect interesting concept terrible coding i noticed half my opponents disconnected before i died despite winning that battle just downloaded as watched a couple of your vids now and got curious anyone else having probems running it on linux it started and before anything even happened it crashed out as in i didnt even get as far as a loading screen lowko if you like dungeon builders you should try empires of the undergrowth still in beta but looks really promising d hi lowko whats the music in the background its not in the description did you know that underlords and dota auto chess are not the same much love lowko keep up the great content fyi your 12 hour vid on a plagues tale was long but awesome by the way lowko would you play a blizzard themed autochess there ate already plenty of races and classes good guy lowko uploads 1 hour early a video thats 1 hour 23 minutes so people can finish watching at the same time as other days really seems to be less and less classic pro game review interesting to watch someone else play the game and see the different approach but man a necro 2 is way better than lich one in that team even necro 1 is better because he gives warlock bonus hey lowko have u even cosider to play dota 2 in the chanel or stream just dont forget to tell yt users that u go a do it what do you think of tft viewers probably dont wanna see it huhi like it though i dont get what you see in this game but hey at least youre enjoying yourself fourth battle chess is awesome just not this guy do a artifact honest trailer first yes i loved battle chess thats right artifact i said good

to our viewers across the world please support you are such a nice guys its a joy to watch you33 it kills me when u not put mirana or medusa dude alchemist wont change anything good savage build btw but not ready for end game you should add medusa as i see you can have the 2 star medusa and could activate hunter buff actually i think you could have used kunka there great build matt love those savage zoo games too much ads ok i have to roll for the pudge you can save rerolls now wow that dude with the arc wardens he didnt even have any 3 stars at all hey matt do you know if savage bleeding is physical or magical damage thanks man techies still the best d that end lol who needs a thumbnail anyway xd got here a bit too early i guess disclaimer valve obviously has been putting out patches all the time recently sometimes even multiple per day this guide is more surface level how to generally counter knights not in any specific meta or patch we try to get these guides out to you asap so that they might still feel relevant but of course as time goes by heroes get patched metas change etc in a month knights might be incredibly weak and not even require a counter who knows editor i tried strange bedfellows a few times and it did really well if you get the picks i have been playing knight a lot lately so its good to know how to counter them amazing content ive followed you since gwent and you maintain your sharpness as always never script anything by the way just speak freely suits you best i literally tried out double strange bellow build before watching this video and got first now i high rolled pretty hard 3 star demon hunter and 6 knight 5 demon comp it carved through everything just started watching your videos a few days ago thanks for keeping up with the meta and making relevant videos ive just had like 5 games every single time knights come out on top so i search how to counter knights and your video comes up first posted 19 hours ago last game i played had a sick lineup few good 3 stars 2 star enigma with refresher and still came second to a troll 4knight 6 line up what a joke knight overlords not knight underlords just get lucky and do the demon hunter build again phenomenal video your content is great keep it up man d how do you think deadeye would perform against knights obviously not as a full blown strategy but as an addition to salvagetweak comps slightly for example adding a gyro to your hunter composition my thinking is that deadeye could both help snipe of the nonknight units relatively quickly who often deal a large amount of the compositions damage as knights tend to be fairly low damage with ck and especially dk being the exceptions and also kill off individual weakened knights removing part of the effect that relies on a nearby living knight snipers special ability has largely the same perks as the ones mentioned above while gyrocopters at least perform decently against bunched up melees in theory this sounds quite decent at least as a nichepartial strategy but i question if the effect simply is too marginal to care about adding a gyro so would you run bedfellows with the anti mage and terrorblade then and all other demons be a good anti knight comp i keep trying the builds that youve been posting and its helping me climb and learn the game isnt doom pure damage as in the ability not the hero absolutely loving your underlords content keep it going swim how do battle fury cleave and dk 2s splash damage work in underlords in dota cleavesplash effects deal physical damage that doesnt get reduced by armor meaning its effectively pure damage is the same true for underlords stream when btw nice sub gain the thing with knights is that it seems to be favored by rng across tiers its so easy to transition to 6 knights in late game even without any knights on the field mid game what i started doing is trying out diff build since im new and want experience but also buy and bench lunas batriders and chaos knight depending on how my current build is shaping up i might dump the knights but if im ever projected to lose to another players comp then i start fully committing to knights by late game i would normally have a 2 star batriderlunachaos knight and maybe a omniadon i also auto bench a viper so when i get a dk even at level 1 with 6 knight and dragon bonus it is guaranteed to do well in my last game i happened to have level 2 enigma with level 3 cm and refresher orb on enigma enigma dealed like 12k damage every game that was the most disgusting thing i ever saw sure when they go knight i cant even get a mage drop but when i go knight they all turn into mages fuck this game didnt know that retaliate and the savage global items were pure damage is that a theme across the global items i wonder if unstable reactor is pure damage as well yo swim id really appreciate a how to play mages video summarize the boss and big boss tier in three words too many knights also have you ever seen a slark 3 in 6 warriors with retaliate and radiance its a side to behold eventhough the radiance would be better on a unit that isnt immediatly focused probably its a funny meme tho yo swim been climbing hard since watching your videos about leutenant 5 now or smh with about 30hr playtime are pre level 4 silver lining and forged in battle insanely busted been playing them just like your guides suggest and i never placed below 2nd with eitherwith forged early rolls for bm and jugg pudge drow feed armor reduction or beast bonus with prio on 3 hunter spike and or 6 warriors and silver lining just standard losing streak into mages i was just wondering cause i feel like while other early bonuses are strong they dont seem as game shattering when only picked up once i dont even wanna know what happens if i ever roll 2 forged pre 4 or something like that thanks for the great content and guides some fresh standard gameplay on the way too at last you uploaded a vid about the latest patch nice isnt knight passive a flat reduccin of damage for some details info as the 3 alliances warlock shaman and mage has the mana gain for each hit capped at 20 mana the formula is dmg dealt 375 mana so the capped dmg for mana gain is still 75 not 150 reached bbi today after playing only about maybe 2025 games in total ive lost only 3 on my way there ive never played autochess either a lot of it is down to watching your videos and streams thanks for the content keep up the good work mindblown didnt even realize how important mana info is thanks for the vid i hate underlords mana mechanic my tb 2 has a lot of dmg and it takes him ages to gain 100 mana while in dac tb just need to slap the enemy twice and hes full mana where can i find more indepth mechanics information like that that is really helpful guide i actually didnt know that retalilate ramps up the mana gain there is one thing that bothers me tho some units seem to gain mana much slower than others i am thinking about bounty hunter and tinker and maybe queen of pain it seems like they gain mana 2x slower than other units am i right what about batrider nigguhs stacking his goo every 2 or 3 attacks this guides show some info that you cant just read somewhere its really good please keep giving us info that cant be found elsewhere in the game the awkwardness at the end of the videos is the perfect ending of the videos d can you please make a video about board disposition of your main composition best underlords channel in the world thanks to you i went from outlaw to lieutenant ii and still ranking up love your guides keep it up what about mana gain items can they increase your mana gain more than 10 40 cap do you coach or spectate games for people trying to get better this is very helpful thank you for putting together this video nice guide swim 8th btw petition to make the logo a dab posture swim makes when he sneezes to match his signature move i just started playing and

my friends if you would like to support me in my passion to bring a brighter and more informative two of the same demon should still do pure damage by the way or is it bugged i just had an epic knights game too it plays quite different now feels risky in the mid game but you can still win i was lucky to be against 2x 6 assassin players at the end so i could just put tanks at the back and win hey matt great work buddy ive gotten good with underlords because of you i dont usually watch you stream but ive seen 90 of your youtube vids can you tell me where to get that rng booster man do you know an exact date for season 1 release 2119 the way slardar throws his spear 5 cells away aight imma head out nice game majest btw is a demon hunter build still decent to play why do you not go for the free roll waw nice job your channel rising pretty quick soon you could buy 10k pc keep the good work btw this is the luckiest rng ive seen yet which was for almost whole game gg matt nice luck tho have a lovely day your rng told me to give you a like so i did knight build are the dear of dev how do you compete with others also building the knight team so i won my first match and it was a ranked match i used scrappy hunter because hunters are broken and i like explosions lol only lost 20hp the whole game fortune favors the bold ggwp matt matt how much did that rng booster cost for 1736 to happen five useful units with two glows then free roll into two more glows rip my luck great game as usual matt but can i have your streamer luck until i reach lord matt is it insane luck i believe its just your normal luck level d great game matt love watching your videos before sleep so relaxing compared to playing on my own xd yeah thanks matt got this week off of work so got to much time xd and always waiting for new vids how do you know whos the next opponent swim thanks for the very quality content im not super good at poker i only played for a month lol well no shit youre not even good at poker ive been playing over ten years and can honestly say it takes a lot lot longer than that to get good but thank you for making me good at this game in a day thanks to your videos learned a lot thanks keep it up what do you mean by diminishing outs 2340 video time i dont get your whole talk about outs and how they affect your decision making of when you roll vs level could you elaborate on that very distracting with how much he keeps playing with his hair finally a good content of underlord auto sub and not cringy openly farting can be so strong its like a power move try it in your workplace or relationship great content i love your entertaining vids but the informative content in this video made it the best one of yours ive watched yet in autochess you would roll a lot on lvl 8 with assasins if you level it becomes harder to make lvl 3s of the cheaper units nice video on that radiance choice i think the deadalus on medusa would be way better because the treant was dying in like 2 seconds this is an amazing video you explain so many parts of your thought process its a lot of rampant information but it all makes sense and gives us a great idea of how we should be thinking as we play the game i love hearing your perspective on the economy lvlingrolling outs positioning all of it i came to just skim for an idea of when lose streaking is viable and ended up full screening and watching the full thing great job for that last positioning of the lone druid i dont know man but i feel it would be bad if the lone druid get silenced why dont you use the tree as the main tank i feel better if you switch the position of the lone druid and the tree your vids have been the best learned so much actually useful information what purge did for dota youre doing for underlords and thats so wonderful and necessary keep it up 3926 thats a level 2 dk why is he green if you replace one of the assassins with viper then dk absolutely demolishes their front row when they bunch around the tree also ld one step to the left would isolate his dk aoe in the last rounds love your videos but it triggers me when you say level 2 kunkka etc its 2 star kunkka or even kunka 2 accuracy in terminology is important for effective communication man watching you play with your hair in your streamyoutube is mesmerizing the content is awesome you interact with chat in a very educational way and i learnt a lot from it keep it up i took a break to study poker for a month but im not a pro or something like that funnytalk its like called gambling addiction i just finished a game where i got silver lining second round i lost streak until i had 34 hp then went knight assassin and destroyed everyone i had a three star qop and viper super educating video swim keep it up very informative and fun to watch thank you is there a reason channels are removing old gwent videos i just rocked a victory with only 12 double silver linings so i loss streaked until 25 managed to get 7 3 board it was one hell of a turn around i doubt ill ever do that one again7 love the vids only been playing a week and ive learnt so much from you random question is there a reason why you sometimes pronounce your ts properly and other times you dont i would use positioning if i knew anything about unit ai i have no idea why my assassins dont move and instead let enemy assassins hop on over i have no idea why tidehunter decides to take the longest possible path around the field instead of hitting the unit next to him the purposeful inflections in your words are so annoying i can hardly watch i won my very first game about an hour ago heres what i did i saved my money until i had 30then spent it all and got five tier 2s i was in last place with 69 and won the next 12 matches i saved up from the initial purchases and spent it all again and became unstoppable i won with 41 good do you now any meta strong alliances thanks for the videos swim i just hit big boss 1 ive never played dac and just started playing underlords a week ago so i just wanted to say thanks for making it alot easier to learn with ur videos 3 will the 1 silver lining get you the interest if you started with 29 gold 30 gold as the round finishes templar radiance is better i just played a game where i ended up heads up vs a hunterwarrior player with a 2 kunkk and tide he was level 10 i was level 8 i positioned my kunkkalycan to silence his kunkka and came back from 18hp to his 60hp positioning is op pick an assassin put it as a frontliner success the dj khalid of lies here comes another one how

if you would like to support me in my passion to bring a brighter and more informative videos on auto chess to our viewers across the world please support me on i really hate that ck doesnt 3 stars lol d matt you are my sandman keep it up dude i shall watch you until i slumber hey guys when does he start streaming eastern time and on twitch epic knight battles you got a great humble personality its good streamin man dont change a suggestion matt would it be too much trouble to label the patch update at the bottom corner or something this allows us to know at what patch it is and the content we are viewing your update states 24th july 2019 but primodials are still disarming 419 i know you have a lot of old videos but can you upload new patch instead of the old patch first old patch your rng is entertainment all in itself were grateful to have you your voice is so zen and relaxing that im watching your vids before going to sleep old patch arc warden still makes clones is it just me batrider should stack 10 max but in nmy games it only stack 7 max i think u better get puck than necro matt it make dk spalsh hes not noobfriendly show the alliances tab for the viewers we know you had memorize them already but the viewers dont savjz please can you show us the synergy menu on the right i dont really enjoy 66 savages i usually only go 46 with a summon stone since the dmg from the bleed really falls off late game 26 heartless give about 3x the returns of the 3rd rank of the bleed hence why i rather just take advantage of the strong early game of savages and level up to 10 then go 4 savages furionunless i get a early enchantress three then maiden or necro disruptor and four knights or powerfull warriors scaled kunkka or doom brawny is also an option but good luck getting them in this meta its simply because no savage unit are tanky enought to even capitalize on their own debuff so its generally better to just add the human silence or heartless debuffs depending on what you are up against how do u build your team by alliance or heroes synergy 4 druids suck i dont think so i have won a lot of games with 4 druids savages and 4 druids elusive yesterday i won 2 games in a rown with 4 druids 4 knights viper necro and those victories were not close at all i actually wish your title was six savages sick savajz cmon man the bad thing about summoningdruid build is they are totally countered by 1 single unit disruptor his ulti silences the healingsummoning and thus breaks the whole team why ppl put them in corners tho the treants pathing at 1400 made me laugh because of how stupid it was lol by the way aint doom a unit which a player can fit into any non demon comp as doom lvl 2 is extremely powerful going 6 savage 3 warrior with a last flex is actually very underrated and most of the time uncontested i once made a build of warlocks and trolls with summoning stone and few beasts i was unstoppable until someone had better luck and got full knights if youre gonna go 6 knights consider getting 2 undead abba knight and drow for attack speed you are amazing bro i just want a new left for dead like if youre coming from crowbcat me wow im so excited maybe this new release is team fortress three left 4 dead three half li oh god dammit valve valve new valve game everyone cheering for half life 9 valve its a new dota game disappointment this is exactly why i will never play dota valve makes a new ga never mind its another dota themed game so sick of dota nonsense value plz valve is so lost right now god help them fuck off valve ima sleep on this so hard youd think i was dead this is not the valve game i want to play okay valve is ded theyll never produce anything worthwhile honestly dont know what everybody expects from a hasbeen company that made a decent game or two 20 years ago artifact 2 the not card but dota game valve releases new game finally something new i cant wait to see what it is another fucking dota game welp im gonna go kill myself now dota underlords has already more players than artifact ever had auto chess free valve yeah give us 10 for the beta lmao shit like this makes me want epic game to win open beta means everyone its technically a closed beta cause need the pass buying in to it non dota players sobayed i pleaded with valve please make another game or update some neglected software but all they replied with was dota dota counterstrike i didnt understand it looks fun i just hate that its dota themes wish it was just a fresh game completely why arent they gonna release something half life related oh good more neglect for tf2 and half life and another dota game because thats what everyone wanted alasanother dota game give it to everybody for 10 its not interesting its crap ok buddy ill just play some left 4 dead 2 now fuck dota and anyone who likes this shit i say this as someone who doesnt even give a damn about most of valves shit tf2 community lie down try to not cry cry a lot i see anger there i like miniclip better than valve these days ah yes this is the game that we definitely asked for this looks sooooo boring everyone hey valve hows it going we were just wondering about that new game you were working on so what gam valve dota everyone wwha valve dota another dota game is this valve or blizzard well it was quite obvious they were going to make competition to auto chess and since im waiting for the flagship title well i could not care less ya know if the og dota mod was never made back in the days we wouldve had l4d3 or half life 3 or the heavy update by then drodo already had their mobile game on the market jesus christ how many times are they gonna release dota content i much prefer the riotleague version fuck dota we want half life vnn valve launched a new game me oh really vnn but its dota and a auto chess game me i sleep guess you freaked out over nothing tyler valve lets throw some random games to get the people distracted and then we release a new half life game to get all the atenttion and love we deserve release half life card game valve got massive riots and player drops valve tell me where did we go sooo wrooong in heavys voice got an autochess ad before and after watching this video its official valve just doesnt care about any of us they just want to keep milking the dota community for all its worth releasing garbage like this after the artifact backlash is a spit in the face to all valve fans so is it me or does this all smell like a aw shit here we go again moment do i smell another artifact i think i do well i will predict this will fail people dont want a new dota stop acting like this is a breakthrough in human history its another gimmicky dota spin off just like artifact and isnt all that much to be excited over also valve releasing games isnt going to cause epic to stop buying exclusives imagine how much money and respect theyd get if they released portal 3 or half life 3 yet here they are making yet another dota spin off that no one asked for it will die in a near future anyway you can already play drodos auto chess is both downloadable on their websites as well as mobile stores how is valve first to market they didnt have enough of this dota crap yet why are they charging to get into the beta this is auto chess it is a mod and should be free though i guess gaben is someone who thinks we should pay for those as well in fact it is a mod for dota which in itself was a mod its no secret that dota 2 auto chess has the bleakest future out of all the auto chess games right now so of course people want to check out all the other games and i know you get the battle pass but for the auto chess player who most likely isnt a dota player that is irrelevant at least thr russians are happy why gaben do this i saw auto chess ad before this video kek well if i was on a marketing race against official autochess creators with a chinese backup who refused to create an official game with valve and riot games i would insantly release to not lose this oppurtinity too wut but they had artifact telling you ricardo milos owns valve why the fuck is everyone making this chess game riot is doing it and mobile games are already going sicko mode so why the fuck did this happen all of the sudden i know the mod is popular but this is a sudden explosion dota why you ruin everything motherf not another fucking dota game cool now when are they going to listen to fans and make video games that people want not another dota spinoff that was made by someone else hl3 when whats with valve and dota next year dota vr every halflife portal tf l4d cs fan bruh like i want new games from valve just can it not be tiny dota spinoffs as a dota player its fun looking at the comment section full of fags who never play this game everyone hey umm could we get portal 3 maybe even tf 3 valve releases another dota game everyone fffffffffffuuu beating the dead horse i see everyone can we get a new half life game or maybe a content update for tf2 left4dead 3 portal 3 valve dota dota counter strike compete with the epic games store nigga epic lost as soon as they released that piece of shit this a parody of mobile game called auto chess did they learn nothing from artifact nobody wants this shit give us a new ip or a game with a 3 on the end of it another wortless valve game we need tf2 updates valve released another game yea its called do nevermind and nobody seem to care so lets wait a month for this to have 300 players daily and then have valve make something not frickin dota related god dammit valve wtf even some wonky csgo singleplayer thing would be fine cmon tyler pls give some variety with the stock music before i actually clicked this video ive thought to my self lul cant wait for this one song he used in every video since 1923 and tf2 is like sitting near table fire is around a merc like soldier or heavy who says this is fine just as lazypurple said i prayed please valve please update sfm so that it doesnt use a in 2008 version of tf2 why do you curse me to manually animate things as simple as picking up engineer buildings and using the wrangler but they only responded with dota dota counterstrike i didnt understand these comments give me cancer just disable the comments whats will all the hate toward dota in the comments i played underlords and it was very fun plus auto chess was already popular so valve needed to make this yet another dota game really oh cool another board game 102 youll never live this down tyler community with tears and salt gushing relentlessly from every orifice in their body valve please video games that is not cards monkey paw finger breaks valve remember the game artifact that game flopped hard now valve need to make an actual game its like they saw your last video and just took your advice lol xd is it me or anything dota themed with dota in the name that is not dota 2 is a total crap i mean all games released after dota 2 this gonna fluck if epic made halflife 3 clone im wait for valve annonce on next day i want to commit neck rope on the bright side they finally released a third game for a title no one cares about dota dota not interested ive given up on that they will ever make a new game first it was a shitty magic ripoff and now a stratego ripoff its weird how a custom map for blizzards warcraft has become the new flagship for valve these are dark times indeed also does icefrog gain any royalties from all this another dota gameugh make a vid about how valve should do somting now to get half life out the door for 10 dollars anyone can get a hold of valves newest title man you cant really shake off that clickbaity nature can you for 10 dollars you can get into it early closed beta the game is free and will be free its not a new game its another dota update valve doesnt make games anymore they make money and thats it its a dota game but its a third dota game from valve d fucking dota again another game nobody asked for just like the card game awww but hate playing mobas theyre usually a single map and the heroes dont do anything cool especially when its top down valve just released another game that nobody gives a shit about dota chinese audience and people still think epic is for the chinese 2018 dota cards 2019 dota chess 2020 dota connect 4 2021 dota scrabble 2022 dota hungry hungry hippos well fucking grand do people want half life 3 portal 3 or left for dead 3 maybe a spinoff of any of them or maybe team fortress 2 no dota fucking dota but im not surpised because the game before this was artifact so im not suprised at all get a reality check valve ffs another dota game ffs whats next tf2 themed backgammon game nein not gonna play this rng game another dota game because no one loves tf2 anymore not even the pan maybe its time to cash out my vast collection of stranges looks kinda boring but maybe itll be ok for a mobile game thats three dota games in a row with a bunch of tech demos mixed between them people wonder why i consider dota the game that killed valve well everyone look that this and see exactly what i mean they couldnt make a half life sequel in nearly 12 years but dota gets three games back to back im sure this is what everyone wanted valve releases new dota game the entirety of the internet how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man first i thought autochess already came out on mobile ah yes a new groundbreaking aaa experience from the industry giant valve a true gem that clearly took many years to create and thousands of work hours of playtesting to polish to deliver us a worthy successor to their amazing popular card game artifact its nice to see that after all these years valve still makes quality games we knew them for they just cant get away this fucking dota shit another doa game day 2145 still no half life 3 or you just wait a week and dont give them money i mean 10 bucks for a couple of days really idnt worth it whether or not you like the dota franchise the dota branding or autochess as a mechanic this is a new valve game thats it thats all they have its a game that relies entirely on the reputation of the company its from a company that made their last good game six years ago new revolutionary chess game valve really knows what we need and i thought it was gonna be dota royale who the fuck cares about dota petition to kidnap every dota players unless they stop playing it so valve wouldnt milk the shit out of that boring ass game valve is really shooting itself in the foot by putting out another dota game so soon after the last one flopped no one cares about dota as a franchise ah shit here we go again this doesnt count i cant believe valve did it so fast haha they always had idc attitude last few years company whos historically made exclusively fpses and redefined the entire genre for well over a decade thats now trying to be hip with the new hipster genres did someone say dota chess stop releasing dota related games valve but the answer i got was dota dota counterstrike i didnt understand yay another game that no one asked for itll be dead in 2 months and tyler will shill until it ends up like artifact everyone in teh comment section is complaining at least give it a test i dont give two fucks about dota update fucking tf2 and maybe ill buy the steam index note if you dont update tf2 i wont buy the steam index another artifact what a surprise why tyler you made a video about underlords and showed us dota auto chess gameplay instead a part of me wishes they made the announcement with a big mysterious trailer in front of a huge crowd just so we can hear the audience reaction when they realise its another dota spinoff game serves the guy right for going with the enemy every ad i get on youtube recently is drodo auto chess including that video i think drodo are the first into a marketing still waiting for dotas battle royale these things should be called dlcs at this point cool artifact 2 i guess the only way to make valve react these days is to threaten their hold on the money valve releases a new dota game tf2 fanbase gaben please bless us with a new update a new map a class update anything but please update this game it has been 2 years please put new game in quotes next time fuck dota really cant wait to see how they monetize it at this point saying theres a new valve game feels like clickbait i dont understand why so many comments are negative some of us are truly passionate about dota and many people like me have played hundreds of hours of autochess its a fun concept i understand that players want their favourite franchise to get a new game i also want that but there is no need to be so negative about it this isnt as bad as artifact there are actually trens of thousands of people who genuinely want this game dear valvethe only games we need from you currently areleft 4 dead 3portal 3 and halflife 3 no we dont want more dotano we dont need more skins on cs gowe do need some tf2 updates thanksthat is all for now i think antivalve time worries me more than standard model valve time boy howdy i sure do love d o t a did valve forget they were built on great fpss dota so its basically nothing get back to work folks nothing to see here even more dota shit yay kms the index knuckles is getting shipped and underlords took from about early 2019 until now to make and ship so valve is capable of getting things done it just depends what it is and how badif they want to do it im willing to bet a lot of the current employees at valve dont want to work on any very ambitious projects like hl3 because they figure its easier to do nothing about them instead thats why the games that we are getting now are dinky little dota spinoff games no one cares about and in the valley of gods that valve bought out the studio making it valve needs to pull their head out their ass and wake the hell up wake up and smell the ashes another damn dota game 146 we have 3 mayor players valve riot and who else remember when valve revolutionized the single player fps story telling genre man who gives a fuck about dota well that escalated quickly valve needs to stop releasing random ass games valve is actually retarded at this point great valve yet again showing us how out of touch they are valve releases a new game vnn hapiness noises i like the idea of valve using the dota ip to make new and interesting games but this just plain looks disappointing plus its not really available to everyone like you said because you need the dota battlepass to play it not everyone plays dota so valve not just making a true free open beta is beyond me i really hope this isnt their replacement for artifact the resources wouldve been better spent on anything else if you ask me another dota game were is the heavy update well welcome to chess news network for the next 18 months dota chess wow so a mod for dota 2 is getting turned into a game while dota was originally a mod for world of warcraft 3 huh time to mod underlords halflife 3 nah another dota game ill make it for you in a month at least it forces them to do some hardcore source 2 performance optimization to make sure it even runs smooth on phones cool more boring games screw dota a game for weaboos yeah cause we needed another fucking dota game why all the hate for dota in these comments sure i have never played a moba game myself but i do not see anything wrong with valve improving on the genre if they want to auto chess may not be what we want as fps lovers but valve gives us hope by being somewhat competitive time to fetch my suicide bullet reminder that valve can make a portal vr game albeit more of a test in 3 months an auto chess game in just a few weeks all within source 2 and theyre still waiting to port csgo and tf2 to source 2 three dota game made by valve whoever did this bring back the real valve pls after this ive completely lost my hope for any half life game and to be honest the small flame i was barelly keeping alive for the past 12 years is now completely gone a fucking autochess game what the fuck are they thinking it already looks awful please valve just say it its just one sentence we dont care about what you want we want money if they just said that we all could go home and stop bothering them with all of these requests for the third installments of their franchises another dumb ass game from valve yeah im done got an auto chess ad before this vid lul thers no 3 can steam release something that isnt dota for 5 seconds you all guys talkin shit but i have to say this game is very good give it a try im serious its very fun valve can make stuff like half life and left 4 dead but this is the quality of games they are releasing in their biggest competition ever compete with epic game valve could sleep and they would still do that 70 chance this is one of the reasons tf2 has slowed down is he saying maba cause i dont get any results when i google that i saw an auto chess ad on this video vave now have 3 dota games 3 wow thats interesting but i sure dont care ill start caring about new valve games again when they stop realising dota related shit imagine ending terrible news with have a good day seriously fuck valve for the eighth time everybody disliked that on witch engine is it running valve just released a new game dota kcuf valve first cards now chess and then what fuckin uno the last 5 years have been rough for people who dont care about dota nor vr sorry trolls this is nothing short of a version of a mod that was popular in their game workshop for dota 2 and not a real investment project they tried to work a deal with the creator of the mod and that business didnt work out perfectly for both parties they paid to be able to make their own stand alone game of the popular mod and here it is once again valves business method of free modding opens paths for our future enjoy it for a change anyone else find the amount of people writing off the game just because its dotarelated really pathetic lol the hate shows how stubborn this community can be while a majority of people are enjoying fun games oh well their loss fans hl3tf3l4d3portal 3 please valve looks at steam charts steam chats dota player count through the roof valve dota then wow nice 2010 android game valve valve is bitch that has hard time to please seriously wtf is valve doing this is basically board gamechess and it looks like fucking shit valve time to step your game and get back at making great games again that made valve what it is now there will come a day when dota will fail and valve will fall however valve will soon rise from the ashes of its regret and return to what made people love them and not what made the most money volvo thanks for the autochess game but like can we have a game that isnt dota friend does valve even make video games anymore me well yes but actually no nobody likes auto chess plz stop valve dota underworlds csgo operation plezz tf2 localization files artifact shouldnt have been made when gabe newell himself just accepting his notoriety and making a joke in it in his dota 2 voice pack i lost hope on valve i bet the upcoming vr game is dota vr i miss valves singleplayer games i really wish valve felt any motivation to do something with any of their ips other than dota and counterstrike got an ad for auto chess when i played the video all these people being down on the fact that its a dota game and im just sitting here excited that valve is actually shipping things simi consistently again dota released a new valve game looks like our spin off of dota didnt work lets make another is it half life no not a sequal to old ips then why should i care can we have a non fucking dota game hopefullty this has a better fate than artifact lmao fuckign doubt it maba is dead from start why you say its huge companies only want to make more money quick d isapointing o me t valve a please am i the only one who has never cared about dota or watching e3 sucked literally everyone is chasing the mobile money now why cant we get a non dota game dota is the only valve game i hate everyone need to realize that valve is an investor nowadays portal is them investing on cool indie game concept artifact is richard garfield came to them with an idea and valve searching to expand dota 2 lore and finally this a game that originated from their game custom game engine valvs is changing but its not a bad thing the funny thing about dota is that the majority of dota fans dont care about other valve games and the majority of valve fans dont care about dota fuck dota and everything related to it wtf is exactly this game name one ip valve actually cares other than dota and csgo you dont alright the odds of having heavy update sooner have increased give me a description on how this game plays i have no idea what i am looking at this is like the second dota game that valve released in a year while the rest of their ips remain dormant tired of this tbh another dota game when will you learn when will you learn that your actions have consequences team fortress game or update please sniff valve should have also given beta access to artifact purchasers wooooooooow im so excited residentsleeper okay real talk i feel like dota is the second worst brand valve could be choosing to make all these spinoff games with the first being halflife because then theyd be accused of disrespecting its legacy in large part because dota 2 is perhaps best known simply for having one of the most toxic playerbases on earth out of the three or so tangentially gamingfocused discord servers im in which total maybe a couple hundred people i dont think anyone in them plays dota 2 for this exact reason to boot i have absolutely no idea what auto chess is if you showed me such a game built as a tf2 or portal spinoff shit if you showed me one built as a l4d spinoff i might go okay i dont know what auto chess is but i guess ill at least see if i like it as it stands now my reaction is what the hell is auto chess and why should i care what about a tf2 update tyler mcvicker what is valve doing autochess already had 2 competitors valve the singular entity tyler my son watch this releases game tyler mcvicker hnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggg everyone else oh they arent first to market did u do any research i secretly hoping for this underlords game is a fps for dota buut nooo its a fucking chess what a joke im very furious right now due to i being a tf2 player valve cant make their own games anymore uses mango on courier lol oh shit here we go again that video came out quick yet another dota game is almost just as bad as yet another skyrim port another dota game how surprising and exciting not what most volvo fans want but im happy for them kind of sucks you have to pay to play right now especially since they plan on releasing it a week from now still i guess i understand why theyre doing it this way not only do they get some more money out of it but its also guaranteed that people who actually want to improve the game will most likely get the pass thus providing them a good number of testers for all instance and purposes free clever move all in all note im not saying everyone who gets the pass will be a good tester just saying a good number of them will at least be somewhat dedicated so its technically dota 2 chess edition 1 right who cares where is valves 3 vr full length games valve releases a game and litterally noone except for this channel is talking about it seriously i managed to find a single post on rgames talking about it and it had less than 300 upvotes twitch has less than 15k people watching this in total this shit is already a flop everybody go at this new dota game store page and spam negative reviews about valve not caring for other games such as l4d3 for me this is starting a war i am sick and tired of fucking dota do literally anything else oh my god its just fucking chess why not a team fortress 3 or halflife 3 do they not care about their other fans cool valve chasing yet another trend are you fucking with me another dota game aaaand its another dota game i mean it was obvious considering the great succes that artifact was who cares about auto chess me see valve still makes ga tyler its a dota game me oh at least it means we dont have to use that epic hellstore this entire comment section what company makes more smaller simple quicker and more often than large scale fps games what they use their most popular and most well suited ip instead of a lesser know one with a artstyle and timeperiod less suited for the games yes they should update tf2 but it makes a lot more sense both in terms of context card games are often fantasy themed autochess was a dota gamemode and money dota is still more popular than tf2 sadly also again dota fans are more likely to want this than fps fans would be to make these games based on dota with the way valve works the bigger the project takes the exponentially longer it might take to perfect and the more likely its to be cancelled they are making strides to fix this but i highly doubt they managed to do that to a degree where we are gonna see a new large valve game every year or two even if they had no problems chess is just easier than a complex fps with story voiceacting more cont great dota great more dota garbage cant wait for this to flop immediately like another dota related project valve worked fast on this one yeah im as shocked as everyone else wow kripparian made a video too and just for saying it out it came out before yours another dota shit game enough with this bullshit we want fps games like tf2 or portal possible to find the outro song anywhere remembers everything about artifact ah shit here we go again whats their obsession with dota oh boy another fucking dota game who fucking cares call me when they actually do something wow valve this is a first this is what they consider worth the wait oh boy another game i dont really care about valves latest releases a battle royale some shit mobile game with the portal ip pasted on it and mobalite fad chasing gags its funny how many people are giving valve shit for actually moving forward in these comments its something i personally have no interest in dota and likely never will but id rather valve release something for a franchise i dont care about than nothing at all at the very least its a sign of life that something can move forward this quickly oh gee another dota title dota this dota that cant we just go back to the good ol days after tf2 well this was a disappointment spy so what will it take for them to work on and release halflife 3 a tf2 update i mostly want answers and communication at this point i legit couldnt care less about dota and it baffles me its their most profitable game despite the fact i never hear about it and when i do its valve releasing a spinoff game nobody fuckn wants if this chess game is good great i get another game to enjoy if this game fails itll be another lesson to valve to please work on something else ffs i dont even care if its updating their old ip or making a new one i want a real innovative game from them are the niggas who work at valve stupid like fr theyve released a dota game before this and it was total shit and everyone hated it and now literally another fucking dota game niggas when u gon release half life 3 at least give us the heavy update bruh valve somehow is the first to market ha ha me myself as a dota player does not give a flying fuck about this chess game or whatever it is what the fuck is the game even is it just autochess im confused i clicked on this video well knowing it would be some crap like this and im still disappointed tyler speaks fast at the beginning that means hes exited valve clearly doesnt want my business yeah but its dota so who cares maba isnt going to catch on valve remember you have other games 3 with this this means valve can finish something fast the game started in early 2019 and is in a beta state now wow like it or not dota is valves current money machine they make about 72m in only 37 days and keep growing i dont fucking care about dota calling this a new game is laughable gaben pls we know you love dota but we would prefer new games rather than ripoffs of other games with dota slapped on it oh boy another dota game loved the comment and valve somehow is the first to market by this point itd be a safe bet that the flagship title is dota related valve can you just please give your other franchises some attention dota dota dota i dont give a shit about dota yall hear sumn i wouldnt really call it a new game if its just another dota spinoff remember when they used to make original innovative and fun story driven games i love seeing this right after your sort of heavy breathing video about valve needing to come out with it quick lol that being said i dont give a shitv about these dumb maba games honestly i dont really care about dota myself just like most people seemingly but its still fun to see valve actually making games and it makes me hopeful for the future since gabe said the reason why they havent been making games is because theyve been focusing on hardware and steam but that theyre now in a place where they can focus on both and seeing artifact dota underlords the valve index all within a fairly short timespan is pretty cool wow thats interesting but i sure dont care talk about halflife vr thanks for the bad news good that valve has time to produce a bullshit game seriously how much can a classic fan halflife2 get kicked in the balls even more yes i am pissed reinventing chess awesome a new game from val its another fucking dota game hope this gets popular cuz in auto chess this is the current balance of the game a well balanced team of 6 3star tanks 3 3star ranger 2 3star mage 1 will lose against this 2star assasins 6 and i am like srsly 6 assasins that are only 2 stars will just annihilate a well balanced 3 star team ok then i will only spam assasins from now on why should i bother with other classes and their bonuses when assasins can just steam roll everything open beta dota battle pass owners so tf2 update leaks when well boys we are bringing back the old doom poster gang cant wait to see how valve f this up again just make a half life game valve a normal hl game no vr no bs just push a good game and a excellent engine that people can play whit and create mods i guess its the steop in the right direction just what weve all been asking forfuck you valve sick of your shit valve must have been doing at least some networking and integration stuff before they even started on the game itself all that cross platforming its the easiest thing to do i dont think sm come on not dota again well at least its something something that wont fill the empty hole in my heart dota 2 battle pass i think ill pass on that one sees that valve released a new game sees its another shit game like dota cries still no source 2 sdk fun game tho can someone explain how this game works and will play fuck this gay shit thing is you would never know if it was you who made them release it prob not tho lol fucking dita bollock everyone halflife please valve were very excite to announce underlords a new dota game another year another valve game no one wants valve wouldve succeeded much more if they released a really big update im just saying need tf2 update now valve is just a tard shadow of what it used to be went from hlcs l4d and portal to card games and jumping monkeys chess games everyone we want hl3 portal 3 left 4 dead 3 and the three vr games valve oh so you want some more dota games source 2 yay another dota game people halflife 3 left 4 dead 3 portal 3 valve artifact dota underlords another dota game hey guys remember when valve set the trends instead of chasing them those were good times now we just get dota payforcard game and dota auto chess ripoff valve you know what we all want its not dota the sleeping giant finally woke up this really gives me a lot of hope for valves future i dont understand how dotas valves most successful ip when literally no one in this comment section could give a shit about it oh man dota how exciting valve just released a new game o its auto chess they didnt learn after artifact did they plot twist the flagship franchise they were talking about was dota all along artifact was valve chasing the card game hype danger zone was them chasing the br hype now theyre jumping on the auto chess train wtf happened to the valve i knew me make half life 3 and portal 3 everyone make half life 3 and portal 3 literally everyone make half life 3 and portal 3 valve heres a dota expansion i do not expect anything from valve and even then they manage to disappoint me thats actually pretty smart and pretty interesting it looks as if they were making this game in advance based off of the success of autochess and had advance knowledge that the studio that created autochess had no intention of partnering with valve and were promised suitcases of money by epic this makes me think they are keeping an eye on studios signing exclusivity deals with epic and the partnership with microsoft wasnt divine intervention keep in mind gabe newell worked with microsoft before he founded valve so this may be an example of a mutually beneficial partnership cant wait for dota 2 the tictactoe game vavle makes new game it a dota game suicide rate increases 200 so no hl3 still well wake me up in 15 years i ts f u c k i n g d o t a i had to stop watching half way through because its too depressing that they arent getting around to tf2 fast enough valve can we have something that isnt dota or artifact its been years these days valve software feels more like dota software what up guys its scarce here we are doing a triple upload today valve just doesnt want to announce anything publicly anymore cause in reality nobody asks for this stuff no one wakes up one morning and says i want more dota cashgrabs lets not forget the artifact tease was the biggest cock tease ever telling valve to shut up and just release this stuff when its ready still something valve came out so valve does mobile game clones now oh a new valve title how excit oh its just dota they put the game to be only accessible ingame and with no social media announcement so ppl wouldnt shit on them even more valve fucking abandon this cheap lol ripoff and get back to support your more succesful truly original games i just want my tf2 update oh wow i really really want this what do we do to make more money oh i know make fucking chess this is why i hate valve they only care about dota im would write dont bash valve because of epic game storebut i know youre not that stupidblind have small penis to masturbate mirana porn while play as invis coward like the actual dota dedicated players who spend money for dota battle pass subscriptions well gonna play meat fortress 2 then fuck you valve just fuck you another dota 2 spinoff what the fuck cough cough tf2 update cough cough just leaving this here in case someone finds it a spinoff of dota 2 can you say dota 3 do you need to knowlike dota to play this i absolutely cant stand dota but i do really like chess and of course its a fucking dota game fuck valve so first they give us the dota 2 card game and now dota 2 board game fuck valve valve releases new game oh valve releases new dota game oh nobody not a single soul not a fucking single mind dota hey lets kill and slaughter all of the other well uilt valve ips lmaooosksksks cuz fahk you

didnt we just get a dota card game tyler this is a new valve game we all wanted this right everyone well yes but no man the announcement is like 40 min agoyou work fast man valve looks like our dota card game failed plan b valve saw your last video and listen thanks tyler and so as the war rages on in the great steam epic wars the battle for autochess has begun anotherfuckingdotagameareyouserious valve is finally doing something in response to the epic games competition situation great to hear they didnt go extinct the craziest of reverse valve times wow no thanks im good tyler you fuck dont you dare say new game if its related to dota they listened my dude but y tho valve stop making useless games give us good games not this shitty card games and chess games we want hl3 bitch what the frick valve finally remembered their password on steam ha they listened to you sees title yeahoh another dota game tyler valve wont be able to release this game fast enough valve challenge accepted nothing motivates you to work better than a huge bonfire directly underneath your backside valve because 2 dota games isnt enough this kind of game doesnt really interest me valve won my heart primarily for consistently quality fps games i want a real new game from valve well i never was a dota guy so i dont have thisvalve please make orange box 2 so valve pretty much just makes chess and card games now yes new game yeeey where is heavy and mvm update ffs oh boy more dota am i excited tbh if it aint about me i dont care yes i totally want more dota game dota auto chess i have never played dota but i kinda want to play dota underlords now so csgo has a ton of updates dota 2 gets this tf2 hasnt had an update in 2 years new valve gameoh its dota spinoff where is heavy update those who got excited from the title clearly dont know valve valve is learning wait a second valve makes games i have a feeling most people dont know about dotas existence when looking at valve it just shit its just shitty ass dota not jontron they listened to you holy shit never clicked faster ngl thought it was vr but this also works love your stuff man valve released a new game real shet its dota i sleep ofc its a dota game valve releases a game circa 2019 colourized a new valve game well what do ya know its another dota game what you guys dont have phones me reading the title be like what aww wow finally watch as it fails first literally skipped 3 tuskand says theres a tusk very hard game to play the most you even need is 2 lvl 3 you need 3 of the same to level up to 2 and 3 level 2 to get one to level 3 i for sure didnt leave but it whas so painfull waching you pass over like 4 to 5 tusks and slardars or whats its name befor you started losing you pass over 2 tusks it whas so painfull but good game man you owned them d this is better but i think my phone cant handle this if only you had your melstorm on you win 4900 idk how to win i lose lose lose these are dota2 heroes there is more of them theyl be in the game in the next season droto had to rename them because of copyright but theyre basically the same and the abilities are same too they use abilities that are in dota but oly some of them hi molt its exciting to watch you again playing underlords i didnt leave molt that was insane i actually thought you lose that final round more vids like this pls wow that was close didnt even knew this was 51mins haha well i didnt leave noice pls play dota to under stand heros prefer the mobile version over this one you missed too many tusk man but im confused how you won but nice game btw i didnt leave hehe dude this was rough to watch you need to watch your rounds so you can see what is going on more other than that you were really lucky and missed so many upgrades plus didnt equip some items im not sure if you noticed im in the first 14 of the video but druids level up a unit on board temporarily underlords please the dark blue ones was damage from iitem u equip on that hero is this game from valve i got so frustrated watching this you literally shot yourself in the foot half of a dozen times trying to figure out how druids work they literally work the same as every other unit their abilities just make them stronger without having to build the units you couldve had 3 3 stars at one point very early on full blown lucky win though lol please try arena of evolution its a much more fleshed out auto chess mobile gloves of haste on pudge lmfao stupid he obviously doesnt play dota hahahaha he gave enigma a maelstrom treant protector is warpwood sage not whisper seer molt how old are you when you say it will be at mobile does it mean it will be on android or in google play going all game undefeated then lose to the same guy 5 times in a row i would just delete the game before i broke my computer lol what a crazy gamee molt i personally like the style of the league of legends auto chess game both are very cool and have very cool mechanics of their own if they continue to correctly polish their games then they will both ebd up being amazing games why is your facecam so big i did not leave and bro that came in clutch so this version is just like dc universe cause its darker finally valve releases another game honest question is there something wrong with him or does he just act stupid i didnt leave and dota version is so good compared to the other one you got lucky with that tusk i m internally screaming maelstorm in the last moment i could beat this dude so badly lol missed so many opportunities with three star stats love your content molt keep up the good work i yhink the itens in this one are way too broken but im glad is not that rng like the dragonnest one and you can choose but i think dota version needs more warning like dragonnest to when you can buy a unit to level it up andor have a duplicate in store are you playing this on steami couldnt find it to get upgrade lone druid 1 to2 you need 3 lone druid the lowest level druid will upgraded on combat so basically lone druid will get3 if you have full 4 druid or you upgrade with 3 lone druid 2 off combat i would like to see the other version missed up tusk and slardar 2 times to lvl up on 3 stars xd they should all get together and make an ultra auto chess game and you can choose what your characters look like so you can choose for them too look like the ones from dragonnest or leage or this one and then they can fight each other and then that way they can be more well rounded and make changes and learn from their own seperate games along with finding out with what the people want in their game where do you download this game molt pls can you go in the clan the first order that has a member called lighthelio he made a crazy deck that pushed him 600 trophies thanks dont like it i like the way the other one looks could make a drinking game with this guy everytime he says the lowest star ally druid is upgraded a level big fan of you bro never knew you would do anything with league of legends have been following you for over 5 years now keep on going with the amazing vids lel just when i start playing autochess he does too haha didnt leave 3 hey in bloons td battles im sure i versed you the name was gamingmolt and my name was andre829 fun and exciting experience playing with you bro didnt leave love your vids man been watching for a year or two other version looks better maybe because im used to it to be honest molt the shop gave u so many chances but u just missed them wait molt what if your lowest star druid was lvl 3 so pretend you had the druid buff and all your druids were already lvl 3 would it become lvl 4 i like the original one but i think supercel should make one it would be the best the other one seems more polished animation wise id prefer that one but do what ever one adds and has more content facepalmed hard watching you try and figure out druid dudeliterally im in love with auto chess mobile and now they release this i dont really now if i should quito autochess mobile once this comes on mobile is this game out yet i didnt leave awesome molt keep it up i guess im a trooper how the f u win i like the other version better dragonest i think like if u agree plz why youtubers only play dota chess and not dota ranked cant wait for the league version i personally really like the other auto chess a lot more i dont know how much this game is interesting to play but i feel it slightly boring to watch maybe because of less action and movement going on i was so stressed that he didnt notice his enchantress went up a level every fight because of the druid buff lvl up once on round 5 and plsssss try to stay above 50 gold so many bad plays pls go watch other streamers for a day and u will improve damn much xx dragonest is the best hey molt ive been watching your videos for a year or so now from clash of clans to clash royale to brawl stars and now auto chess and from watching your videos i got my first win on auto chess learning your strategies and it was perfect didnt lose a battle 30 rounds finished 300 with 100 health still so thank you keep doing you i cant send a screen shot of it i wanted to send you lol i dont like drodo autochess standalone game one all characters are chibi color palette just way too similar its like watching sausages slapping each other and i dont know whats going on i didnt leave and the update looks nice but for some reason i still like the other version better and i cant wait to see it in mobile and molt would be so kind to play the game again and tell me more if how to play it and keep it up need battlepass to play this game i didnt even realize how long the video was untill i finished it dont like the look of this so much compared to the other one but good video regardless league of legends players here to check tft gameplay lmao on display is how strong beast warrior is early game despite how much the guy playing tried to throw the game he stayed on a win streak might be mostly the incompetent opponents though this has better graphics but the other one has better gamplay so i choose the other one games take way too long for mobile please let stop auto chess advertising this game seems good but i would rather play the original auto chess they should get all the attention it was like fortnite and apex or fortnite and ther battle royale fortnite got the idea of building so they got the attention i think auto chess deserves the same i didnt leave plus underlings is better than mobile this game is actually so good you make it even better thankyou so much i still like auto chess more please play that one more why u not play like much people for fun why u so frustrated in this game the game make it for fun man lol is this game released for mobile yet im very excited for this game in next weeks open beta release if you are thinking of doing more dota underlords you might want to change your camera position its kind of blocking you gold definitively would love more of underlords auto chess was a way better yo molt i like this but i like the other more maybe im just biased cuz i havent played it yet though 5136 molt 51 minutes is such a long video nick hah noob all of my videos are 50 minutes i like the other version more i like this version more mostly because of the better item mechanics it means in battle your lowest druid on the board is up one level cant wait for this to become open beta i cant play the dragonest one because it wont download on android or bluestacks for me so im looking forward to this one i love these types of games because as ive gotten older and stopped playing video games so much my reflexes arent as good as they used to be it doesnt really matter which one you play you should play whichever one you want theyre basically the same just slightly different i like the original more looks cleaner even just the bars auto chess og i will never play anything else all these games making bootlegs of og basically i hate it until someone explains i hate et is this mobile i like the drodo auto chess more just to let you know molt but still good content i like the old one more but nice video i would choose league of legend auto chess valves underlords or going by riots tftwill probably help you get new viewers i did not leave i stayed and watched u missed all the dooms sladars tusks the other auto chess is better in my opinion i like this one better because of better items the original rely so much on rng store drops and items are meh i think the druid is the same its just worded different idk tho play brawl stars its so funny at the fact that molt and i are total opposites in terms of identifying characters in this one and the autochess mobile since i played the autochess in the dota client while molt hasnt play the original i like the original best molt you made so many mistakes dude you can see the icons in the shop for the same troops that you already have the icons are located below the shop also focus on only the troops that you already have buy new troops only when you lvl up or when you are about to lvl up its 100 that if they work on this version it be the best its graphics and just the way the game is is epic always prefer a better graphic game they do need to make it on mobile tho so i can play haha love dota chess so i prefer this one definitely getting this for mobile moly please dont switch for this game please please please i like the origin one more than this feels like a rip off tbh how did you figure out how druids worked and then seemingly forget i prefer auto chess personally i need help winning in the pawn league im almost out of pawn9 though where ca you find underlords i didnt leave it was too exciting you missed quite a lot of tusk there my boy i prefer playing and watching the dragon nest one autochess all day i hope someone make one piece or anime in general into a game like this one lot of people seem to like the other version better even though this looks more polished another positive this is less likely to turn out to be chinese spyware i have a question i play auto chess mobile are this game from dota and autochess the same game i meanmost characters are the samewich one will be more relevant to play wow that was a crazy game bruh keep these comming the og auto chess is better i just dont like how they literally just copy the whole game i wanted a new mechanic not just a carbon copy of the game this game is better imo do vids for both auto chess u missing so much in your shop man the original one is better i like the other one treant is already lvl 2 the auto chess is better i think the other one is better my opinion i dont like dotaanderloards this need more polishing i like the original more i didnt leave and keep on making great videos for us to look forward to auto chess is better i like the original auto chess mobile better molt please play the original one more thx other game is better the bar means extra damage because of equipment i didnt leave that was sick and keep up the great vids personally enjoy the other auto chess more maybe once this one releases on mobile and more people start playing it people will want this one more and thats fine with me too but until then continue the other one pls looks pretty sick but i still prefer the other auto chess tbh can u play brawl stars love to see more of these videos molt i like the other version better but this version is fine u should alternate between these versions ever auto chess vid these underlords graphics just dont appeal to me i dont know why mobile auto chess is way better in my opinion how can i download hey molt i havent really watched your auto chess videos i was wondering if this game is the same as auto chess but on pc upload more of this mlot play more like this molt we want auto chess we dont want this fucking game guess im gonna move from auto chess to dota underlord so more content from dota underlord please love your vids i didnt leave what a finally duh who would leave but great video others say they have the same moves well they agreed to make seperate games i didnt leave love your videos keep posting i prefer the normal dragonest version i think the one that you played before has a better set up but this is way more appealingthey are both cool but would rather see the old one morekeep up the double uploads mot plzzz play more of the original auto chess i like the first one better but this one is good too tbh whatever you play i will watch this game is coolbut why would it copy the same moves characters do i like this better for the reason that i plqy dota and thr heroes qnd items are more familiar i like this game more than the other im gonna wait for the dita autochess mobile then ill play it and commit i didnt leave and its 7 am 2 me right now game looks neat but im sticking to dragonests game i didnt leave hahaha this video was a rollercoaster of emotions haha id really like to see enemy buffs prefer the original one auto chess mobile is better autochess mobile is way better this one is too dumbed down i didnt leave really enjoying this game i like the graphics much more than the other auto chess game would love for you to keep covering this game keep it up molt play the mobile version revive to old auto chess i didnt leave i love these auto chess games and videos looking forward to all the auto chess coming id like to see a mix of all of them from you obviously i wanna see some more of this im going to play dragonest version so ill definitely watch dragonest but if you upload dota ill watch it just not as immediately so if you want to mix it a little between the two ill be down with that this has better graphic but original one have better gameplay that warlock with claymore at 841 triggers me i like the other one its awesome i got an auto chess ad ty for making a video on this i never would have found out this fun game i think u should had used the enigma instead of the tide earlier to deal with the last guy he was using knight that mean he had alot of magic resistance and armor but enigma would do directly damage to hp i didnt leave my boy i like both versions do a little bit of both but i will definitely get this game on mobile that ending was so clutch and i didnt leave i think auto chest mobile is better in my opinion i didnt leave and you passed up on like three tusks at the end i didnt leave love your vids keep it up found your videos the other day and im a big fan of your auto chess videos im really looking forward to dota underlords and teamfight tactics and i think it is awesome that you are making content about all of them keep up the good work hope to see more dota underlords as well as auto chess mobile watching ur gameplay molt stressed me out to manny good opportunity to hit lvl3 u missed it hahahaha lol anyway good gameplay when mobile up i like the dragonest one morei hope league of legends make a really good one i like the other auto chess more molt since it is like almost midnight for me i will watch the video in the morning i didnt think i was going want to download this gams but the game play i love the style look of it molt theorising druid made me so mad xd when he didnt even realise he upgraded natures prophet xx wish there was a mix between both i still would like to see the dragonest version i tried auto chess and i did not like the game at all i hope they make it for ios the gold number they will release it on mobile june 20 2019 is this game online or like a career mode moooree of this plss make more on that game plss hope they put dota auto chess on mobile this looks much more organized and slick compared to the other auto chess i much prefer watching this one i like the other auto chess better love your content molt keep up the double uploads i would rather auto chess tbh this one is a little better i personally dont really find it as appealing as auto chess but i still may enjoy it i dont even know how to play the game i like the chinese auto chess more it has more soul and looks a bit lighter also it is the original game valve autochess copyed 90 of it got a ad of auto chess before watching youtube are u watching me auto chess looking sick looking forward fot teamfight tactics league of

yesterday 24 brutes 24 brawnies 3 hunters and whatever you get along the way is actually really strong gg beating all those 6 scrappy builds in all my games either 6 scrappy or 6 mages is pretty much an auto win nice plz upload more full length standard modes that maurana 3 star was the right choice going vs the assisans the jump away form the dive can really save a round great game well played selling almost a 3 shadow demon then lostgg 8 players 8 hobgen is anessix out of the meta at lord rank great game i prefer watching regular ranked mode over knockout i wished it went to round 50 ive never seen that creep round that was a good game i enjoy how you dont only post wins so it was exciting to not know if you win or lose wow what a game i dont think i have ever had a game go that long nice win thanks for the standard game cracked 7k subs congrats that was a crazy game damn no view 2 likes youtube 4030 jeeeeeeze that was a close call i love playing knights and it is so much fun to see your emotions during the game remembers me about my own games hope to make it to lord soon and face you in some games would you consider making a video about the strategies of when to lock particularly in the early turns or if its simpler than i realise give me your take in a comment i am totally frustrated the knights are just too strong now i wanna watch this with swims perspective x good game nonetheless omg this lobby is insane congrats on the win was great to watch this live this title isnt even clickbait for the smart dota underlords player because any 3 star hero is really strong with decent alliance still good game came here just for the swim lul please more underlords podcasts they should call insects the swarm or something similar imo imagine an lc with refresher thats be fun spiders arent in the insecta classification glad swim knew all of this both are anthropoda bug is a vague term and not scientific bs in entomology and grad school dropout more ads plz ca n not wati for saeson ibone also just to comment on the comment about it being wierd for 2 units to share both type cough scaly warrior sladar tidehunter cough cough oh sorry had something in my throat 400 her cheeks are just spread you know what i mean sunsfan 2019 a spider is an arachnid not an insect how many ads did you fit in can you guys get an underlords channel im here for dota ads wtf first first hey guys this is more experimental how would you feel with the occasional snippetclip like this not from a full game but fairly educational andor entertaining is this something youd watch often if we did one full game a day and one shorter clip a day or do you prefer 2x longer videosfull game looking for feedback on what type of content you guys like editor good info man keep it up the videos can someone explain to me how interest mechamic work i noticed selling two will give interest but for how long should i do that and why was he hovering 50gold there wasnt a single piece of actual advice in this video now we know what we want how do we know this nothing useful here why not just put all the unlisted gwent videos into a playlist wont affect the algorithm and still keeps them available to watch no decent video idea if it were more structured and maybe slightly longer it would probably be the kind of tip video id prefer and maybe others as well yes please ive been looking for educational videos for a loooong time im still not sure what im doing in dota underlords game yet pointless video this is really nice and helpful you can even stretch it out to 10 min with 2 midrolls for ad revenue xd want more instructional videos also would love highlights instead of full games 160 mana gain epic 6 ace mage late game build its time for new mage builds where we found 6

mage kinda ass 2 units dont even use mana and its really as good as a arcane bootslvl 1 cm it should lower cd by 10 and 20 imo tommy lo i like your video its funny to watch think ogre mage is buffed coz first he casts on himself which means early game is stronger second after casting on himself you can control who to have bloodlust thank you looking to play underlords coming from a history of fps this was great to familiarise myself to this whole new genre of games cheers really helpful video already play quite a bit of tft but underlords has some more subtle nuances that this video helps with youre so underrated man the amount of videos on just literally any mechanic anyone could ever be confused about you are a walking underlords tutorial preciate it the visual effects of underlords is really easy to understand i was able to jump in pretty easily and i love how you can just play bots d the pause function is so good 3 i still am not very good at positioning in the very late game i havent yet been able to score a win because i still am having a hard time with understanding positioning my guys correctly thanks for your guide i stopped playing since the new patch because the game is getting too complicated for a casual player its like you cant play it for fun anymore when you have to watch streamer playing jailbreak system for at least 1 hour everyday then finally you can enjoy the game thanks tonnes ive no idea why would anyone derate this great guide video for me most of the information in this i had already learned from your other videos but for someone in the basic learning phase this video would be a jewel nicely made would annesix hype increase her demons atk since she dont have atks rly nice you put this out i think its a rly complex game where every little help is needed nice work your samychann great video thanks for helping new people learn about this game this series is amazing im always excited to see another upload since the unfortunate end of dota auto chess love you quill what does kunkkas boat do anyway i really cant see any effect what so ever i actually really like these dota underlords videos i prefer leagues tft as a game but your underlords videos are so entertaining keep em coming hobgengang me and you quill havent seen this since they made it official why is the player now also a character thats stupid it was supposed to be about the pets collecting the dota units right your initiature sandking should have the blink p great video but youre a touch quiet i think you could also increase the game music a bit assuming no copyright issues so theres sound when youre not talking between rounds hope to see more of this you actually won with assassinx6wth i have never seen an assassin build do any good after round20 the amount of people ive seen try it and just fall apart late game is staggering there at the end your comp looked like a smiling face and it made me grin w so is the ck2 campaing over saint ava mentioned

informative videos on auto chess to our viewers across the world please support me its better to pick terrorblade n lycan so we have 3 changes form love the commentary i learn a lot from you possibly could have won that if he adjusted the positioning sooner at 1635 doom casts doom silencing the friendly demon dodo ismnt my hero he and ha ha went to jail i dont want to be a hater but i really like it when its just lewis and sips pyrion just changes the dynamic for the worse i think 43 minutes in knights still arent next to eachother respect you even more now lewis after your rant on not loading up lol ppl complaining about team dd content smh wow lewis sucks at autochess poe is dogshit to watch tbh because sips went minions lewis has ed grimley hair over all league of legends has a far better graphics quality and it is also easier to understandnavigate if you like dota or dota ii than you should definately try league of legends and likely you will like it more sips if you vender your entier inventory full of rings its sorta like soj but instead of summoning a uber boss you get lore weave chest peice like 70 of deaths in path of exile are really just a miss use of flasks you need bubbling or seething and a really big long acting one more poe and deep rock god i love sips and i also love ppath of exile lewis brindley 2019 snubbing pflax in 2019 this game is the pinnacle of might be fun to play zero fun to watch heeey im also level 4 but ive never won a game so sadface oof yogs have been playing some dulltowatch stuff lately i find all these auto chess games extremely boring and lame oooof as someone who watches a lot of dota underlords this was very painful to watch more lewis plays path of exile d sees video mixed emotions ahh so many dick ripping moments like not putting knighs together or putting treant protector at the back i am surprised he wont that ive played only a handful of games of underlords but never really felt it was all that interesting that being said the later matches of this game were actually entertaining imo this poe track in the background is nice but its on a loop for an hour and overlaps with dota music 4100 thats my complaint as well sips yes finally that thumbnail of sips is gold 320 my only explanation for why you gain gold when you are on a lose streak is you become ruler and you raise taxes the answer isnt even related to the game and is unofficial my dear bruh elty if youre watching this gimme a like yo thinking about getting this for my phone kind of interesting thank you sunsfan every other one of these is like minimum 30minutes i am so happy i started this random video thinking well lets see if its any good and then the sudden realisation omg yes its sunsfan instant sub any chance you could do a small guide on some of the hidden feature like the chat ui and the slide out that shows the players rank and heroes so all this sounds like chinese to me but this is what i got u place shit and let the game play itself riveting what font using that much more helpful then the ingame tutorial thank you thank you for the short succinct and quick tutorial i hate how everyone else is making 3060 minute videos when all i want is the quick overview youve provided more power to you thank you now i know how to level up my heroes ayee its dotacinema subbed is this coming to android thx for the summary i might be interested now dotacinemavods changed their name to this if anyones wondering what the fuck is this channel sunsfan autosubbing me to a channel about a game i dont even play anymore not very cool youtube or you either sunsfandotacinema if you knew about this wtf youtube why did i automatically get subscribed to this interest is calculated at the start of the roundjust before the fight starts in underlords not at the end of the round like in auto chess how am i subscribed to this wtf why am i already subscribed link to the spreadsheet for the tier list can be found here httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1bbe42cxofqgma1lavfahkkd9tbbjjam8zsu51npewsedituspsharing remember as the game changes as patches hit and updates are released things will change this video may potentially in fact very likely will become outdated as the months go by however the spreadsheet used for this tier list will always remain updated so be sure to bookmark it and as things change so will the tier list this was just an easier method of being able to constantly update the tier list without doing a more visualinfographic type tier list hope you enjoy since i despise warlock alliances either as a user or as the opponent then dawning of ristul is higher in my rank 3 i think blight stone should be higher but not much i guess it depend on what the enemies go and if you are getting heartless n such but in the situation case it should be top 3 t1 item imo nothing over chainmail tho and i guess to some extent everything situational all else is perfect just like your poofy hair and cinder block head of beauty thanks man love lots comment comment comment or something for youtube props is mask of madness ever good on anti mage big time contract is such a huge bait if you only get one you are forced to run shitty units and dont tell me ogre magi is good now hey swim just taking my time to write you a comment before i go to bed i just started playing underlord about a month ago with a lot of old dota now dota is blacklisted in my house by my wife lol experience but no auto chess history i am currently in big boss 2 and i feel like i have improved so much since i started i just want give you a big thanks for all your guides besides this item tier list i really like your balance change analysis and fundamental videos like mana and black listing mechanics cheers thanks good content as always i would say hot will be 10 on 3 star tinker he can tank and spamming those rockets without worrying about death dude that end of video commentary on youtube was epic likedsubscribedand im looking for you on twitch thx id like to add two things helm of the undying is good not only on frontline dps but for clutching a second ult off on pieces like morphling qop or tiny especially if you have some form of mana generation that can be impactful in slow early fights helm is also the goto item for kotl because when he has it on you can put him forward and have him nuke the enemy frontline when it still matters about poaching knife its a situational win more item if you have the top board or an early 3 you can slap it on and reap the rewards of omega economy i ran uncontested magesassins one day and put it on an early 3 qop with primordials and druidsavages in the lobby it was hilarious to earn up to 8 free gold a round but i agree its not good did u forget heart of tarrasque brawnies i know the probability is ridiculously low but the combination is nuts a very reasonable list and i agree with almost every ranking although its a bit unfair to compare the very situational items like fall from grace summoning stone big time contract etc at their best to other items average value id suggest to put the score of these situational items in brackets to clarify that the requirements for them have to meet why is fall from grace concidered solid in savages i know theress lycan but the alliance bleeding dmg is superior isnt it all in all though im very grateful for this list since i was overrating items like poaching knife vanguard and smuggler and concidered blade mail only viable in brawnieson pudge since i didnt knew the dmg procs before resistance will definetly look for it in knights and scrappies from now on thank you for your awesome youtube content keep it going weird to see shivas not only highly rated but also at the top of the list ive seen a lot of pro streamers shitting on it since it basically just fills all the enemies mp bars before yours and they all cast their ultis first granted its probably better against stuff like elusives where you dont care as much about their mp and you care more about their attack speed plus not hitting the ones in back means it doesnt apply the debuff even to the back end units that usually are the fast attackers anyways plus you can play around it by putting one unit forward if it is wrecking you and the slow doesnt even last that long correct me if im wrong but your aegis argument seems flawed or it reveals a greater problem you say that it scales to being more important the later on because the earlier you get an item the more valuable it is because you use it longer therefore it has more impact that idea is fine except for the fact that you dont seem to scale other items scores based on when you will likely get them for example the highest tier items all have absurdly high ratings as they have a very high impact makes sense but you are using them for what 2 or 3 turns if thats the case then chainmail doing less for significantly longer should be ranked higher than them i like your rating system and it makes practical sense on how to decide what to pick when playing a game but aegis seems to fall out of that decision matrix why did they change a higher class of criminal to tier 5 makes no sense ohohohohoho you just dont realizr the true worth of force staff sire thats very good in some situation its indispensable godlike tier item like seriously poaching knife is a amazing win more item it is great when you beat every board other than that it is garbage seems good never picking aiges again i guess with games going over 30 rounds easily now smuggler and embrassment are way better also ageis can be the difference between 4th and 5th place alot of the time as close as games are can you make this not go to htmlview every time so we can make a copy and sort it timbersaw octatine shard spam pure damage two tiles away is totally insane i never knew blade mail reflect unreduced 30 incoming damage i find tranquil boots are especially good on melee units that need to close ground quickly perhaps multiple times each battle also good on units that have large or vulnerable health pools that benefit from the recharge tiny bloodseeker clockwork lycan juggernaut bm am ogre slardar amd treant all benefit from tranqiul boots over most tier 1 or tier 2 items id rate tranquil boots equal to gloves of haste and only slightly below chainmail thank you swim for this very helpful guide how about mask on sniper i know before they patched his ability it was good is it still yeah this veeery little sense most of the time most items are totally situational dependent therefore its score could be 0 in one game and 100 on another poaching knife is great on tinker sniper and pa in my experience depends how quickly you can kill i think i put on tinker early on and got decent procs i would actually say hood is better on a tank because most abilities are magic damage anyways the video we need but dont deserve agree with this list far more than others ive seen and really like the numerical ranking system why is poaching knife not rated with the consideration of putting it in assasin builds sorry noob here is using refresher on sf bad aegis or fall from grace at turn 3 should be an easy pick as your build is not yet defined forcing is quite bad and if you end up in one of the 80 of games where you are not in knights or hunters you most likely simply lose an item with ffg similarly summoning stone although it is far easier to determine whether you are in primordials or savages at this stage of course ffg and summoning stone are great when they are able to hit their build but it is very relevant for their value that they most often will not fit for this reason the safe pick aegis is way better than swim gives it credit for even at early rounds in any case very likely better than arcane boots while other tier 2 items goes also somewhat for the value of blademail are far more situational and you really do not want to have to pick them too early similarly family discount this can easily outpower moonshard when you just get a single key threestar unit in the endgame out of it that you would cant wait for the next item tier list next week what musicsoundtrack is in the background my crosseyed girlfriends boyfriend had to retrain the muscle memory of her eyes in order to watch this great quality content the notes system with loses 10 pts etc is perfect for what its trying to achieve i cant think of another system that wouldnt over complicate it pick aegis whenever i see it okay you forgot octarine ogre instacast wo mana requirements great for grind comps hey man ive been folowing your videos since the first guide i really love this tier list videos but one thing i dont get is why savage is a free wintop 3 i play a lot of savage and i dont even win on early game maybe with a 2 stars venomancer at round 2 but otherwise i consider them a really weak combo another thing i would like to say is that i try many times 9 assasins build and i almost won everyone and if i dont win i get top 3 i prefer them 9999 times over savages xd is mask not good on anti mage nah i dont have to take contract just because is op i dont like it so i dont get it got offered 3 on a game today didnt took it still won hey swim it would be nice if you make an in depth guide for synergies rock paper scissors what a synergies weak against how to counter strats etc thanks is the mask okay on sf underlords university ty professor swim 3 1755 the best of all voice crack time whats the best

to get good on this game damn i keep on loosing its actually called savage but u still call it beast xd good autochess player xd i woldnt call it the new meta you got a lot of lucky rolls with all those 3 the fight was very close but the other guy didnt had a really good board i think the new meta is towards hunters the multiproc of 35 is way more than 35 more dmg because the proc can proc again i would say its above 50 and synergyzes well with some items im definetly on favor of trying new stuff like this thogh why is he talking about about the frozen throne meta at 1949 that game has good meta and its quite old i dont get it warlock beast is amazing but i got troll to spice it up tusk ld lycan venom sf disruptor wd ss bat troll dont say this is the meta valve might nerf veno yeah warlock beast is meta now savjz and savage is a homophone can you explain to me why you want to lose the first round lots of questionable plays in this game surprised he did so well they should remove wicked intent and add the effect as the alliance bonus his accent is so lovable he wants that manchantress real bad xd warlock knights troll is the best meta rn pls come back to hearthstone underlords should add a better significative difference on character level up i miss the skins upgrade of the old auto chess i might take a small break until the warlocks get nerfed a bit all games are so boring the guy with biggest warlocks wins warlock heal is fucking disgusting what do you mean by beasts there is no beast alliance and you should have sold the dk and bought tidehunter and made the save warrior hunter build that ive just won 2 games in a row with i dont even play underlords anymore but i watch every videos u upload hahaha 1137 no they should not it would send the wrong message the dota community is already not happy with the attention underlords is receiving and artifact is still fresh in their memory they advertised artifact at ti and the community bood the shit out of them for it agreed personally i got a double 3 star warlock alliance boost one game and rolled to victory pretty easily i think warlocks is really good against most other comps because they can do a lot of damage and take way more than some tanks could ever tank i think warlock alliance with the alliance perk is the strongest in the game atm way stronger than hunters or primordial thats for sure why did he stop playing hs can some1 answer please always fun to be this early great game by the way ive learned a lot from your stream 4 sprits are broken epic 6 mage 3 spirt combos 16 in the world

subscribe my frien i prefer to go 3 mages and rest spirit using 2x2stars for 2 of them and only focusing one to 3 star5 spirits on board without its ace 6 with him razor and surger for 2 other mages still pwning the noobs hehehe terrifying win i believe positioning the razor w arcane boots in a position where the mana would hit kotl wouldve been good you said by the time kotl ults everything is over and thats because razor was one too left to radiate the mana to him mattjestic title has a typo and the description is spirits not sprits hope the throat is good waves from twobob 6x 2 spirit is better than 3x 3 spirit because trigger delta slam with skill is more important how to counter spirit player is to positioning all heroes on the corner just like cornering to face assassin you can use legion also if youre doing a spirit build right it is equivalent to 5 spirits if you got all 4 spirits could you please teach me how to put each hero on the board hope they allow to choose more than one underlords and you can swap them between rounds where i can watch you live on twitch can someone give me direct link to him if you go out be sure to wear a gas mask for safety first holy shit the fiends were so op 4 days ago i think the problem is my guys are all grouped together proceeds to continually group them all together manually ive learned a lot i knew i was doing something wrong i had no idea you could upgrade units your item placement is horrible but we still love you if he had put assassins in at the end he could have got those two at the back this is really cool im sticking to dota this game sucks ass 36 mins battles ur not even battling ur watching pieces move byu themsefl terrible all ur doing is selceting pi3ees each round and wathcing boringggggg thoroughly enjoyed this 1450 lmao has 0 elusive units sjin lets try that lets put that on someone importantmaybe the tiny facepalm troll craft it about tolling your frends team fight tactics is the new autochess your team is paper thin and you favor low star pieces this looks way more polished than autochess wow this was recorded weeks ago oofthat was pretty painful to watchlol you had a level 2 lone druid one of the strongest units in the game and you sold it and instead put 2 warlocks out one of the weakest units in the game auto chess mod is becoming a standalone game and it will be on epic games launcher and auto chess mobile which is created by the same team as the pc mod is now just auto chess dropping the mobile part out of its name because its getting merged with the pc version and will become crossplatform are you going to try team fight tactics when it comes out you wouldve won if you put daedalus on sf against a gyro seperate into at least two groups and i dont mean one guy as a group that way only half ur guys die not all of them as a fellow horrible auto chess player that was really fun to watch you never leveled to 10 sjin youre the worst at playing this game but we love you i hate people of colour dude you are a f beast i absolutly love your videos especially the item explanation video was very helpful keep rolling tim 3 im gonna have to get used to this new patch i had a 3 star arc warden and lycan with summoning stone and in my rush to get a damage item on arc warden skull basher i passed up on a tombstone was against knights so i figured i needed the damage rather than just a bunch of bodies against knights that might not be dying that fast but it went completely over my head that zombies would benefit from the stone still won thank goodness but wondering if it would have been way easier or worse hard to tell that was sick i feel like dk will prolly get nerfed 3 star smashing teams like slicing into butter dude great explanation keep the hard work props all the way from brazil how many times gaben gave you the chance to have 3 stars arc warden rofl had a game yesterday where i thought i was doing pretty good ran into a three star dk rip me by far my best deck i like to use this build thx for it first have you thought about adding the twitch chat to these videos think it might be nice since there is quite some interaction with the chat during the videos early mass bloodbound into 6 warlocks works pretty well if you can get some contracts go for fast interest and levels then start adding more warlocks as you combine the ogres hhhhheelm of un dye ing for the love of god nerf the boring knights all i know when i see savjz video i go thump up its that the first time i type first nice video but tft suck

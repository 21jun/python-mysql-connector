im not a ravager im an alchemist is that a final fantasy reference ravager is a class in ff 13 and alchemist is a class in other final fantasies i noticed there are fauna and flora in this game there wasnt a lot of that in previous games so when or where in steam world is this is there a new game plus this is like slay the spire but less roguelike looks like the knight is a she im having issues finding this game on the eshop store can anyone help reading every subtitle is painful to listen totalking soooo much just an opinion just start playing dude geez talk to much how far are you in the game i beat it and i am missing 2 tutorial listings yo great vidoe but the first steamworld game was steamworld tower defense though like many i havent played it and only found out about thanks to the internet gameplaystart of game at 224 i want more 3 love the style of the game and the charming characters if this where on 3ds id buy the hell out of it but i cant afford a switch apparently if you cant afford a switch nintendo doesnt want your money why is this not of pc they lost a huge market going only on the switch why did you skip the beginning cutscene one gear to rule them all and in the steam bind them your not the only one but you are very appreciated hey guys did you know that some p5 dlc is coming out some time at the end of this year cant wait to keep seeing you play this found you from stwd2 and will probably watch this all the way through too so please keep pumping these out i insta prepared my wallet full of joy because i love the art the cards just got instakilled by realising its not on pc this could have brightened this week of being sick at home tt it sucks that we cant save decks makes it so much more troublesome when switching characters still i wish that this game is on steam it looks like something up my alley you missed a secret nyehworld quest im here to tell that anybody who commented first or second that there comment is now voided have a good day and you lost me at card game does the game got replyability you try killing the little guy in the hog boss fight in darkest dungeon then youre going to have a bad time anyone speak binary what does it say on the bottom of the cards or its just random 1s and 0s slay the spire is amazing gb needs to give it more love when it comes to ps4 and switch this is card game this is fun so easy as simple jrpg unless im mistaken theres no question of the punch card codes being accurate each one has a unique binary value but what they actually mean depends entirely on the system that reads and interprets them since that system doesnt actually exist theres nothing to judge their verisimilitude on most likely each card in the game has a unique punch code and the theoretical system that would read them would simply have a preprogrammed list of all cards and have each code correspond to a particular cards value in that list without any sort of translation being necessary so its a nonissue all thats necessary for believability is that the cards all have different codes heck is this battle system based on fategrand order jan is awesome this game looks great and i dont like card games i enjoy all the steamworld games i hope this comes to places other than switch though visually reminds me of some old snes rpgs its beautiful the cards look like punch cards i cant get over how cool that is i need more jan in my life i really wish this was on pc i got a backlog of games to play for now hopefully it will be on pc eventually inb4 epic store exclusive had no interest in this previously as none of the steamworld games have managed to grab me but having seen the quick look this looks awesome the battlesystem reminds me of what i remember baten kaitos being like which is one of the few jrpgs i actualy really enjoyed playing as opposed to just being into it out of love for the visualsmusic and storytelling ps still curious why all the vo in baten kaitos sounded tinny as all heck id guess its something to do with how they were compressed never heard anything similar before or after edit oh fuck ben mentions baten kaitos 25 minutes in xd i liked slay the spire quite a bit and its cool to see a more rpgish version of that concept im interested what a gorgeous looking game doesnt look like something id play but can appreciate the makers of steamworld always trying something new jan cuz this is a card game me awww clicks off watching and listening to jan mature as a staff member and getting more into game reviewspreviews has been an absolute joy i hope he gets to do even more as he really does come across as genuine and just a great dude the steamworld games are all great cant wait to pick this up ive got it preloaded im a big fan of the steamworld games and im very excited to start this thursday i loved steam world heist wasnt so into what i was seeing from dig 1 and 2 and this one falls in the middle id be into this if it was just a regular turn based rpg cant get into card mechanics unfortunately ricky berwick brought me here im here cause i already finish the game defeating behemoth sure tough as hell but im enjoying it fun game my first card game been craving for more are there any super bosses in this game i ask because im more of a jrpg player like final fantasy tales of games and i like grinding to get my characters stronger or in this case better cards im guessing does anyone know more games like this a party based rpg sort of type lmao ign calls this 5min video a review while giantbomb has a quick look video that is 30mins long ign is fukn useless these days this is probably the most informative review ive watched so far ironically i think i may wait for the game to go on sale to 1015 before i commit switch onlybut my steamworld collection is on vita and ps4 i also have my switch but i love the gameplay and the characters since i got to knew steamworld heist through steam powered giraffes music for steamworld heist so its baten kaitos thats exactly what i was hoping for i may just drop hearthstones for this game bruhsfar as a game that addictively fun and not too complex ill buy for 10 and play on xbox i may consider this talks about cards for entire review not story or quests not the best review i know how the combat works now but thats about it as i love fgo im definitely gonna try this out once i get a switch waiting for the pc version combat style is an iteration on slay the spire doesnt even mention it until the end of the video im so glad to see how this franchise has grown jesus i hate this combat need this for pc is this the nerdy guy from criminal minds their reddit ama said they had plans for a physical release later this year thinking of getting it then great review tom ive been excited about this one for a while cant wait to pick it up and give it a try mehi got many other games to play before this one for sure at first i thought that i couldnt enjoy a card game like this then i remembered that i lovedddddd mega man battle network im still not sold on it yet so ill wait for more reviews especially what this weeks nvc panel has to say id like something a little fuller than a 1520hr campaign and tom already saying that the enemy variety is a lil thin is not terribly encouraging either i want to want this but there doesnt seem to be enough going on for me to bite it doesnt feel like card game even though it relies heavily on cards i really liked dig this looks unappealing kermit the frog reviewed this although ill buy this i had preferred steamworld heist 2 a steamworld game not on steam is not ok the steamworld games are always fantastic so what similarities are there with slay the spire i know i dont speak for everyone but i wish they would have just put their time and effort into steamworld dig 3 or something more open world third person like baby something akin to darksiders imagine living in a thirdperson open world with the steamworld genre sounds very cool gave it a 6210 youre welcome steamworld quest or slay the spire decks do not matter nor a focus2 min later decks matter and are a focus the music sounds amazing imagineform is the best indie studio ah image form these guys always create such amazing games seems like a simplify kingdom hearts chains of memories great review this is a must have for me oh thats not smoke thats just steam steam from the steamworld well be having mmmmmm steamworld is this game coming too steam too im liking the music at least slay the spire if your into fortnite check out tactical sypher help him grow drop a like or a sub if ur felling generous ofcourse have a amazing day who remembers baten kaitos ps4 or only on crapc avenger end game three days hype alert hype alert first 86 thank me later have i ever helped you make a purchasing decision or enlightened you on an awesome new game you enjoy fan funding and sharing my videos among friends greatly helps to support boomstick gaming thank you i have played many many card rpg games in my day starting as far back as i can remember with baten kaitos 1 origins phantasy star online card revolution and dozens more since then this is a pretty goodcard rpg game for the most part but i feel a slight step back in quality compared to the more recent steamworld dig 2 heist which felt like they had more love poured into them worth the asking price for sure but dont expect astonishment thanks for watching and reading deadite in the review you mention that the card based rpg is a pretty rich genre but this is the first example that ive seen and i really like it are there any other examples you would recommend i think 74 is pretty low for what you get here its a really goodfun game its lack of complexity isnt really a negative its subjective about whether you want a really a challenging game or not and has no bearing on quality this game is a perfect breather in between longer less casual games and i think it works well as a handheld game i agree that the lack of deck saving is sort of a bummer but nothing really stood out to me as bad or annoying beyond that its a pretty high polished game and its negatives of looking for items in the levels is kind of a nit seeing as almost all rpgs do that thanks for the review man the game is probably a pass for me due to its simplicity i was really interested but yeah looks too easy can i play on android maybe we should just ask imageform for deck saves they are very communityfriendly also i know you want to keep your reviews short but especially for more niche games a short comparison to specific similar games would be really helpful these types of card rpg games are so boring to me well said and well done review i ended up loving this one a lot the combat cards and music are so damn great thanks for this very useful review not being able to save builds sounds like a fairly big missed opportunity but since its a good entry point for the genre ill eventually give this game a try im not a big turn based rpg guy but ill pick this up just because all the steamworld games have been good so far thanks for the review i am going to enjoy this game so much like you i also have gotten a review code for the game i started my playthrough but yeah this game is going to have me grind if i am to get stronger and beat it im also a sucker for rpg games 246 i wasnt ready to this 19k of damage had to go back and like all these i dont often log in to my youtube when watching so i go back occassionally to properly like things their is a bundle with first dig and hist that i cheeked out at my library on the ps4 so you might just can buy that these are the best kinds of games they taste delicious and are fulfilling and they leave you wanting more this game is only getting better and better god damn that was good i didnt like the ending only for the reason that there was so much build up to gilgamech and such a let down when he just gets tossed to the side in the end no punishment for his crime no real change in him just yeah im gonna go play golf with this tiny guy good story over all though captain canary shouldve been a team member too i loved that ending it was so amazingly satisfying the game the story and the characters were really well handled and so ends the adventure for our heroes at least until next time until next time armelly isnt going to pull a gilgamech is she man gilgamechs boss theme was really good ill have to listen to that again later out of curiosity i tried translating the names for the behemoths limbs cruento terram is either italian for bloody ground or latin for gory earth as far as i can tell lamenta astrum roughly translates from latin as tears of the stars in terms of the attack names that arent already apparent golgotha is latin for skull gehenna is latin for hell nibiru is especially interesting its apparently an akkadian an ancient semitic language used in babylonia term that means crossing or point of transition the word tokamak in hells tokamak refers to a device which uses a powerful magnetic field to confine a hot plasma it can apparently be used to produce controlled fusion reactions in said hot plasma i like how the executive producer was also credited as glorious leader gilgamechs barbels were labeled with the sign for infinity protect all these precious steambots i love all of them and the song at the end is amazing ffffff so good an episode with finding all the secrets and arena fights different combos will be nice i only watched the 1 episode for this series i stayed here this episode for the music xd does not sound like that bad of a game tho whats the name of the song that played during the credits organic is the eldritch for robots great game i wish more awesome cardbased games would come out cholo this game looks fun generally love your stuff always try drop a like but goddamn i was tearing my head out when you werent paying attention to when armilly was blinded in the dragon fight ended up dragging out so so much longer than it needed to because you kept doing random crap other than attacking during the few windows you could have smacked it i wonder if their going be more elemental dragons since you can tell by their maskfrist dragon was electric because purple and this one blue for ice this game is great but i hope slay the spire comes out soon for the switch really they wont let you tell unless i missed something all it is is just a damn storytelling by one of the bot from steamworld heist dont know if it before or after heist this is shown at the start htf is this some major spoiler if it was the end of the game it would made sense but it the beginning htf do you have an embargo for the start but not for half of the game after that this product is provided by image form games as well as thunderful publishing as im under an embargo im allowed to show footage of the game up to chapter 12 sadly why i decided to wait until now to do this is because i was busy with a lot of other games i am only one person who can do so much and having a lot on my plate is strenuous and a chore it really is its reason enough may is going to be devoted to finishing up stuff that need to be complete it also means i wont buy new games this month i want to at least save up to get the new gaming laptop and thats going to be a challenge onto itself it really is but yeah i hope you guys enjoy my preview of steamworldquest it is a sponsored video as i got a review copy from these guys and i must abide by their terms want more of this show me help us reach 15 likes on this video if you enjoyed this video please be sure to do these 5 things like comment share subscribe click the bell do not forget to set notifi 3109 biggs and wedge nod is obvious xd 540 pretty heavily armed for a female then again her personality did seem to match that of a female needless to say i wasnt necessarily surprised by it keeping an open mind about it 449 so we have that kind of character which can result in exercising the tongue orik seems to have one mask that just flat out gives him 30 crit chance that by itself makes me think hes going to be super dps once you get more cards mulan is one of my favorite disney film i really hope you finish the series i really been enjoying it 3640 well the dude is putting the omelette on his head to get them gains you have to put them in your mouth they seriously messed the berret in the closeup damn poor armilly getting rejected like that hurts me too it looks like the guild is just full of snobs blindfolded themselves for lennys surprise bbq about sums that one up buffing up armilly or ultimately orik once youve gotten him up to snuff as crit based dps with the other two being buffer and healer is a sound plan though its looking like you could swap orik into a support character as well sometimea i think that armellia is yust yelling wonder wall i really like the way they made the card gameplay with combos and teamups item system is nice card crafting too the plot and the characters bore me a bit up to now but maby they develop or grow on me later a wild beedrill has appeared i was wondering why a robot would be bothered by bees but then i saw the bees why are they robots that eat and have genders and sleep and have parents they are spectacularly unrobotic for robots i really like this game myself and i really enjoy these videos i am up to chapter 8 myself and although i dont consister myself a expert i do have some tips 1 a good rule of thumb on treasure is that there either in a area in the open or hidden in a secret passage in one of the areas corners make sure to double check the corners because some secret passage are finicky to go in 2 you can use the magnifying glass in youre battle menu button to look at enemy and ally stats status effect if you have any damage resistances and damage weaknesses it doesnt waste a turncard but it can bog down combat a little and although not mandatory it can help you make a deck for difficult enemiesbosses its weird being the first like and comment this game looks awesome and btw dont be discouraged by the lack of views 1502 sans duuuhhh stop playing really cool games my wallet is crying shame i missed the stream but i hope this video gets some fresh eyes on this game because it is seriously some 1010 shit definitely one of my games of the year so far and i play a lot of games can i just say nice stream but also why do gun jumper liam jump the liam gun and always pick hard difficulties on stream maybe my epenis is just too small but it makes me feel pressured to pick difficulties in games beyond what i used to i just started sekiro so i wont be watching the last few of those streams until after i beat it myself and i am not gonna do that bell thing fuck that its hard enough having played the game on legendary i will say that blind is probably the best card in the game it works on just about every boss and significantly cuts down the amount of damage you will take forgot part 1 in the title all the steamworld games besides quest is on sale till the 23rd of may for 70 off guess im buying them all now thanks liam lol i cant help but feel like this is what a new paper mario rpg would play like overall like the first two but with hints of color splash and sticker star added to deepen the mechanics with a deck mechanic as opposed to single use pick ups like they were i could see it leaning heavily into the card themeaticts like a casino world a medieval tower of cards castle area etc 3504 wait wiggs and budge like biggs and wedge final fantasy was referencing star wars i wonder if soloing captain canary would have worked out by throwing out cards and passinghealing until combos came up the deck was full of unusable stuff but hey i imagine getting stung by drills would be pretty annoying when the detective pikachu video came up i was hoping someone would mention the ryan reynolds watermark implying it was his private screening question if i was to work on an rss compilation how would i get the finished product to you this is the first time ive ever actually seen a steam world game and it looks fucking ace how have these games been flying under the radar for so long senpai you seemed to have misspelled card game month continues baten kaitos when god i remember getting heist on my ds and it was so fucking good also copernica is cute ill never understand why people dont like the cold in springsummer i always feel like my skin is melting give me rain and cold cloudy days over obnoxiously bright mucky hellscapes anytime i havent played steam world dig nor dig 2 but i loved heist right now i dont have the time to play quest but l will look into your playthrough from time to time i usually dont watch lets plays or stream playthroughs but i always enjoy watching your stuff keep up the good work liam is this the new cardgame mont lets play damn liam you forgot to add part 1 on the title card game eternity continues its summer in canada meanwhile in arkansas its been cold enough that ive had the heat on all week i was not aware this was a thing thank you limabeansenpai brb gotta get my credit card gotta get this now been wanting to get slay the spire but it isnt on switch and this looks really similar mechanically but by the same guys who made one of my favourite games ever is this on switch why would they change the art style i prefer the old one wtf cant wait 254 dayone the music is damn nice lorewise you guys think this is the rebuilt earth im conflicted i love steamworld games but i hate these sort of rpgs i am not big into card games but previous steamworld titles were stellar this gameplay video kind of sold me on this it doesnt look too bad and it might be fun to play around i love that you shuffle cards but still get to see all the animations done by the actual characters on the battlefield i might even wait for a physical release from guys like limited run games i hope this will drop soon on pc tho i now its coming for switch before anything else but i read that it will come on other platform after d i cant wait to play this look awesome i like the combat system loved all the steamworld games this is great i always wanted to be an evil henchmen instant buy yo day 1 of the localised version in my language i really liked the previous games in the steamworld series but the dialogue is always getting in the way of me fully enjoying them this time im gonna waiting patiently for the localisation day 1 people complaining about card dont even see how a card equals a skill meaning its basically skill management whether it looks like a card or a menu with choices isnt really different only difference is the random nature of picking cards each turn except you get several at once not just one plus you can discard a bit for new ones if needed for extra control looks really promising and the steam world games have an awesome track record this far probably day over purchase although id love to have the physical switch version please tell me they are gonna release this on steam omfg this seems like slay the spire but set in steamworld in other words im buying this on release if yall had video for your podcasts i would of been able to watch this during nvc i dont know what to think about the graphics but the gameplay is exactly what i was looking for on switch and the ost is amazing day 1 purchase for sure wedge and vicks budge and wiggs huh respect thats a reference to wedge and biggs from final fantasy lol budge wiggs amazing day one buy from me played every single steamworld game so far cant wait to play this game myself is that yoko shimomura i feel strong vibes from legend of mana and kh1 aaaah i was hoping it was a sequel to steamworld heist but this will do they have yet to let me down definitely picking this up day 1 had me at paper mario lost me at card building if it maintains the humor of steamworld heist then im all in reminds me a bit of baiten kaitos which was one of the only deck building rpg game i loved so thats encouraging whats the point of including cards in this bland rpg look at what slay the spire does come on if i love how fast the combat animations are looks like all the boring aspects of an rpg well its not for me getting slay the spire vibes which is great except maybe i wont die as much in this game promising im not into card games but i love previous games from this guys so ill keep an eye to this was this a failed play store project will be passing indie developers should make you know a real game someday and leave moms basement you won me at paper mario esque rpg but you lost me at cards and deck building i can remember playing baten kaitos i got totally immersed in the world and the story but the carddeck battles turned me right off i abandoned the game after a couple of hours i couldnt stand that my abilities could only be accessed by random chance i wonder if this game will be more accessible i do love the other steam world games i love that the first 2 enemies are wiggs and budge love the steam world games ill be picking this up exclusive gameplay this game looks so promising cant wait to play it would be very interesting if this game setup was the same universe as steamworld dig tho anyone else thought the thumbnail looked like a older version off a teenage mutant ninja turtle lol true first looks pretty schwifty this game looks like it could be fun also thats amazing gameplay thanks for it first i feel like ticktocktic would be a better name than arachnobomb i read fury as furry 3157 i might go back and break final fantasy 8 dud 8 is easy to break without cheats look up the wiki a a speed run as soon as you can transmute card into items it is game over massive stats boots infinite limite breaks you want you got it 4000 i cant play much anymore because i am in pain pretty much all day and using my arm makes it worse so i watch other people play the cool games thank you did he ever actually equip the fire damage up accessory he bought missed an interactable at 1151 edit looks like you found it later its interesting to see how different you play not only in card but equipment as well since i focused copernica into a frost and storm build because almost all of the enemies in act 1 are either neutral or weak to frost and storm damage and i gave her a blizzard orb for beter frost damage and i focused galleo mostly into offensive healerdamage mitigation build using super soaker too synergize with water jet from the hydro gloves and with copernica and give i gave him the power bangle and later the power servo to increase his damage and healing i used armilly for pure physical damage and self healing so i gave her the silver bracer and scout badge for increased healt damage and self healing and i use intercept less for the damage and more for the flinch but thats what makes deck building so fun yeah apparently dogs are a thing in portland almost every house in my neighborhood alone has a dog and i live with two everything sets them off nice one cant sleep and wander comes to the rescue uh wander your thumbnail looks a bitdifferent wanderbots how you poison a robot you make it rust the same way bleeding them is basically oil leaking out of theyre systems your so into the game you forget to change the cards nice videos keep it up please i have to very much agree with your statement at 422 this game is very much adorbs hey i recommend you to not underestimate stone lionflinching is pretty useful and orik needs the defences plus it dosent use any gears though i admit your current setup dosent seem to use as many as mine does doom with the cyclone cut from orik my do some silly stuff because doom procs everytime you do damage for about 35 max health and cyclone with max gear hits about 20 times it should be worth a try versus a boss hmm i guess knowing how much you like to steal gold and your love for galleo adding orik will help with a balance of dps and healsupport in that case it does sounds like a pretty balance team with galleo dedicated to providing heal and debuff while the twins deal damage and steal gold and orik being a balance of either helping to deal damage or to help support this team might work especially seeing orik able to combo with galleo and orik cards looking pretty fun to mess around with and with a high crit rate i think he will be able to deal more damage than armilly armilly seems like she works really well with copernica especially when many of her cards does hot resist debuff assuming that you are in a stage with enemies who are weak to fire these 2 will wreck them edit alright now that we seen what cards can be crafted tarah thayne galleo orik seems perfect they will be comboing around galleo though which i guess suits you just fine when i played through this game for the first time and if i was using orik i paired him up with galleo and copernica to give him beter survivability by equiping miricale worker quick fix and later team repair for healing and equiping copernica with mana barriar and barrier field for damage mitigation to have orik focus more on crit chance with spiked collar and storm damage with wind gods drum trying to find copy of nogameryouknow when he did walkthroughs on vhs with ps and nintendo ectanybody know wherepewdie i think so stole ideas from this guy and still does forget about the gilgamechs i love that the cards are programming punch cards thats a great question leo is now the only segue i will ever use now in life 535 am i the only one who really enjoyed steamworld heist i hope they make a sequel was such a unique tactical game they need to make an epic huge metroid sized steamworld dig 3 is this coming to pc or did tack have to play this on the switch he doesnt own yet lol they should have made a sequel to the robots in space one but made it better this really looks great the aesthetics and character design are really unique and creative i also love the idea of having the cards look like programmed punch cards that tell the characters what to do throw in the cogs and they nailed that steampunk vibe ill definitely be giving this one a shot looks like some quality escapism game ha ha ha what a fantastic episode of new gameplay today informer looks very tedious will this be on the switch this looks sick cool it has shaken me to my core to hear that you used to be into homestuck robots bleed by leaking oilfuel the poison is acid paralyze could be magnetism i like to think that way anyway the my little pony megaman game is pretty cool its a nice hard megaman old school game with ponys ps wonder if you get down time and still have a 3ds their a game i thought of thats like a lighter version of etrian odyssey call 7th dragon you might enjoy it because their a class you get that lets you be yugioh and use a deck of cards to fight i love the bleed trap they haveit was a very fun game i cheeked out within 10 years the most triple a studios will be gone they simply wont be necessary triple a quality will be possible with double a budgetresources i really want to play this frustrated they chose the easy exclusivity money over their long term pc fans i hope it gets released on pc eventually i have no switch p why you using steal strength when they attacking you with magic we all know you will go back for it ya the treasure is probably back in the first room with the 2 staircase so you probably have to rush in and just go down the room before exiting whats up with the video description switchsteamworldquestdescriptionchar my mind can only think armilly plus papyrusomg 0 2640 moisturize it puts the lotion on its king i really like how they scaled the xp so you can do some grinding every chapter and it feels like it mattered then you move on with some nice buffs bought with the gold and ressources without having lost the plot kingoo would be a better name i belive than yust slime king if you press select when you are upgrading cards you can see exactly how much the card will increase so press a to upgrade card then press select to see the new card text this is how i learned that bravado would increase armilys attack by 2 stacks instead of one i believe that is what the upgrade says im not sure since im am typing this without having my switch with me also a stack is 20 percent so 2 stacks is 40 the two thieves are the next party members the butterflies tell you where to go hint hint nudge nudge so many hints the game was throwing at you dig 3 died for this slay the spire reminds me a bit of dbz legendary super warriors on the gbc i hate the usual card games but loved that one or hand of fate for example they killed steamworld for me shame everything looked good until bam more card games this looks awesome card game 1551 i personally dont think tarah thaynes healing is better then galleos or even oriks for that matter i will say you have made a good build to capitalize on it but the main reason why i dont thing there better is that all there healing is based on tarah thaynes and in one card cast allies physical damage meaning that if a enemy is or has the ability to be resistant it will decrease the heal and if a enemy is or has the ability to be immune to physical damage you will gain 0 hp ganted there is a card late game that gives tarah thayne the ability to turn physical damage to arcane damage but the same rules apply to resistantimmune oops i guess i was wrong it was the stairs up and not the stairs down you know that old adage if you cannot say anything nice do not say anything died with the internet to be fair though for the popularity youve garnered most behave properly im pretty sure the combo works if you just have them on team you dont have to play the others card but i could be wrong why does a steamworld game wait to come out on steam what is that combat fastmode that as activated 1700 wiggs and budge biggs and wedge nice reference still waiting to see biggs and wedge again in final fantasy 7 remake smash more stuff see something on the field smash it so you know there is a supergiant game on epic games store for free and its their newest game transistor i would love to see wander voice act this game with a robotic voice changer xd im thinking you get more gold from breaking stuff as the mage still cant download it yet but at least i got to watch this episode but wander creeping cold damage another enemy as well so rather than seeing it as a single target skill just treat it like how you treat flame wave an aoe spell thanks wander for the good news about it coming to steam dig 2 came out on the switch first then went to steam the following day so dig 2 essentially came to both switch and steam at the same time episode two here we go cant wait to play today in japan so ive already been waiting hours to get off work to download interesting waaaaaaaaait now is copernicas final flash a callback to dragon balls heavy finishing move that vegeta uses by the same name i can see a no repercussions deck with unshrouded light with copernica and the twins paralyze and confuse yourself i wonder if it counts stacks as one that could be insane why dont you just take copernica and lose galileotwins do healing with life drain like crazy have you tried using pain gain to gain hp from when you attack the enemy that hurts you when you attack it with a physical attack overpower from armilly removes immunities i said it 4 times and ill say it ag i mean nice video man oh boi another day another steamworld quest episode this game so much like overlord the adventure must continue would love to see more of this video it looks great from mushroom to become hero welp you god boring huh triple dang steam world heist is by far the best in the series but this one is cool too id be very glad if they make a sequel to heist its a masterpiece also the robot narrating at the beginning is a character from heist this game whatsoever intrigues me is there any news about the game gonna be release on android or ios hmm a game where the female character character talks to the male one like he is an idiot how unusual in this day and age steamworld is not coming to steam sigh remarkable tactics series i love the art style but im biased since i love steamdieselpunk so much most of the time i see games one day before mrbird makes an episode of them before the episode i say nah not a good game and when the birdie showes the episode i always change my mind more pleaseee falcoon is the best youtuber make a series of this pls might have to try this out myself good one is it finaly on pc great game would like more also can u play more of a plague tale innocence cool great art style but what a crappy gameplay and writing human here whats next steam world steam world its a charming animation and your voice acting goes great with it cheers please dont just ignore us continue just ignore them interesting game falcon is best youtuber somehow that being better than having your sword out all the time the way i figure it it is better for two separate reasons possibly only one but still first it does not telegraph your motions to your opponent as much he knows that you are going to strike but not where and secondly because you draw and cut in one motion it might allow you to cut faster since you will basically fling your sword and then have it jackknife into the enemy 3227 dont worry their french is just as rusty because its matre not mitre the is there as a historic trace of an s after that letter fallen from old pronunciation so maistre was the old spelling the can also help you figure how to pronunce more conservative dialects ex patte and pte sound the same in parisian french but a and are very different in qubec french iai is a surprise attack to use at the beginning of the fight in order to attack your oponent with the same move where you draw the sword removing unnecessarry movement from the action to make it more efficient than mere sword drawing with this it is just like in the game the best beginn for an attack plus if you attack your enemy with the unsheathing then he cant really see where you aim and intercept if you had your sword allready drawn then the movements of your arms or the sword would give off a tiny warning that those who know what to look for can use to react a little bit faster blocking repelling or even countering the swordstrike efficient so its situational but in those situations its pretty usefull the naga are a mythical race that had three types lesser a pure snake body with a humanoid head greater a snake lower half with humanoid torso that was scaled and the head was snakelike with no hair pure snake lower half with a human torso two or four arms depending on mythology and a pretty face with long flowing hair gorgon is a race where as medusa was a gorgon witch nagas are immortal in dd a very fitting subtitle there its a beedrill catch it in your pokeball so is crit physical the way to go or is there a decent spellcasting build with copernica i mean it seemed to me that the primary reason she seemed so lackluster was that you have to switch her deck around for every zone to take advantage of damage weakness even so i wonder if the leechcrit train isnt vastly superior 2502 the 666 heal well it is under the cover oh btw eventually with a fire build from armilly i saw that there is a way to do 5k damage with one hit hey wander you should really take a look on the doomcylone combo that you can do with orik and tt just saying yeah if you want to stop bugs from getting in your house the best solution is that bug repellent and spray it on the windows and doors it also works for most insects so prey doom and cyclone so does cyclone slash work with prey in good ways spider are not suppose to care for chestnut wood too bad most of the usa chestnut tree died from a diseases from a chines chestnutit say that spider refuse to walk on chestnut wood if you want a bug catching plant and the air humidity is high you can try butterworts pinguicula the flies get lured stuck on the leaves and get digested but those are not very effective what works better is a lureandzap lamp those are not good outside they mostly kill useful bugs but great indoors where you dont want bugs at all there are nice wallmounted models horse owners put one or two in the stable so biting flies stop harassing their pet boss rushes in rpgs often suck a prime example is the one at the end of xenoblade 2 where youre tasked with beating three fights in a row with only one party member another one thats irritating almost entirely due to the lack of checkpoints is the one in octopath traveler you have to kill eight bosses and then defeat the twophase true final boss which completely dwarfs every other fight in the game by a massive margin in terms of difficulty with no save points at all digging the videos man keep up the great work cant wait to get my hands on this one most of the review is good but the beginning kind of bothers me you should avoid making comparisons that make absolutely no sense ff6 really i see zero similarity can you travel freely over land on foot and in airships in this are there 14 playable characters most of whom not only play their part in the main story but also have their own sidequestarcs and complicated backstories can you wander around explorable towns and other environments and interact with a multitude of npcs and find hidden treasures does it have segments with outoftheordinary gameplay like a tower defense segment with teams of moogles helping defend a cave against enemy forces or the opera singing raft riding etc how about two vastly different versions of the open world brought on by the destabilization of the entire planet by an evil ruler think back on the story of that game and all the things that happen think about the complex combat system with spells and tools and sabi love the review these developers make some great games sounds like a cool game gotta ask though was this video sponsored or something your presentation kind of sounded a bit like an ad which your reviews usually dont if you open the packaging slowly you can salvage the sticker you rip everytime you open a srg title i cringe every time but to each their own i guesslol have a great weekend the game literally arrived on thursday for me lol i like how this game looks a bunch i like how the steamworld franchise does something completely new with each title except for the main series i kinda get what youre saying about the animation movements though in game its pretty reminiscent of flash cartoons look at you pumping out these videos left and right good job ive taken a liking to these quick little videos along with your big hunga munga ce videos also like how i asked in the past video have you experianced what i stated in your celeste ce video within your experiance of the game also after a long while of nothing limited run contacted me saying that theyre going to send me a celeste trading card apology card and a new poster hooray have a good night viewer feedback i would have preferred to have seen the three latest srg releases as a single video instead of three supershort clips but as always slick also grinding is bullshit card games reeaaaaaaallllllly arent my thing but at least the steamworld games are varied like if theres one steamworld game that doesnt catch your interest theres likely one in another genre that will ive been playing heist and its been an enjoyable experience so far and im also considering taking on one of the dig games but quest yeah sorry this isnt for me robot mage is cute tho as a bit of a cushion for those possibly looking into this game as someone playing through it now this boss in particular seems to me like an isolated incident at this point i was a fair bit stronger then vine was in levels here with a deck stacked a bit better for this fight and it was still a bit of a slog where the boss by himself once i killed the other small theif didnt present much threat to my team but took a fairly long time to kill purely cause of that regen he gets but ive yet to run into any boss this annoying much further in the game this is literally a reskin of slay the spire i mean its cool but i mean really its a shame that he starts to feel not sure about the game after being so bad at the last boss or probably just some weird design hard to say with other stuff i have seen about the game and how other people seem to really like it and it is funny to see vin lose his mind vinnys not a real steamworld fan he hasnt played towerdefense sweet another gen 7 franchise to kick the bucket keep at it and maybe one day ill be able to move on in life my bitterness is maximal you can get through 90 of any pokmon game doing just trainer battles rpgs dont have to be grindcentered some advice for potential buyers those already playing ive died on almost every boss mostly because i chose the hardest difficulty but it was also because i was using a deck that had no synergy or was the wrong strategy for the boss it takes less than 30 seconds to exit a boss rebuild my deck get right back into the boss fight i think its a clever fastpaced way of encouraging different tactics rather than relying on one set deck that breezes through most of the competition without much brain power with this in mind i havent had a boss fight thats taken more than 5 minutes as of yet however i will say if you skip fights then youll be climbing an uphill battle because levels have a tremendous effect on your characters compared to any other rpg that 1 level can dramatically impact your success rate in battle that would be my only complaint as of right now im on the 7th chapter otherwise im enjoying the heck out of this game cant wait to finishing learn how to use your cards right lmao well this was dissapointing i was really looking forward to a new steamworld game this doesnt look fun for me i wish the combat was more like chrono trigger yeah that last bossfight was horrendously balanced if vinny wasnt playing his card right then the boss should have wiped the floor with his party instead of getting it stuck in a war of attrition if the boss doesnt have the fire power to kill the player yet can heal faster than he takes damage its just dumb his smile and steam gone did that trader have cat ears what a crying shame for the ending boss fight thought about giving the game a go i do love the way the game looks on paper as well as the art style but this is excruciatingly painful who wants an impossibly long grindy boring boss fight that one comment play it if you want will really seal the games fate and vinny probably said that in front of maybe 3000 people something needs to be done about this asap or else its gonna die before it even begins so is this the same team that made steamworld dig given that game was also not the most original thing but man this looks utterly generic and forgettable sad fans of turn based number ass virtual playing card ass combat will love it no doubt i actually bought this game because of this stream and i was dreading the boss fight at the end but when i got to it i beat it in about 6 minutes my deck was completely different the mage had all the damage accessories on and only fire spells and focus knight used the move that lowers fire res used items to remove bleeding to keep attacking and after the thief died i killed the troll in 3 rounds through his healing i think the important part to remember for people that were turned off by the last battle is that this is a card game dying sets you back 2 seconds away from the boss so if your deck is not working you should probably change it i dont play a lot of card games but vinnys deck looked really unfocused with pretty random cards in it i didnt have to grind at all and got through fine plus as someone else pointed out there is a card at the shop that removes buffs but i didnt need to use it just a random guys opinion for all the doomsayers game is really fun so uh maybe im just being a bit nitpicky but if your game has an option to fast forward battles doesnt that mean your battles are long and boring aka the main gimmick of an rpg i dont really want this but im glad theyre still making steamworld games this is why steam punk sucks vinny this guy on youtube with a wall of funko pops and a trilby told me ff7 remake was never coming out that must be the source that one chat member had when claiming the game restarted from scratch lol in all seriousness though theres no source for that claim and is just being thrown around even if it was true restarting shows an integrity for the project the same way it shows care for metroid prime 4 neither project wants to be anything less than whats deserved that boss battle is a damn shame the rest of it seemed pretty nifty hopefully this is addressed at some point and that we get a steam release at some point jon joonn i can smells ya jon me laughing my ass off xd the mans final words being play it if you want that was so heartbreaking to hear wow this game leaves an awful first impression the mobile game comments come from the animation looking like a skeleton with hinges candy crush is a 20 hour game too i feel like im watching an android shitshow but its stuck on an ad for a shitty mobile game chat talks about me gacha mobile games me i kinda want copernica porn my friends did a great job on this game i was a qa tester and im in the credits x so i am possibly a bit biased tho vinny spending 30 minutes in a single enemy made me give this game a hard pass i hate fire emblem it took me a second to realize the names of the robots are based on famous inventors or scientists of some category image and form make such good steam world games i hope they keep this up steamworld sticker star vinnys chat has the right of it fgo does have a ton of story and feh has just ended up being a disappointment im a longtime fe fan been one since they brought it to the states i even liked fates shitty story unbalanced maps and all is this game worth watching that moth joke makes no sense why would the moth walk in somewhere when it could fly and also how could it close its eyes if it doesnt have eyelids i was skeptical about this game upon its announcement and seeing it now i dont think ill like this much its cool theyre trying new artstyles and gameplay though dont worry vin norm mcdonalds delivery was still so much superior to yours that even though i heard your bloodied mangled version of that jokei still laughed game looks cool tho prolly pick it up i have to wonder if there is something wrong with either vinnys characters strength or the difficulty the balance of enemy hp seems way off its especially noticeable with the bomb spiders who he fought in pairs and exploded in 3 turns when he barely managed to kill 1 every time and of course that final boss of the video i hope this game has a character named something like ishtire or a boss named geargalana i might add this to my steam wishlist i really enjoyed steamworld dig although i havent gotten around to the other games in the series yet and the art style is more my cup of tea than slay the spires is copernica in particular is adorable steamworld dig 2 was so good honestly im not really feeling this one battles are so long for early content just thing about end game stuff how much time will takeno thank watched the end of this live the final boss battle of the stream was really unfortunate balance a boss battle being hard is fine but the boss was designed in such a way that it took vinny something like tentwenty minutes of just mindlessly attacking to kill the thing because it had health restoring items that outpaced vinnys dps alnost to the point i was convinced there had to have been some story item he missed to turn off the healing or something its entirely possible vinnys party was fubar but it wasnt the right kind of difficulty a chapter four boss should not be that tanky or boring it probably turned a lot of prospective buyers off myself included and it sounded like vinny wasnt even that interested in continuing to play cause if thats what chapter 4s like whats ten gonna be like im sure theyll see it and rebalance some stuff but you cant fix first impressions in which chat including me go all this reminds me of fgo and gacha talk ensues and vinnys fun plummeting at the boss fuck card games im so sick of virtual card games theyre such a cop out what the fuck is that cursed thing at the end of the video sorry this one is a little late the games come thick and fast sometimes what do you make of this one which is your favourite of the steamworld games so far what genre would you like to see them try next happy gaming glen i got this and ori the blind forest with an eshop card i got for christmas i 100d ori in one evening and started this game last night im glad i picked it up as im really enjoying it so far just came back to watch your review again for old times sake i like steampunk but will i like this meh id probably just go for final fantasy instead love all their steam world games especially the steam dig series hope theyll continue making more on that series itd be cool if they make some castlevania style game but with steam world context the game looks great visually the characters move around the screen very similar to dust an elysian tail even the design reminds me of it too that sort of 3d 2d cartoonish look just a different approach on coloringshading as far as the frustration goes with card drawing a physical card game generally doesnt have rules where you get to narrow your draw to a certain type of card or pile now cards for other characters being omitted makes sense but sometimes its just luck of the draw and the frustration is real i was not sold on the card mechanic but seeing it in action i think i get it now looks fun but that random lack of useful cards would bug me so glad its not too often have played dig on ps4 havent picked up heist yet looks awesome the team really have done a real job with the steam world games linking up love a turn based game what else could be next steam world kart beat em up bring them on if they are this high quality i say to minimize overloading your hand with sp cards you should use your redraws to swap them out before playing your last card on the turn i think i only ever ended up with a dead hand maybe 3 or 4 times throughout my entire 30 hour playthru on legend difficulty also dont be afraid to use healing items in battle if youre having trouble you may want to lame a fight out to heal up your party before progressing though deck balance is also important keep your character deck balanced around a 44 split of action and sp cards with the sp cards having manageable costs they cant all cost 3 or 4 sp you may want 1 member of your party to act as a battery character that generates sp galleo and the 4th character can do this this game was great and especially lovable if you like building characters and parties not my cup of tea but thanks for the in depth review yet again man the style of these reviews is awesome truly made with love what a quaint little game the world and characters are both enchanting and whimsical the card battle system looks much better than some other card based games ive played which killed the appeal for me cough cough chain of memories i agree with your review scores and i appreciate the heads up on the random draw mechanics for a 22 game i think its worth the buying and giving a try im on the fence about this one have avoided the game genre before as i never really enjoyed it but i love the style of this one thanks for the review lads gives a nice indepth insight yall do giveaways this game would have been so fucking sick as a beatem up brawler the graphics are so gorgeous ive been having a ton of fun with this one i know you brought it up as a negative but i really like the mechanic of still drawing cards for your dead party members it makes losing a character feel like even more of a hit as it then slows you down it reminds me of the system in mage knight the board game where you take damage in the form of blank cards in your deck as you take hits you have less optimal turns for me i find it adds to the tension awesome review i love the look and feel of this game i played the first one on the 3ds a few years back might pick this up when its on sale personally ive never played any sort of card rpg type game guess i might as well start now thanks for review this not my type of game but seems fun steam world games my love games this game will be remembered for year like the other i love it so much great review thank you switch up keep it up image form confirmed a physical release later this year this is by far my favorite review by you guys i love seeing you guys grow and getting better and better at your jobs love it so far you are the only review to mention being able to regain your health via statues but enemies respawn almost similar to something in a souls game thats why you guys are awesome you pick up on a lot of the smaller things in games that other people ignore but is extremely helpful in determine whether to buy a game or not you cover so much not in other reviews excellent review thanks for the review guys great job will be picking this one up game looks good but 25 no thanks map movements remind me of the legend of mystical ninja game for the snes love that game i adore imageforms games and as fun as this one looks i still think im going to wait for a sale price because im not sure if the card mechanic is something id enjoy or not nice one glen never played a steamworld game but maybe heres the place to start i really admire how they try their hand at different genres game looks great but i am holding on til slay the spire comes out on switch for my deck building fill also any chance you guys got news on the yugioh game for the west i miss playing yugioh but dont wanna jump through hoops getting the japanese version looks like a fantastic game im not big on turn based games visual looks good and gameplay doesnt complicated like others that gets boring when theres too much instructions reminds me a lot of metal gear acid for the psp it used to had a turn based action gamplay style where move where dealt in cards one of my favorite games might give this one a try i maybe new to steamworld series but i love how this games graphic give you that feeling like youre in a painting like how i felt when i played legend of mana when i was much younger with my brother wahoo im excited for this i think im gonna wait for the physical release tho ive never played a steamworld game however i loved slay the spire so this seems like the perfect one for me to get into thanks for an excellent and indepth review ill have to look into this one looks lovely i really dig the art style thanks for the review and especially for explaining the card combat mechanics please stop yelling at me at the end of all your titles british accent 1820 video length 1520 amount of different scores in the review 2020 steamy gameplay 1920 thanks for the review and i didnt even realize all of their games were different absolutely loved this one gonna revisit it soon and start fresh great job as always i dont know how i feel about this game jus yet but nice review glen interesting game review anything similar to battle chasers nightwar fantastic review so in depth image and form have become a trusted brand for me solid games and im a massive fan of their style of steampunk in fact when i talk to anyone about steampunk these steamworld games are what image is formed in my mind first love em no cards to purchase outside of the game also makes this worthy of a purchase thank you switchup for yet another great review thanks for reviewing this one went to the new discord and back to youtube and bam 1st view something to watch whilst ignoring the kids image and form are amazing game developers forgot to mention in the video the awesome and easy way to just play this game with the just the keyboard liked and subbed your channel you handsome beast theyre slowly building up quite the steamworld universe through all these drastically different games but save checkpoints in 2019 on a pc game is nearly inexcusable looks a good addition to the genre but those wobbly character animations to make it look not static really bug me in any game he hates you or picking up that mushroom so he sends more mushrooms at you that he will loose for shure genious logic xd i love steamworld characters and this was a great addition i completed this on the switch almost bought it again on the pc more crappy card rpgs bravado increased your attack power might have been a good idea to use it before all of the strikes in the same turn you missed two pieces of equipment and skipped some parts of the dialogues which was actually funny 245 this is some topgrade meta writing right there armilly equals me been looking forward to this thank you wishlisted wish i could say thank you better am already a patreon awesome i was wondering how does this new steamworld game play and here you are with an answer lovely im in chapter 1619 on normal took my time and clocked in about 22 hours visuals are gorgeous hand drawn character models and backgrounds comperable to dragons crown wich is top notch level the gameplay is wonderfull classical turn based battles with cards not too complex not to easy encourages one to change loadouts with immediate results the only caveat so far is the way the voices are handled it made me skip through most of the scenes and therefore making the story almost irrelevant but other than that its a really really good game go rpgfan glad to see you guys stretching yourself with quality video content i love your podcasts nice review shame that the game isnt stellar but still 80 is an excellent score ill probably pick it up at some point though being the cheap ass that i am itll likely be after it goes on a deep discount most great studies have a misstep like this eventually and good studios learn and grow from it as you mentioned and i think there is another cybersteampunk learning experience coming up for a big project that might put them in the red hi guys jon is back helping us with another review we hope you enjoy this one let us know what you think down in the comments below many thanks juan is there anything to do after you beat the game a very good review john but nothing beats steamworld heist i think i must play games quite slowly i always seem to spend more time than the average im still not finished at 25 hours great game hey there i really like your style im currently looking for a partner for upcoming blockchain game reviews for my website httpswwwmultiverse101com you can see most of these games here httpswwwmultiverse101comtrailers only 2 of them have launched but soon more will be released so im hoping to find someone like yourself to get some great reviews out for them in the coming year if you are interested in partnering or collaborating on this just follow the contact info here httpswwwmultiverse101comabout cheers im starting to think that image and form can make any type of game and it would be great will pick this 1up on sale i think nice review jonny although this seems a bit of a step backwards in terms of steamworld dig 2 no no no more roguelike or lite thank you cant wait to pick up great review of a great game once again proving they can make whatever they want in the steamworld universe being a card based game im sure this will be discounted sooner rather than later so when do i get my copy great review and video was waiting for this one thanks i see switchwatch posts a new video i see steamworld i instantly click like i dont know crap about card games but i do enjoy the steam world games maybe its about time i give a card game a shot tell me what to do my brothers id play this just for the graphics alone reminds me of dragons crown great video jonny definitely gonna check this one out the steamworld games are always great thanks friend yes another indie classic on my switch great review awesome list definitely have to get gato roboto i remember playing the demo for wattam at pax prime 2015 so glad to see it get the praise it deserves some great picks another metroidvania styled game with soulslike elements released in 2019 that deserves some more attention is minoria from bombservice developers from brazil that made momodora reverie under the moonlight fyi for kuniokun the kun is pronounced the same as the first three letters of kunio just another flawless episode epn should have 500k follower minimum when compared to competition come on internet lets get smart shout out to blasphemous loved that game i dont think it got enough recognition baba is you is on switch valfaris the game that got sued by iron maiden to change its name lol definitely going to check out wattam i just recently got into katamari demacy and the rerolled edition i remember seeing your review for the original back in the day and i should of tried it then great games good list of some interesting and different games valfaris and steamworld quest are some killer games been meaning to play river city girls since release but since i havent yet ill have that and streets of rage 4 to play in 2020 woo gris on the nintendo switch is an amazingly beautiful game i highly recommend you play it if you havent so many games i wish i had the time and money to play them all river city girls was amazing just picked up a physical version of river city girls on switch at best buy i was waiting a while for it and i cant wait to get to it hey vic im almost done watching all the seasons of the classic ep it is truly nastalgic for me going back to those days my question is why did that format fizzle out like where you would go inside studios and interview etc would be awesome if you still did that today would be amazing also i found that you were the first one to ever do something like that back in 1995 which is truly awesome good stuff vic blasphemous wtg and gato are all right up my alley the retro inspired stuff is the best imo great video victor as always even though 2019 was not a amazing year for videogames their was plenty of good ones that came out river city girls is 30 off on the nintendo eshop now wonderful video thanks for giving these smaller games some exposure i cant wait to try them especially gato roboto ill be revisiting this list in the future i dont play much anymore but theres some things here that have me interested dude when i looked up the definition of a hardcore gamer the name victor lucas showed up true story man great recommendations love to see you still on here making videos miss the whole crew that used to be on your show on television keep up the great work brother have only hear of a few of these games the last one you talked about looks very trippy outer wilds is the game i always wish existed when i was a little kid playing snes i have not had as much fun playing a game before my problem with indies now is there are just too many its hard to know whats good and not unless a game gets a lot of media attention it clogs the eshops up and makes me feel lost when i surf through the weekly sales also no longer having demos like xbox arcade did makes it where i feel like i miss a lot of stuff i would like thanks for doing this video ive got a few to check out now im subscribed i hit the notification bell and this is the 1st video im seeing from you guys in a year thanks vic great video vic there are few there i need to play observation and river city very charming and beautiful game i love it so much this is really like the best parts of fire emblem meets steamworld didnt tjhe planet blow up in the last one did anyone else think that slime looked 100 like a dick looks good definitely on my list of games i want to play that soundtrack tho great but wheres the steamworld dig 2 dlc as a steampunk fan i would like to say ill take your entire stock old bean animal crossing plz made me remind of vanillawares games looking forward to this game i played the original steamworld dig and i liked it a lot the only problem was i didnt really want to play it after i beat it the first time i was excited when i checked the description and saw it was an rpg because steamworld dig was good at motivating me to continue playing however i more prefer action rpgs over the typical turn based so i dont think i will be purchasing this i am anxiously awaiting when they port this to 3ds after the switch cause then i shall have them all because they do not put in nintendo switch games like injustice 2 or spiderman or the game that every fan wants to be the gta 5 add project diva to the nintendo switch project diva future tone whatever the newest version of project diva is please restore miiverse on the 3ds and wii u great i love rpgs ghosts n goblins remake hows rusty this is basically a warforged only dnd campaign i enjoyed this very much i hope theres some dlc with another character and some new cards d looks amazing from previous games how much time does it usually take to complete them never played any steamworld and looking to get into the series annoyed it aint on 3ds purchasing soon enough turned based rpg with card mechanics baten kaitos anyone intro reminded me of chrono cross times scar intro 135 teaser for the next game its pirate themed i guess aha so according to this pattern well be getting a spinoff in a new genre between every dig game 2010 steamworld tower defense i didnt even know this was a thing before looking into the dates 2013 steamworld dig 2015 steamworld heist 2017 steamworld dig 2 2019 steamworld quest 2021 steamworld dig 3 2023 steamworld fps battle royale dating sim this reminds me of darkest dungeon in terms of the art style ha they took a meme and gave it life lol i really loved steamworld dig 2 i hope there will be a third one it reminded of beaten kaitos for some reason is this the same team who made dragons crown whats next steam world battle royal with spining tops or watever i was the 666th like im worried this look horrible and this is my opinion fyi i am not buying this game too many damn games so little time i might have to just not buy any new games next year and play catch up for the rest of my life the art looks cool i really enjoyed the game its a linear 20 hours long rpg with gorgeous visuals and a really fun combat system you will constantly get new cards and build new decks to create combos its full of the usual steamworld humour aswell anyone on the fence about it should get it if i never played a steamworld game before would that affect my enjoyment for this game launch trailer uploaded a week after it got released good job and here i am reminded that nl casted bravado after the attack cards and thinking it only lasts 1 turn unique gameplay unique graphics unique animation everything is unique omgf day three buy roadhouse looks amazing enjoyed steamworld dig a lot and going to give this a shot this game has something to be with steamworld dig sora for smash bros dlc i got excited i thought it was a new steamworld dig retrocesso do steam world 140 was the one closing the book seabass theres no chinese version steamworld quest wand of gamelon what date is e3 i m not a fan of the card sticker rpg genre it really limits the battles in game and basically makes the entire game one big rng random number generator i will not buy this because of that alone beat the game solid 20 hours its like slay the spire but not a roguelike with a party of characters each with a small variety of playstyles also the characters speak in robovillager akin to animal crossing which i find charming buy all the steamworld games is gilgamech a wordplay on gilgamesh playable characters for super smash bros ultimate 1 waluigi 2 rayman 3 crash bandicoot 4 banjokazooie 5 shadow the hedgehog 6 shovel knight i like the art style and story looks interestingbut why is an rpg using a card based battle systemdid no one learn from the kh game that used that used a card system fire emblem world hd looks great all of these cool little extra rpgs all look pretty cool but when are we getting a 3 houses trailer wait is it switch exclusive or what i cant find any info about any other platform the nintendo minute gameplay made me really interested in this game theres just something intriguing about it looks amazing probably is amazing but im not a fan of rpg like games so its a no no for me first mario maker 2 direct soon absolutely loving this game so far every steamworld game besides the tower defense is fantastic and quest is no exception still waiting for steamworld dig 3 cool nintendo keep up the good work why does the in game voice sounds so weird ps the music is absolutely gorgeous please watch my videos im so excited for e3 2019 click lol im quiet early plz dont kill me for commenting that support me on patreon httpswwwpatreoncomnintendogalaxy join my discord server httpsdiscordgg62thszy would anyone want to see this

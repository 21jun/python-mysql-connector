god fucking dammit i paid like 4 cents for this bullshit on summer sale wtf is wrong with me really the entire video focuses on an mmo class ffxiii and ffxv for the majority of it at least they showed tifa some love wheres terra and celes those are the real ladies of ff lumina and iris are my female chars in ff i guess could someone tell me the name of each one v this music could not be more generic awesome could have done with more tifa lockhart though tifa shiva harem lyse aranea lightning lightning sis badass rank dark fina and terra must be here also the others elena charlotte fina lid citra folka i believe im missing someone from ffbe who is the girl in red 042 whats her name what is full form of gmv they are not in the song but i love garnet and fran the best chics of games hands down after bayonetta of course no lie tifas the most badass tifa would rather not fight takes care of her friends and loved ones and herself above all else treats error with mercy but corrects viciousness with ruthless commitment claire farron needs men for teammates but does just fine on her own lady yuna breaks the cycle of destructive selfabnegation and sets the world free from historys false dogmas sacrificing her innocence and the love of her life final fantasy gets their female characters so totally right what tv program is this sometimes i think velvet crowe might be the only good female protagonist jrpgs have produced since final fantasy 6 for the gays i love this girls the feminist anthem i never played ffxiv so i never knew how much of a badass lyse was i really love this is this a game or move bad music good scenes what are those peoples name love that you used salute by little mix those girls deserve more credit addicted truely what thats girls name in 227 and

call cool video fricking awesome keep it up cissnei and kh2 kairi are the hottest in my opinion my only problem is i dont know who i like more serah yuna vanille tifa and lightning are my waifus especially tifa and serah my list first to last adult rydia tifa terra celes yuffie aerith lulu rikku 102 beatrice lightning rosa rinoa the teacher quintis yuna but im torn between tifa and rydia tifa is definitely what my ideal girl would be like i always pick her on ff7 and rydia has the maturity not to mention terra is so nice and she has a strong resolve to fight injustice so glad i got to witness this before baby got back was removed 1401 if you watch this just play it on spotify while this video continues to play 1301 actually yeah you can if its a miner that is i think we can all consider this a ff game looks at kairi plays kh3 oh square nooob choice my top 1 rinoa the princess 2lightning cute bad ass 3tifa boobs 4quistis sensei please teach me 5lulu boobsmilf the girl at 056 is like shes just looking into your soul so now that the ff7 remake trailer got out yesterday what do you think of tifa and aerith what about jessie how about cloudette the best placement in all these countdowns is to not put tifa in any of them tifa is the hottest videogame babe ever truer words have never been spoken why dont anyone find aqua sexy i didnt liked your taste you must have placed lightning on 1st position dk is kind of a perv but only because he says it in his videos we males all have the visual effect whether we like boys or girls dk admits it unlike everyone else goddamn its too many to choose for me its rydiarikkuselphieand vanille overall can you make more than these 1239 kairi definitely deserves a place on this list and finally after 13 to 14 years kingdom hearts 3 is finally out or 6 years after this video was made lol where the hell is kh3 i thought vanille would be 1 most banging golly i agree with 1 yuna goes from a beautiful yet naive summoner in a dress to a way skimpier better haired even more beauty in the sequel as for tifa i disagree i even count yuna terra lightning and selphie as better 6 years and a few final fantasy games later i guess its time dk make his new countdown on top 10 final fantasy girls believe it or not i totally agree with your list except if you see how they did rinoa on dissidia nt yeah and yes dont forget aranea hopes mother anyone fran should of been 1 on id bang her so idols could pass as final fantasy characters like irene tzuyu jisoo and in boys we have taehyung myungsoo taeyong jaejoong eunwoo as representative ahh yunni is a lil too passive for me bro p awesome vid tho maybe il make my own lol garnets got one of if not the most succulent asses in all of final fantasy eh dk my list is deff different cu personalities are huuge thing for me but i realy enjoyed checkin this out tifas always been my number one bruh theres some good porn games online too haha you dark bastard lol wheres fang on this list lulu to me is hottest because she so feminine and grown up yuna is most beautiful rikkus spaghetti hair in ffx2ruins it all ohhh i was wondering who that girl was in montys music video yuna shes a butterface have you seen her in x 2 aeris aerith sounds like a lisp honestly yuna for life 1308 the answer to your question is finally here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgwlkem3m2ee before i watch celes is best lightning all girls in final final fantasy are bitch except ff xv girls only cindy who the bitch simplistic opinion for a personal taste and i wholeheartedly agree cindy iris aranea and luna done and done i think we all need to remember the fmv for ff3 with refia she was so peng totally agree with yuna in the 1st place but unfortunally shes mine liked this rare video yea but then we reach those games where that one boy has a better ass then the girls ala bridget damn traps making me question my sexuality isnt ashe lightning and i agree yuna number 1 right on so many ff girls so little time yeah tifa is the hottest pixelated female in ff or most videogames for that matter so hard to pick a 1 let alone 2 3 4 and so on for some reason i keep going back to rikku not only is she cute and beautifull but i just love her personality and knowing the voice actor behind her tera strong is just so hot she was in this movie where she hits on this guy and he has an orgasm just a couple of seconds after she hits on him i could be wrong but i think the movie was senior trip quisits was also a top on my list seeing her sigh in her opening cutsceen over squall and behind the machine gun cutsceen during the seed exam when she tried to talk to squall later and he was so rude to her i wanted to push him off that balcony they were on lol some of those girls when they walk i wish i could ask them do you get fries with that shake this list is in all wrong order wow i was so uninterested in the plot of x2 that i completely overlooked brothers weird pining over yuna but i guess one more dumb thing about that game is like a match on a dumpsterfire by now i was wondering where yuna was early but damn she got top 1 lol kairi being 15 well she was older than me when i first played kh2 my favorite is yuffie by 1 million i felt that way about tiffa until i played ff4 and seen rydia coming back to me for the first time rydiamy bae believe it or not even though shes not playable shiva was hot or even siren from 8 but gotta say disqualifying tifa was a fair and good move 1 though on the most beautiful list i think rydia and aries are 1 and 2 and quistis wud be my 2 for the id bang list following lulu seriously what got me stuck in lulu was actually that one scene where her neck was exposeduh yeah damn i might be gay but i can say your picks are what i like i didnt understand well why he put serah in each cut but shes still in 4 heres my list 10 edea kramer 9 quistis trepe 8 yuna 7 rikku 6 aerith 5 yuffie 4 selphie 3 princess garnet 2 rinoa heartily 1 freya crescent omg i swear you disqualifying tifa had me cracking the f up i place lightning on first position of the top i always going with lulu in my party because she is misteryous and sexy sorry my english yeah i would bang fran too i dont care how old she is i find your number 1 pick to be a fantastic choice where the hell is kh3 indeed riku is the goat theres a reason kain wants to kill cecil for note green blond and gray hair in terra is for sprite concept art and description why rinoa is in the 9th place she should be in the first ones aranea and tifa all the way btw do u gotta gf brotha or have u ever had one also tifa is number 1 ughh lulu isnt hot shez a goth lookin skanks b ut im a prep and im a good lookin guy so u kno p ive always wanted to see a sexy version of celes from ff6 i never saw a wellanimated version of her in action im not mad with number 1 gotta love yuna no lenne shes just as hot as yuna back when ffx came out i had a massive crush on rikku we were about the same age all of these final fantasy girls are beautiful and cute i was waiting for top 10 wow i enjoyed paines not on here hey i really like your videos youre a good one d i wish rydia was that lulu is best is my opinion antimeta to me the cutest is aerith the most beautiful is serrah and the one id bang is without any doubt rikku i wish i could hug tara strong shes the hottest ff girl and shes not much younger than my mom as much as i love tifa i will have to agree that it is unfair to put her in the contest so thats legit i still love her though shell always be my 1 ff waifu 3 wtf is this for real the number one is yuna bruh rikku is 1 cutest ffx and top 5 hottest ffx2 before i watch yuna better be on here or ill crie terra is my number 1 for simply being most beautiful and elegant also being the fact that shes the first female protagonist which she handles very well which you dont see very much in final fantasy or video games in general terra is easily the most fascinating ff character for me and my perception of her has changed dramatically since ive been playing ff6 2nd playthrough and it also being my gateway into the final fantasy series she has a really big past about her that she could not help getting captured by the empire and getting the slave crown put on her probably because she tried to resist the empire at some point she was forged by love between two completely different beings thats what makes her so interesting and fascinating her very existence proves that humans and espers can coexist with each other her ability to transform into her esper form makes her much more extraordinary and lovable if they ever remake ff6 i really want them to flesh out her character a well since i already came and decided to give truthssilence is now not a choice as much as i do enjoy the countdown my opinion of the best ff female hands down would have to go the only one that stays on a ff timelinesorry lightning but even you timeline ends when u beat ffxvthat would have to go that gorgeous ice queen boss sexy shivaher icyhotness never ends cuz every char on every single damn account ever will have to try to warm her up to complete ffxivyeah tifa may be popular and i do agree a lot with this list but the biggest problem with this list of females story has endedsorry to sayshiva has got it alland can compete with any of these females on this listeven tifaon any ff timeline ut in the end wins against any female on this list due to the neverending hotnessgah damn sometimes being a grown up sucksid go online and welcome the winters night with shivawhy didnt she get on this listpeace of course tifa would be on there me well yeah shes attractive thats why shes disqualified me thats fair jordan thats not fair me calm take deep breaths jordan why disqualify though why not make her an honorable mention me pfft i dont know dont ask me i didnt make the video 541 why she was too overpowered and wanted the weapons sephiroth and bosses in general easier hell her final limit gives you recovery and invisibillity goddamit but why square why couldnt barret die we dont give a fuck if its obvious aeries death was too we need an op character vincent can substitute him if dont get why i want barett to die because square orignally planned for barret to die but didnt cause it was too obvious 1251 pedophile you know in final mix theyre still kids right even so in kh2 15 is still a kid too young for sex im glad light is at least in the top 10 what b is the song at 910 was gonna lose my shit if yuna wasnt on any of the lists lol what no ffxv characters lunafreya should be on this list rikku 1 for me in every category playing ff13 i did get a lesbian vibe from fang but know i see them of having a sisterly connection they are like the gran pulse equivalent of lightning and serah except better their love seems more natural lightning just seems like she only loves serah is because theyre sisters in my eyes you could disqualify tifa and garnetdagger cos she is not only beautiful but she has a very deep character and a for once really really cute romance with zidane i know this vid is old but after watching this this is the time i would like to announce you some stuff btw about kh 3 they just started making that and 7 remake right after ff 15 was done got anymore questions cause i got some kind of answers i also heard that some of the characters from treasure planet is going to be on kh 3 now thats something to see i hope ff 7 remake the nomura will be making an appearance in e3 games dont know where but im pretty sure its in japan or los angeles ca hell be talking and showing game mechanics and visual contents in the game about ff 12 theyre already in the middle of the process making the remake for the ps4 so about releases on kh 3 and ff 7 remake its releasing 2018 and beyond but dont think itll take the same time as ff 15 at the very least itll take 4 or 5 years depending on how well they produce the game ff 15 is going to be a pc port in the future nomura indirectly said it himself during his release did you go to jail after you admitted having a crush on a under aged character where was 218 from that was a kpop song haha in my opinion you should have added lenna ffv but such a funny video congratulations yeul comes back you idiot 1353 at least she is happy in the countdown pictures vanille is tolerable but she sounds like shes going to orgasm every 5 seconds she speaks xd i think death people always ask me why do i always play the girls its because i want to see this not this im a man godammit nailed it its not misogynistic to want to look at a womans behind all the time rather than a mans id say its more like not being gay still cant believe people calll aeris aerith if anybody has every played ff7 they would call her aeris why the hell did square enix change her name will never know but i grew up knowing her as aeris not 10 years later changer her fucking name tifa is overrated whaaawhy goddamnit d hahahaha i pissed myself laughing because i was thinking the same thing about aerith d fran is and always will be my number oneshe is the only action figure i allow to sit on my computer desk the rest of the lesser women are on a separate shelf hehe rikku and sarah were hot but i had dreams of marrying rinoa yuffie is great no she is not the undisputed queen you blessed weeb beatrix didnt make the bangables i cry foul 2017 update aranea highwind best waifu but for me she is number 1 mistress rosa is my all time favorite hello selkies 1 cute girl ff crystal chronicals cant believe you didnt mention them wowgreat video i knew that lightingserah and yuna is the top 10 on the listthanks btw even now the 1 still is correct who and where from 617 yuna is at the top of all of my lists both on x and x2 also i am now in the process of painting a portrait of her and yes she is even higher up on every list of mine than tifa whats the music clip that plays during the number cards considering the fact that the cinematics on tina was of the highest quality at the time it was made she really was the hottest babe at least at the time i cant help but make my own top 10 list right here youve inspired me lol 10 paine 9 general beatrix 8 edea kramer possesed ver 7 quistis trepe 6garnet till alexandros xvii 5 yuffie kisaragi 4 rikku 3 rinoa heartilly 2 selphie tilmitt 1 freya crescent i swear im not a furry but i just cant help it would want fuck yuna where is cloud that shemale where is cloud that shemale and how about selphie ff8 this guy is a perv typical darkkefka do you reeval this now that ffxv is out and cindy isjust omg disqualifying tifa because shes too damn hot priceless i laughed my ass off lara croft probably wants a word with you in regards to that first comment about hottest girl in gaming ever xd cute id have put yuffie at the top for my list but to each their own like the inclusion of cissnei though very underrated character beautiful id have put yuna as my top that goddamn sending dance fmv in ff10 was stunning plus how she looked in the wedding dress bang hrm not really a category id think ofprobably yuna again for the exact same scene as earlier the sending dance top 10 hate to keep harping on the same thing but still yuna if we were only allowed one per category then id swap in cosmo for beauty and rikkutifa for bang damn that gear she has in 102 but yuna is still top overall and better imo than tifa so where would you factor in the girls from 15 into the equasion also i think you should add in a graceful catagory interesting that neither rinoa or selphie were on your cute list from the mouth of the creatordesigner rinoa was designed to be cute as a contrast to tifa who was designed to be beautiful as for terra the green hair was her original design then after 7 they decided to go with a more realistic look and made her blonde because you know we cant have crazy anime hair colours running around not sure how they explain lightning then seriously i think yuna is creepy lol she keeps changing mind dressup that stupid laugh after blitzball match against dick son goersprobably gonna blame the voice actor just started watching this and already have to say that you are totally wrong with disqualifying tifa because of her being the best by far not at all she might make the top 10 but isnt in the top 3 at all on the actual list i would have a top 3 instead and it would be 3 vanille 2 serah 1 lightning she is serious so shes going to be great to sleep in the bed with i must admit i was surpised not to see leblanc from x2 on this list she was pretty hot and her outfit left little to the imagination omg cant stop laughting xd serah ashe vanille are sexiest to me somehow hey dk how come you dont have walkthroughs for ff 1 ff 2 ff 3 let me know okay maybe im just insane but something about the pink hair just gets me every time lightning1 for me bro even over tifa lulu is probably my number one pick theres just something about the pale skin and black hair and especially her motherfucking body that i love about her i even like to finish off battles with her just so i can see her sexy victory animation like kinda makes me at least want to find a hot cosplay girl who looks almost like her and bang her is that alright that you took scene from you know 108 im going to give the benefit of the doubt and assume the fmv for mysterious girl wasnt released before you considered most beautiful and who the fuck gonna bang a rabbitlmao after some lore research various bits of gameplay footage a few good hours sinked into record keeper and a dream date mysterious are the ways of my brain i can say that my top ff girl is terra im gonna take the hate and tell you kh is not final fantasy and anything related to the 13 series shouldnt be on any list other than worst games of all time i agree with you terra is the most beautiful owo cutest girl yeul but hell which one of them d i am with you always play the females lol why would someone be angry about yuna being 1 i fell in love with garnet years back i am sorry i have no regrets whatsoever lulus mine hands off wakka beatrix isnt on any of these lists come onnnn garnet reminds me of demi rose mawby the reason im into big boobs because tifa my 11 year old eyes realized that rofl it kinda is true fang is basically the love of her life you see it pretty much as canon in lightning returns shes always shaking her assits like she cant help it kept me laughing dude lightning is always gonna be a girl seriously how can you say shes pretty feminine shes a lot pf things but hats off to liking rinoa heartilly that girl and her entire theme is one awesomely beautiful woman in every way i was kinda hoping for a most badass girls countdown meaning girls you really dont want to piss off cause they will mess you up if you do by the way i already called dibs on rikku so you can have paine or leblanc omygod i forgot how cute yeul is all timeline version give yeul more screen time oh add 6 id bang her for beatrix tifa is the hottest ff girl ever and 1 should be killed for saying anything else big tits big ass sexy hair need more ye tidus seriously is a lucky bastard xd top 10 ff hottest puts kh in where is general beatrix form final fantasy 9 she should be in the beautiful list or ill bang her list if shes not the top tier im a little disappointed i knew my girl would be number one yuna is my favourite too yuna is my favourite too well tifa on ff7 advent children is practical yuna with bigger boobs what i like about her in early ff7 series is she is a norm breaker early ff series they break gender male is phyisical type and female is magical type rydia is top 1 on one of my lists i actually agree with your taste of girls same order for me lol this is great good list but i wouldve at least put fang on the most beautiful list fang beats all of them heres my list tifaserahlightningvanillerinoaand that hot ass teacher from seed lets face it most final fantasy players men and women with any interest in girls would happily bang at least 90 of the gals in the series 3 yes i agree tifa wins everything dude ashce butts is better than alysa where was shiva how about celes ceres from ff6 haha i like the part you saywhere the hell is kingdom hearts 3 somehow i dont follow the reasoningbehind disqualifying the hottest girl of them all if in fact she is the hottest girl of them all u mad best thing about yuna is herlaugh ha ha ha hahhhh cloud of darkness oh yes lulu baby and frans voice is so fuc sexy and now you got an abo for putting yuna at 1 this kind of list really makes me wish theyd implement my idea for a ff crossover which is an ffx2 style game but with females from various games playable characters and default classes would include cosmos paladin maria ranger refia dragoon rosa white mage faris blue mage terra red mage tifa monk rinoa black mage garnet summoner yuna gunner lion thief ashe knight and lightning warrior and theyd come with tons of fanservice maria refia rosa faris terra tifa rinoa garnet yuna lion ashe and lightning would be summoned by cosmos and are asked to team up in an adventure with x2 style gameplay with these girls using dresspheres this time drawing references from all ffs like rinoa in a girly version of squalls outfit for warrior each one with a couple of unique abilities and attributes for each dressphere to set themselves apart from the other characters and of course there are special dresspheres too as if the fanserv nice list i agree with a lot of your choices yuna is actually one of my most favorite if not my most favorite video game character but aesthetically i wouldnt put here at the top here is my lists cute 5 serah ffxiii2 4 cissnei ffviicc 3 terra ffvi 2 yuffie ffviiac 1 rikku ffx2 beautiful 5 minerva ffviicc 4 celes ffvi 3 tifa ffvii 2 yuna ffx 1 rydia ffiv hot 5 shiva ffbe 4 elza ffxii 3 lightning ffxiii 2 rosa ffiv 1 lebreau ffxiii hms porom ffivtay aerith ffvii rinoa ffviii ashe ffxii fran ffxii frimelda ffta2 top 10 pulling instead from the lists above 10 terra ffvi 9 celes ffvi 8 tifa ffvii 7 lightning ffxiii 6 yuffie ffviiac 5 yuna ffx 4 rosa ffiv 3 rikku ffx2 2 rydia ffiv 1 lebreau ffxiii no love for rydia feelsbadman id have to give the number one spot in every category to fang hell she was the sole reason why i brought ffxiii i literally saw her in a gamespot magazine and knew i needed her in my life ashe ftw penelope is the worse close the door and grab some t i really like serah but i think she looks like 10 times better in her original ff13 outfit dont you think also im happy to finally see someone who loves vanille like me opens new tab im going to play every final fantasy game i xv and will be recording it and posting it on my channel stay tuned as i attempt to quickplay longplay every final fantasy game i promise it will be sick and i will upload constantly i agree with your count down what was that song all the female final fantasy girls were dancing to ive heard it before i absolutely love this officially subscribed funny thing about vanille she is the most potent black mage of all ff games lol even if she has sixlets and skittles for brains you should have made vanille crystal statue as 1 for the lolz i dont know yuffie has always been my favorite something about her attitude is sexy rikku is also very high on my list of girls i wish existed and i knew lol somehow i knew it was gonna be yuna i dont know why but i agree tifa had to be banned its no competition if shes in it um tifa is not that well good enough to be on any of those lists thats my opinion really dk i understand its your opinion but 1230 just because square enix may or may not do kh or has some cameos of ff main characters doesnt mean its from ffofficially in my opinion tifa pants down i enjoy because yuna is the best i really like watching this channel great job check out my channel ive got some of the most beautiful ladies on the web showcasing the instamodels from all over the globe please subscribe and support thank you i did not expect kairi here so this made for a pretty nice surprise pun intended dat moment when u thought tifa is number 1 then u find it 10 well im out 3 in ffx yunalesca is pretty hot when you fight her near the end reason why terra hair changes is bc if you played ff3 or ff6 it is really she was a hybrid made by the empire i like her the best also her story is a sad one shes so depressed bc she has enough power inside her to destroy the planet n she knows that is why she wishes to die no offense its my opinion alone but you got a terrible taste of woman xd i demand a list fully compatible to my brain p 750 i wish nora got their own spinoff just so i can see more of lebraeu also you forgot the u in her name personally celes from vi is my favourite ff girl girl i was like hell no this guy isnt gonna leave one of the most iconic ff women outta this list lol then you showed her at the end and i was okay this guys alright lol though i got admit yunas timid shyness pissed me off like it was such a turn off in ffx which is what made me like her cousin a lot more i mean who couldnt resist that light bouncy energetic happy character as rikku rikku was way hotter in ffx than in ffx2 idk why but she was a lot more mysterious i guess which is why shes hotter attractivelmao whatever darkkefka ones im personally interested in 5 yuffie 4 terra 3 selphie 2 lightning 1 iris gladioluss little sister from ff15 these are not in a particular order theyre all just my type thats all darkkefka nabaat really the only sword i want to put in her is the buster sword right through her chest darkkefka does anyone read the dissida ansem secret ansem or xehanort reports they clear up so many questions people have if theyd just read darkkefka are you happy yule is the new etro any top 10 hottest ff females that doesnt have fang on the list is invalid fang is the hottest out of the whole series you earned my approval with beautiful 1 well done kingdom hearts thats a freaking joke what the hell that is not a ff game dumb ass nothing againt your ffxiii choice but i prefer fang most of the rest i agree with to me i really consider yuna as number 1 most beautiful final fantasy character of all final fantasy stories and i also consider serah as second finally allysa got a spot im just starting ff13 and vanille is reeeeealy cute and should be top 5 cute sighsi swear if you remove the hair the look basically the same even considering the stylefor me its personality and i end up always loving the boys for the girls always seem the same clich and typical barbie doll theme predictableso i have yet to see a female different from the predictable status quo sorry but so far xena michone and sigourney weaver actually are the rare few female id vote if they were in a final fantasy game they kick a and look good doing it then gasping like a stupid quirky fallen maiden in despair or try to act tough but still wear a mini squirt and conveying clich female to no endsorry girls whose knees whom always bend inward like a dog whose trying to hold its piss is not anything to brag on i guess men are more superficial then women are and that really disappoints me for ive been too won over male charactersstill am so even if i were a dude it would be the same no matter when i saw yuna was number 1 i gave a slow clap fly on you magnificent bastard mini mouse best final fantasy game fang because shes actually very womanly and not cutesy at all also gee by girls generation holy shit i know this is a pretty old video and so on but ive just gotta say i think yuna is much better looking in the first one i honestly dont find her redesign that attractive i like the character based changes but just not her face i dont know what it is but i just like yuna from the first one much much better 10 yuna 9 terra 8 lightning 7 garnet 6 rikku 5 quistis 4 lulu 3 aeris 2 tifa 1 selphie why the hell has noone mentioned selphie fyi only played up to x2 and a few hours of xiii hence no opinion on girls outside of this but i also believe unless it says final fantasy in the title its not a final fantasy game im surprised serah and vanille were not 1 and 2 also while i havent played ffxii2 just by the footage you showed i can agree that serah is in her own tier of beauty and she is pretty hot too it is not a ff game but i count it as one too tifa is the hottest i cant watch this video because freya isnt on itsemiserious jokes aside i gotta agree that you do have good taste in women cute means ugly but interesting aerith is beautiful i am sad that i pumped hours into grinding her levels just to have her die at the end of disc 1 tifa and dem boobs yo love it hell ya yuna in her gunner outfit dream come true tifa is 2nd to yuna every time quina should be 1 im gonna buy ff viii just because of rinoa top 5 i wanna bang you should really be top 5 sexy p please do a followup with how you feel about all the girls now p you forgot ultimecia edea cloud of darkness why cant you base beauty off of personality whatever i am sorry to say that other than kingdom heartswhich has got to be considered a final fantasy game since it has so many final fantasy characters in iti have never played any final fantasy game but i agree that you cant have tifa in the count down cause thats not fair and that i agree with most of the list i will eventually get around to playing these games cause i relly need to awesome video man some of you will disagree with me in partim not as enthralled with tifa as most people seem to be shes ok but i prefer rikku and vanille just like you do hey kefka can you do your top 10 final fantasy sfm pornos would be really interested thanks yuna rikku vanille serah lulu my top 5 gotta admit though you made some really good points dk was that clip of you hugging rikkus voice actress got to give tara strong a hug awesome despite how excited i am for ff xv i fear this is something that will be lost in the next ff game i mean did they have to make all the characters male i really hope its just se not revealing it but i hope we do at least get a female character as a party member or at least take part in some form of the core story please for the love of god what final fantasy do you know that doesnt have sexy female characters i mean this is a major trait of the series excellent choices but i have some comments 1 fight me bra rikku is mine 2 im starting to appreciate vanille more due to your videos 3 i heard from a friend of mine kh3 will be out after the next kh release of 28 fran is too old it was good until you included kingdom hearts in the list lol i cant disagree with yuna being top she deserves it shes beautiful sexy as hell smart kind strong dangerous in a fight and one of the sweetest love interests in ff history add to that shes one of the only women to actually be the main protagonist of an ff game lightning and serah being the other two makes her an allround top pick my only quibbles are with your excluding fang from your list shes gorgeous man wtf use your eyes theres a model figure under that toga and your decision to spoil a major plot point in xiii2 id already played it but others maybe havent please be more considerate 1 lulu is as sexy as fck i would bang her twice every day 2 garnet should be on the top 5 cute list not on the top 10 sexy list 3 hmm fang more than vanille she is more rough and sexy and has wild hair 4 and noo kingdom hearts is far away from being final fantasy 5 aaaaand yes yuna also my favourite ffgirl ever ever ever because of her ffx and ffx2 are always worth playing and ffx is the best ff game anyway lightning is the best beautiful and badass what more could u want ahem yuna best girl rikku being second and everyone else i could care less thank and bye mostly because ffx was indeed the first final fantasy game i have every played most of them i dont even know which game they are in yuna is my top 1 favoritesexy final fantasy girl ever the top 5 i wanna bang youxd holy crap thank god yuna is number 1 i kept waiting for her and was pissed she wasnt on here just to learn she was number 1 gotta admit i love rikku tho yuna 3 my first video game crush ever xd aqua is best kingdom hearts girl tifa is hot and all but i think morrigan from darkstalkers might have her number love how they are playing girls generations song gee during the dead fantasy part i love kpop oh yes i agree with yuna being number 1 but sora should be first dude you really need to stop soiling games did not know that kain wants to kill cecil my name is rydia im named after rydia from final fantasy this fuck yuna im break up lol i have married ashe alright lol for quistis you shoulda included the cut scene where shes shooting the gatling gun so badass overall though a good list agreed with you on tifa after ff133 light just got me shes on pair whit tiffa as sexy but more cooooler as a character yuna i just love her in ff10 the inocent girl that believs in love as ff102 shes like a rebelion 15 years girlnot for me lulu is the most mysterious and serah is the best suport character fran is the most alien sexy race and aerith its the most desierd girlu know what i mean dagger is also in my harem and rinoa is to powerfull ashe is a widow and terra its my new discovery also i think fang its a trap still not sure whit nr1 tiffa or light but whit the remake no im gone have 2 wiffus tiffa and light soz for my bad english aeris dangit its aeris screw the aerith bs i hate they changed her name like that wtf rinoa is my 1 p just sayin dagger was my 2 but then i played ffx and i do like yuna she is closest to rinoa in that aspect so it ties my 2 the thing is i was never really a tifa fan oo i saw how everyone said tifa was best they even have tifa porn i mean it is extreme but i never did agree rinoa was the one i was always interested in p what was that dancing scene too bad yuna becomes a bitch after the events of ffx2kind of cant agree more with 1 yuna is the best waifu in video gaming imo she was the main motivation to play through ffx2 i was totally agree i thought yuna was not on the list i was crazy then omg on the number spot cute beautiful and hottest yuna loveyou general beaitrix unbearable and would make many babies with her if she was real yes thank you for adding asshe that booty carried me through ff12 dude i agree with all of these i like your listyuna was no 1 to me fran has great boobs nice legs bunny ears and a sweet ass ashe has a big hot ass i even nicknamed her lady ass lol lightnings a badass and they can all kick some enemy ass and you good sir have excellent taste in ff babes oh and tifa has the biggest boobs of any ff character giggity giggity anyway nice playlist i didnt expected my favorite of all would win the top 10 oo they didnt nerf terra in duodecim they just made it a lot more balanced lol terra and zidane were the characters most people played in the first dissidia because they just had huge advantages over the other characters esp terras ex mode nice choices maybe you could do resident evil version seems like mojo somewhat agrees they did a top hottest girls rules was 1 girl per franchise tifa was the girl they picked for ff ranked 3 on their listfalling to chun li and lara croft tifa will always be the hottestever mother from type zero no no 1 of all is tifa its just not fair that she is disqualified my ff girl top ten list10 maria ffii9 tifa ffvii8 selphie ffviii7 yuna ffx6 lenna ffv5 celes ffvi4 paine ffx23 rinoa ffviii2 aerith ffvii1 rydia ffivhonorable mentions relm ffvi definitely high on the cuteness factor rikku ffx wouldnt kick her out of bed garnet ffix cutest in that game rosa ffiv definite gf material marle chrono trigger not an ff game but mmmmm why do you always play as the girssss hey everybody check out my top 10 ff girls please 3 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxojtb3d5tv0 due to her outfit hiding her entire body i cant put on the overall list yeah my top 10 hottest girls overall from any video game doesnt include zero suit samus and neither does yours ok guys im just now playing kingdom hearts bbsand i have to say aqua beats kairi by a mile tifa and yuna are soooo omg 1000 words on silver wings who will lenne say are not enough to description how fucking aresome this girls are cloud and tidus im fucking hate your bastards d ps my dogs tifa and yuna saywuff xd kingdom hearts 3 is coming buddy so dont you worry ff 13 is a suucks tifa reminds me of a friend that professionally modeled internationally because of how worldly her looks were and having such a leggy 52 36c2434 hourglass didnt hurt either even compared to her more glamorous sister her own mother always says she was the most beautiful of my daughters sadly at 70yo her looks have only left her as a relatively cute grandmothertype with hips that turned to sand resulting in need of 9 hipreplacement surgeries that left her needing a walker after a slipfall on a wet bathroom floor and a once firstsoprano voice ravaged by haircare chemicals after a career in hairdesign a smoking habit started at 10yo resulting in a raspy tone that commonly gets her mistaken for a man over the phone a sole picture of her in a vintage bikini from modeling days one enlarged clarified my me from a walletsize no photoshop sits as a reminder and a informer to new visitors of how she once was back when many times i im not into women but what about the goddess from crisis core i think shes so beautiful i think you love a domineering women and you have masochistic tendencies lol i believe nabaat was even voiced by the same woman who did lulu so yes i did notice those right away yuna she was soooooo off putting the only thing that makes me sad though is that celes isnt on any of the lists i put her in my top 3 female video game characters of all time why dont you do an lp about fatal frame girl dk oh yeah take it off take it off nooo damn cape im pissing myself how about rosa from ffiv rydia also could compete saying this before watching the list i love yuna and i agree that she is extremely beautiful but rinoa is my top choice out of all of them shes all mine back off what about lady yunalesca rikku not number 1 with the tifa handicap good call on declaring tifa too good to rank shed take at least 2 spots per list just by herself im saddened that lenna faris celes and refia isnt on the list i dont care if there is no fmv of them i think theyre great and well deserving on the list fran gave me so many half chubs sorry not sorry holy shit i love the commentary when you picked yule instead of yuna my jaw dropped seeing you had her in a different countdown then i understood i laughed my ass off as soon as you disqualified tifa lunafreya is the most stunning videogame girl ive ever seen my opinion funny video im weak over here man i never take my eyes off serah keep her alive and well at all times and it made me intrigued by this your id bang her list is crazy none of those girls would be on my list lol 611 ehh i dont know i always like paltuena a bit more i think rydia is very very beautiful i fall in love if shes real anyone finds penelo hot d im not even angry you put a kingdom hearts girl on here what baffles me is that you put a kingdom hearts girl that wasnt aqua on here terras amano concept art had her as blonde but when they sprited her both to differentiate her from celes and to hint at her nonhuman origin like rydia they made her greenhaired in game i think in anime green hair also means pure of heart and terra is so innocent it takes the world being destroyed for her to know what love is you chose yuna omg i love her the whole id bang her bit not to nitpick but wouldnt it of been easier to call it the sexy portion of the count down dk thats essentially what it boils down to unless im mistaken i like your commentary and your final fantasy count downs subscription 552 you want to know something twisted according to the game theorist what sephiroth did wasnt fatal and she was still alive when cloud dropped her in the water cloud killed her 719 there was absolutely no reason to make this category wtf is wrong with you am i the only one who tought that yuna will not be in this list then at the end i hear what can i do for you then i was like what the fuck did i just hear yunas song and then yunas picture comes out omg where would selphie fall fang manfang if you really like real women go for fang never seen such prime force of nature put on a female character on a damn game ever before her end agree bout tifabut that means she wins lol my top 3 3 vanille 2 fang 1 rikku and i was 15 when final fantasy x was released so its not wrong to like rikku keep up the great vids dk love these countdowns and the lps yuna and tifa are my top easily how could you ignore garnet beatrix yuna and rikku my 1 ff girl is paine i loved the makeover they gave rikku it was a vast improvement but bamf paine was like the more tasteful younger cousin of lulu remember the scene when lulus like her baby kicked i was like where how she stayed in that same dress throughout her entire pregnancy unbelievable my 2 is tifa strictly because they toned her down in advent children she was giving me way too many lara croft vibes in ff7 my 3 might be fang because i love touch chicks or maybe edea because i am a glutton for punishment i think the sexiest ff girl however who is clearly strictly fanservice is fran the entire viera race actually where are the male vieras i think they were in the ff12 spinoffs but i cant remember i fapped to tifa we didnt get access to so much porn back then all final fantasy male countdown please all final fantasy male countdown please minfillia from xiv only one that beats out tifa and rikku sorry girls theres a reason i dont play female characters i dont want to be distracted when i play my game and i get distracted starring at female toons when i play i want to win not get a boner so stop being a perv and play some man toons already you homophobe zid on zy dane wtf dude and its ty dis not tid us okay i just have to say this i am a woman and i watched this out of stupid curiosity of what guys think while sexiness isnt on my mind i was actually blown away by how much i actually agreed with your count downs it was very well rounded including many final fantasy games and many underrated ones too so give yourself a pat on the back you deserve it 3 just saying it before people think none exist im one of the people that can get behind ff and love it but kingdom heartsno likie really dont see how another game franchises character made this listnot angry justexpected consistency and lol can we all agree darkkefas a lolicon d strickly not calling him a pedo being a lolicon and being a pedo are hugely different things one gets a boner because of the age the other gets a shwing for the bodytype fran better fucking be in this video i take it youre an ass man the first thing i noticed about nabaat were those are you blind lack of females from the following games final fantasy i ii iii and v disappoints me oh for the love of god pierre the longer video continued the more i was thinking wheres yuna where is cloud lol wait im still confused on why theres a kingdom hearts game in a final fantasy countdown i mean isnt a countdown on final fantasy be strictly related to final fantasy just my opinion but the kingdom hearts was a little random 1435i hear ya brother i hear ya oh man for me it was yuna or rikku love em both guh most of these dames are too young for me i should make a list of hot dudes because there are dudes like auron and vincent that are not underaged and very hot rikku is number 1 all time final fantasy fantasy aha yunas different color eyes does make her hot true dat what about cross dressing cloud also ashe has a butt like korra and where the fuck is celes im so disappointed in you how could you choose yuna over rikku you bring shame to famiry i agree where the hell is kingdom hearts 3 hey you left fang out terra was a green haired girl in final fantasy 6 too i would put aerith as number one and terra as number two for most beautiful aeriths vulnerability puts her over otherwise good list for most beautiful girls though i would have had ceres up there is number 5 just moving quistis down to 6 lots of beautiful girls i agree tifa is the best overall a good strong beautiful woman without all the feminist crap and cloud would be nothing without her i am very happy with your list much agreement and much respect no love for celes i mean she was mistaken for a famous singer also i dont get all the hype about tifa aside from her rack she doesnt got much going on id take aerith over tifa any day props on the belldandy shoutout btw however i think urd could give her a run for her money but i guess thats a whole different discussion the mysterious girl is kinda hot if u ask me rule34 cough cough were not going to go to jail for having a crush on a video game character give it time laws are being passed every day also you are the only person i know who mains female characters in games like i do and for pretty much the same reason a good list but for me i would have rinoa at the top shes my girl right there haha i was never really a fan of aerith and i quite honestly have no idea why she seems like the kind of girl i would go for vibrant green eyes and a sweet heart but idk something about her i just didnt care for and i just dont like lightning cause she is kind of a bitch sometimes otherwise its a good list if i were you this would be my list xaerith ixkairi viiivanille viilightning vinamine vxion ivterra iiiceles iiaqua iserah this is my opinion and wheres celesaqua and namine get something to agree on the girl of final fantasy when are they going to make game about them id have thought that kairi would be in the cute category but its no big deal cissnei is actually you as the character avatar you choose in before crisis terra had the best pixels tifas disqualification earned my thumbs up and a new follower of yours quit trying to be mitch hedberg yo final fantasy xvs new babe is likely to come up on your top 10 hottest list check her out httporig00deviantartnet53eef2013169c3finalfantasy15blackhairedchickbyscarletr4ind69mv1epng every1 who seen tifa first cut at 108 and recognize it leave a like xd i wonder how many people have seen that before this every1 who seen tifa first cut at 108 and recognize it leave a like xd i wonder how many people have seen that before this in dissidia the story goes as many of the final fantasy characters join up to eliminate chaos the boss behind all the trouble in the final fanatsy series since the original on the nintendo or so this is to be believed the villian who has been working behind the scenes steering all the ultimate evils trying to destroy the worlds throughout the final fantasy games someone kill that sob permanently dammit evil just never dies x cissinnei is actually yuffie in disguise xd just wanna say i am very happy with your list and opinions me would put lulu as number 1 of the i bang her but have an obacon so am disqualified the problem i have with these characters is that i simply dont find most of them to be physically appealing and just overall meh im just not a fan of asian facial features overly young of age not going to judge but its questionable whether or not half of the girls on this list are of age or women with voices higher pitched than lilypichus with that in mind im not saying that theyre unattractive just that they arent to my taste this however is based solely on a physical level after playing through the few final fantasy games ive had the time to play i do have a fondness for a few of the characters the biggest sin of this video though is the exclusion of the handsdown sexiest character in all of final fantasy kefka his girliness should count him at the very least an honorable mention a final fantasy ft gee my life as a snsdfan x fffan is complete beautiful 2 whats name about this game garnet from ff9 is better than tifa all around im surprised edea didnt make this list at all i mean i will agree the first time i ever played viii she scared me shitless but now that i understand her character and have the time to actually look at her she really is beautiful tifa is a whore and probably the worst babe advent children is awful and should not count not sure how rikku did not make the cute list sry 3rd game in 13 is unplayable no one would bang faan no rikkushe better be on the last list i find rinoa hotter than lightning mainly because of her dance moves and the fact that lightning would be a dominatrix too bad garnet is in a horrible game 5 babes beat rikkuno not possible kingdom hearts is not a ff game and if we are counting i understand adding her to the list but not above rikkusecond place kingdom hearts 3 will never come out i know they say its happening soon i doubt it serah is number 3 rikku beast her and since we included kairi she does also p i understand asha butt fetish but her game is the utter worse piece of garbage ever and you cannot stomach just for her ass vanellie would be number 4 yuna is hot ill give it to you but she the best yuna would be 5 as yuna cannot hold a candle to rikku props for not forgetting about jihl nabaat too bad they killed her off in the first one i personally like the ff type0 gals cinque deuce and rem i was wondering why there is no yu oh wait dude ya got a good taste i find the lack of celes disturbing clearly she is 1 ok i agree with most of your list but seriously yuna yunas your number 1 well its your list and your taste like you said this video was 2 years ago you probably changed your opinion by now why so much hate it was a good list i guess some people just gotta be mad about something yuna is the hottest girl ever in ff history in both ffx and ffx2 serah is my number one she reminds me of myself and is so cute all hail the queen tifa hands down yunalesca is my babe im with you on the whole quistis thing squall was trippin terra is from i agree 100 yuna is my favorite as well so cute yall need to chill and remember that sadly these girls arent and never will be real ngl but real women cant even hope to touch that level of perfection anyways but thats beside the point not real chill save your anger and hate and go let it loose in a feminist rally or something you know so you can actually have an effect on the real world leave videogames alone please before i watch this lulu meh i might be the only man who doesnt think tifa is the most attractive i might be the only man who doesnt like insanely large breasts really i honestly find tifas hentai rack unattractive i prefer slimmer girls i always found rinoa way more attractive than tifa ever since ff8 came out ff7 is still my favorite final fantasy but i find rinoa way more attractive though in ff7 advent children i find tifa much more attractive than in the original game and dissidia on a side note i dont normally consider kairi a ff character but i have to admit in my opinion she is the most beautiful video game female of all time in kh2 of course ok kids watch this i and play fran will be my 1 forever we need more hot final fantasy girls with bunny ears cmon square noooo not yuna maybe she is beautifull but her personality is so bad i hate when girls act like angels such as sara aerth and yuna beside if you look to the face light should be no1 i mean look at her her face is so beautifull she is strong and independent woman not too good not too evil she is like any other human being commit mistakes and try to correct them also you have fang her face is beautifull but somehow she acts like a man i hate that about her give cosmos green hair and shed look almost exactly like palutena ashe probably really cant help it maybe its her clothing that makes her shake that butt also i had a serious cursh on selphie ffviii xd i just spat coffee all over my screen when the theme songs for ashe came on damn it kefka haha disagree with so many of the choices but totally support the the existence of this debate i knew clicking on it that there would be nothing but disagreements in the comments fully support the alyssa choice but she shouldve been on the cutest list edit i also always main female characters for superficial aesthetic reasons as well tifa will be the goddess over all other ff female characters i can see why you didnt qualify her rinoa is highly underrated here imagine a ff8 remake you guys would just instantly faint from her outstanding beauty and drool like theres no tomorrow also im a bit surprised that lenne didnt show up shes not exactly ugly i believe i mean she almost rivals yunabut in the end tastes differ i dont know but i never found yuna to be beautiful in the first game because her robes blocked everything and i didnt like her face but the x2 and everything changed in the original version of ff 6 terras sprite had green hair they made terras hair color more realistic in dissidia but had a alternate costume that gave her the original pallet colors to answer your kingdom hearts 3 question in case you missed the news at e3 square enix has finally announced that theyre working on it as well as the long awaited much anticipated remake of final fantasy vii great countdown by the way i agree with taking tifa out of the running there isnt a girl in final fantasy that can compete with that one tifa dna aerith were always my favs but the way i looked at it was tifa was the rowdy girl you had fun with while aerith made great wife material fuck yes yuna is my favorite ff character yuna good choice kingdom hearts 3 is coming so is the ff7 remake and lightning would still kick you in the ass and then the balls i feel an odd sort of kinsmanship with you now for some odd reason should i be worried but seriously rikku vanille yuna all of my yes umm its spelled porom as a gay man i actually agree with this countdown lol but leblanc wasnt in there at all 1230 subscribed you have my respect bro yuffie is soooo cute in advent children when shes 18ish instead of 16 the reason that terra has 2 hair colour variations is because they had way too many blonde haired characters and so to help differ her from the others especially from celes who is also blonde teraa was originally blonde but was changed in her 1st outing hence why she was remade into a blonde for dissidia and her green hair for her 2nd costume yuna is probably the only final fantasy girl that could compete with tifa id bang her like anyone thats not inflated would ever bang you lol should be i wish i could bang her you sound like a fucking rapist and its more than slightly disturbing a good person does not look at a girl and say yea id bang that only sociopaths think that way you should find some help guy i would have to agree with this video 100 you nailed all the ones i was thinking in this top 55510 and that is all that i am happy about tho my opinion is still a little different it is good enough foe me youre right i agree tifa is the sexiest terras hair changes color because iirc her original artwork was blonde due to it being exotic in japan but when the game came here her hair iirc was changed to green because its exotic here and also in japan this channel deserve much more subs than it has the only bad thing i see from it being more out there is that people like anita sarkeesian will try to shut it down with the its too sexualisedfeminist card so happy that yuna ended up 1 im in the awkward situation that my wife looks a lot like yuna totally didnt marry her for that reason totally even her personality always sweet and caring started out real shy but developed an outgoingadventurous spirit shes also a big ff fan and she knows what i think about her resemblance even other people have mentioned the similarity i want to tell her she landed 1 but i cant bear the thought of the look shell give me when she realizes how weird that would be haha lol the beginning youre right having tifa in the competition is like bringing a nuke to a gun fight omg youre amazing darkkefka and i just subbed to you because of your ff count down videos also belldandy ftw you now for number one overall music starts me yuna kh3 is simply square enixs ace in the hole everytime sales start to go down either ffvii or kh3 get teased or leaked or just so much as mentioned and all the old fans come right back hopefully they actually make the damn games this time around what do you guys think overall and all things considered which game is better ff10 or ff12 please let me know your reasoning im really interested to get a lot of opinions reason i ask is i feel that 12 is overlooked and underrated while 10 is overatedboth were great games but what do you guys think i agree i want to look at this too most beautiful character in all of gaming yunas face is to wide to be no 1 for me for me its a tie between edea and lulu i love the whole gothic menacing im going to brutally murder you but look hot while doing it vibe they both have plus ive wanted to cosplay as edea for the longest time rikkus my favorite too in fact shesprobably the hottestof them all especially when she dawned that bikini in x2 yuna on the other hand is both beautiful sexy cute and extraordinary all combined into one guess you can say ffxii has the character with the best ashe xd cissineis real name is whatever you named her in before crisis as she was nunchucku in that i believe thats why they dont say it its a hint to the whole final fantasy 7 games all tying into each other so she doesnt have a single official real name will this make it to the final fantasy hottest girl 2015 httpassetsvg247comcurrent201506girlcloudjpg as a kid going thorgh puberty i had speacial dreams about yuna i was wandering when yuna would show up but thankfully shes 1 also my fave edea from viii wouldve been in my list see first 145 mins tifas too op for this list good likes and stops watching video where the fuck is quina i know you play it off as im such a charming little perverted scamp but its really creepy final fantasy games are pretty great but its fucking annoying to hear some fat black dude talking about fucking a bunch of polygons youre the kind of weirdos that give feminists ammo to use against gamers as being a bunch of sicko rapists clearly forever alone where was celes on the countdowns come on shes a blonde bombshell id bang her number one are you fucking serious thats called having a thing for child looking chicks you have a fetish which severely skewed your view man so kingdom hearts chicks are included why no bravely heart than for same reason its a good choice that you didnt put tifa into one of the contestant coz lets be fair she already won the title of hot babe among all the games female characters yuna i freaking love you man xd yuna is my 1 character off al time and imtalking about ffx yuna not the second game wich is crap sighff is ff dude and kh is kh they are different franchises lols darkkefka terras hair color is originally blonde but in the original version of the game they made it green because they thought she looked too much like celes idiots 1 aerith 2 rosa 3 adult rydia 4 celes 5 original yuna 6 rinoa 7 quistis 8 garnet 9agrias 10beatrix 11 nabaat 12tifa 13 terra 14 lebrea 15 ovelia 16 mysterious girl 17 cidney 18 stella 19 cisnei 20 lightning i kinda had a thing for fang yeah some will say shes more or less a dude that was remodeled into a woman but hell i grew up with a couple tomboy girls and they tend to be hot when they grow up and fang is kinda like that to me also ultimica and cloud of darkness in dissidia also drew my attention needed to add a 4th category of sleazy type outfits always loved garnet and then there is lulu there was a little word play that you could do with tidus in talking to lulu about dating her was kinda funny 5 yuel 4vanille 3sice 2seven 1lightning you put a scene of tifas hentai video the hair for terra is from the game when she is in human mode she has green hair when in esper mode it is blonde however in esper mode her outfit is different at least it is in the game my personal top girls and runner ups to save time and space for each categories cutest terra i find her more cute and innocent than beautiful runner up selphie most beautiful aerith will always be number one in this category to me runner up yuna most banging tie between lulu and lebreau i will undress them faster than bruce almighty runner up lightning cuz i love tough chicks hottest overall tifa notwithstanding dammit this was the hardest one i love them all but if i judged by which character is the hardest to take my eyes off of it would have to be vanille runner up short list rikku rinoa elena she doesnt get enough love quistis serah would you mind making another one check stella and cindy of ff xv sorry about all the typos my thumbs are too big i dont care what you say about fang she is stisll tht tosp of msy lits and so hat if she is manly she is hot to me and id bang her every day if i could but sadly i cant yuna is the most beautiful character have been ever see i just heard girls generation gee gee yes i like asian girls short doesnt matter really cute and very nice to talk to and btw dk i play female characters for the same reason lol yuffie crisis core awwwee final fantasy vii cute advent children hot dirge of cerberus damn sexy duuude duuuude i wont question your choices and rankings but but how could you forget edea and ultimecia not even honorable mentions also dont call dibs on rikku shes my personal favorite too i refer to lulu as distracting boobs dk watch this video even though your probabky gonna hate ithttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvopgqogmk67m blond is exotic in japan but not so in america and europe so they changed it to green to go along with the other worldlyness of her character if you didnt already know by the by terra with green hair superior as far as the aerith thing goes squaresoft had to decide between killing off aerith or killing of tifa they chose aerith probably because fanboys would have killed them had they killed off tifa i like her and all but god forbid oversized boobs dont stick around in a video game and oh gosh i lost it at fran and ashe lmaoxd technically you cant go to jail for having a crush on a 15 year old in general but it doesnt make it any less creepy where is fang during this whole video i was thinking if it cant be tifa at 1 it has to yuna glad we think alike seems as if fran is the closet im going to get to a hot black chick in final fantasy i agree with tifa and yuna 100 ugh vid spoiler alert around 400420 dont watch if youre about to play through ffxiii2 i think aeriths the beautiful final fantasy girl inside and out and i appreciate her character more than anything but i will say that the other choices youve picked i can agree with but behonestyouthoughtsheshoudlvebeenincludedinmontyoumsspecialdamnit no elena from advent children complete coming into the video i was thinkingit better be tifa or we will have problems then it got interesting with removing her but yeah yunano complaints there you should do a list with guys i mean girls want some of that cloud to and btw i love rikku too shes so cute can you please give me the link or tell me the name of that song in your opening queensevensice should have been number 1 jihl nabaat could definitely get it why minfilia is not in this she must at least be no 3 or something rydiaaaaaaa super hot humm those of you who are familiar with that tifa scene you all should be ashamed of yourselves lol i came here to see if yuna was 1and for no other reason but i must say kairi is not a final fantasy character shouldnt be on this list oh no love for shantotoor any of the ladies from ff xi for that matter why no ffx2 leblanc totally bang her httporig09deviantartnetfed8f2008301adleblancffx2mcmexpooct08byelegantaurajpg you had to disqualify tifa really meh shes not even all that id put her somewhere in the middle to me shes the girl next door never really cared for her not even after the graphics got enhanced in advent children shes pretty generic in the design and looks department i mean theres really nothing about her that makes her appearance unique or stand out and her personality is just boring i always liked aerith better anyway while playing ffvii you cant get her mixed up with anyone else shes graceful feminine beautiful mysterious and ethereal aerith was a total angel in the updated graphics at the end of crisis core and i cannot wait to see her with even more updated graphics in ffviis remake my top 5 would be aerith garnet terra rinoa and then yunafrom x she looked a little bit too much like a mouse in x2 and honestly though almost all final fantasy characters look hot or beautiful shrugs yuna was the only reason i finished ffx was that you hugging i think tara strong awwww not sure about the original ff7 but aeriss charm climbs up when she appears in the movies and later titles lol tifa isnt hot at all i personally am not even remotely attracted to her thats just your personal choiceso you should have put her at the top of your list ive never understood why yuna is so popular she has gray hair and a boring personality shes on the bottom of my list except for payne of course yeah yuna is really great one of the reason why final fantasy x is my favourite final fantasy game i agree your list was quite interesting and you didnt mention ashes wedding outfit or penelos revenant of wings outfit those were sexy clothes too i like celes too so sad she didnt made your list while kairi shouldnt be on your list if you talk about her then what about princess jasmine shes hot stuff too for one instant i tought that serah was your cutest character because in xiii she was rather more cute then sexy in 132 she was both but really how could you disqualify tifa i mean give her an award for being unique i didnt agree with this list until i saw yuna as number 1 i fully agree with that one yuna took everything for me hottest cutie and id bang you without a doubt i cant believe you didnt mention paine from x2 i loved her and even though she was quite quiet dayumm she woulda been runner up from yuna for all of them kingdom hearts kairi i prefer aqua she got dem boot she got dem boob she got dem boys like zach and terra tough you have a good taste there sir serah hotter than lightning pftplease squall and siefer arent the same age selphie either id consider kh a ff if they did the ff characters justice squall and seifer the same age and yuna rikku and payne fairies while tidus is soras age the disney characters are spot on from there movies and im not even gonna mention how they ruined zack and how he was the only ff in the psp game i know most people reading this only played kh because of the ff not for donald and goofy tifa is and always have been the queen i do believe that spot goes to either lara croft or chunli tifa is well behind these two brother is pretty hot though tifa has to be disqualified i love how u always dq someone in every count down sorceress edea should have been on there first hey brett gailey the women probably wont get offended theyre video game characters secondly thank you dk for saying it as far back as ive been playing and when playing applicable games people have asked why i am usually playing as the females do i want to look at tifa or barrett claire redfield or leon s kennedy lara croft or nathan drake btw i know the last two arent in the same game i was making a point lastly i respect your choices but no celeswow to my taste aerith would be winning all categories anybody else agree wow disqualifying tifa i mean yes shes hot but really shes not the hottest girl in video games she is about laura croft level of hotness but seriously samus is many many times hotter then her even before zero suit samus was a thing samus is so smoking hot normal people need a varia suit around her tifa on the other hand is a bit overrated of ff7 yea shes the best of the 3 girls yuffi is a teenage slut and aeris is as bland as paper but really there are hotter ff girls out there and ive never played an ff game since ff13 which was junk i dont understand why do you always play women as your main character now i want to see you do the opposites list as a april fools joke and do the hottest final fantasy guys list sydney in ff15 trumps them all but she is new thinkshelke definitely deserves a spotnext to cute ones but thats ok not my list anyways yuna need some boob job to compare the queen league tifa lock hart and yes that your taste and my taste is big bun not flat bread so you classify your opinion as a problem no need to go any further is the most idiotic thing i ever see and hear matate por amor a la humanidad how can garnet not be n1 cutest her face is flawless rinoa is the best i hope vanille is on this dat ashe tho for real my top picks in no particular order are rydia terra celes yuffie fran rikku yuna and gogo i havent played ff13 also i thought porom was like 12 years old tifa will stay as tier0 forever when ff7 remake releases or atleast show their character designlol terra is a badass of course shes on a list how did u spell yeul wrong when its spelt on the screen for you lol ive given rydia some thought and it isnt the green that turns me on it is the unkempt and wild appearance she has rosa is attractive but she is too wellcoifed and tidy in appearance and that rates her lower in my opinion rydia has this air to her that says she is not afraid to chip her nails on an offenders face should they deserve it while rosa looks like a contest poodle personally i hate that about a girl when they look that orderly it sends the vibe that they spend so much time on their appearance that theyve lost sight of more important values and here i was thinking i was the only guy who used females as main characters in video games based solely on the fact that i much rather look at a females ass than a guys applauds i completely agree with your opinion of tifa she is indeed the queen of babes i also looove rinoa shes got a special place in my heart since ff8 was the first ff game i played as always your commentary was awesome 1102 1107 what did you think about elza from ff12 aka hot npc alert httpimg3wikianocookienetcb20121017073311finalfantasyimages00delzaff12jpg i like it for the most part i just have one girl i think should have been on the beautiful list lenne from ffx2 that dancers garb really compliments her figure cute face long flowing hair and those big beautiful brown eyes does anyone else agree with me do you guys think lenne should be anywhere on the lists dk did you consider her at all and then replace her no selfie in cute list im mad bro nice list not exactly sure why but i was a bit surprised and quite pleased to see fran on your list maybe because 12 doesnt seem to get much attention yuffie is a great pick too one that i would have liked to see on the list is pain from x2 haha at the begining theres a short part of a porn vdeo of tifa xd indeed taste is personal and so cannot be disagreed on but we were very surprised not to see eiko in the cute list those flapping sleeves alone do it for us already haha if you mention final fantasy and cute in one sentence eiko pops up lol yuna for the win i agree with your list 100 and ff13 girls are sexy and ff1012 love me a viera i was shocked at the top 5 cutest sure yuel is cute bbut serah also how is quistis on the beautiful list but not rinoa sees serah and rinoa on the top 10 list ooooohhhh okay aeris is forever 1 for me xd shes top everything on my list 2nd would be yuna lightning is someone i will never to attracted to shes just a bro to me you are one of the rare people that like vanille d claps yes on the lulu xd rikku is great too i always used ashe to roam around cause i loved how good her ass look i like more yuna from ffx shes cute and kind of chesty honestly im surprised selphie isnt in any of these categories you seriously need to get a life talking about oooh i wanna bang dat butt maturity of a 6 year old and an annoying trailer park black voice too not to mention your top i wanna bang list definitely shows us that you like little boys fran really mmm hump it like a rabbit tbh my top 10 final fantasy and kingdom hearts girls are 10tifa final fantasy 7 because well i like her personality and she kicks butt but i put her so low is because well there are other girls who i get better attached to 9namine kingdom hearts because of her role as a type of sagelike character and her hair color does have some points yeah blonds do hold a special place in my heart because of nostalgia plus i ship her with roxas namine just has that inner and outer beauty 8queen final fantasy type0shes intelligent and does a good job of being a leader her eyes are also a plus 7rikku final fantasy x because of how preppy she is and again blond 6rosa final fantasy iv shes very sweet and is pretty much cecils light that will come into play later 5aqua kingdom hearts birth by sleep her hardworking nature and strong motherly side 4lulu i know i complain about her tsundere like tendencies but after seeing chappu she does have a change of kairi made this list with those big size 37 manly feet just an observation her hair was blonde in the japan version but they changed it to green in the american release to avoid confusing her with celes i believe im a girl and i think tifa yuffie fang rikku and lighting are hot as hell d wot waz dat anime u showed senpai i had to do it lol cool and funny vid xd i was enjoying the video until you put kairi in a ff countdown facepalm much disappoint i compliment your list i too think highly of sera and vanilles looks and if you think 10 is to low a numberwhat made you think 5 would be enough for cute beautiful or ones i would want to bang xd what about garnet from ffix she was the hottest character definitely my favourite i was like 12 years old when i play the game d its funny the instant you say im not going to like your final decision i think soandso nah and then it turns out that it is soandso and i dont really have a problem with your decision she seemed like waifumaterial from what i played in ff if this was made this year i bet it would include sice from type0 and i couldnt blame d seriously dude spoilers for yeul come on i was more into larxene than kair before i watched this i told myself its either tifa wins or she gets disqualified for being too hot you da man dk you da man your sexualization of females is disgusting i wanted to watch this video just to see your opinion on the characters but this sexualization is appalling its 2015 nobody wants a man who thinks of a girl as a piece of meat rinoa is number 9 how could you ranked her so low i dont like lightning at all i dont know why garnet is garnet rikku should get dressed already what the hell is kairi doing here ashe is beautiful vanille is too well i dont know but she annoys me yuna well you have got a point lucky tidus rinoa you will alway be my n1 wait a minute you say you wanna bang alys who is that at 053 i was 8 when i started playing ffx and i ahve to admit even though it was early in mmy life love came for me when i saw yuna and rikku but the only one that stayed was the perfectly gorgeous yuna for me terra is the coolest tifa is the hottest and yuna is the most beautiful im ok with the list even though most of the girls i havent heard of i need to play more ff sequels what the hell yuna and sarah farron didnt make the id bang list that crazy why kairi got hereshe is on kingdom hearts not final fantasy i dont suppose we can count the aeons from ffx wheres lenne and paine and shalua darkkefkayou my friend make some really good videos this one being my favorite and i wanted paine too oh well man final fantasy xiii girls are the best the graphics are so good that they are more real than us i cant take a number one i think serah lightning vanille and yeul are too hoy cute and sexy at the same time i was wondering where my girl was at on this list when i saw her at the endi literally was like my girl lol yuna has always been and always will be my favorite ff character d youre a funny man darkkefka enjoyed the video i am pleased with this outcome my top pick is a toss up between yuna and fang what is that dance clip that he keeps showing forgive me if this is off topic but you should do a top 10 final fantasy bad girls list or are there not enough girls to make such a list yuna and tifa just got some serious competition its a girl known as cidney yuna bes pick ever sh is the best darkkefkahey so no rosso the crimson from dirge of cerberus i remember when i first started playing ff games i always thought paine for ff102 was the hottest then i played ff13 a few years ago and i have to say lightning is the hottestmost beautiful in all ff there is something about her character that so enticing people may think she is too boyish but that sternnessstubbornness is such a tease her personality is really bitchy on the surface but you can tell there are layers that get better as you get to know her character better in the game lightning is amazing most or all of the ff girls character bodies were modeled after japanese female body types however ashes body was modeled from a french womans body type which is probably why her but is so popping p yuna ffx didnt make the cutest list no way she is so cute yeah i agree i always thought yuna was cute i would stick it in her pooper easy never listen to the extra audio on ffx hd the shit pissed me off serah seems like she belongs more on the cute list for me the most beautiful sexy girl in ff is garnet it is a very good and detailed list and i agree with a lot of the choices though maybe my ordering might be slightly different yes i would keep kairi on the list though technically the new characters that were created for the kingdom hearts series like sora riku and kairi are actually disney characters in themselves after all the game is a disney interactive game with square enix support and licensing for use of their final fantasy elements and characters to help provide story and support outside of the individual disney worlds they even gave most of the final fantasy characters their own world of radiant garden hollow bastion but considering how much ff elements are used in kh it does make since to include kairi in the list not to mention how gorgeous her american voice actress is you know when zidane touched garnets butt and he said i didnt do it on purpose i thought the same thing sure zidane i cant help to say i think whoever thinks like this guy is disturbed its not real but you can obviously connect to it because they have a way of expressing their feelings yeah the guys in final fantasy are wonderfully made up but no way would i fantasize over whats not real lmbo new breed of creepy to each their own but i never cared much for yuna but my top 5 are rikku lulu aerith tifa lightning penelo had dat booty as a somewhat of a pervert im pretty observant with women many people are wondering why the fuck isnt fang on this list something about her bothered me from the beginning and this article confirms something i already knew the reason why fang isnt on this list is because she seems a littlemanly to me apparently square got lazy with fang during the creation and put a womens face over a mans body and added in a few female structures httpepicstreamcomfeatureslist55funfactsyouprobablydidntknowaboutfinalfantasy10 agreed with just about all of this list though id have put frans older sister jote somewhere in either overall id bang her or beautiful while fran has raw sex appeal jote had that more mature dareisay motherly beauty that outshined alot of women in ffxii speaking of motherly im surprised hopes mom in ffxiii wasnt on these lists anywhere she had a gorgeous face and even though she was mostly covered up you could still tell that mother had a figure myfour favorites is yunaasherosa and penelo rydialulu and fran rounds out my second favoritechoices omg i cant believe you chose my favourite female character as number one yuna i love you haha sorry alyssa is way to skinny although she has a nice butt i have to agree yuna is amazing lightning you motherfuuckkerrs i love she tifas on everyones list thats why she cant be on yours cause shes among the hottest by default lol id bang her 1 should be edea from ff8 dat 1 beautiful didnt disappoint 3 she is basically the main character of ffx imo you really lost me at the 15 year olds dude you should get that treated okay darkkefka i promise i wont rage because for a lot of the girls i agree with your choices personally i wouldve placed quistis a couple of spots higher on the beautiful list but i got a thing for redheads and chicks with undeniable specs appeal overall i think youve really hit on it i also wouldve had beatrix in but as you said its your list no celes in that list booh terra rocks btw tifa yuna thats it contest over 1217 rikkus swim suit i had the exact same reaction and comment on my first ffx2 playthrough shes still my favourite ff female character lol looks and personality omg the whole time i was like what about yuna d woo highfives shes perfect 3 dude edea should have totally been on this list she is sexy as hell zidan you srs didnt realize thee was silent in zidane i agree i fell in love with yuna the first time i saw her youll bang her thats disgusting no one thinks like that wooooooooooooooooo im just glad yuna is 1 and that kairi was considered xd for me my favorite girl in the whole final fantasy series is rydia just because of her simple beauty shes a black mage and i love her personality what they nerfed terra which final fantasy was serah in all the women you see on this list are in the heartless realm if you what any on broad speak now or forever think placing the hottest women on broad of kingdom hearts 3 i completely agree on tifa yuna actually looks japanese the first cut from tifa is from a porn i am agree with number one where can i find the music video where all the girls are dancing i fucking lost it at 719 have top 5 cute top 5 beautiful then top 5 id bang her lol the reason terras hair is blonde in some shots of dissidia is because when her game came out blonde hair on game sprites is hard to actually see so they had to go with green hair so you could see she actually had hair and dissidia basically was just giving us both hair colors for the simple fact that it was her character design in the concept art and game but her original color was blonde because amano had a thing with blonde hair and blue eyed characters back in the day the majority of why tifa is the queen is because of her tits no more no less yes she has awesome moves etc but seriously you would be kidding yourself if you thought that her popularity was because of those moves when it all comes down to in the end because of her tits 432 i thought the same thing of squall my put a sock in it blindfold and bend over list haha quistis lulu fang vanille fran penelo cidney jihl paine sice queen bro let me just say you earned yourself a like by putting yuna on 1 in this sense great minds think alike edit whaddaya know time to play ffx2 again tsk if agrias had an fmv shed so be all over that list d new sub here i was goddamn nervous i taught yuna was not on the list til you hit number 1 anyway you got all my bae rinoa and yuna tifa is my bae too but sad shes not on the list but i agree with you that she cant be on the list cause it will be so bias she has all those characteristics shes cute beautiful and sexy i totally agree with your list tifa 4 the winn yeah i would definatley bang lu lu now frain maybelist i would so tap that when its comes to vanille rosa is pretty hot lightning is pretty hot id bang her i love garnet beautiful rikku is hot but paine is hotter yeah i think kairi is pretty cute and yuna needs to be on the bang her list you have the same reason like me for playing with girls instead of boys d i always tell everybody id love me some nice girls ass then a boys ass d here and there some other opinions tbh but like you said its taste but i can live with yours i agree with the majority of the list but i think fang deserves a spot on the list shes got the killer figure sexy accent strong and loyal plus that sari looks fangtastic on her tifa ftw son terra has always been my favorite im glad she was on your beautiful list beatrix is the best overall celes was the best i was wondering if you were going to have fran on here somewhere to be honest i was mostly impressed she crosses deserts and beaches and caves and mountains and forests in high heels but her english voice and those rabbit ears contribute to one smokin hot bunny lady never been much of a yuna fan even after a decade of x and x2 playing if she was in any other game id like her but next to lulu and rikku shes just sooooooo plain didnt want to say it but in the beginning where he was saying he was disqualifying tifa the clip where she is just standing there is the beginning of a porn of tifa i dont judge i like it lol good porn tho nice choices man i have always been a terra fan so impressed that you picked her as your 1 most beautiful i just wish they would put celes chere in one of them shes my all time hottest for both looks and personality i do like lulumy brother likes penelofran and alyssa im feeling rikku and lightningmy brother also does the butt watching with vanille and sherry and yuna yuna ftwalong with all ff female characters w first off no kh is not a ff game no matter how u slice it second how dare u take tifa off the list or even give her the chance smh i totally agree to the list but kingdom hearts is no ffgame its a disney game with some people from final fantasy really penelo xd youre countdown is nice but the repetitive music between each countdown is annoying after a while i would trade penelo for garnet at cute girls no2 but like you said its an matter of taste that kingdom heart girl is more cute for me too but i dont know which cutie should trade place with her nice video i like it no beatrix from ffix i see kinda why you disqualified tifa cause she would be number 1 on every list as would mine i would put rikku in 2 cause damn maybe im jumping the gun because i just finished the cute part but where the f is vanille lol youre right its what you prefer i agree with tifa hands down but i dont look at aeris that way to me aeris seems like a daughter or sister somebody who needs protection grown up rydia though yeah edge noticed even while he was wounded there she is number 2 vanille is 1 the whole time i was waiting for yuna number 1 you got it shes a lot more attractive in ffx though 1 yuna 2 tifa 3 rinoa 4 lightning 5 ashe 6 aerith 7 paine 8 serah 9 vanille 10 terra and now i must go watch real emotion as sung by koda kumi english version too if i can find it ha i thought i was the only who liked lebreau good vid and list xd i almost 100 disagree on just about every top insert number here video you have oo i guess we just have very different opinions on all things final fantasy also kairi is in no way shape or form a final fantasy character she should not be on this list she is maybe a square enix character but not a final fantasy character lebreau and lulu i agree with no beatrice or ruby from ix 010 terrible list lol i like tifa tifa is best of best beautiful cute sexy lovely brigtness tifa is the best beautiful whats was that vid were all the girls from final fantasy girls are dancing i was positively surprised by your list because it was quite complete criteriawise i dont share all your opinions but overall i like the fact that anyone can understand your choices we might not like them but we get it and cant say anything my views are probably different because since im a girl its really hard for me to judge these characters solely on their looks thats why im not fit to judge here what was the first game you shed a tear for this list was going great until lightning popped up no1 lightning 3 id pick urd over belldandy any day 10 rosa she is an amazing white mage she is very sweet very kind and extremely protective of both kain and cecil she is one of my favorites 9 rinoa she is a sorceress but she has a big heart and she is very much in love with squall 8 lightning despite her anger and her bad attitude she is an amazing warrior shes very beautiful in every way and she knows how to handle her enemies everything she does is for her sister 7 princess garnet after her mother dies she loses focus and she cant control her emotions however she learns to battle through the pain and she becomes a force to be reckoned with 6 rikku like yuffie shes adorable she knows how to make people laugh and cry 5 no disney hasnt said that this is a final fantasy game this may be part squareenix but even they have yet to say this is any way compared to final fantasy 4 serah giving her life to save the future she is a very beautiful woman former lcie she knows what she was and she w you put the best from my fav ff iv and you put yuna on number one spot aaaaand you included kairi man this is the best list ever one girl i personally wouldve added is beatrix from ff9 shes beautiful her hair her body her i dont give a shit attitude agree with everyone else though why am i watching this sometimes i wonder how many of my fellow ff fans are doomed to a life fucking fat ugly old or just nasty chicks i slept with a girl that wasnt hot once never again hot girls only even if i end up coming off shallow and have to just turn my brain off during conversation no fang come on you cant deny that she is smokin hot my all time favorite ff girl will always be terra branford i also love rosa yuna lightning as well lol i love how you write off tifa for the right reasons when i play kingdom hearts i always think its like a final fantasy version but its not part of final fantasy game but i love playing that game all your ff 10 102 and 13 132 best picks i never really played the other games im playing 7 now and after that i will play 9 and i never beat all the ff 13 games i have them all just stoped playing when it got to the grindy parts hears the song what can i do for you as 1 pops up oh oh goodness yyuna yuna pops on screen aaaaaaiiiiiiihhyeyeeeeeeeeeeee yyyyeeesssssssss you are the fucking man for making this video i would had been so upset if yuna wasnt on here rydia on this list or rage quit 1233 no its not a final fantasy game i want my 12min back you wasted my time this video is awesome rinoa tifa garnet then yuna are my fave i dont care as much about the others but lulu and beatrix are hot too dude i love how you disqualify tifa cause she automatically wins lol yuna has always been my fav too rikku is under age you know in ffx she was 14 i think and x2 takes place 2 years later so shed be 16 then oh wait you used logic reason number 56 they are video game characters and therefore not real and on ashe her skirt is literally two pieces of cloth two pieces finally i dont mind vanille shes actually one of my favorite characters of ff13 where is that video of all the ff girls dancing im just curious it looks really adorable xd i agree all about ashe i kept watching and not seeing yuna or fang and was prepared to express disappointment in the comments not rage just disappointment haha then you hit number one and i was like its all good id actually rank rosa as 1but meh opinions lol im sorry man i love final fantasy but making a vid about them chicks i dunno seems kinda weirdish to euhm well nvm everyone their thing i guess i kno ud bang them tho xd its just funny to see ppl get hot bout some game chicks xd tht is so true were the fuck is kh3 you know what i have seen so many of these top 10 final fantasy girls lists that completely ignore the side characters we need a top 10 final fantasy female side characters list some thing like in no real order beatrix ff9 lani ff9 leblanc ff102 scarlet ff7 clouds mam ff7 lebreau ff13 elza ff12 julia heartilly ff8 jihl nabaat ff13 dona ff10 i was just happy fran was in the count down 3 quistis for me i like girls with brains and glasses not to mention that school teacher look she has going for her lol i also like rinoa and garnet as well they are so kindhearted i think the new cid gonna replace some of these 3 since tifa wasnt in the list i would have put rikku at number 1 of all for some reason shes been my favorite ff female shes got the looks spunk cutesy and is rather intelligent also yuna is easily my pick as well but i also think lion from ffxi is pretty darn hot as you said it is subjective and my list would be a little bit different but i like your comments especially because you mentioned belldandy as 1 goddess and that you prefer to look at female butt when playing games rip monty 1434 what game is he playing thats great but you basically just listed every single female ff character there is might as well just admit it theyre all hot where the hell is kingdom hearts 3 i know right xd my top ten most beautiful best body 10 yuna 9 kairi 8 vanille 7 rydia 6 terra 5 aqua 4 tifa 3 rikku 2 serah her face and her in a bikini is reason enough lol 1 namin as beautiful from the outside as from the inside really loving that what the song in the beginning called no love for fang c best commentaries ever i agree about yuna and tifa too i wonder where ff 15s cidney would rank here sorry man even letting the 15 and 16 year olds slide kingdom hearts is far from a final fantasy game and kairi really doesnt belong on this list it might just be me but the butchering of the final fantasy universe by this games narrative is just intolerable i admit that kingdom hearts is a good game on its own but they just take way too many liberties with the characters and material they were given nice list but have to say lulu all the way kh and final fantasy are by fave games and i legit yelled thank you when you said that kh can basically be called a final fantasy game and included kiari along with the question when the hell is kh3 coming out along with yuna being 1 3 yuna all the way its not because shes a girl or cute its because shes a spellcaster and can summon big creatures i may be gay or transgender but i will always like yuna for one thing im a spellcaster and i loved her magic dance in the first game darkkefka we just have got the very same taste even with sherry top 10 hottest girls 10 yuna 9 rosa 8 adult rydia 7 aerith 6 celes 5 tifa 4 lulu 3 sorceress edea 2 quistis 1 serah top 10 hottest guys 10 cecil 9 squall 8 vincent 7 sazh 6 cloud 5 zack 4 warrior of light 3 kain 2 jecht 1 snow 1 yuna 2 tifa 3 rikku 4 lightning 5 garnet 6 rinoa she better not have done it before meeting squall 6 yuffie 7 stella we dont know enough about her yet 8 aerith 9 vanille 10 panelo honorable mention terra cissinei lydria lebrea if kairi namine xion aqua and olette all count they would would be in my top 20 list top 5 i wanna bang you i couldnt stop laughing it was an epic win i so agree with yuna kh3 is scheduled to come out this december on ps4 and xbox one final fantasy viii thesorceress i was feelin this listthen you brought in kairi rydia and terra3 ps already liked rydia on ff2 first time i see a little cutscene of her i was wondering how you can get a boner from pixels no love for celes i feel sad seriously i really love celes d lol this video is hilarious were not going to jail for having a crush on a video game character challenge accepted great list i dont care what any of you say rydia is love rydia is life then lulu then tifa i also like faris from ff5 interesting character and celes i really like her too i bet she has a busty compact but rydia is the best ff girl i think i mean green hair is sexy oh wow i almost completely forgot about cloud of darkness rydia is on my mind so much that i actually forgot about her cod is like my 2nd favorite id totally tap that oh my god what the hell am i doing with my life fantasizing virtual people god dammit dont judge me rinoa is best out of these somehow i knew yuna was going to be 1 my favorte ff girls would have to be tifa yuna rikku rinoa and finally lightning anime girls however 1 is reserved for moka akashiya from rosario vampire yes i mean both sides of moka where did you get the mmd of those girls at 210218 i was starting to get concerned when i didnt see yuna on this list but you didnt let me down man final fantasy is the reason why my standards for girls is too high 850 i mean lets be real here how can you not think about sex what am i doing with my life i agree overall tifa is the best though lulu and garnetdo come pretty damn closeas well even considering that they looked good in combat as well and not just in the cut scenes when i thinkrinoa looked like total shit in combat gameplay and cut scenes werent that great alsoshe shouldnt of even been onthe list there was really nothing special about her should ofreplaced her withsorceress edeashe was actually the hottestgirl in number eight in my opinion nabaat and lulu are voiced by the same actress paula tiso where is elza httpfinalfantasywikiacomwikielza like you said people will disagree and i think with my tastes the hottest is not tifa but is in fact paine from ffx2 outside of tifa rinoa is my favorite i have to admit im a girl and i really like this video but you putting yuna at number one surprized the hell outta me xd yunas my fave finally fantasy character i only got ffxiii a few days ago and i noticed nabaats figure straight away the first time i saw her where were you when aerith died i had to laugh at what you said about fran it made me laugh i mean seriously i could you not think about sex lo right to the point course i new ashe and lulu would be on the list somewhere sure theyre not number 1 on your list but you know im not complaining as long as some of my favorite girls are somewhere on the list im not complaining besides my tastes are pretty general when it comes to cuteness sexuality and just plain oh god let me get a taste and of course yuna she deserves the number one spot in my opinion as for tifa well shell have to try a little harder next time but hey you cant deny anybody would wanna do tifa even my own sister would i know this because she said so herself and besides whats wrong with falling in love with a vg girl lol after i saw tifa disqualified i didnt want to watch it anymore cause cmon shes why were all here haha im curious as to why i didnt see celes what is the song that plays at 1023 i love yuna good choice man good choice tifa and lulu are the hottest no question something about rikkus spunkiness makes her pretty hot too quistis with the whip is pretty damn hot too im curious about lightning too why did square kill of aeris just cause no seriously someone just said lets kill off aeris and they did in what ff game did hey bring all the main heroes together with cosmos dk you just won a subscriber i like your taste in final fantasy girls and your passion for the games plus your comments are pure gold i would say aqua instead of kairi 1 terra 2 serah 3 tifa 4 garnet 5 lulu 6clair lightning 7rinoah 8 quistis 9 rikku 10 rydia i only dont put fang here because she was supposed to be a man my list is like 1 tifa lockheart 2 aerithgainsborough 3 lulu 4quistis 5 yuna the summoner honorable mentions shalua rui lucrecia crescent rinoa terra branford cissnei not her real name i would include rosso the crimson on my id bang her list xd why the heck kairi in the video its not even from final fantasyjust because kingdom hearts was square enixs project lightning is best 3 penella is maka from soul eater i agree with your list hands down with tifa as always best countdown for me final fantasy 10 is my favorite so rikkuyuna are always gonna be my number one dam i need to hurry up and beat x on my vita so i can play x2 how can any of you deny that the hottest most bangable ff woman isbrahne raza alexandros xvi eiko is cute in like a cute kid way quistis is a sexytime goddess hands down best countdown ever and it never get us bored because of your funny commentaries complete list and i almost know all the girls but still lightning farron would always be my no1 why because shes not only a pretty face and super strength carrier but also she is now the legendary ff character ever no ff character have ever killed the real god ever besides her though i dont want that to happen for real but lightning is damned shit soo cool and hot rydia cuz of her green hair huh if the carpet matches the drapes i think il pass lol my list 1rydia those fmvs when she returns older 2tifa lockhart 3lightning 4serah 5vanille 6rikku 7terra branford 8yuna 9yuffie kisaragi 10aerith gainsborough honourable mentions princess ashe beatrix garnet kingdom hearts is not an ff game yes it include characters from ff but it isnt an ff game those fmv of rydia though were fucking amazing when she returned she would definitely be in my top ten i am glad vanille ranked 2 on the official list also happy about terra and lulu i would have had paine on the bang her list though yaaaayyuna is on the top you are just like my opinionsmake me xdlike your taste yunayunayunayaaay yuna is on the top i like itto me she is sexygoodbeatifulla little bit naughty and romance tides i like it this was the greatest countdown i have ever watched subscribed this is going to get a lot of hate but i dont care i dislike tifa paine is totally bangable even though she looks like a gothemo with daddy issues what video does the dance clip at 124 come from wheres sephiroth lol god dam u u got anaconda in my head u basterd but ur a great youtuber ill let it slide alyssa is product of a paradox you resolved it and got rid of her you actually kill alyssa is it just me or do the clips in the video change each time you watch it how can you forget shiva you do know that number 2 on the bang that chick is over 50 year old theres a reason why kain wants to kill cecil true dat bro u had me rollin lol but id bang her catagory guess thats a dude catagory best part at the end rikku am soryy but your cousin is hotter than you it made me laugh soooo much dude i dont get the big worship of tifa shes rather plain how can you not put in any of those yunalesca am i the only one that thinks beatrix is hot its a nice pick but rikku is my number 1 lol xd i really like yunabut i also like serahlighting and stellaanyway yuna is number 1 for me 10 qustis 9 rosa 8 yuna 7 yuffie 6 rydia 5 rikku 4 porom after years 3 selphie 2 garnet 1 aerith 1 pick definately going to agree there made x2 100 worth buying and playing over and over nabaat was cruel i know ive hit rock bottom when im watching a video titled final fantasy hottest girls or is it just because im a fan of dak kafka i suppose ill never think about it too much ugh tifa only had one redeeming quality which is why i named her titties in ffvii quistis ooohhhh i do love that nerdy look even if im not terribly fond of blondes as a rule fraaaaaaannnnnn oh that leather armor thong alyssa its called factory air i really dont like tifa at least one people to contracdict your disqualified one d skip the yuel cutscenes cause you hate seeing her die over and over part rofl that was gold oh thank you thank you thank you i really love your choices every single one was placed perfectly and guys really you have to admit that yunies just the greatest 3 this is definitely one of the funniest countdowns youve ever done yuna certainly is gorgeous but howd i forget that she and brother are cousins no wonder rikku yelled sicko when he tried to hug her and you have to wonder why rikku decided to strip down so much in the sequel lol although no denying shes pretty hot in her own right tara strong herself scares the hell out of me just dont ask why also as for your comment on the disqualifier clearly you have not played fateextra caster thats all im gonna say i never realy found vanille to be annoying what killed 13 for me was the crap combat setting fucking seriously lightning your just going to walk right into that deathbeam ang get one shot by that five faced fuck nowe dont all agree that kingdom hearts is a final fantasy game i like both but they are not the same series god i cant help but keep watching this time and time again simply because my yuna made the top spot im surprised you didnt add fang but i respect your opinion dk 3 ps good job pulling out jihl nabaat d i almost expected yuna to be 1 i mean cmon its yuna you are right everyone has their own taste and i like tifa not because of the boobs of course im a girl after all anyway i totally agree with you a lot especially top 10 my favorite girls rinoa selphie eiko i know i know shes a kid garnet beatrix tifa yuffie yuna rikku serah lightning vanille kairi terra yeah take it off take it off noooooo damn cape my exact reaction at the same scene yeah we honestly might not get kh3 at least for another 23 years at least we know its gonna be eventually released though i actually dont have a problem with kairi on this list i consider kh to be its own series but still related to ff but not canon and all that so thats close enough for me kingdom hearts 3 is indeed coming out for the ps4 and xb1 its in development and we probably wont get it for another 23 years sometimes your honesty makes me laugh like did he just say that good list although i hated alyssa more because i just knew she was up to some bad shit strange beatrix is no where on this list dk i am a little confused now i watched youre lp of ffix and there you said in the ending of that game when they show garnet in the airship that shes the most beautiful final fantasy girl ever look at 930 when you said just those words im not complaining or anything but thats what you said lol however my list is my top 10 most beautiful final fantasy females 1 aerith ffvii 2 tifa ffvii 3 yuna ffx 4 garnet ffix 5 terra ffvi 6 cissnei ffviicc 7 rinoa ffviii 8 rikku ffx 9 lightning ffxiii 10 rydia ffiv i remember spitting my drink when 3 for overall girl was shown i knew you were gonna do that obviously since youre a straight man we cant ask for a hottest guys but have you ever considered doing something like badass guys or something like that glanced because i was curious where youd put a couple but garnet is adorableshes not the only good looking one obviously but fuck it all if she aint cute and i just noticed something quistis is familiar as hell and all i can think of is bayonetta which is weird because i dont have it nor have i seen that much of it sure aint from playing 8 becauseno its not from playing 8 oh and quistis is way too young to be a teacher i mean really shes like as old as her students kingdom hearts 3 is still in development my hottest girl is vann look at that lushes hair kh3 was set to release at the end of this year but i believe they pushed it back again so we will not be seeing it probably till the end of 2015 possibly summer of 2016 dont know why its taking so long girls generation was in there gee kpop song when it hit 1 on most over all women i was rooting yuna ashe 3rd what the fuck fucking fuck no1 everyday ok just in case anyone is wondering the dance sequence in the beginning is dead fantasy gee by montyoum i know that i was wondering what it was so heres the answer kefka i respect your opinion really you did great by putting tifa outside of this list because of what you said she is the hottest girl in gaming putting her in a final fantasy list is pointless after all as for your number 1 pick in the top 10 i completely agree yuna is the best final fantasy girl imo too d nice tastes man and for the other tops and girls well i agree too except some from xiii2 but thats because i didnt play it i do agree with serah though because even with the almost no appearance in the first game i did get a kind of feeling for serah and as for kairi well she isnt a disney character and she isnt a final fantasy one as well but ah what the heck she is a square enixsoft creation so she can count to this list and i agree yuffie is the best 4 me number 1 we all agree omg iknew it was yunie i heard kingdom hearts 3 was coming out in june i was just watching some of darkkefkas videos again and i noticed this and where the hell is kingdom hearts 3 over a year later after this video was made and still no kingdom hearts 3 just a bunch of spinoffs and a remaster but its supposed to come out for ps4 i think fans are starting to get pissed as long is yuffie is one of em i can accept it whose ass smells better rikku lightning or tifa sorry dk kh is not even in the same class as ff xd yes thank you for showing aerith dead funny commentary lol good stuff im very pleased with who you chose as 1 overall she is my favorite i used to manipulate the game camera angles to get a close up of her ass in the narrow corridor on the airship dk the only banging i would do to nabaat involves a sledgehammer and possibly a couple dozen railroad spikes that bitch cant rate because she is too much of a bitch just imagine how she would look in a bikini f that just imagine how shed look on fire lol love 840 silence while watching her walk and i hear seriously here how can you not think about sex good stuff man any rinoa fans whats that dancing part at the biggining from why everyone isnt happy because kairi is in the list kairi is beautiful girl and i am happy she was in the list and what is the song that plays for ashe i disagree with your disqualification of tifa shes pretty great of course but i simply just dont agree that shes the best female of all video games it comes down to the whole different tastes thing as far as final fantasy goes i put yuffie and rikku much higher due to my love of the cute types though tifa definitely has the traits needed to make a great motherwife and is definitely attractive shes just not my first pick the id bang top 5 couldnt have been any more accurate lol haha great topten dude to be honest final fantasy bitches are too skinny for my taste and too young im not 25 anymore i argee yuna is smoking cannt wait to get my hands onfinal fantasy 10 hd light ftw seriously how could no one put quinna on their list yuna fan girl yes right choice i guess with fran maybe it the bunny ears that give her her sexiness but i wouldnt put he on the bang list maybe the hot list but i know zoophiles would like to bang her yuna 1thats good but i think rikkiu should have been 2 and where the hell is kingdom hearts 3 haha already knew you are going to rate yuna as the one number one i would too but for cute did you consider selphie from ff8 at all fuck yes i knew tuna would be number one on this list tifa is undoubtedly hot in 100 of straight men mind but not all of us have to agree to the fact that tifa is the hottest girl in gaming or even final fantasy opinion wise some may rather believe that other girls even in realistic modern games that out of choice that they are 10 times better than tifa because some of us may prefer cute over hot ashe is probably my favorite she has a nice backside i feel many of the ff girls although cute do not do it for me that much prefer thicker girls he is right thats all i have to say your right on with the ranking and i would have said rikku first then yuna but nice damn cape funny as hell nice i think japan rated lightning 1 based on character idk lol you seriously should have said more about garnet for example am i the only one who thinks she looked more beautiful with long hair and can you please make some more top 10 videos maybe top 10 final fantasy games i find tifa overrated i would rank rikku 1 overall but yuna wouldnt be far behind id try to find room for paine and beatrix ff9 in the id bang her list omg brother is her cousin how did that not click i thought you would have put rikku at 1 cute i love quistis too i used her all the time in battle i cried at aeriths death too i think eikos 1 or 2 cute xd thank you for choosing rinoa on the official and garnet i have to agree with your 1 itll always be yuna for me too i still remember the first time i saw her staring at her eyes to see if one was green and the other blue no other character really made me pay attention like that her eyes just suck you in and wont let go ive met 3 real girls in my life who could mesmerize me with their eyes so maybe shes just a trigger for my rl relationships am i the only one thinking yunalesca should have been on the id bang her list no goddess is more beautiful then belldandy amen brother darkkefa im a little surprised pain from ffx2 is not in this even though there are very little shots of her shes pretty damn sexy x3 darkkefka kairi me o0 o i mean yeah square enix outdid itself especially with the red hair and blue eyes combinationbut shes fifteen 1549 i agree say dk i am pretty sure that you have heard of the lightnings return that is gonna be released soon so you will do a playthrough for it right just to see serah back i would i think that the best girl is stella from final fantasy 15 and you forgot her could you do a top 10 female ff characters i mean these girls all got the looks but in some cases thats all they have aeris rinoa and lulu being good examples sorry but thats just my opinion maybe i should also point out i havent played 13 132 or the dissidia games and btw i dont think kairi belongs on this list sure shes hot but kingdom hearts is a totally diffrent frachise mmm some of these i agreed with the only one i strongly disagreed with was rinoa quina is obviously the hottest girl you make funny and useful videos yeul comes back and doesnt die in the next one as a bisexual girl i can agree with a lot of your choices personally id bang them all i agree with dk if there is a game i play that has an option of playing male and female characters i go with female maybe when i was little i would never play as a girl but go 7 years later to present time if i can play as a girl i will play as a girl no shame in hiding it right but rydia in the gameboy version in some weird way will turn into merlin in some weird way ok i have to ask what was that clip of all the girls in a dance line at roughly 123 or so hard as hell list but my 1excluding tifa is either lightning or rikku but i wouldnt count kairi cuz technically she would be counted as a kingdom hearts not final fantasy or disney character you know youd hit it lol well said damn cape prevented everyone from seeing boobs xx i personally love tifa lockheart or lockhart theres one girl that i think should be on the list and sadly isnt paine damn shes hot d nice list keffka d i know it the most beautifu terra judging by ur username hey kefka how excited are you for kingdom hearts 3 on the ps4 lightning sucks why is she on this list send pm man i want to know she was one short of making the beautiful listwhich is why i showed her she was an honorable mention im a man i dont want to look at another mans ass for 50 hours theres nothing stupid about that just out of curiousity whatcha think about lenne it was from a hentai and its a really good one but i cant link it here if the first scene of tifa was a 3d hentai video pass it to me xddd theres something ive learned over the past 5 yearswomen think about sex more than men when he said how can you not think about sex i said simple be a girl she is made by sqaure enix and you might geuss who are making final fantasy nuf said i get kairi after all it is a square game and they did use enough final fantasy in it that its practically tied to it although id personally take selphie over yuffie you shouldve used one of frans fmvs though it shows off her figure much better in a couple scenes shes my 1 for id bang her even if she is the oldest one on the list i almost would dq yuna as well because shes right up there with tifa lightning 8 and were is fang she is super hot kingdom hearts is not final fantasy i knew it i agree yuna babe but i saw her first lol damn it dk youre making me think its ok to fall in love with video game girls i always get asked why i play with female toons in games as well im glad someone else out there understands why nowhere has that been more true than in the earlier builds of dust 514 when you set the scout suit as your default they toned down the figure now but back then it was hands down the best ass you could find like starcraft ghost levels and id have thrown fang in there but i know shes not for everyone so other than that i really loved the list not to me rikku and yuna for me tifa may be in top 10 but these are numbers 1 2 for me aerith i dont know if im the only one but after i played crisis core the death scene in vii got only a billion times harder to watch in vii i thought she was cool kinda cute but more or less an enigma but in crisis core she became a real person but that like three second scene in the ending of kh2 when cloud walks in and she looks at him for the first time in etro knows how long that was pretty emotional for me isnt adding her cheat a little bit i wont say kingdom hearts isnt a final fantasy games but still darkkefka man you have got an awesome taste i would choose the same list and yeah yuna for the win i will dude u get me u really really see final fantasy so similar to how i see it keep a lookout on my page im gonna post a final fantasy vid soon kingdom hearts 3 coming on next gen shes 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 she isnt final fantasy at all never tifas fucking hot shes 100 final fantasy as far as i concered i totally love how you describe bootylicius ashe jajajaja i agree whit yuna you do know that kairi isnt even 00000000000001 final fantasy right this made me laugh so muchxd no lenne from ffx12 le gasp i found her hotter then yuna in the songstress garb dont have the time right now to watch the whole video but got to your disqualification and you know what for some reason i feel like i should be mad but im not and completely agree with your decision cant till i have the time to watch the rest i realized what time it was got shit to do lol i dunno man im the opposite i love anime as far as story plot cause lets be real half the things they do cannot be done ina real actor actress movie yet i couldnt stand to sit there and watch me some virtual boobs and pussie it just wouldnt do me any good at all so real porn for me and bleach naruto for entertainment tehehe best of both worlds sounded more like you said yo daddy but you get my point what did u say neways i really really wish i could understand that ghetto accent of yours but when your speaking about cosmos and u mentioned another goddess did u just say no1 is more bootyfull then ya daddy wtf really lol i cant understand what are you talking about i know hes good friends with rikku but he only really loves yuna also if youre talking about lenne thats not tidus its shuyin completely different person shes not even a woman anyway just takes that form for no reason whatsoever lol when baby got back pop up i lost it way to funny i wouldnt trust you around the touhou part of youtube 1430 well it seems that im not the only one xd i dont know why people are afraid to admit that they have or are watching porn lol its not like youre going to get shot at from nowhere if you say anything about it ive watched porn and i have seen all types shudders people be crazy man xd cant believe you didnt give lenne any love shes gorgeous or maybe its just that i got a weak point for long hair characters watchvkv7ou6pl5wu skip to 148 how can i not think about marrying and having sex with these girls as you put it because normal people dont think that way the girls on here make me sick also i found the characters in final fantasy vii dull and boring anime convenintion big people from all over and the hentai panel are always packedso yeahits true nearly everybody in the world watches porn it is what it is im here for the id bang her list what was that dance clip you brought in early on btw with that said i completely agree with your list dude you live in a very twisted place if you really believe what you said is true for everybody i like how you just disqualify tifa cause shes too damn cutesexybeautifulhotgorgeous xd she and fang are on the too tough to be hot list tifa is the hands down winner of every category but u forgot pain from ff x2 one of the most failest video ive ever seen xd wheres paine from ff x2 gad dammit 1410 ive heard the song from jackass and damn it i forgot the title does anyone know id probably put lenne somewhere on those lists wouldnt be able to say where though next time please choose the japanese dub the english dub is so annoying darkkefka i agree w your list but alyssa as 1 in id bang her i dont know i found her voice and her to be very annoying me im a vanille fan so i would put her 1 in id bang her and to be fair i have to put vanille as 2 in the hottest girl of all and serah as 1 you got to agree serah is fucking hot blowpop thats why i like them theyb are slim but theyre sexy with itits what i likeand its also why alyssa is on the list fran with her its sexnothing more its the first tifa picture we know we know also garnet and serah are built like blowpops and fang needs to be on at least two of the lists although im not a loli i totally understand alyssa there but beating out the chocolate bunny i laughed so hard at some of the comments you made xd yeahschool girl outfitsi love those schoolgirl outfits for all my top 3 for me 1lightning 2yuna 3stella nox 1 lightning 2 ashe ashelia 3 garnet dagger these would be the top 3 for me everybody who watches anime watches hentai at some point anime conventions proove this the hentai panels are always packed with menand women and sometimes you need to wait for people to leave before the gaurds let you in anybody who tell you that they dont watch porn 90 of the time that person is lying nothing sad about it i like your and your taste id have gone with payne for the top one besides the obvious tifa but thats mainly because of her style overall well done so thumbs up for you good sir awwwww terra and yunnie are so sweet they are not just beautiful but adorable as well i love bothof them you can just tell this guy watches hentai this is so so sad rikku is the 1 3 yesasheyuna and lightning is on the list these are my fav character in the game dissidia1213 and 132 you dont need to go out and say sarah dies when you just want to mention shes cute you lisp spathering weaboo yuna ftw though what surprises me is that shalua rosso or lucrecia didnt hit the list lmfao yuna is even on a list best part about yuna most plain looking girl ever rikku literally erases her from existence yeah but shes so hot she could have been nominated as one of the hottest or most bangable she may be but sometimes shes a little manly wewffxii and ffxiii is my fav xd rikku is my number one since ffx in ffx2 i look at lighting more cuz i didnt like the outfit as for kingdom hearts 3 next summer everyone ps4 xbone i agree that yuna is number one lightning i came to see if yuna would be 1 she is im happy now im flying away i get here because aeriths theme p after ffvii i could never play a ff game again and this is real nothing beats that story kingdom hearts 3 is confirmed d i showed her as i mentioned it so she was an honorable mention if you pay careful attention to the beginning of kingdom hearts 2 some where someone says that it will feel like sora been gone for a year something like that with that said kh2 takes place one year after the first game i used to know this girl that looked just like tifa omg she was so hot too selphie from ff8 should be on here too am i alone in thinking selphie should be somewhere on this list rinoas is too underrated no way yuna beats her fran and alissa yeah right this videos hilarious baha favorited actually i dont know what manual you have but mine says that kairi is 14 years old just like sora in kingdom hearts so 15 in kingdom hearts 2 yuna as number 1 agreed surprised celes was not on that list that opera dress cool now do the guys yay cissnei thanks for putting her on the list and gee just make me extra happy 049 who is the girl that has long hair they are all gorgeous 121 where is that from oh man i was going to cry if yuna wasnt on this list but i think she is a perfect number one rofl tiffany so pretty that they had to ban her beauty actually in the manual for kingdom hearts it says kairi is 12 years old so in kingdom hearts 2 she is 13 nabaat or lulu either way if i could id bang em both but shes nice p rinoa shoulda been number one but your right on with vanille lightning should be first in every listomg she is fucking gorgeous this guy make me laugh so hard along the videonice job keep what will the next top 10 gonna be when i heard what can i do for you i was like yes its yuna i dont care if i am a girl i totally agree d i wholly agree on the 1 as yuna that is the reason i still play ffx and x2 rikku is 16 in ffx it says it in the booklet that would make her almost 18 in ffx2 hi d is it ok can you list what final fantasy game each girl came from please d maybe in the comments thanks d xd lol this was pretty funny xd hahaha but namine just has i dont know something special d lulu is officially the most beautiful girl in ff tifa for me is the best now you should do legend of zelda gah iv been aerithed rolled now im crying why square why fang should have been there shes pretty damn sexy kariroo she is like 13 years or something hmwell they are one in the same yuna is also my personal favorite good choice warming up to lightning for the record and its kiiiiiiiinda a big deal namine kairi dk dont joke and i have to agree with him yunas a baws the number of times people fap to tifa and yuna is too damn high but who cares start the self love everyone p you may like lion from ffxi hot redhead with yellow outfit rikku youll always be my number one pick thats why i put you at 7 lol celes doesnt have a good fmv she creeps me out i never get why people think tifa is hotattractiveetc she was sloppy seconds i liked aeris and i didnt care about tifa no personality and ehhh to this day shes just another party member to me nothing more i think yuffie would have made a better love intrest then tifa yuna especially where the pulled back hair in her wedding with seymour how is it that tidus fricking tidus gets not one but two hot girls how does anyone that annoying get even one average girl let alone two smoking hot ones if you want the honest truthno im not one of youand sometimei really really wish i wasnt nice vid good choices agree to every thing said omfg you have snsds gee in the background kh3 is on the way bro its on the way acutally dude i think thats two reasons well thanks monty oum for doing what you do best you use the same categorical system i use for real girls lol so tifa is desqualified and rikku is number 6 rikku is the only final fantasy girl capable to kick tifas ass in a beauty contest and you put her number 6 if tifa is desqualified she should be undeniable number 1 or be desqualified too sure yuna is beautiful but rikku and tifa are exceptional rename the title final fantasy hottest girls besides tifa i guess ill take that as a complement countdowns always contain spoilers you are the whitest black guy ever everybody who clicked on the video knew tifa would be number 1 so i showed her first to get her out of the way incoming butthurt comment why exactly is tifa disqualified is she to be penalized for being the most beautiful character in the entire ff franchise i mean i understand she probably cuts the chances for potential competitors in this kind ov thing but really she earned the spot to be there she deserves it its like shes the best so well keep her out makes no sense to me disappointingunfair anyway other than that for the most part i agree with your choices 3 that aerith theme got me anytime and the music sight peace maybe but kh is really close to itand kairi is just too beautifuli couldnt leave her out i dont agree with a kingdom hearts girl being on the list its not final fantasy period im glad you give recognition to girls who are usually shoved to the side though they really need to remake the older games and let you guys and some of us girls drool xd this is the countdown that everybody wants to see im sorry but i literally dont give a shit about your opinion i am not complaining its an observation and am not the only one with the same problem try harder groupie am i the only one who thiks fang is missing from this list ignore the diks u make some great vids and make me laugh keep up the good work 1227 lol dafuq that isnt from final fantasy xd sadlyim talking about black people some people find it surprising that im african american because not many of use are doing this stuff on youtube and ive received many racial comments some people hate me and dislike my videos soley due to my skin color isnt she from 14 xd i thought that you would put stella on the top 10 was contemplating where tifa was gonna rank too well if you are still asking about terras hair in the original game final fantasy vi terras hair was originally green but in dissidia final fantasy they make her hair brown yet they make her alternate costume her original in ffvi this also happen with the onion knight final fantasee iii i hope this help you this list is ridiculously revolting i can understand why they would say that you do talk pretty fast since i have a friend who talks even faster i have had to chance to get used to it p get over it u fukin gimp it just a word and my choice to use it hardly means theres anything wrong with my ears nor my brain does it now i dont care about tifa and aerith i like kairi emine favoritein everything of this islightingvanilleyunaandkairi yuffy is too cute arith is too hot lulu ill bang here and fran and lightning rikku ashe yuna are too dang um hot love them i can understand perfectly people will hate this but tifa is not on my list and why too many fav her arith was mine this is the weirdest final fantasy top 10 ive ever seenits good tho if you speak like you write then you need not only get your ears looked at but also your brain i didnt address him with bad words but you dont deserve such a respect go fuck yourself for me its no1 tifa no2 yuna no3 vanille wtf y r so many people givin it this guys a legend he makes some sick vids i agree with pretty much every thing in in this vid and i can understand him fine so if u cant get ur fuking ears looked at some of us who are the likes of you anyway what do you mean well i really like your rankings and to be honest i like this too but its kindasuperficial man i know it is not the case but id fall in love with a ffgirl because of her character sounds silly maybe it is yuna is my favourite too place 2 rinoa place 3 terra ride on listen here jerk i knew since 2012 yes i amvery serious look jackassi made the video long before the announcement and fyi kh three is coming this fall jackass end of overall 10 i just laughed my ass off wcxpjgg yeah i totally agree also ive been wasting my time with this game all day have a look its tight tolynwht i know this is your own personal opinion but if it were me i would make the final list 4 yuna 3 rinoa 2 vanille and 1 rikku i dont think anyone plays ffd for the plotline because its too damn confusing i hear ya dude its true xdddd hahaha it took me longer than id care to admit to realise that yunas eyes are bicoloured i can understand you perfectly fine lol all right tifa rydia serah farron lightning vanille yuna rikku celes and rosa if were counting kingdom hearts then also kairi and aqua you just seem to have not the best microphone dark kefka you actually do the best top ten lists lol you definitely know youre stuff and some of the stuff you come out with is so funny lol keep up the great work dude newly subscribed i replied because of the voice funny commentary to boot dont be sad dk i was an esol students 3 years ago and i understand 90 of what you say theyre all sexy enough to fuck too bad her tits were pyramids fucking ps1 polygons aerith can be compared to tifa p both awsome girls omfg lol unexpected tifa ranking love it not saying yours or anyones is wrong or bad its just my opinion sorryi cant change my voice i dont understand why people say they cant understand me its like theyve never heard some of us talk before yunai put yuna over tifa for me love yuna have to say i agree with your choices my friend 100 fuck that my fav was tombraider from ps1 shit was cash i guess i can live with the list lol no losing here id of had kairi and namine in it 3 and my number of all time would be serah deffo i actually agree with the alyssa bit shes pretty hot aerith are beautiful and cute i can barely understand this guys voice any way the video is ok oh dude youre a pervert xd anyways i think namin is a lot better because of that onepiece dress that shes always wearin you know just imagine how hot would she become in later years with the same dress but with more much more potential w first game boner mine was chun li in alpha 2 yuna is always my number one choice feng should be number 1 on every list rikku second those boobs are op tifa my first video game boner im afraid that sherry and rikku might have some competition when kingdom hearts 3 comes out i love kairi this much that would be alyssa yuna garnet and ashe but i felt no need for a list like that hahaha thats right but was just talking about my personal choise p darkkefka why didnt u do the best add on this video on top of this list my favorite is kairi and since kh2 came out 2006 she would be 22 now and possibly with a little more coughs boobs the overall list covers all 3 categorys i love serah too and my vote go for serah she is simply gorgeous shes cute she is beautiful and i want to bang her there you go all three categorys in 1 girl 1427 that exactly my though thats why i always play with female characters at mmosgames i dont want to spend hours looking at a man butt i agree with you all the way yes im aware of the ribbon and hell yeahkairi in cut cinematic scenes shes on this list for a very good reason i dont know about u but i think ashes ass move faster than her or any other girl for that matter haha this was so funny and thank god for so many ffxiii girls ffxiii was sooo good good vid interesting choices and i loved the comment about why you always main the girl characters i do the exact same thing for the exact same reason xd wait you left selphie out of cute and where the heck is celes we never get a full look at xion thanks to the cloke namine and kairi are one in the sameso she counts too ok im fine with tifa out of question but why did you included kairi when namin is a lot more sexy and cute not to mention xion d cissinei didnt get a boobjob on that dead fantasy gee clip there objection but kairi is not a final fantasy character she is a kingdom hearts character but hey she is so cute so she will find her way here somehow go play a girl for u rpg is role playing girl lol go to hell its a joke well that may be but you need to understand that ive been chewed out on this topic for years now so anytime i see one of these jump the gunit didnt seem like a joke to me lol you honestly think im a cross dresser whats wrong with trolls like you get a life dude you can insult me all you want but everytime you click on this video you raise my ratings but if this stuff doesnt interest you why the hell did you click on the video hmm the fact that you clicked on this video proves that you like pixelated asses yourselfso shut the fuck up look here dude first in many games the females are the best players second most of the time spent playing games is staring as the characters back i dont want to look at a mans ass all day thats what i tell my bro whenever i play games that allow you to play as a girl character he just calls me weird gay and a transexual i think he has issues after hearing that serah is not the sexiest i knew it was yuna for me serah will be first and yuna second but damn thats a fine list 1308 if you waited 3 more months square wouldve told you lol cute no1 that spoilerfuck i 100 agree with you make a nintendo version of this with the nintendo girls lol this is my top ten why do you show me aerith as soon as i heard that music i got misty eyed stop making me feel things my personal hot list and in no particular order i like rikku garnet rinoa selphie quistisyuna pain lulu arieth and tifa i agree pain is also very sexy 3 i think all the girls have their own sex appeal and are all appealing in their own way i love tough female characters too um i think their all tough tifa is classified as tough too and people still find her hot p their is nothing unsexy about being a tough and strong woman its good to know that some people understand this 5 kairi has been my biggest video game girl crush for 8 years now not to mention she is voiced by hayden panettiere who is also incredibly fine kh3 is announced and on the way soon i cant wait to see how they make her look all grown up dark 3 in the final stretch of the countdown you have no idea how many people ive had to explain that to well i play a male to represent myself in the game world why do you play a woman because if im going to stare at ass for hours on end i want it to be a womans ass id have put her on my want to bang her list shes quiet but i bet shes a freak in the sheets d i always thought the toughness is what made her hot paine looked like squalls sister or somethingintentional maybe paines too tough to be hot where the fk was paine fang and vanille remind me of lesbians lightning and yuffie are tomb boys kinda remind me of boys 1104 censorship win i cant post that link here i havent can i have a link terra instead of celes in beautiful girls come on only thing missing is beatrix well as far as i know tina is the japanese name for terra i long for a list like this that bothers to include lenne tina is teras name in japan i think yuna for number 1 excellent choice i love yuna wczoswn yeah i totally agree also this game is tight been playing all day bitly17wzl50feekd loved the countdown without question tifa will always be number 1 nice disclaimer on that that i thought quistis should be a little higher but thats just me good job tifa will always be the beautifulest girl ever she is my favourite character from ff adn so is cloud zack adn areith even though cloud had to go out with her and like ruin his relationship with tifa grrrz oh well imma girl and i am not lezbain all im saying his that she will always be beautiful 3 well its on hold but i doubt he will pick it back up lets just say i cant post a link to it here im pretty sure about 90 of the people who clicked on this video has seen that hentai video 108 anybody recognized footage from the hentai video is it bad if i did some people do and some people dont she was in montys dead fantasy video for a very good reason also theres something about kairi that many people dont know she may be 15 but japan has a much younger legal age range she was designed to be fan service and a sex symbol she has a ribbon on her very well detailed panties had they known this the would have surely edit this out what the fuck no i dont consider kingdom hearts a final fantasy game just accept that tifa won i dont know half these characters but i never thought karai was hot i think obviously the hottest will always be tifa similar to her is lulu who essentially took over that role i think the cutest has to be selphie beyond a doubt garnet is perhaps the most beautiful to me besides aerith finally what happened to tina i love gee good taste in music friend hey dk i know you hate aerith dying in ffvii but it had to be either her or tifa someone in square lost their mother during development and they wanted to implement that feeling into the game along with moving on and not letting the death of someone close to you slow you down yea i hear u there bro maybe some of these others can deal with always using a male char for gaming but comon it isnt like we going to be looking from their eyes feeling what they feel or doing what they do you just simply using the char to play the game u want to play i can see if your acting like a girl but really only something weirdos will do it and yea what guy doesnt like looking at a girl even if its pixel seems odd to me i agree with dk what is the point in wasting time out of u life to complain about something so obviously pretty much what im doing now but yeah i dont get people like you everyone has their own taste people can do what they like so if you really dont like it yet you watched this video i dont get it lmao qpcxzsz yeah thats what everyones been saying and dude you would probably enjoy this online game bitly14ttmfcnojim was a bit surprised not seeing beatrix anywhere in any list but overall great choices man the only one id have changed is lulu as no1 in the bang her list lol lulu is one smokin hot polygon babe ok so i had a spelling mistake the real pervs are the ones that made the game and jail bait they are not real so its not illegal id bang all of them if they are real i agree about tifa poram in ffivthe after years shes a grown women in that game by poram did you mean porom from ffiv its very hard to make decision whos on which list id make 1 list of 100 final fantasy girls i would bang the stupidity is strong with this comment well some people like that if the only thing that bothers you about a game is which of the sexes ass youll be paying attention to id start questioning my security in my sexual orientation clearly we all know which head is thinking for you nothing weird about it ill admit i watched this because i was wondering how weird it was and i got to say yeah its pretty fucking weird its a game what the fuck is up with you a boner is a natural something that you cant control and there is nothing wrong with that that only makes it worse its like secretly selling porn picks of your neighboursistermomroommate its just creepy whats wrong with liking polygons anyways some have it with a table some have it with a chair theres no problem as long as they dont hurt anybodyand they wont now excuse me i have a hot date with my architectural blueprints fap fap fap you disqualified tifa thats freakin hilarious wheres frans sister shes damn hot i think youre missing the point im a man and i dont want to look at anothers man ass for 30 hours i never said it was my only reason so u only play as girls to look at theres asses get a life dafuq is beatrix on this list agree about tifa to being disqualified simply too much consider her 1st place in all the top lists my personal chart cute 1 ritz ffta 2 krile ffv 3 selphie ffxiii beauty 1 celes ffvi 2 agrias ffttwotl 3 beatrix ffix bang 1 quistis ffviii 2 rikku ffx 3 edea ffviii and btw my charts are only top 3 since i didnt play all the game of the series yet i am ok with this list i am sad you didnt do the gay thing for a top 10 for the boys rikku is sexier than yuna in my opinion though 3 my top 3 are celesrydia and of course garnet garnet will always be my queen not just because of her looks its also for her character design i swear ff9 made me feel bad for her her mother betrayed herher mother got killed her homeland was destroyed i mean come on the game never let her catch a break i felt bad i know its a video game but come on im a girl but i agree with you about tifa shes not only hot but sweet as well you dont get this kind of video game babe everyday 725 fail i could never get past bitch when it came to her it doesnt matter what she looks like final fantasys hottestjail bait what the fuck is wrong with you people belldandy is the zero i see your point however allow me to dissent i could write a book on ffx about how brilliant that game is and of course ive watched carefully all the character personalities while rikku has always been outgoing since the beginning of x yuna never gave a single sign shed become what was of her in x2 i like the general idea that a pop star can bring joy and happines to the world but thats simply not yuna thats a story for another time another game thats not a sequel worthy of ffx i hope youre not implying that im a virgin because i can assure you that i am not well ill admit that youre right that your weird fetishes shouldnt bother me since i dont have to worry about any of you freaks reproducing lulz i understand people always saying they hate the new yuna but i dont think they understand yuna herself the whole reason shes like that in the second game is that shes finally able to cut loose and actually be herself though granted you can see she picked up on tiduss personality a bit after he disappeared remember that throughout the course of x she was expecting to die that was on her mind regardless of the events leading there she would die word count too high but you get it the virginity is strong with this video whats that dancing video that appeared a few times throughout the video you should play it and then watch advent children again its so much better i did the same thing watched it and then played it and i never got the full experience of that movie until i got attached to the characters through playing them good stuff no doubt the fact that it bothers you speaks volumes about your own insecurity just saying no point in being a twat for the sake of being one at least theyre real people and not just geometric shapes rendered by some fat middle aged programmer i agree tifa is the queen of final fantasy ive never played vii but i love her on dissidia and advent childeren who do you drool over porn stars they are real and they dont even know you how creepy is that 5 the hope theyd eventually beat the shit out of each other hehe d actually theres quite a few more positive aspects to that game than im willing to admit that is if they dont claim its a sequel to x x2 was average with some pretty good features brilliant ideas but alas it also had way too silly elements for a sequel of such a masterpiece of videogames art and your name makes no sense lol x was the shit one of the best stories of all time hard as fuck and plenty of eye candy in more ways than one but x2 lets just put it this way there are only 4 things that made the game worthwhile for me 1 sexy bitches 2 hacks 3 the bad ending where vegnagun blows up spira lawl 4 and the perfect ending ive been waiting to see yuna through the whole video glad you ultimately did not let me down on a side note i like the ffx version much much better i dont like the facial surgery they gave her in x2 a damn bit this does not apply to rikku d and come on they turned the incarnation of sheer beauty force of will humbleness and purity into an half sailormoon pop star slut dumb as fuck xd 940 we wish they were flesh and blood of course we know this why do people like you always have to hate the video is for entertainment geez and im not the one who made these girls if it bothers you so take it up with square i hope you know that youre essentially drooling over polygons fucking pervert alright nobody wants fang fang darling you will be always in my heart please spank me i showed selphie in the beginning when i said cute so she was an honor mention he dropped it monty oum is awesome cant wait to see what he will do with rwby3 its a shame he dropped dead fantasy fair enough and its funny because i agreed with very little of your list though i couldnt find fault with any of your actual reasoning for one i think tifa is rather bland and disproportionate i would agree with yuna overall 1 but id have to put rydia as 2 because they both have the perfect trifecta of appearance personality and strength of character as evidenced by their stories both being strong enough to take care of themselves completely but not being overbearing niwdmke i agree one of my top 10 but if your bored check this good time waster bitly19gwej3ygqtp many people didnt know this dont feel left out when a girl has a body like that most people only pay attention to the tender parts mei look really really reeeaaally hardand i notice little things that others dont yuna is number 1 for a very good reason okay what the fuck i played through the entirety of x i played through the entirety of x2 i never skipped a single cutscene and until i watched this video not once did i even pay attention to the fact that yuna is heterochromatic i what in the shit is wrong with me that i dont notice something like that im seriously questioning how i make it through each day when something like that doesnt even stand out lmfao game girls are flawless clearly i love all the characters but i still cant help but find some of the comments weird as well maybe because im female but serah has always been my gamer girl crush her and rydia in all honesty i always thought yuna was more attractive and in all ways better then tifa dont hate me for it because that is just my opinion oh god your explanations are hilarious xd hahaha tifa got disqualified xd well she is the hottest obviously i know and i very much enjoyed it some people just need to remove their heads from certain places and learn to have fun with the rest of us i just like the characters tifalightningserah p i know too just want to share the good news everywhere lol i know the video was made before the announcement kingdom hearts 3 is now in development man xd i soooo effing agree with you with everything you said about tifa sure tifa is hot but not so much in kingdom hearts as for tiffa being the hottest of video game babes how do you feel about mai shirinui from the king of fighters series and ivy from soul caliber 4 thanks and btwthe video was requested by fans its not like i just did it out of the blue sad that some of the girls commenting are so insecure they cant see the fun in this this comment from a straight girl love the list dk yuna is my no 1 too d correct me if i wrong but is the bgm at the each shift from nectaris i already know from the start yuna going to be number 1 after tifa got disqualified xd kingdom of hearts is it own game so no kairi is awesmoe baby got back from the 90s whats the song at ashes part of the video and nice video d near the end of this video i started thinking wtf wheres yuna then i realised she just had to be 1 ohnevermind another female whos jealous at the fact that game girls are hotter than you we do have women i guess i shouldnt tell you i love hentai then why did you click on the video awesome video funny but true commentary and yeah i had had my favorites as far as whos the hottest n sexiest female characters of all final fantasys but yeah i agree yuna has all the goods hands down weirdos their cartoons this is creepy go and get ur self a women freaks i really share your oppinion about tifa shes the best but i dont really like yuna and aerith please dont kill me guys xd i like that you prefer serah to her sister most people dont see that serah is a lovely character hmmmmkasumithats actually a tough one i do plan to do other top ten series in the future id say kuja is the hottest girl isnt she pretty much the same looking as terra no no no i hate yuna so much shes dumb she only got new clothes coz rikku gave her them rikku is the best ever what about celes rosa beat her by an inch terra is originally meant to be blonde but if i remember right when it came out in the us they made her hair green ass ass ass ass ass u got that right homie what about fang advent children movie where then you need about 7075 i think its the alternate ending you get if you finish ffx2 with 100 complete what is the clip at 235 from crisis core no i think that makes him a male human you should try it sometime damn dude i got some questions on who should be in one place but overall i can agree with your choices on all of your separate categories yay yuna is no1 your commentary is goddamn funny its actually pretty close in fact e3 voted lara as number 3 and tifa as number 1 in 90 of gamers opinions she is 15 after all maybe f she was 18 i would have put her as number 3 also why kairi is on no5 she has more potentials than you think i think yuna is the best at least she can kick some asses she looks nothing like lara croft in your opinion edea from ff8 and cloud of darkness from ff3 best milf ever 3 rinoa always and forever awww rikku wasnt higher i agree with this list though you have a good eye my friend lol with tifa disqualify but i agree with what you said tifa is and always will be the undisputed beauty queen of video game babe that would be super cool fingers crossed and again i really love your videos keep em coming i might come up with something later you could still do a video like that btw love your videos damn wish i had tought of that it would have been superfunny 3 i laughed so hard kingdom hearts 3 is comeing out soon it was announced a e3 thank yousomeone thinks the same you clicked on the video so what does that make you i dont have time for the likes of you haha when i didnt see her anywhere else on your list i guessed itd be her as number 1 lol when you show the ff7 girls in their original game models its hard to take seriously i remember when playing thinking aerith was the ugliest design of all the games i almost couldnt take even that scene seriously cause the model was so offputting but her appearance in crisis core really translates her beauty as a character well and is the thing that justifies her ranking guys its both oh yeah i forgot i havent played kingdom hearts in a while pumkinhead24 and darkkefka are neither wrongher original name is aerith but the americans used aeris in the gaming of ff7 and ff tacticsproof is if you watch at 215217 and 233236 of the youtube top 5 friend zones in video games by thewarpzone another proof is the final fantasy wikis and look up aerith and it says that both names are hers without the spaces just depends on what versions of the game you playedso long story shorther name is both aerith and aeris damn it i was singing gee gee gee gee baby baby baby all thorough the vid i honestly feel lightning should have been higher im sorry but aqua imo is much hotter than kairi baby got back what makes you say that no but it ur list i was waiting for yuna tifa could have been on the list imo shes hot but i personally would take rikku lighting vanille or rosa over her any day just my opinion though great list meh ive seen no sign of this at all rumor mill runs all night every night keep making awesome videos please i was writing these comments as i wrote this and i love yuna man i was waiting for her i would put lulu on 1 would bang damn right tifa is the goat asking this again because im still confused whats the connection between fang and vanille that weirds you out i thought they were just relatives namine is kairi so yeah she would count im sorry for spoiling it for you but anytime you watch a countdown from anybody get ready to be spoiled its that walk of hers yep she did unless u go to an anime convention they look very real to me kingdom hearts 3 is being made buddy d ps i totally agree with ur list i played all the final fantasy gamesand what about namine lol awww drag dude thanks for spoiling the end of ff132 nothing better than being 30 hours in and getting the whole game ruined for a hot fake girls list what is the video called where yuna and tifa and the others are dancing 1101 is by far the funniest and most cringeworthy part of this video i love how people come here and say how weird people are for making these vids and watching them well who searched for it i actually agree with all your choices there dk how do you not have fang anywhere on the list or did i miss it shes sexy bad ass and that accent haha also kh3 is coming soon get ready for it dk caus i am i dont think i would prefer penelo in the cutest tbh but tastes differe ofc i would put serah in it over penelo well imo ofc so great job and poor tifa got locked out xd hell yeah yunas the best i think serah is the hottest girl of all i love your taste high five ill let kairi stay because hayden panettiere is her voicd actor i loves me dome clairebear what can i say yuna and rinoa are my top 2 tifa is a lock but needs better graphics come on ff7 remake true i did note in the video that we wish they were real so dont worry i know they arent real whats the connection between fang and vanille that weirds you out i thought they were just realitives shes in overallwhich means she cute cute i think kairi and the rest abover her are beautiful which makes rikku the number 1 cutest sorry pal its aerith and her real name is aeris not aerith why on earth is rikku not in top 5 cutest rikku and rinoa ftw agreed though i dont agree on the sora part i like that pairing yeah yuna is the number 1 refia is the hottest lold at the tifa disqualifier xdd glad im not the only one here who realizes how hot and sexy kairi really is yunas mother was cids sister that makes cids yunas unclewhich makes rikku and brother cousins with yuna this is why they went to such great lengths to save heror did you not play the first game im happy with the whole lineup but only thing i will say to u is that brother and rikku are not related to yuna at all brother is the guys name im happy u through terra in the beautiful category and note that her hair is green for her 8bit sprite while in the cinematics her hair was blonde vanille was bangworthy as well as rikku just sayin great list if kairi counts as a ff character then shed be my number one i dont care you cant get that sexy in one year trust me shes a bomb shell she definitely hit puberty she hit it with a motherfucking tank and ran with it i love you kairi sora doesnt deserve you seriously missing some fang in there p and here we have the problem why ppl cant stand the new games its not like the old ones buhuhuhuhuhu qqqqqqqq how about just play it and get your head out of your ass and maybe you find a good game but when you always compare it to the old ones than you will never find any good ff game again he lets you know in the start of the video its his own opinion obviously you get off on fapping to internet arguments go get all pissy somewhere else where you have might actually have a real reason too why is there a vid of belldandy in the part related to cosmos x i think rinoa is underrated when i was a kid and saw her first in this white dress at a friend i just wanna bang her over and over i bought a playstation just to see her again and it startet with ff but what the fuck how you can even play ffxiii or ffxiii2 thats the only ff i never finished its soo not ff except the hot girlsoh i would slice me bit from lightning dunno if anyones answered but i do beleive terras original haircolor is green my favorite will always be garnet from 9 also quistis she doesnt expose a lot of skin but can still be sexy also uses a whip what more could you want my favourite girls are and always have been yuffie and lulu how could anyone argue with lulus cleavage lmao those girls dancing to gee is from dead fantasy episodes check the full movie out its the coolest ever thanks for mentioning rikku lulu and yuna in your video also i want to thank you so much for making yuna number 1 thank you thank you d youre a fucking weirdo no idea what you just said aerith scene always makes me cry ey dark just dont pay attention what this asshole says serah over lightining youre fighting a losing battle if you cant deal with guys being turned on by game girls then im sorry it is what it isdeal with it this is one of my most popular videos do you really think i give a fuck about how one stuck up girl feels you need to get you head out of your ass and wake up to the real world its called entertainment i dont have time for 500 pure hearted goody goody girls who get creeped out by the slightest things i hate girls like you u dam right tifa is the best youre just a female maybe an ugly one well im not going to let your opinion decide the fate of this video many people requested it so i gave it to them we love game girls and if it bothers you so then i dont know what to tell you i agree 100 with tuna as number 1 nice observations agreed yuna the hottest ff chick ever good job man final fantasy versus xiii final fantasy xv doesnt that just feel lazy why did you click on the video actually i like her default costume better it looks good on her her swimsuit wasnt meant to be used with her sprite she looks funny in her swimsuit sometimes now somebody like re6 sherry birkin she actually is naked in the lab and they added a coat over he body but theres a way to take it off on the pc version and shell walk around completely nude and it looks real but you can tell that serahs swimsuit wasnt mean for her it was just something they did to get money yeah i heard cant wait qand where the hell is kingdom hearts 3 a its in development what about quina what aboutv i know why they killed aerithplanet protector and great gospel are too op ok just because square enix made ff kh doesnt mean that kh is ff game tifa lara so tifa isnt the hottest thanks well paine is a little too tough for me i kinda wished pain was on this list but it is ur appion and i happen to agree with almost all of your chooses i dont think there is a need for background information because that is not why people clicked on the video also just because i think yuel is cute doesnt make me pedo in fact thats why most of them are not on the hot list cute and hot are 2 different things and incase youre wondering poram is a grown women in ay what do people thin about final fantasy 13 lightings return and the charaters in it why you wont use aerith as 1 shes freakin adorable isnt she wish to respect the characters of final fantasy all i could think of while watching this was gee gee gee gee baby baby baby yeah i heard i cant wait i agree with thejuubi which one is the one with ashley in it sorry im still kind of new to final fanasty yuel is cute but that doesnt make me pedo and for your second line this is the every reason why i noted that she becomes an adult i saw the cute 1 coming before the counting youre such a pedophiliam who was your other optionchild ridyahahahahahaha you should do a video montage of all of those vanilles ahhuhohahhhhahhhohhs she does in the game xd pls i agree 100 jihl nabaat is so underrated character shes hot sadistic and her personality is one of the best in ff history everyoned bang her i totally agreed 100 with this guy about female character i mean when i play a video game i wanna see the female girl shaking her ass not some dude character and that game would go to hell i always wonder about that as well how the hell do you bang lulu when you have to affing take off all those freaking belts i mean my boner probably be gone by the time i take them off lol at 1103 when he says oh yeah take it off noooo damn cape i think final fantasy should make a female main character you cannot change from your party and she is ugly as hell amen brother amen nice countdown and you are right it is very hard to make this kind of video everyone has their own favorite personally i place lightning a lot higher near the top while serah and yuna are fighting for the number 1 spotin a pool filled with honeywearing bikiniswhat was i doing again as for tifa personally i think serah yuna and ashe are equal to her but as you said we all have our preferences cool video dude nice to see a fellow 132 fan dude you have to see images of lightning retruns never noticed the green and blue eye lol rikku is also my favourite character in the ff series i agree with you and the list vanille garnet and rikku are underrated and some of the best ever i alo think cloud of darkness of final fantasy 3 belongs on the list too i love lightning i think serah is ok i would have made rinoa much higher but thats about it well done if i could do it over again id probably put aerith as number 1 serah would still be tier 0 kairi check ashe check rinoa check lulu check rikku check obvious differences in opinion aside definitely a very well put together list that was awesome though im surprised you didnt show ashe in her funeral and wedding dresses both were incredible and definitely makes you wish she was flesh and blood and not just somebodys brain child also which episode of dead fantasy was that clip from i dont recognize it same here she is a bad ass in dead fanasty just wait till you guys see ffxv girls they will blow you mind tifa is the hottest and yuna is the cutest but i prefer rinoa to be my gf garnets ass maybe if ff9 had updated hd cut scenes she would win but until then ashe hands down i wouldnt say that lulu is just all grown up she tells it like it is and doesnt sugar coat anything when i found out vaniell was lesbian i was like holy fuck are her and fang sisters or girlfriends im a little confused on that i like how so many people love serah i do too but i love lightning the most 3 3 penelo also i completely agree about quistis in fact that character and her opening fmvs heavily influenced my real life attraction to chicks with glasses i actually agree with everything on your list except for lulu she is such a bitch that i couldnt like her at all in spite of her ginormous boobs also id like to say that garnet has the best ass it has an amazing shape even when controlling her because of her super tight outfit i said she was tier 0 im a girl and if i were a guy id definitely pick yuna too xd for me serah its the most beautiful girl in ffsorry yuna became so much prettier in x2 and serah looked alot better in xiii2 great list man but ill still always be a lightning guy myself you had to put rosso the crimnson around there somewhere even as an honorable mention but nice list overall tifa disclasified lol shes the best one 1432 amen to that yeahi need to work on balancing the audio i was wondering when yuna would pop up on the list lol thanks spoliers maybe but the general rules of countdowns they usually contains spoliers i thought people would know that before watching them are you the one who told not too lol enjoyable top 10 but this really needs a spoiler warning i really liked jihl nabaat she was very attractive and interesting i think she made a great villian i was soo hyped when i thought you were about to fight her then she gets taken out and no more jihl the rest of the game i was like fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu i didnt get the manly vibe to me she acted like a bad bitch with a feminine side as well i didnt get the lesbian vibe from fang and vanille if they were biological sisters in the story it would seem ok to everyone you dont have to be blood related to be family they been through a lot together also there wasnt any romantic interest in the game for her snow was with serah hope was young and sahz was an older man all the other men like raines were to absorbed in what they were doing nope tifa beats her just by a little tifa hottest girl in gaming did you forget lara croft yea youre right darkkefka the ending of ff132 pisses me off too i wonder will serah be back you read the title and then clicked on the video so what does that make you this is so nerd great list no mention of beatrix from ix so is lulu from ff x both of them are little manly because they have been designed as a tough character still we find lulu hot i love fang but i have to admit shes a little manly at times you were so right about all girls especially tifa i love her and your comment over kingdome hearts 3 is perfect and absolutely right but why didnt you include fang from ff xiii in hottest list you could have included her in id bang her list atleast you were so right about all girls especially tifa i love her and your comment over kingdome hearts 3 is perfect and absolutely right but why didnt you include fang from ff xiii in hottest list you could have included her in id bang her list atleast darkkefka your right about the bang list and nabaat is the hottest ever p if you got kairi you need namine and xion somewhere in there i cant blame you for ashe in the artbook in the collectors guide you can see the bottom of her ass and vanille is just a sex goddess in 13 serah is very underrated the ending of 13 shattered me i swear and ive yet to finish 132 but yeah i can agree with 90 of your placement thumbs up lenne was better looking then yuna but just my opinion 1 cute for me was rikku but vanille sera aeris were runners up 1 beautiful for me was lulu 1 id bang it for me was paine just something about her smug silent ego that makes you curious about her in the bedroom lol 643 her blonde hair is based on the concept art i couldnt even make a list if i tried they are all number 1s imo though i guess if pressed i would put some of the younger characters as 2s until they got a bit older final fantasy was made simply to make our dicks hard story is great too but dat eyecandy my top 5 girls are rydiarosaterraceles and garnet not in that order but those are my top 5 i would put garnet at number 1 but otherwise its a good list im between rinoa and yunahard choice but both are fine as hell im a great kh fan and i love kairi bt i must say kh isnt a ff its from squereenix and disney lightning serah kairi and yuna are the best i agree with 1 hottest girl tifa is confirmed for doa 5 ultimate thanks i dont mind people giving opinins on the videoits when the insult me directly when i take offensive good choices all around the thing about pedophilia is that a character with a young face and large breasts would be more likely to discourage it because the point it that the victims bodies are underdeveloped 125 dont we start to inflate her already too big balloonsnow im always number 1 i like how you broke it down and im glad yuna got some respect and its good the later games get some recognition instead of the usual vii worship those of you who have a problem with kairi being on this list forget about her and consider tifa number 1which makes yuna number 2 you are aware that more than one person can be wrong about something at the same time right yeah i totally agree kingdom hearts is not a final fantasy and unlike this guy i have never heard anyone say or even imply that it was i dont know why youtube keeps recommending this guys videos to me every time i watch one it pisses me off saying that kh is a ff game is one of the dumbest things ive heard sure it has a lot of ff cameos but where do you spend your time and who do you spend it with when you play kh nearly all your companions are disney characters and none of the worlds you visit are ff worlds if kh is any any franchise game its a disney game and kairi is a disney girl and that makes sense cause kairi is one of the seven princesses of heart and the other 6 princesses were from disney movies thumbs up cuz yuna is the best i meant who sorry i must agree with the kairi issue she is not a final fanasty girl but how can u not like tifa i mean how can possible be hotter then tifa tifa is great but thats a matter of preference i wouldnt throw into this i thought aerith or even yuffie were more attractive than her personally the fact you acknowledged princess garnet from ff ix was awesome rid kairi and id have liked the video there are so many ff heroines that could have been put in the placelike beatrix from ff ix that woman is super sexy and bad ass heck anything but kairi or any khs girl side female characters in ff can be hot too like elena from vii very good points but i just had to put her in here i did put tifa as tier 0 so you could just put her as number 1 remove kairi and bump everyone else down by the way i dont dislike ff13 but i agree with on that ff12 is a great game these are video women top 5 cute top 5 beautiful top 5 i wanna bang you and top 10 overall suit yourself many people love kairi they consider kh a ff gameand they consider her a ffgirl so do iso i put hrer in here im the only one who finds this video kind of creepy kingdom hearts is not a final fantasy game and therefore kairi is not appropriate for the list thumbs down really what do you say yuna is the favorite of more people you thought whats the bullshit of having to pick an addscrew you u toob aries she is the first beautiful girl dude when you were going on about how we wouldnt agree with number 1 i said to myself man so long as its yuna that would be weird are you going to do anymore videos anytime soon yuna is my fave i love her d put yuna in rikkus outfit and youll see why this dude is funny but how the hell the he get that yuna is hotter then rikku how if everyone would stop acting like ff9 doesnt exist that would be nice i think daggerprincess garnet is the cutest lighting fang yuna rikku yuffie and namine are the hottest girls in final fantasy decent list but how is fang not on this list in any of the categories and kairi doesnt belong here imo but to each their own rinoa is 1 tifa is hot but she is too much of a lara croft copy those pussys look good to me i highly disagree on tifahottest vg girl of all time no she isnt even among the top 5 from ff franchise but otherwise i think this is a strong list though this is my opinion not a complaint 1 tifa 2 fran 3 aerisaerith 4terra 5edea this is a bad ass lists i salute you on your good taste sir and good thinking to dq tifa it needed to be done for fairness sake but kairi really shes not an ff character and not on the list my list 5 tifa 4 fang 3 vanille 2 lightning 1 rikku you know if kh became a final fantasy game just because there are final fantasy characters in it doesnt that make it a twewy game as well or probably any disney game you can come up with i am doing what dk says on ffx and i beat penance without 255 def and no zanmato well personally id prefer lightning even over tifa but well 3 nice list d yuna god damn she is fine im playing through ffx right now and im already poppin wood cant wait till i get to see that girl in hd this december im glad im not the only one who thinks the same about vanielle id put her on the cute list i love her accent thanks for making this video was cool darkkefka yuna ftw the mysterious girl from ff4 after years i can see someone jealous about this who is 054 some of you dont like the idea of kairi being in this countdown is it because you think shes too young or shes not a ff character or maybe its both hmm well how bout this im sure everybody who watched this video has once in their life clicked on a very popular video call dead fantasy gee that series is a cross between dead alive and final fantasy right who was the first person you saw in that video he put her in there for a reason shes a soldierthats why as number 1 lol but i guess why because she is a beautiful tomboy its okay im pretty nerdy and i think its weird too d i think some characters are cute and have awesome personalities but ive never had the urge to have sex with a fictional character xd you miss belle from ff crystal chronicles the crystal bearers oh sorrywell falling in love with hot game girls its just something we nerds doat least me anyway maybe if i lived in an area around people would shared my hobbyi wouldnt have this problem i said when they look underage not that they are ive heard about it being done with other games like they covered up more skin on the characters because too much was exposed oo shrug i did watch the video lol i just thought it was weird nothey didnt reduce her breast sizethey covered it and that girl is a grown woman many things are nerfed before they come to the us because they have a bad habit of thinking that games are for kids if you watched the full video you would have heard me save we wish they were flesh and blood geezthe video is for entertainment for me the farron sisters are on the top of my list im with you regarding the ending of ffxiii2 if lightning doesnt save her in lrffxiii im going to be so pissed off i dont get this they all have the same fucking face lol and good luck banging them theyre just pixels on a screen dude would you try to bang the mona lisa cmon but with the one girl they probably reduced her breast size because that is something done in the us when a character looks underage as to not encourage pedophilia i think its weird too but lets be serious here pedos are disgusting i cant help but laugh at your name being darkkefka since kefka himself is already a dark character and that instead of kefka or any ff character being your icon you have roll from megaman legends which is awesome btw it was a joke but thanx for all the mental images haha i was scared at first cuz i didnt see yuna for most of the videothe end was worth it kairi would indeed be illegal in my country and if she was flesh and blood no way i would make any moves but i still think shes hot no were notwe didnt make them dress in thungs and we didnt put a ribbon on kairis panties they creep me out tifa is definately number 1 for all shes beautiful caring has fantastic hair and that body wow i dont blame you for disqualifying her as otherwise shed have automatically been number 1 for everything in my opinion fran was hilarious lol i am agree i agree on you with yuna as 1 shes the only final fantasy girl who has two different colored eyes in the universe of final fantasy im totaly agree with yuna p 3 what happened to ultimecia and cloud of darkness d any one else see squall at start thats my kinda women top 10 most difficult normal monsters please put great malboro from ffx reason it comes out of nowhere you have been wandering omega dungeon for two hours and this mother fucker pops up and uses bad breath on you causing you to kill yourselves ff9 that yan thingy was pretty darn strong most of the hard monsters were on the early ffs 14 3 had some real hard ones on it you said you hadnt played it though so idk ok ill give that if you were in a different country or even in certain parts of our own country rikku kairi riku and porom would be legal no goddess is more beautiful than belldandy yes she didwatch it again makes me want to play through the games again i call for an hd remake of all ff games yuna is also my number 1 and my 2nd is sarah great list btw terra original artwork she has blond hair in the game she has green love the list nice countdown ty lol it was interesting you made a tier 0 others may not like it but i think its a good call marlboros arghhh celes was my favorite ff female beautiful determined doesnt take crap from no one but is still a deep character with emotions and doubts her original artwork in the guide i got with my game on snes gave me a massive ecrush maybe later the next top ten will be the top 10 most difficult normal monsters sometime this month all we see is her faceand there are more beautiful girls but i did consider her the i bang her catergory made me felt awkward cus thats like saying you can do winnie the poo in the ass ive liked subscribed because you put yuna 1 goodlad d where is minerva because most of use consider kingdom hearts a final fantasy game have you played it kairi is not related to final fantasy how she in this though hey men your 1 yuna she is the reason why i play final fantasy i like it kingdom hearts is a crossover not a pure ff game caisus english voice gaara english voice im sad not to see fang in the beauty or bang her category but i understand your reason why with the other girls expect nabaat she is fricken hot how is she 5 she could have be 4 or 3 on the list but seriously good video and thank you for not have tifa in the list like you said hottest game character ever no need to rub it in all the other girls faces me too though if youve been following the developments thus far you would know that there is a new character named lumina who looks identical to her though one can only speculate about the connection between them att psits not called 133 the official title is actually lightning returns final fantasy xiii i know what you mean imnsho 1 cuteskuld 1 beautifulbelldandy and 1 iwannabangyouurd although as for the iwannabangyou category peorth hild are closely tied for second and megumi is second in the beautiful depo while miniurd and grownupskuld are pretty much switchedthough skuld becomes more beautiful than hot in her altered form why dont you rewatch the video and ask yourself if that comment was really necessary this comment is enough to make an athiest like me scream amen 125 dont we start to inflate her already too big balloonsnow ill say this by even acknowledging the existence of games after vii and x you are already more of a fan that most people are and youre funny as hell so good on you sir in kh1 she had a miniskirtwhen we saw images of her for kh2we wanted to buy the gamethis is why they made this move kairi is fan service she looks really god awesome in the ending and the openingbut reallyi can get how porom became a young womaneven though i dont know if the hair die was made back thenafter 17 years and i can see how luca became a bitch and i can see how a minor character became such an important characterleonora but tell me squarehow can the jumb from 14 years old to 15 be so big and while kh1 kairi has only a friendly voicekh2 kairi is hot and i will never forget how beautiful she was in the beach there making a kingdom hearts hd version i know how you feel about serah i hope hope hope something happens to bring her back in final fantasy 133 lightning returns serah is my fav final fantasy girl what kairi wouldnt count anyway she kingdom hearts look at pennlo revenant wings yuna is the best i cant really argue with this list tifa outplayed them i dont knowfor some reason i like her maybe its that walk i quite agree about tifa with you so yeah its understandable to me that you would disqualify her say published on march 8th current date on computer march 29th we get to see it a week early lol at 210 from left to right its kasumidoa kairikh tifaff7 yunaff10 and cissneicrisis core the one you think is hitomi is cissnei like i said before try again you are wrong we all agree in number 0 3 this is the funniest top 10 final fantasy video ive ever seen y what the fuck are you talking about i havent downloaded shit dude and what the hell does pn mean can you even use proper english mind telling me why hahahahahaha that guy just downloaded freaking pn tifa in the living room um its from uh i cant where did you get the footage of tifa lockhart in a living room please let me know kay theres also quite a few hot monster sprites in the 2d final fantasy games like the goddess form of chadarnook in final fantasy 6 im sure i have you beat watchvytuktcghduk come at me bro cause i own her lol i really liked the ff series and played them alot but lolz i never got horny with pixels xd pardon me bro ur effin awesum ur list was legit and i loved ur commentary xd anyone else think tara strong is actually a lot hotter than her in game character rikku yuna is always my number 1 i love your commentary man xd you make me laugh so fuckin hard that was a good list good choice to disqualify tifa shes hot but it made these lists pretty boring nice work the only reason i know their ages in kh1 is because of the little instruction booklet which vita games unfortunately have and the manual in kh2 says its been a whole year since kh1 and lord knows how much time has passed in between kh2 and kh3d why dude i saw her first shes mine characterizing fictional chars with the hot title aint good at all i really liked this video dk i respect your choices and thought this video was great that part with fran really cracked me up keep up the good work you and me both dude haha didnt even know all these caracters xd i feel dumb ya i didnt agree with you none except that tifa is the hottest of em all but this video was still awesome and you made me laugh good about a couple things thumbs up still buddy lol i can strangely see his point however these video game girls from japan need some weight on them for my personal standards thesemost characters are based on asian idealism of a perfect woman when i heard what can i do for you i knew it would yuna wonder how lulu will look in the hd remake fran all the way you are one wierd guy talking like that but its funny rikku is mine taken straight from wikipedia in kingdom hearts ii kairi is taller her hair is longer and has become a darker shade of red her bangs part to the opposite side and her body has developed into that of a young woman againin quotes and her body has developed into that of a young woman even they are paying attention to her body look dude shes hot and thats all there is too it cute yuna beautiful yuna id bang yuna rikku and lulu at the same damn time i wish they were flesh and blood butt naked in my damn bed but yuna y u no real alright this was surprisingly entertaining pretty decent and unexpected choices too like alyssa and even yuna damn that alyssa you knew she was up to no good the first time she was prancing around itll be exciting to get ffx2 in hd later this year too i remember seeing a cute girl in the ff3 ds game is that her fang is too tough i appreciate your opinion and all but i mean fang is easily 1 for the id bang that list she may have too tough of a personality to be anywhere else but tough girls do insane things in bed my man beatrix okay so i agree with most of that but lightning as number 8 what are you thinking she is by far my favorite character tied with serah now i have played all of the final fantasys but my three favorite are lightning serah and vanille even though 13 isnt my favorite game it still has the best characters okay well it might by the best game but i really think lightning should have been 2 if not 1 on the overall list i mean really dude she is super pretty but i wouldnt bang her i like the video and agree with most also agree in tifa but fuck kingdom hearts i dont know why you put that garbage in the list see what i mean there are some people who dont like the list wheres fang wheres paine wheres leblance wheres celes wheres aqua if i picked these girls it would have been the other way around wheres yuna wheres vanille wheres ashe wheres rinoa wheres kairi i told you it didnt matter who i picked some of you wouldnt be happy this is my list guys well u havent seen much of lucrecia paine and fang are too tough for my listand i hate larxenes attitude yes vanille is my fav character kairi aerith lightning yuna rinoa rikku and serah are my favorite girls and im a girl i was surpried that fang paine larxene and dear sephiroth stab melucrecia were not in the list just for their beauty and body figure even shelke and shalua i was holding my breath for 1 i was thinking you where going to say pain lol omg you got me if penelo is in this top five its a fav video just me so tifa is so overpowered as being hot that she is not in the top and got disqualified instead to give the others even a chance to shinesounds the most reasonable to me how are paine and fang not on this list anywhere vanille was soo close assassinate yuna lol i dont think tifa is that hot xdd tifa disqualified for me shes 3rd on my list hahah love this guys attitude thanks for the vid mate i think you made a good chose for number 1 hottest girl she is my favorate girl how could yu say terra is more beautiful than me how ummm cod anyone lightning is good but the guys at square apparently dont know that theres such a thing as too much of a good thing she was great in ff xiii xiii2 was in my opinion an unnecessary sequel but a good game and despite serah being the protagonist lightning had a central role in the plot and now we have lightning returns which not only features lightning as the main character again but also has the cheesiest title of any videogame ever even the best dish starts tasting bland after a while that cape deserves an ultima at least shut up queen brahne is my future wife im a girl and i loved this video 3 totally agree about yuna hahaha lol good points about every all the ff chicks kh3 wont be made until they finish with versus xiii on a side note fang deserves a spot in this she is number 1 in most beautiful category omfg i hoped terra would be on one of these lists did you see all the video shes number six i love her pro answer to newb failure hi i love u video but you should have add tifa and the hottest porn star can u make a top 20 of the bad girls in the game and a top 100 of the hotest video game girl both good and bad like you dont love a bad girl fang where tha fuck is fang i dont think shes ugly far from it its just that she looks like a young boy that walk is something else though good work banning out tifa b4 this video started i was like tifa obvi then u went and threw a curve ball that kept me watching lol you forgot to add in stella from versus xiii yunasama but i still feel that her outfit in x1 is da best still she looks great in anything yunasama serah will forever be most gorgeous i hope i aint the only one who balled my eyes at the end of xiii2 xd i cant say that i agree or disagree with you on most of these the only disagreement i have is i think quistis should have been higher or maybe ever 1 on the most beautiful list either way i give you props for even being able to make a list such as this as you said making a top ten or any list for that matter of these ladies is extrememly difficult both of course do you even ask its something about that walk of hers i think shes cute allies or all characters vanille will always be my favorite she is in very very last men list ahem i mean in girls list whwh where the hell is fang oh sorry i didnt wanna shout d still where the hell is she first save your joke to your self nobody laugh sec yes its asian girls foolwait do not saying another bad joke like its video game or the voice who speech is nonasian or learn english i will rip your hair off listen i know this is your list and all that im not trying to knock it just have one question alyssa im not seeing a figure or booty lol what were you looking at she kinda looks like a 12 year old boy just saying the rest of your list i can see your reasons though this is pretty much how my friends try to convince me to play new games i do believe im going to play more final fantasy games as annoying as it is youre right about tifa being a gamebreak babe its almost cosmic law that shes the hottest id say that your decisions were pretty sound sans a couple which i think my own opinion holds sway also even if i didnt agree with any of your choices know that id have liked this for yourcomments on lights transformation scene add 10 points to your man card totally with you on lebreu alyssa and serah lol you had so many funny and clever side comments in this one blonde hair big blue eyes more peach skintone than yellow not to mention their anglo saxon first and last names yeah i can tell these girls are designed to be asian and nobodys hating except for some virgins here who are wound up too tight my problem is people are way too uptight and cant read between the lines if a comment is serious or not get that stick surgically removed out of your ass if you cant see the joke in my comment more importantly get your eyes checked if you really think these final fantasy girls are asian haha there are just too many to choose from but i will always have tifa on top but have you also considered some of the villain females because cloud of darkness didnt look bad in dissidia can agree with yuna as nr 1 but rinoa needs to be higher not bad but the lack of paine on this list is disturbing dude whats your problem you really dont have a life if you have to be a racist bitch to this guy for me its yuna and rikku i love some other things about it but they are the main reasons yesi know you are its hard to decide why ffx is such a perfect game is it because everything was about as good as it gets or because yuna and rikku are in it dude did you not hear it is his taste its cissinei he said soand even wikipedia updated it to cissnei aerith 33 im bang her lol wtf the clip that i pointed out that he used is from the guy who does the dead fantasy series its hitomi hell yeah dk yeul is so damn cute how could people possibly hate why is that lol whats your problem uhh yesalyssa is sexyto me anyway shes on the overall list which means i want to bang her too thanks for taking care of that for me finally someone else thinks yuna is beautiful ive always hated yuna when i was playing x i actually wanted her to die i didnt even bother with x2i had too much dignity to play that fanservice crap though to be fair the only character i liked in x was auron the rest of them were awful i still find it unexpected how either an animation company or group went out of their way to create that or someone had that great of animation skills to pull of something like that i suppose it doesnt matter either way try again friend cissnei in crisis core when they go to the beach that the only place where 3d tifa is viral lol she is like a pornstar p 210 thats hitomi i died from laughter where the hell is kingdom hearts 3 selphie didnt make the cut do not blame him he did not see her in final fantasy advent children no no no no no see her in final fantasy advent children first then talk noob all this girls is asian so go your selfracist aerith is ugly as fuck she looks like my cock damn niggah you like dem white girls too much ive hear dtheyre making it which means it may be true but still not but i do hope very much that they are makingit p because ff versus xiii it will be only on ps4 what if what you said come true you do not have right to even give your what do you think about it will come or not if you know what i mean ashe fang dagger rikku and thats it youre profile pic deceived me i thought it was a real fly on my screen i was attempting to wipe it out of my screen however it also may be curious how come the fly is still on my screen then there goes i finally realized it was on the computer itself wheres aqua khbbs on ur list man ff girls arent hot they are really pretty though idd where the heck is kingdom hearts iii though ive heard theyre making it right now but i wantz you have all my fave girls on here rock on how is it a spoiler when it can be found everywhere you look oo i agree with yuna i crushed so hard haha number one became kinda obvious once yuna wasnt in anywhere else lol agreed not cute just because she has breast does not equal bang material or sexy either i new yuna was number one lol half way the ought i thought you wadent going to name any i new then you said lulu my opinion is she always bored me as a kid every cutseen she was in i hated yuna and rikku on the other hand well to me aerith is no 1 in all categories vanille argh she is hot as the sun argh orgasm so i have a problem with this video he gives no reason behind why he picked the girls he did yeah i completely get that shes such a cyootie patootie and i want her body its just her personality and her wanting to get it on with hope that really sets me off about her the one with the tifa blow job i told youi dont know im really attracted to her for some reason everything about alyssa is just no how could you yeul is sooooo cute agree with number one my opinion either d d d yuna is just the best d i love her calm voice thanks to hedy burress her figure her hair her eyes her whole personality d d actually its spelled porom ffiv after years and yeul ffxiii2 lol im suprised at how many people know where that came from lol that first tifa scene is from a 3d porni know what you did here spoiler i hope you die son of btch sir mixalotbest countdown ever what is the name of the music in the ashe scene in top 10 lol i love how you disqualified tifa you are so correct does my race matter you for real on id bang her 2 she aint human someone somewhere is fapping to this you all know its true nice countdown thx for uploading on my birthday kind of disappointed none of the unique looking npcs from final fantasy xi are on here seriously you got lion cornelia karst prishe klara bester star sibyl cause she is cute as a button perih vashai ulmia eshantarl aphmau and lilisette there also a new one which you see in the seeker of adoulin trailer but i cant remember her name theres definitely something wrong with ses age convention there is no freakying way that rikku is only 15 if shes in real life even light and cloud how are they under 30 mmmm thats fair still i never thought there was anything bangable about her body except the tattoo on leg thing falcies are prevs lol lol yeah premature commenting her body combined with her cutness points her in overall her body combined with her cutness points her in overall pay no attention to that idiot i dont care what anybody says kairi is hot and thats all there is too it the game community put her on the hottest gamer girls list for a reason its cool she just missed the cut theres way too many girls to choose from shes a little manly at times porn crap i always thought hope and vanille were the same age whoopsies come one now even square wouldnt be that low to give a 12 year old a body like that with a tattoo on her butt shes 19 dude you do know that vanille is 12 right l dont worry 3 yeul and all the past characters from 13 are coming back in lightnings return final fantasy xiii its been stated they there well be a happy ending 3 i wont say any more then that 3 its the internet and what is the internet for i like the source you used for tifas introduction i predict that you will put the sun sigil as 1 how about a top 10 of the best overdriveslimit breaks etc yuna gah great number 1 choice i agree completely once i hear the i cant hear you i smiled cause i knew it was yuna great choice i keep on imagining donkey from shrek narrating this this top ten was quite accurate personally its riona 1 for me i fell in love with that woman the moment i laid eyes on her just because kairi looks like a child quistis who looks very adultlike is 17 and rinoa is also along the 1517 range sadly no tifa is ugly af to me honestly i think yuna was a lot prettier in ff10 in 102 oo yunaaa big surprise there lolz loools this was hilarious fuck you sora kiaris mine bitch which ones were those 7 and 132 about terra you most see her in dissidia 012 duodecim final fantasy cg video at end of game final moment after you saw her you will know why she 1 on beautiful list trust me fang do not get me wrong but she look like a shemale or like an india girl with that clothes she wear it will be a thousand years to be on any of this list trust me on this too only 2 of them did i wouldnt post a link here just google tifa 3d hentai youll find it wut kingdom hearts is on this list link please d also can you make a countdown video of which ff made you sad you are always full of humor sense like it although in my idea your list should be reversed well except for ashe she deserves to be in top 3 hehe lol really i always thought that she was a tad creepy ill bet the girl that had a crush on zell would have been cute and what about raine ellone and julia cant remember if they showed her in ffviii no agrias for ff tactics they didnt show her so well i guess even for the psp version i guess you pretty much killed it i still say tifa should be fair game lol i dun care who u picked as ur first they r all fine for video games i couldnt help but smile n laugh my way to the end of ur video ur commentary was hilarious n u prolly nail what most people think about these chicks xd thanx for ur time lol well yeah ill give ya that tifa would win all of those lists on here xd though for me she is the hottest ff girl in my book as well xd as for all of gaming flame shield up she is in my top 3 thumbs up i agree on dat yuna as well and fang sucks shaman30228 lol disqualifying tifa thats hot thats a hot way to live tell that to the gaming community who voted kairi the number 7 hottest gamer girl of all time its a video game for fucks sake you forgot about fang where is celes or maria from ffii lenna even faris is this top just for rendered girls its not fair celes would have beaten all of them in any category at least you put terra but only becasuse she was in dissidia and there is a 3d version of her have you seen yoshikata amanos artwork from the old ffs you can see how beautiful where girls from the first games without being all hdrenderedmade just saying i like serah mainly cus shes voiced by laura bailey haha i agree with tifa she is undisputed i enjoy this video a lot this was so fun to watch your 1 was great im sure we can all agree yuna is awesome although i wanted to point out you forget to add fang to your countdown shes gorgeous also it would be nice to see other countdowns on ff i quit playing finaly hallway on the first game so the second one probably suck too i was going to play a ff game after this now i have co clue witch one to play tifas actually pretty offputting because of her endowment in general between tuna and rikku for me id say for me its a tie i cant decide personally in my opinion who i find the hottest and sexiest of all awesome video but alyssa number 1 in the bang category about your 1 there are a few reasons why i dont like it and its not because of who you picked 1 as soon as i heard the suck music from the suckwhack ass fanservice game i automatically retracted my i know its gonna be yuna but im also going to respect that thought i hate that game for my 2 reason 2 it was a huge fanservice and those skimpy costumes only took away from the gameplay because no matter how bad it was braindead fanboys girls would play itsquare knew this lmao omg at about 1415 my brother who had been listening to you go on about kairi and rikku who is 12 going on 13 looks over when you showed ashe and that oldschool music started playing and says ok that guy should be locked up i busted out laughing then he asked me if i thought that was funny and of course i said yes im gonna call you orb because you remind me of my friend orb d dont do it there are more than enough of each to go around ill make sure to subscribe in order to see it make sure to specify in your video if you are making both and they are different lists 615 who was it that you said the woman wasnt more beautiful than what 2 goddesses were you comparing and where are they from that one lost me 655 i didnt quite catch what you said they nerfed her battle skills why did you do that you were talking about terras skills 5 4 bang its i didnt recognize lulu would put a curse on you and wakka blitz kick in nuts 2 nuff said wasnt kingdom hearts iii that stupid 3dsonly dream drop distance game which means many will never play he thought that she was like an overpowered spam that would always be at the top if allowed to be used in a contest no rikku in the id bang her section you disapoint me only cause she was dq that was said at the start of the vid lol yeah yuna is the best wait tifa lost really ffx on doesnt count your video is invalid im happy to see yuna as 1 even though i am a girl i can say she isnt a beautiful woman im in love with her eyes just imagine if she had the swirl in her eyes like rikku did man would that be the coolest eyes ever wtf terra isnt the most beautifull girl actually your top 5 for the most beautifull should have been done in reverse sorry for my bad sentence here i didnt know how to say it in english xd and yeah youre right we all wanna bang fran i didnt actually know they were part of the rules then again i guess i dont watch too many countdowns sorry for complaining about it i now know better for next time somebody else noted that i simply forgot about edeashe would have been in there hd i remembered her well the rules about countdowns is they normally contains spoliers so when you dont want it spoiledyou shouldnt watch countdowns sorry for spoling it for you but this was such a big deal that even people who havent played it has heard first im not here to rant about how you made the wrong decisions secondly what wanted to say was thank you for pointing out two spoilers for ffxiii2 because everyone has played that havent they i always did find penelos outfit really unattractive and that really drives me away from her i wont complain about you putting kh in the list but its still not ff even with the characters in there and there is kh3d as well with my limited space ill tell you that your 1 is great youve got to mention ff7s mog house not frustrating but just because its so heartwarming top 10 summons i know this video was all your opinion but really in girls i wanna bang category how is edea not in there maybe i am alone in thinking that but i have always wanted to bang that sorceress on a side note great job on disqualifying tifa your reasoning is on the money everyone knows she is the absolute sexiest video game girl great video dont worry dude that person blew it out of proportion he went too far terras hair was originally blond in the japanese version because it was supposed to be exotic not a lot of natural blondes in japan however when porting it into areas where blond girls are more commonwellgreens rare actuallyi might have to mix mini game with side quests the next top ten will be most frustrating mini games oki tried to resolve this in a friendly manner but based on these comments of yours youre either very young and immature or youve got some serious issues i guess im to blame for my comment but anybody will tell you that i was joking in anycaseits come to the point i must block you sorry it has to be this way like i saidits problay my fault for my comment but it was a joke and now youve taken it to a whole new level just something random i threw in there i see it seems i hit a sore spot i really was just being humorous but looks like you arent listening to reason sorry you dont believe me all of my subs know im a perv sometimes but the video was for entertainment hey belldandy is not on final fantasy series lol i was being humorous dude sorry if i offended you hmmmmyoure profile picture i know where you got that shame on you lol this video is hilarious so glad i subbed someone finally put yuna as number one finally someone agrees you are awesome top ten final attacks im loving this lol yes shes sexy i want her lol what allysa anyways epic video d i thought this video was hilarious penelos even cutet if you play revenant wings first how about top 10 worst side quests catcher chocobo butterfly catching lightning doging queen of cards monster hunting and much more im out of ideas dk rikku baby you will always be my number 1 pick but i have to admit your cousin is a lot hotter than you are rikku whatd you say i cannot help but agree with you on yuna but i must say i think that yuna and lenne are tied from the thousand words cutscene damn man i cant believe that you didnt put beatrix lenne or leblanc on the list for 1 overall you have excellent taste sir its the basic your taste sucks and mine is the only right one statement which just never seems to die gtfo dude you made the best fucking choice at the end yuna ftw dont like penelo s i prefer ceres from ffvi she is strong and beautiful pedophile much lolbig butts personally garnet is the hottest ff babe but its your video and i think kairi is more cute the hot but again your list not mine i liked but lightning deserve more than this uu i was likeyunayunayunawhere the fuck is yuna then when i heard real emotion i was like fuck yeah awesome choices i 100 completely agree ok although its about taste how could you leave out selphie in the cute section she is so adorable she is like the incarnation of cute and also cant agree on tifa beeing the number 1 in all videogame history also i guess girls and boys play games like this very differently xd never realized ashe hat such an ass drop i think riku is rather cute then sex especialy in 10 not so much in 102 anymore also i dont think kh should be in there its a series on its own alissa ew and serah i didnt cry when she died i dont think i liked the game very much im very surprised fang wasnt mentioned o icannotagreeontife i loved the belldandy reference no one ever features ultimacia beast hands aside she is pure sex on legs cant forget fran aswell noooooo lightning is first of all final fantasy characters ya ya ya people hate lightning but she is still the best aeris quistis rinoa vanille lightning its not because ashe has a big butt its because of her tiny ass skirt its between yuna rinoa tifa why are you tasting him pal i think thath you exchanged the meaning of hot with cute i mean come on yuna is hottest than lulu omfg yes you soo got number 1 right on the spot d yuna is far pretty much in all your teirs you did imo xdd even disqualified as well ff x and x2 are reasons i play them just for sake of playin to just see yuna d was overly and unnecessarily long having different categories and then another top ten on top didnt make much sense just make your mind up and dont try to please everyone i said if you factor in release date if you do shed be 15 in 2002 11 would make her more then legal plus no laws on the internet yeah it was only made by the same people had the same characters as most of them soundtrack from alot frankly from your logic if kh is not considered a final fantasy game neither is dissidia its the content that make the game not the title you added kairi thank you but xion from 3582 days remains my fav nice list though never knew about hald those girls xd i love your picks for top 10 tho i will admit tifa looks like a transgender whose plastic surgeon did a bad job on bastards they dont deserve those girls well maybe sorazidane and tidus do but leon dint act interested until rinoa was in trouble sooooooo with all that in mind we can easly see who the four luckyist guys in ff are leonzidanesoraand tidus rinoa should have been in that for sure 216 whats that dance video 602 which game is that one and which one of the games did poramrydia i no about ff4 what other oneslebrea from and 1437 agreed who me why would you say such a thing maybei might mix it up next time darkkefka i love you for putting yuna as number 1 i was wondering where the hell she was 3 ah tifa is sure to be nuber one and yes serah is realy hot and yes yuna is gorgeous xd i like rikku allot too by the way xd i was like tidus what the fuck choose heeeer not yuna xd and in cissei video he msic behind is kpo my sister is lways listenning to it xd kairi this guy shes my fav hahah just proved his point i was pretty skeptical when i clicked this video and was pretty sure i was going to be snnoyed at the choice but boyyou did not dissapoint yuna you are so beautiful can i just be you the hottest ff girl is noel from ffxiii2 huh what do you mean hes a guy you just have to agree with yuna out of all the heterochromia eyed characters on games anime manga and comics alike yuna is definitely the most beautiful design terra is not beautiful shes just too cute your music is way 2 repetitive i have lost all faith in humanity i havent played many ff games but i did see most of those coming tifa yuffie aerith rikku yuna riona etc thank you for including kh what about fang but the best are indeed tifa and yuna kingdom hearts is not a final fantasy game and never will be yay i was hoping for yuna to be 1 how about namine then yuna is the best no but i have the game hot girls yepi never picked chris again after getting that outfit you find out in before crisis final fantasy vii released in september 24 2004 exclusively for japan mobile phones penelo youll never fly anything if youre rotting in a dungeon vaan ooh i like my girls with fire penelo youll never fly one of those if youre rotting in a dungeon either yuna is the best 3 follow the hentai you have no idea how much you made my day when you said the top 5 i wanna bang you nice video thanks mate hey dont think im mad that yuna is the hottest i agree with you 100 percent cute beautiful sexy whats the difference i knew yuna would be number 1 3 haha i have the same problem with my friends saying why i main the girls in games than the guysand i answered them the exact same why you said it lol make a top 10 songs from ff pleaase and a top 10 boss theme like so he sees posted the video response because i know you like yuna hope you like it hilarious video awesome count down of course yuna lol and from my personal opinion i think its easier to may a list of the hottest girls than guys and im gay so thts really saying something xd but considering that my str8 friend whose a dude found it easier to make a top 10 sexy guy list rather than the girls lol xx how the fuck does that work xd lol i wnna bang u wtf do u have a life omfg lol characters ingame numbers and he want to bang a program lol minerva oerba lightning yunathose are my personal favorite hotties that doesnt mean i dont like other ffs ix and crisis core are my favorite nintendolife25 cept for sora that kid still has the annoying squeaky voice that makes me want to mute any of his cutscenes xd 16 is legal in many countries like it is in my country lightning 1 here whats the point of making this video when tifa is going to win and u disqualified her i would have taken the decision you took about tifa in the beginning for aeris hahaha at that tifa intro that doesnt change the fact that kairi was 15 in kh1 and the time from kh1 to kh2 is 1 yearanywaysstuff the clip i cant post that here sorryjust google it and youll find it eventally i meanyou really should make sure you know what youre talking about before you pedo me here you havent plated after years yet it seems my limit on game girls is 15 because of ffx rikku real life girls is 18 but did you really think i would be so creep to use a 57 year old girl in this countdown poram is a grown women in after yearsand thats the one i used you havent played after years yet have you i love rikku morebut tifa is more sexyplus the age thing put tifa in rikkus clothes i hope you do that was a good game mysterious girl from ff4 after yearsthe main villain because kairi is betterthats why shes also much more gorgous why did you guys thumb down this comment its an inside joke hes cool many people have said this you guys are getting me interested in birth by sleep when i finally play it ill be the judge of that umm aqua shes way hotter than kairi okay terra has blonde hair because in the orignal artwork she is blond but with the makers thought celes and her would be confused with so they made her green to seperate them since in the world of balance you primarly play terra and in ruin celes so they did it to make her easier to see dissidia went with the blonde as a nod to the artwork which is the main source for the character creation and the green as the alt 110 i know where you got that shit from what about stella from versus xiii waifu overload damn lol this video is hilarious ive got a question for those of you who are calling us creeps how did you find this video anyway people dont cry over serah spoiler she comes back in ff13 lightning returns ya know who id bang laughing octopus from mgs4 but in the ff series id choose vanille shes hot adorable and bangable whos the girl at 0057 dang straight aeris is beautiful xd skynorthern yuna is 1 on the over all list actually riku was 16 in kh2 sora and kairi are both 15 yes aerith is beautyful 3 hahahaha vanille her terrible aussie voice pisses me off to much personally because im australian probably it has squall aerith cid and a mixture of various ff characters in there not just kairi most people who like final fantasy and kh would consider it to be a ff game though it is kiddish that didnt stop ff9 from going chibi c im starting to wonder if guys realize the wonders of a push up bra lmfao ffxiii had the sexiest girls gathered in a single game than in the entire franchise xd props bro i would never have been able to keep it fair and i wont lie thought you would follow the hype of lightning xd question wats your thought on like the villain but good deal characters like elena i think from vii beatrice from ix leblanc paine from x2 me too rikku will be my number 1 pickbut i belive that yuna has a better body ikind of forgot her she would be on the bang list well namine is basically kairiso i guess she counts e3 voted her 7th or 6th i think kairi is hotand thats all there is too it i put her on this list for a reason you didnt really think i would forget yuna did you shes number 1 for a reason lets see here dude ahon this video watchvil2wj2ytq4 ypu posted something about jacking off to a women swinging her ass and youre calling me a creep at the end of the day you are still a man what the fuck is wrong with you people its a video game if it bothers you this muchtake it up with the people who made 1517 year old girls walk around half naked with boobs as big as angelena dude great list made me laugh glad it was in recommendations also wheres yuna yuna was 1 on his list d lol do you have to put on that song for ashe xd i find that hilarious but at the same time yes d when which game how do you see that scene that is all kinds of disturbing man bbrrrroooooo spoiler alert at least mention that man also wheres yuna shes beautiful sweet notsomuch with the sexy but still soooo beautiful for all the fang lovers shes definitely my fav ff character of all time but dont think she belongs in any of these categories now if theres a bad ass amazing breaking the social norm category then that list would only include fang and vanille speaking of which why isnt vanille included in cute omg the laughs hey kairi is kh sure kh has final fantasy elements but kairi isnt on eof em your analysis of fran is superb i salute you i already started to hate you for leaving out yuna but well you saved your ass how is she manly because she isnt a damsel nothing about fang gives that vibe off she was the only treat in the otherwise awful ffxiii what about edea i respect your vid bruh i loved yuna but rikku is forever and will be the hottest id marry her and grow old with that chick something about fang turns me off shes a little ummainly not complaining about the list overall although kairi is way too young imo but im disappointed theres no fang hottest playable character in that game second only to jihl five ff13 girls and no fang tsk tsk then dont watch any of my videos its an old 90s song called baby got back yes i knew it yuna number 1 but i love your choices why squre why you had to kill her off tt aerith waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i feel u man whats the song u played about ashes butt selphie should at least be in the cute list i always thought that too until i played dissidia one thing guy chronologically kingdom hearts 2 is kingdom hearts 3 chain of memories is 2 and where is namine bastard aerith shall always be 1 to me even if i am alone in that opinion well it just means i get to keep her quistis is so young beautiful and lively in that cutscene in the beginning its a pity that she looks old ugly and tired during normal gameplay the opposite goes for terra rydia is magnificent what i loved most is her adult mugshot in ffiv so motherish looking i never liked tifa that much so sterile only big boobs and nothing else yuffie is my favourite from ffvii play dissidia wheres the dancing clip from when he was talking about tifa ummactually rikus 16 really nice list i total agree with you on the whole serah death i too hated that they killed her nice list too okay this video is starting to follow me in the newsfeed slightly worrying how turned on you sound about these still kairi noooo kh is not final fantasy agree with every one of these good job id bang all the final fantasy woman in any order great video man i really impressed i have only one question do you take into account a beatrix ff9 tifa disqualified dude i think you only really described overqualification sad that tifa was disqualified and is not 1 but yuna is a very close 2 so if tifa is out it is a very obvious choice to pick yunaaa awesome list too d lmao right when u said lulu i was like omg yes lmao that was so right on call xd not bad for the picks if only i played the older ff more i started at ff7 but not bad haha i understand where youre coming from but you need to understand that the video is for entertainment choosing only those girls would have made the movie far lessentertaining im not going to make a horrible video just because one person cant get over himself do you realize that you just called about 85 of male gamers 18 creeps theres nothing creepy about it its a video game i think the bw pokemon girls are hotas well as many gamers but we are not going to go to a real life 1516 year old girl and hit on them if so then yeahits creepy theres something you fail to come to grips with all of these games where made in japan they have a younger legal age it wasnt i who decided to make rikku wear nothing but a bra and mini skirt would be very very very less creepy so would have felt better if i only choose the girls who are 18 totally agree with you dk i personally like lightning and serah i come on theres a reason they have alternate outfits d let me get this straight a blond teacherwith blue eyesglasses and uses a whipquistis pwns all the girls imo rinoa should have scored higher in my opinion speaking from a womans point of view because i am i think she should have been 4 or 5 but you know this was your top ten not mine i do however approve of your number one choice well although i preferred her in ffx not ffxii totally shouldve added paine if you added rikku and yuna when i palyed ffx2 i couldnt help but value paine over the other two somethign about the daring look in her eyes thought rikku will always be my second best in kh2 when they appeared to sora i nearly yelled let me keep paine as a party member didnt happen though because you say every ff girl is underage when 6 out of 7 arent not just you choose yunaso many people choose herbut whyywhy 9 rinoa is mine what is meaning typo btw your video is badass the best compared to other ppl video and my top 5 is 5nabaat 4pain i love her long legs 3yuna 2garnet and the ultimate 1beatrix in ff9 and i wonder why you did not put her any your list wheres queen brane from ff9 terras hair is green because in ffvi there was a mistake in the game coding making her have green hair tifa 20 rinoa 17 ashe 19 17 when she got married quistis 18 rosa 19 yuna 1719 x2 naabaat nobody knows sowhats youre point great list but ya were is kg3 i like rinoa best because she seems like a real girl and she has the best personality of them all cute and playful and honest not manufactured and generic hot rinoa by far tifa in 2nd glad you took tifa out she has huge boobs lol of course she would be number 1 its not a bad list i think you should have included celes of ff6 i think she has a lot of masculine as well as feminine characteristics which would be appealing to many plus shes a strong woman who can hold her own and i think thats sexy too also fang and vanille if you are wondering are mere close friends they were born to similar clans and i guess their bonds are stronger since they now only have each other as a man i mainly play female characters in games too as a man i dont really give a shit about guys except for games like ff 132 where i would play as noel simply cuz i liked his playstyle over serah i mean a perfect example would be playing as tribal outfit sheva from re5 i mean who wouldnt wanna play as her in that alyssa nah man no way id rather it be fang vanille and definetely nabaat he you mean she lol i always play as female characters for the same reason i know what shes too deep and strong best character in ffxiii in my opinion me too fran is my 1 always how old is tifa rinoa quistis ashe rosa yuna and nabaat just to name a few 1500 vanille and fang in twilight vampire glowing and stuff lol favorite pick or not rikku is hotter than any girl on this list oh course you did the title says hottest ff girls and all ff girls are like 1517 years old i wouldnt be able to bang alyssa shes so skinny i would be afraid to shatter that poor girl i was just about to go ape shit if yuna didnt make the countdown oh yeah like i knew i was going to think it was going to be like this by not watching the video know you know why thats a stupid argument i don knowsomething about he turns me off im not upset about who you put in but i do wish you put fang in she is really hot and i think you should have put her in look dudethe video is for entertainment if it bothers you so then dont watch it i laugh at you two dumbasses thanks to your clicki got paid so go aheadkeep laughing at my videos and i thought i heard every stupid comment ever well if you want to get technical on usif they were real by now they would both be in their 20s hahahahah last one real classy d i think you should put character from ff11 girls there are a lot of female main npc in the game that help you in your main quest great video what do you think about ff x remake for vita uh i dont think that kingdom hearts counts honestly because it only cameos final fantasy characters that and disneys hand so erm hmm i would fuck the hell out of lady yunalesca kingdom hearts is not a final fantasy game so tell me then did somebody hurt i mean kids real kids its just video game they never grow up so we can ask them to merry them neither they have feeling in first place so do not call a person pedophilia on something it it has no soul when you were 15 years old did you ever want to have sex with a woman over 18 if you did have sex with a woman over 18 years old when you were 15 do you think it would have cause you psychological problems down the line nope that game is just another filler like chain of memories is its being used to fill the place between kingdom hearts 2 and three they said that its being used to explain more in depth the story and what we can look forward to in kingdom hearts 3 tifas in a class buy herself yuna is number 1 tifa is tier 0 well you clicked on the video and if youve ever played ff then you know the girls are youngso what does this make you look dudeno i wouldnt bang a 15 year old girl in real life geez i think so alyssa dem booty shorts so right about alyssa though for reasons i wont discuss shes like my number 3 that was the best reason to not include tifa at least she still made it onto the list it wouldnt be a true list of hottest without her i cannot stop imagining this being done by donkey from shrek i cant stop laughing at this video its so funny no its not its lolicon this not real its just game not even real picture so calm down wow that rydia girl is sooooo beautiful oo i might not agree with all of the spots but i can respect the choices good list have you played kh bbs aqcua is hotter i also think aerith deservers a better position she is fucking cool at crisis core imagine her in her 20s way to get around the pedobear responses there is the blonde japaneses tina branford and then the american terra branford with green hair because they felt that it showed her esper heritage and i want to thank you for putting terra in this as without her and the other charaters of ffvi there would have been ffvii in america fang is a final fantasy character just because its not made by the original creator its still a part of the final fantasy game series really good video and completely agree with you opinion fang isnt a character from final fantasy yuna is my number 1 and tidus is a lucky bastard where the video sequence from yeul by 347 was quickly yaschas massif what yearaf i am also of the opinion yeul is the cutest avatar image we need a badass girl countdown ultimecia is the best those horns o or you can take the joke at face value and not put a pointless slander on the mans video troll yeah lulu does have them jiggle physics yuna tifa yeul stella thats my list awesome list alot of it i agree with but in my opinion lightning is 1 and 10x hotter than tifa well i was around 9 when ffx was releasedso technically shed be 6 years older than me at all times well it was intresting to see where all the ff babes are labeled on your list and i do agree and disagree on a few parts i think imo to make this list mor intresting you should have gone with the ladies that in the end were still single because our main protagonists are to dumb to see beauty standing before them i think that would have added an intresting twist to the countdown but thats my opnion xd rikku your number 1 rydia be my number 1 finally a legit ff character rating video p sure i dont agree with half of them but thats just opinion the id bang her list is totaly spot on though p tytyty serahs on the list i was afraid because lightning came up first ashe best butti thought that trophy goes to fran 533 animevideo game rule always the greatest characters die in the half or almost in the beginning how can she be a winner if shes not even in the countdown looks at profile pic i wonder why fuck it im just going to throw it out there selphie lightning is my number 1 well the most was yuna i think from i played ff since kid wow really guy you say disqualified but all you did was tell us that tifa was the winnerwhat reason do i have to watch the rest oh well my phone needs to recharge anyhow so thanks for not wasting my time you wouldnt get why terra has green or blond hair if you grew up with final fantasy im guessing you started at 10 or 13 terras hair color maybe its something to do with being an esper just a guess hey dissidia isnt that confusing ponyinthefridge 9 i just dont like alyssas hairstyle personal opinion i dont like it when a girl has guystyle haircuts first clip of tifa is from a 3d hentai darkkefka and i must both be pervs sorry for the triple comment but subbed for the fact yuna is most beautiful overall yuna inb4 league of legends fanboys dat ashe tifas not on my list at all i only agree with one thing off this list straight men should always main the hot female damn straight other than that nope nope nope way too much love for children and the lists themselves could and probably should be grouped together cute girls are beautiful and i usually want to bang them which makes them perfect either way just not children cause thats disturbing also perfection or not tifa still deserves to claim number 1 anyway cant punish her for being perfect first one year off hell she coulda had a birthday right afterwrads secondly if you factor in release date theyre older then 18 guys i included kairi because kh is very close to ff gameand shes really gorgous and has a nice figure imagine her in her 20s trust methat was a hard move to make rosa beat her by an inch the reason hironobu sakaguchi decided to have aerith died was because hironobu sakaguchis mother died at the time that he was creating ff7 for me yuna is more like cute not hot atalltifa is hot i dont know who half these people are lol have not played that many ff games butwhen you said some of you are not going to like it when you got to 1i already knew it was yuna and im happy i think there may be prettier girls by looks but yuna isjust something different and the fact you didnt completely talk down about x2hell the fact that you even played it since so many people like to badmouth it great video shame prishe didnt make it though lol pretty princess dress me up is the official nick name i gave 102 tifa are almost as hot as the sweet princess garnet and you were even hotter in tha movie p garnetdagger was my fav not just because of royalty but because shes hot even when she cuts her hair which makes it hotter i was disappointed that ryidia ranked so low on the list but was pleased she was there the only reason people accually played x2 was for the girls i agree if she wasnt i would kill him he is right yuna is hot i stopped watching when i saw penelo in your top sorry lol lightning is hot as hell d lmao tifa was disqualified how did i get to final fantasy from elder scrolls lore damn recommended videos icwas wrong before i even watch im going guess 1 tifa sigh oh there she is shes at the end of the video in her concept art she was blonde instantly knew who was no1 before i even heard to lyrics to the song but its 100 agreeable why i shouldnt be on that list cissneis real name is up to the player in the mobile phone game before crisis square is just trying to keep the continuity fine i call her goth friend yussss yuna why wasnt rikku in any of the list shes hotttttttt pretty agreeable list on an offtopic note lumina from lrff13 looks like serah im kinda thinkinghoping she is i couldnt be happier with your 1 choice cause shes definitely my favorite ff girl good on you man i also think light is the hottest virtual girl ever created not only in ff but from anywhere and hottest by far not a chance in hell this is my story also this list feelswrong and awkward and absolutely fucking creepy i mean were talking about fake women let alone video game characters and who we would want to to put it bluntly fuck seriously this is why i stay away from the mass effect and street fighter fanbases hold it yuffies underage isnt she so no i would not hit that unless i want to have a criminal record wonder what would she look like when her parents didnt die maybe the same as yuna or even more clicked video to say rinoa no1 and left rinoa should of been on the top of the list yes id put her over tifa too yuna is 1 so that makes this list legitimate 2 colored eyes people nothing beats it tifa should be disqualified for her giant giggling titsits not fair to the girls that square did not make their boobies giggle like tifas tifa goodbye the end snsd in the background i heard it okay quistis is in there your taste doesnt suck i bet on tifa on the first place anyway yuna most cute and lebrea as most sexi terra was nerfed serious clearly he hasnt seen some of the japanese combo vids where she drops some of the most op broken characters from the first game i knew it was yuna as soon as he said tifa was disqualified thats the joke where the hell is fang actually im playing ffx again right now already past zanarkand going to do side quests first but i have no idea why they made her blonde either terra had green hair in her original game one of these things is not like the other i feel the same way about lightning i hated her at first but then she grew on me shes one of my favorite ff girls now p celes is hot lightning is hot lani is hot lulu is hot fran is hot ashe is hot vanille is hot irvine is hot its one of the paradox ending in the game so that is the reason why yuna wasnt anywhere around well played my friend well played heh good to know im not the only guy who mains female characters i do run males sometimes but those are character remakes from tabletop games 111 is from a hentai dont ask me how i know wait wtf does anyone know why snow is getting alyssa arrested i didnt see this when i played 13 2 wtf my favs rikku is pretty hot specially ffx2 serah from ffxiii2 love her big blue beautiful eyes and aerith because she was so sweet and mysterious i used to love yuna because her two colors eyes make her look so exotic and smexy ffx2 in ffx she act and talk so quiet that she seemed with no personality at all penelo xii oh wait i just realized i like em all lol i agree with you and the tifa thing lol poram is supposedly 22 in the after years so theres no pedo moment my favorites are lightning and yuffie ps i agree with all except alyssa lol i hate you i hate you i hate you thank you for ruining ffiiffiv for me lmao ashe that was hilarious she is gorgeous but fran has a booty too even penelo ff12 is an ass mans game hahaha xd porom i let ya get away with mostly because shes 17 years older in ffivtay but kairi is 16 actually if were willing to count ffivtay then shes not a child i have to second that first off why is this video recommended for people listening to game music second clearly sephiroth is the hottest final fantasy girl third relm shouldve been on the cute list fourth howhow could you leave shiva out fifth why did this video leave me with chocobo music stuck in my head i agree with you 3 finally someone who have waken up from the deep dream of tifas sleep materia and magic and realized that tifa is not the sexiest ff girl ever there are lot more sexier and hotter girls and even more exotic like yuna rikku vanille serah ashe prishe i love you hehe its awesome from 1521 d just my toughts so i agree with ya p face what your minority opinion shes a child watchvu4bqrwfkxy0 stay away from the summoner d how could shirma from chocobo dungeon not make cute shes adorable stay away from the summoner the name i was with you all the way until you said kairi dude i stopped att tifa tifa is not the sexiest ff girl ever rikku is over and out why the fk did i watch this u got 1 right tho would bang 1010 you can just look it up on youtube try dansg08s channel he has a movie version the only thing that bugs me about cosmos is that she always looks sad i think that was hitomi from doa in the monytum vid not cissnei i cant take this seriously even your voice makes it hard for me to take you serious not to mention everything youve said but its nice to see someones opinion on final fantasy girls lol lightning take off hahah no problem dont have nothing to see xdxdxdxd inclusive tidus have more boobs to axl lightning roses dunno about you but i would bang all of them porams a child thumb up for rydia she is the best d tifas out of the competition xd i play both game ffx n ffx2 great game ever yuna forever from innocent to free spirited girl i cannot imagine any character can replace her from my heart i remember watching ffx cutscenes from tv and i have to wait like 5 years before i can buy ps2 just to play ffx and see tidus yuna getting romantic is the best feeling i can hope for yup yunie is the best p actually sorry to correct but in kh2 with sora and kairi being 15 riku is 16 ffx2 softcore porn ashe fuck yeah i whole heartedly agree broskies except for the yuffie part i rather liked her character but rydia is still number 1 why does no one give paine any loves hey wheres fang lightning is hot lightning is a fucking gorila now serah she looks more like a girl rydia will forever remain the perfect combination of cute beauty and sexy all in one green package mjrn ff12 frans sister is pretty cute too as is ff4ays mystery girl final note i cried when aerith died i really did tears of joy i was so glad i didnt have to put up with her useless ass and her limit didnt save her from this fate the only thing sephiroth did right and did cool was killing off that waste of space maybe he could have spared some time to end yuffie too i was starting to wonder when you would pick yuna but as number 1 oh yeah great choice dude but you should have put more ffx scenes than ffx2 great video btw can you ask you brother the title of the vid please and where to download you can send me a private message if you want or you could just reply to this comment to give others something to watch xd whats wrong with poram i stopped at poram good day im gay this doesnt really matter to meand rikku is 17 in 10 interesting choices most of the people i know think the people you picked are bitches what about fangdid i miss her or something that accent has to win her some points id put her top id bang her column yuna serah and kairi on there all sweet d well put together and finally someone else gets way i only play female characters i had a crush on garnet when i was young haha as much as i hate to admit this but if it has a smooth gate with two stepping stonesmeaning their butt to lead us men in palmslams desk guilty love your videos man keep em coming fair list i think all of them are equally beautifulbut seriously tifa is the best if you dont mind how about having someone you know make a guys list its only fair dat ashe d how could you miss agrias oaks or stella huh of his own feelings while trying to move on from his own mothers death didyouknowgaming also she was always meant to die i thought it may be the wrong decision but the fact that so many people refuse to accept the fact that she has passed proves that we made the right decision tetsuya nomura aeris creator honestly i dont know a single person who didnt either shed a tear or get pissed at sephiroth for what he did i hope that youll be able to read this love your videos darkkefka 534 why did aeris die during the development of final fantasy vii series creator hironobu sakaguchis mother had passed away tragically and at the time sakaguchi wanted to tell a story that showed that just because someone had passed away doesnt mean that they are gone he also wanted to display a realistic death rather then some kind of hollywoodstyle sacrificial death the way the team had to continue whilst dealing with aeris death was a reflection next comment lol ff12 is not shit that game is fucking awesome she is based on most peoples opinion not just look but if you play ff7 you will fall in love with her personality too now to burn geoffrey to the ground rubs hands what fuck geoffrey terras hair is canonically blonde the artworks of her were always blonde however the reason her hair was changed to green in ffvi was because she and celes were too similar and they had to distinguish her as the main character green hair made it easy for her to stand out since graphics have improved by now she can be painted blonde again she was also blone in the ffvi psone tech demo shell probably be blonde in the vi remake i still prefer terra to tifa thoughp but its all opinion i have to argue that kingdom hearts is not a final fantasy it may have final fantasy characters but is not classified as one to me elincia luciaalong with other fire emblem girls are the hottest ff cant compete but ill admit vanille tifa are perfection to our eyes you must be a way bigger fan than me not only did you make this video but you played through all the shitty final fantasies after 10 yes she is she is a bad ass soldier who is beautiful and then goes to become etros champion she is my number on 1 but with everything else i agree with you kefka go home your drunkgod please remove grammar nazis my number one is with out a doubt terra especially with green hair followed by a close vanille tifas tits were too much for this video i mean seriously theyre too big for the video lol this is a pretty funny video me personally would go with rikku always and forever as every number ever with lulu in a close second because she is a tease lol but based on your choices you would pick yuna which is cool good call on disqualifying tifa i want to bang alyssashes sexy shes a soldier dude u should have a kiss asses girl so u could put fang or paine in wow youre awesome dude you show me my fav shooting gameresident evil and u show 6 my fav re although i dont like ur list at all but why did u put lightning in the number 8 shes so goddamn hot beautiful and kiss ass love the list and the reasons very well done but i do have one grievance no paine she has that whole dominatrix thing going on mmmm mmmm she can tie me up and beat me with a leather strap any day ive never realised how ashe butt was that big s then again aqua is the tifa of kh so she wouldnt be in this list anyway lol sorry well any countdown usually contains spoilers you really shouldnt watch any of them if you dont something spoiled for you aqua again well ive seen her a few times i think id still like kairi better lol i hear gee nice song choice now remember people he cut tifa lockheart out cause it would have been unfair to the other women aka tifa would have won xp its clear this guy has not played kingdom hearts birth by sleep if he has kairi in his list well your personal taste sucks except 4 yuna yay lightning is number 1 you dont actually have to do it but thumbs up for dissidia hopefully we can get a dissidia 3 for ps vita or the next gen ps hopefully they put secret characters in it too like crono from chrono trigger or sora and riku from kingom hearts up nope tifa already won this thats why she was dissqualified take that wooot yuna 1 she is not only hot beautiful and cute she is also the bravest girl in all final fantasy in my opinion cool countdown and she beats tofa in my book penello is cute too bad story wise she sucks this guy is a fucking gineus when i sobbed during her haircut it wasnt because i understood the emotional significance of her action but because i really liked her with long hair d id put long haired garnet as 1 in beauty and short haired as 1 in cute such as the life of a ix fanboy as the video is called the minute 214 kindom hearts is not final fantasy fail so in technical termstifa wins the hottest final fantasy girl contest on the count that she was disqualified because she is so damn hot ashe had a best butt sure even her name was ashe spell ass you know what i mean d fair enough sorry but although this is good please please for the love of god put something to signify spoliers after seeing that with serah id rather not let others see the same fran is numbero uno d it might be a spoiler if he explained whyhow but opening cgi shows shes much older then she is when you meet her i got to completely agree on it its all down to personal preference like i prefer rinoa over tifa cause tifas too much about the chest area and no where else while rinoas straight up gorgeous hey anyone knows where is the scene of min 122 to 125 from for me they are only 3 lightning celes and terra not bad not bad i dont mind that yuna was your top i welcome it however i was expecting someone other than yuna for me yuna and tifa were the most well picked none the less great list lulu is the one for me dark sexy mysticand you just know theres a smokin hot body under that dress shes got on frans my second dat ass dat voice nuff said where is that cutscene of cain and cicely from is that a movie o 1430 thank you finally someone who understands great countdown you have great tastes my friend apparently both serah and lightning are on the list which i only expected one of them to be on the list not your listdarkkefka said everyone has their own lists which i agree with that statement terras hair were green in ffvi because she looked too much like celes on her artworks shes blonde and her dissidiamodel was inspired by her artworks no ultimecia id at least have her on the bang list this is outrageous anyway great job and yes we all have our own lists lol tifa disqualifiedwell if you like surprisessurei do understand the decisionshe also gets my vote for hottesti agree on lulu being hot alsoi like all about herso youre not alonebtw rosas boobs are averagenot bigumm man you just ruined ityou obviously have an issue with focusincluding kairi in this countdown awww you spoiled the spoiler for me thanks a lot jerk at least tifa outbecause if shes inthe other girl wont have a chance xd anybody agreed xd in her artwork she is depicted as blonde but her ingame sprite has green hair you should include spoiler tags you shouldnt just assume people are going to assume there are spoilers 1342 is a very recent spoiler and you just threw it in without warning my guess with terras hair change is green hairhalf esper and blondfull human darkkefka your videos are friggin hilarious man i love em 3 in beautifulhow many times must i see this do in the movie advent children after the fight with loz you can see tifas nipples through her top shirt no joke d any countdown about video game characters generally has spoilers about the characters in it you should only watch countdowns if you dont care about spoilers or if youve beaten the games in the series like me if you talk about aeris death then i am pretty sure even those who never play video games at all have heard about that scene countless times out of all the ff games i have got from ff 12456 on gba and ff 13 132 as well as the dissidia ff psp game and ff7 crisis core and the ff crystal chronicles game my fav girl from ff will be terra from ff6 i just find her character to be one of innocence as well as being powerful later on in the storyline im saying loli because of the 1 id tap that i mean nothing on her is arousing imo she looks like a little boyish girl i mean my rections to charaters by every 5 spot number 1s from first 3 list and number 5 1 in main list my rections to the number 1s from every 5 charaters yuel rection really really really sees caius really terra rection ok im cool with that by 83 alyssa rection the traitor that good for nothing bithcing traitor kairi rection kingdom hearts is not final fantasy just ff charaters are in it dosent mean it is a ff game jezus yuna rection thank god it wasnt someone i dont know yuna you are hot aawweessoommee said in the way the miz from wwe says it the movie will surly contain spoilers man aerith over terra say i aerith particularly in ac runs the beauty world this whole video i was thinking in my mind i swear to god if yuna isnt in the top 10 overall im going to find this dudes ass and beat him with fluffy the slug but then she was number 1 overall and i cried tears of joy and went and showered or some shit good pick on that 1 girl i wish she was real i agree this is sexist as fuck thanks a lot for the spoiler at 510 everybody downvote this guy i would bang fang rather than alyssa shes just a skinny short blonde not my type anyway ok ok i wasnt gonna leave my comment on this one but what the hell yea where is kh3 doin shitty games all over the place and forgetting that one i want my keyblade now god dammit btw i never knew that were a new version of ff4 with nice fmvs one of my favourites i knew that rydia would be hot when she grew up the disqualification of tifa was hilarious sorry babe your just too hot yuna in top 1 great top 5 hot lost 5 aeris english version of her name 4garnet 3 lulu 2 vanille 1 fang thats not to say thats the order for my favourite characters though vanille can be very annoying personally i think that lulu should be 1 on all the lists but thats just me yeah i bang yuffiejust putting that out there oh i was so upset that yuna wasnt in any tops of cuteness beauty etc but when i saw the last one i was about to die because of justice youre right im still playing ffx and ffx2 because of her i literally agreed with your entire list but i think that you should have made rikku 1 and moved everyone else back one spot animated is better then the real thing i agree 100 this is a fictional list for shitsakes all these people giving the guy shit you do realise you have a choice to click on the video or not take your shitty opinions somewhere else lightning and fang are the hottest two girls i was sad to not see celes in here but like you said everyone has their own opinions i knew itwell she looks nothing like she originally doesatleast in the yuffie hentaii havent watched but darkkefka put a part in a video she looks like her i was wondering when somebody would notice thisyou naughty boy i agree that there is a difference between cute beautiful and sexy and squall ignored quistis because she is annoying as fuck and im glad aerith was killed she tried to steal cloud from tifa aerith has zack who is dead let the dead be together and i think yuffie has a better butt than ashe and rikku is hotter than yuna yunas annoying but tifa is the undisputed queen i agree with most of this list but if you where gonna put a kh girl on it i think you forgot aqua oh yeah yeul is supposed to come back if i remember right darkkefka i need to know what a good point in lvls would be good for ur tower sry but i gots to go kill ya ff6 in case someone never seen it this video is amazing you sir have good taste for ours are similar could not stop looking at ashe lulu and rikku woot beatrix from ff9 is underrated imo but its urs for once i agree with your list yuna is my number 1 and i would bang her too she would make one hot girlfriend celes was always one of my favorites 108 this is from no ff gameis this fromwhere the fuck is this from i think he hates minerva so fucking much for being a super hard boss in ccabout stella he has seen little to no images of her and albawellshe is a palom clone 1st 2nd he hasnt played dimensions and she is really obscure for me number 1 on cute list is serah faron from ff xiii2 actually all of them are damn hot tiffa is d cutest lulu is the sexiest nice to finally see some love for cosmos shes gorgeous and deserves to be on the beautiful list spoiler alert lady ashes butt begs for that nutt terra morphs played 36 kefka is the hottest girl end rinoa and yuna are my favs 33 kauri doesnt count kingdom hearts is its own thing with ff cameos as for terra her hair in artwork was blonde but her ff6 sprite had green hair garnet rikku lulu and lightning are the hottest ff girls imo how the hell is serah on the list before lighting damn straight hottest girl in all of ff is cloud firstmy skin color doesnt decide what i should do secondyou clicked on the videoso youre not doing a good job at defending yourself after giving a lot of consideration and my biases aside i actually commend these choices good job and you good sir are a racist its eye candy its not weird at all now if you tried to say marry these girls then youre weird i woulda put rikku as number one but thats just me never really liked yuna but hey to each his own i dont know but if we work together we can get it there hahahah great video we have the same taste of woman d and yeah i always choose womans in my gameplay hahahahaha the number 1 is ok but what the fuck putting serah on number 4 shit but seriuosly yuna is a good choice unless i downloaded her video of the last mission and i didnt knew it was hentai hey kefka has you ever played shadow hearts i agree that tifa are all fanboys favorite but seraouly why isnt lighting in the top 5 but still tidus is a lucky basterd with yuna what you said about porom was hilariousi dont think tifa is that hot though wellyoure here first offyou are a racist2nd why would it matter3rd then why the fuck would you watch this if you find it disgusting oh that changes everythingi think tifa is a goddess tomorrow why kefka sorry but i really want to see your next ff7 episode peace shivers i forgot about that one how about all the normal human male and female characters are beautiful you just made a huge mistakedont you forget about the heshei mean quina if this is how you feeltell me somethingwhy the hell did you click on the video what does this say about yourself then why are there millions of ff characters in it at least you said tifa is hottest she is my fave she is pretty im a girl and she kicks ass fang is no where you got to be kidding me good best ff girls on youtube either way you covered my favorites unlike some peoples list fran vanille labro i agree with almost all of this only that rydia and lightning should be higher on the list is all but hey presonal preference as you stated ps yuna as no1 i cannot complain at all yuna 1 totally agree subscribed all the ff characters are pretty beautiful fell out of my chair laughing when you came to fran duh kingdom hearts is not final fantasy nooo way haha the intro dude the second problem where you state that you love all of them kudos to you brother also have a think about aeris she is one classy ass lady 3 wtf seriously not only there are some underage girls all girls here are fictional man im sure any kid without girlfriend will bang all girls here if they existed but only option they have is to masbate how sick people can get nobody cares rainbows for adding kingdom hearts into a final fantasy countdown do not even consider yourself a fan of final fantasy put your stupid comments in your pockets the room 100000 agree brother yuna ofc the rest i cant pick the best ones for me are by far serah yuna and garnet ehtifas overrated the moment what can i do for you came on i was hell yahi totaly agree with your list top to bottom only objection terra shoud have been on main thats all and that is comeing from someone playing 99 percent of all final fantasy games i agree a lot especially on jill nabaat damn this guy is hilarious cool vid not that kairi aint good and with the fact shes got a keyblade and is going to begin training shell be there and great but she needs time to shall we say mature yo dk i like yo list but imma have to say namine xion or aqua are better than kairi both in personality looks and what they do also larxene for an honorable mention on the ones you would bang she is the savage nymph and the manga had her reading the book about sadism so you know them pink fuzzy handcuffs are going to good use very hard how is this not a top comment yet i couldnt stand x2 rikku in x she was smart and hot in x2 she was dumb as hell and almost naked doesnt quite make up for her decrease in brains i agree with absolutely everything but how hard was it to leave lenne out i know shes only there for very small clips of x2 but she is so hot great vid dk d good vid dude i agree with tifa being pulled out lol i knew number one would be yuna aqua is hotter than kairi played kh bbs yet id totally bang her ass d he said it in the beginning cuz she was too hot for the list and its obvious shes number 1 check out 113 man if you put kairi in this you should put aqua in it somewhere or replace kairi i think aqua is the sexiest kh character created but good job though i enjoyed this vid sadly i havent played enough of these games to know most of these girls so i dont disagree with anything nice to see some of the 16bit characters getting updated looks 3drl girls are just jealous haters gonna hate shelke from ff7 especially dirge of cerberus glad ashe is number 3 or as i like to call her princess asselia buttnargin datassca ladys better watch out for this ladys man are you a magnet do you get girls pulled to your hips oh boy alot of guys and girls dont like seeing female charaters pulled off this way but these charaters are made for people like you im glad i like the charaters as they are as a person and not layed material it counts for a cameo and thats about it to each their own i suppose what abotu espada 3 haibel to lazy to check if i spelt that right tifa lockhart enough said yepi agree yuna is the bestd wow sexy pixels some people who never even talked to a girl need to get laid dat ashe that is a crap list boo hottest of them all is serah no doubt about it but i know thats just your opinion so fair enough these final fantasy girls should have their own girl group featuring 10 members singing and dancing like girls generation or akb48 they should call them fantasy girls agree with most not sure why rikku wasnt higher up though strangely enough i could agree with most of your picks i will never understand the overwhelming attraction to yuna though not really a fan of heterochromia not really big on the summoner role maybe because i never played ff4 shes a good character who has some charm and i prefer chicks with short hair but i just dont get why everyones so crazy about her i wouldnt even look at her if she was in the same room with diver or gyaru rikku im happy that youre not a vanille hater d lulu has the sharingan in her left eye holy crap i never knew alyssa was so sexy till i watch this video lol thats a tough one watch i again why isnt rosa on this list i dont mind watching your videos but you shouldnt have spoilers i didnt forget the evil ones nabaat is in there yunalesca cloud of darkness ultmeciathey all scare the hell out of me i almost added yunelesca though not a bad list but i think its lacking due to only using heroines i mean cloud of darkness ultimecia yunalesca sexy absolutely sexy and evil mmmmhhh oh and i love you for putting vanille on 2 she is my favourite of all games and i am happy someone else sees it at least98 like i do xd i can respect that list it looks completely legit still you had me laughing when you said tifa is disqualified for being a pro but i feel the same tifa all the way for the tinaterras hair is actually a strange one her original concept was as a blonde but due to sprite color limitations putting a sprite of blonde on her hair would have made her skin and hair color mix if they tried a stronger color it would be practicaly celes her name change was because the name was suposed to sound mystic and tina sounds normal in this parts oposed to there and they returned her hair to original in dissidia because they were based on amanos original concepts i dunno dk fang has her own kind of appeal 3 personally i root for vanille and fang but i understand you want her to yourself x3 im sorry but i could never consider kingdom hearts a final fantasy game yes it has characters from ff but it doesnt revolve around them same developer different series of gamesdang final fantasy has over 30 titles anywayseriously google it you guys can be hating but im just stating my opinion and thats all i have to say didnt understand much about what you said especially when you screamed but i liked the video wow our opinions on tiffa and rikku are the same lol tifa is the most sexy but i would pick rikku over everything kingdom hearts 3 is on nintendo 3ds alyssa kind of looks like a combo between tidus and rikku you read my mind dk kh3 should just be sora with roxas riku as teammates thatd be too badass thanks selphie would have been 6whic is the honor mention i realize this is about hottest chicks but seriously kh3 needs it to where you can have sora in your party duh and freely pick 2 main characters for your party kairi riku mickey axel donald goofy for any world not be limited to only donald and goofy and only trade them for that one character that is never worth it that dance video with tifa do you know where i can find it i think you should have made a top 5 girls based on personality too and if possible can you make a top 10 most hated characters or something in the future that might be fun xd kh3 will take looonnggeeerrrr to be made than duke nukem forever i agree with nabaat being one of the girls in that id bang her category there is just something about sexy bookworm chicks with a living breathing true playboy bunny you should do top 10 male heroes or something like that i kinda hoped rikku would be number 1 on each list but oh well i guess every other girl in final fantasy has to have a chance lol yuna i knew it wheres aqua from bbs shes pretty hot i agree with u 100 my favorites are terra rydia and ashe and serah is good but i hate terra is not tha bad but i dont like it so serahgarnet d lol when you picked kairi i saw the cutscene and i thought you picked riku xd will you make a video introducing ffx hd when it comes out oh hell yeah alyssa my dream girl haha im so in love with that girl thank god yuna was number one because i was going to be pretty annoyed if she wasnt good count down dk saw that coming from a mile away whenever my brother came ini always changed characters just so he couldnt see fran and start picking on mejerk sorry dk but rikku and vanille will always be top of the main list for me yuna def belongs in there but shell never be my top agreed with all except alyssa we still might have to fight for rikku dk alyssa omg she is extremely hot i was surprised to see her here great taste dk surprised at number 1 too but i thought ashe would rank higher i was surprised not to see selphie on the cute list but i have to agree with you for almost everything else except for garnet because i never played 9 and i havent watched your lp yet lmao its on my list after 6 i really like that one i really enjoy these top 10s they are awesome id say serahterrahgarnet but i had garnet on the overall list as well nice but garnet is most beutyful just too many to chose from this top ten was very hard to make from 5 to 1 on the last countdown tottaly agree with you good vid i dunno personally i prefer rinoa p no joke seriously i prefer rinoa d just my opinion d because youre tier 0 we already know youre the hottest and then there would be no reason to watch the video not enough good fmv of them i know that but we can consider it a ff game honestly i love yuna i agree that tidus is one lucky sob tifa ill admit is hot but for some reason i like yuna more i cant exactly explain it oh well great list dk its a shame you couldnt include people like fang and celeste oh well cant have them all nice list but rikku will always be number 1 with me and no fang anywhere i am dissapoint great list although i wish we got a little more fang p youre overrated xd 0540 one of the producers had a family loss and thought something of the sort would bring humanity to the game well done great number one nice list by elimination of tifa i guess i could say yuna is 1 but rikku is my 2nd lightning is always always my favorite srry but tifa will always be my 1 kingdom hearts is not a final fantasy game they may be created by the same company but kingdom hearts is a game on its own kairi may be super beautiful but she shouldnt be in a list that emphasizes final fantasy girls sephiroth is a hidden ultimate boss in both games thats good enough for me that and aerith is alive in them that has to count for something i was expecting to see one of the girl of final fantasy 5 and i was really surprise to not see one of them anyway like you said its your opinion yeah she doesnt play videogames some people do considering all the ff characters nd elements what speak for yourself man i have never once thought of kh as an ff game especially with the extreme disney to final fantasy character ratio 625 no goddess is more beautiful than belldandy hell ditto yeah picking girls so as to not stare at mens behinds agreed that would surprise me i must say for all intents and purposes she looks like an anthropomorphic rabbit which is one of the last things i would consider arousing not to diminish her as a character i know thats not what she is within the context of the game but it doesnt change the fact good calls on almost all accounts only reason its not perfect is cause im not a butt guy with franthe only thing people think about is sex i dont and fran seriously okay list otherwise lol thought you were actually joking about this video and you actually made it maybei might have ranked her higher if she wore more feminine clothingshes a soldier lightning is so low ranked d mother of god dk we all consdier kh a ff game so i put kairi in there you mean gothic oh lord you are into loli for sure fun to watch as always good work dk well if i ever get a girlfriend who shares my hobby ill let her give her opinions on the guys while i do the editing should i put a spoliers note on the video want more badass female fighters oh also loled at who i want to bang i also have to say i know im in the majority but the ending to ff 132 was fcking terrible how do you end a game like that now im cringing at them making a third one there is no point they never should of made a sequel and just left the first game as is it had a nice ending why make a sequel just to fck everything up ff x2 had yuna get tidus back 132 just destroyed the world killed serah and had i said i thought tifa or vanielle would be number one on your list was really suprised it was una i was also suprised kairi was on there too but i see your point ha you said where the hell is kh 3 they keep pushing the game off that i will be suprised if we ever get it they would rather make halfassed inbetween games then just making the third game never thought back in 06 this many years would pass without a third game if it ever comes out it will be great hope for more aqua i lol i just laughed my way through this list lolololl but so many spoilers man you need to give warnings at least i played all of these games so im fine why did you bring up ff132 ending again im gonn cry i still need to play docbut yeahshe looks great in that one lol nothing man just going big eyes for all the gorgeous ff women thanks i tried my best to make this video without offending any ladies watching this 20s she jumps up to the top 3 i agree completely with you here id just move around the girls p and i was a bit surprised you put kairi here but you are right she is very pretty and is just 15 imagine when she is in her early 20s yuna at number one wasnt expecting that anyway love your lists and cant wait for the next one i know this is geared towards guys lol but i really love your ff top 10 lists and i love me some finfal fantasy and i really enjoyed this was loling hard over ashe with sir mix a lot and the way you did the list some of the things you said in the whole video made me lmao even though rikku is your alltime fave i knew she wouldnt be number one cause its too obvious i thought you were going to have either tifa or vanielle as number one suprised you dqed tifa i was suprised you had omg darkkefka i was money on some of the guess its funny we think alike i was right on 1 beautiful terra 7 lightning 4 serah and i was fucking on dot 1 yuna lol my man nice video after all these years alyssa made the listnice when ever they announce the next hd remix they will include kingdom hearts 2 final mix we can wait and see and yes i would band yuffie in advent children and more so in dirge of cerberus cissineis real name is shuriken female in the game where you play as the turks you get to name her that is why her name is never specified in this crisis core hope this helps cool what about kingdom hearts 2 final mix pcsx2 solves that problem for now vanille and rikku are my favourites minus tifa of course kingdom hearts hd 15 remix has kingdom hearts final mix kingdom hearts re chain if memories and kingdom hearts 3582 days and it is no rumor i will when it comes to ps3 she obviously wants to do ya what the hell is wrong with ya man 5 beautiful lol loved that line the way you said it kefka that was great do a walktourgh on kingdom hearts 2 or 1 ass she ashe its a rumor on the final mix partim hoping for the same reason why i perfer original rikku over x2 rikkubecause in the original game they where both cutebeautiful without coming off as sluts good pointand her figure in cc is pretty good your jokes i believe youve come a long way ill certainly stay tuned for your future uploads darkkefkayou are cool in my book i agreed with you till you got to 2 people aerith and kairi i was ify on serah but to me shes more cute but thats just me man i mean it might just be me but aerith kairi and serah are my annoying characters in the game but i give serah props because she did make me cry at the end of 132 im just saying there is one on the psp as well hell ff4 has been remade for just about everything i like the list you really put a lot of effort on it and seeing lighting on the list wow and kingdom hearts is coming to the ps3 with final mix making a debut for the first time aeris is my favorite girl cause shes powerful kind and beautiful without coming across as a hore i know you probably got this answer but the reason why terra had a difference in appearance is remarkably simple they wanted to keep her exotic feel intact in japan terra is known as tina and has blonde hair which was exotic back then to keep that feeling for when it was localized her name was changed to terra and they gave her green hair not really lol wait why wasnt fang on here whoa just what i wanted finally someone as crazy as me theres also a psp port which includes the after years but im pretty sure it reverts back to the 2d graphics of the original havent actually played yet so not entirely certain how about a top 10 list of most hated ff characters there is also the complete collection on the playstation network i knew you were gonna pick yuna as top overall shes one of my top babes in the ff series lightning goddess outfit for the win great video sir also when lightning returns133 comes out will you do a walk through like you did with 132 and lastly do you think versus will be for the ps4 just type rwby red and white trailers never mind ill post the links just samus in general i love her strength determination and well yeah her looks i just ignore other m i died so many times in this video from laughing too hard great vid dk xd true that i am a man and id much rather see te female than male i suppose as you said everyone has their own opinion everything else i had to agree on especially the id bang it list i have to disagree with you on the tiffa thing i personally thing samus is the defacto video game babe gee gee d ok you are even more awesome dk what console is ff4 remake on yay he included cissnei shes not into it too bad if you pay attention to lebreau in combat if she uses a potion she pulls it out of her clevage haha dont think it would work whats wrong maybe you can get her to cosplay the reason for the disconnect between terras hair is because of the concept art if i remember correctly her concept art her hair was green but they made it blue in the final productor was it the other way around havent touched 6 yet shes okbut we reallt dont see enough enough of her in fmv i wanted to include her toobut i didnt have room no celes i would have assumed she has the figure that you are looking for not to mention the cut scene of her at the opera house most beautiful ff girl for me is aerith i actually know a girl that looks like her except she has freckles and blue eyes instead of green now that i think about it all i wanted to see in this list were porom garnet and kairiok not really but only cause i thought you were using only ff girlsbut nowi am in fucking love with that stella chick btw monty oums dead fantasy is awesome and his newest project rwby is looking good cant wait for the third trailer so you finally did it p i agree with your list 100 and you have made me look at certain final fantasy characters in a whole new way thanks darkkefka serah is after reconsideringbut garnet is right behind her and terra stella i havent seen to much of her but i think shes beautiful yeah use to drop f bombs a lot in my past videos ill work on this hope youre not offened by this video nikkiethis video is really for us guys thanks for not going super pervert on us dkporom is really awsome but i prefer leonora a liiiiiiitttleeee bit morewhile she looks like she is younger than palom and poromshe is older than themplastic surgeries1 more thingif you choose from every ff gamethen where the fuck is that chick we see in every ff versus 13 traileri think her name is stella either way she is hotshe is likeinsert horrible hot pun hereoh and 1 more thingyou said that garnet is the most beautiful i like your sense of humor youre not trying too hard be comical youre joke make complete sense you dont overuse profanity our world needs more natural comedians like you your personal beauty contest has begun yeah i heard its final mix i hope soi want to fight xemnas in kh1 with regards to kingdom hearts they are doing a 15 hd remix with kh1 khcom and other stuff i think for the ps3 in autumn always remember the golden rule of final fantasy babes these are girls you may want to fuck but you definitely dont want to fuck with them great job dk i wanna see some more top 10 ffs so keep up the good worl p trust methis was hardi spent a week deciding the lineup i love rikku but there are betterlooking girls shes still my overall favorite what girlfriendwife orihemi and adult nel after themits the vice captain of squad she my favorite but there are hotter girls i love rikku for more reasons than her looks well wakka did bang lulu so hes the lucky one i know somebody was going to chew me out on beatrix top 10 hottest bleach girls maybe but the thing is95 of the people who click on the video will expect her to be number 1 and yeahi truly beleive she is tier 0 beatrix has big boobsthats about it selphies cute but the others are cutier sorry but i think shes a little manly what about fang before watching the vid 1 is gonna be rikku of course after what she didnt have a good fmvbut i thought about her isnt tifa being the queen of video game babes a matter of opinion as well i dont find her very attractive personally he already did its on his channel right now i dont wanna look at this i dont either but its for entire different reasons p darkkefka can you do a lets play on ff x2 criesfinallyfinally someone who understands the joy of female characters that was a pretty funny video viewer responses cute 1 dude you and me sync when it comes to yeul like even though she has those unfortunate things and qualities about her shes mad cute to me beautiful 1 totally agreed as well on terra id bang 1 god alyssa that walk that walk mmph 3 hottest 6 btw rikku is my favorite toojust being honest hottest 1 yuna yes i wanna be tidus for real shes allinall girl youd wanna marry sorry for spoiler alert but man cant believe rikku wasnt number one i kinda understand though if you out her as one the true number one wouldnt be a surprise and boy it was d im glad you made minisections and i love you called one id bang her xd you are hilarious dk you never fail to make me laugh you know people have went to jail for having cartoon child porn i wouldnt be surprised one thing im sure of in this world is that its rotten to the core hell you cant even tell a girl she is cute if your at your job without risk of consequences maybe its just me but you seem to have these kinds of problems more often now dont you i havent watched the whole video yet but i think rikku should be 1st if you ask me heres the countdown youve been waiting for i listed nearly every hot ff girl in how i believe they rank i might have missed a few of them before i havent played all spinoffs i tried my best to make everybody happy anywayenjoy the videoand let the debating begin you think this is crazy im playing five games at the same time right now httpswwwtwitchtvfinotaisen mankind was not meant to have this much gacha i kept clicking your video thinking it was my emulator the ultimate money the wasting dude u need tto relax ur brain otherwise it be overflow another one lost to the gacha godswe are so few now your luck is split by 4 ascended congrats on archuria xd rip the caenis dream gacha no fap on na doesnt mean that fino will save on everything else one more the words of the man who got devoured by the gacha fino im away for a few weeks and then this is the kind of stuff i see you doing what happened quad gacha quad the fun gz on squirtle and on whoever else you got cuz i have no idea about any of the other games p ssr in all the games except in fgo seems legit now this is what i call a roll stream this is definitely unhealthy s t o p when you cant beatem joinem and joinem and joinem and joinem this cant be healthy god please help this man for he has been devoured by gacha this is what insanity is like succubus one is like from kyonyu fantasy i got 100 on that fight scene the first time i played through but then never could get it again for me this is the only game which i prefer the german version d all those diffrent characters have a unique accent like cinna the guy with the hammer and the beard right he talks like a fuckin bavarian its so hilarious i get so happy when this channel plays final fantasy games theres no way this cid rant doesnt become a gr cartoon my fourth favorite game in the series i love it btw i wonder if cidney breathes through her skin yay final fantasy 9 this was one of my favourite childhood games i love it i totally want to watch you guys play the average everyday adventures of samantha brown its an interesting game about social anxiety and it has a kinda quirky style that i think youd find interesting the more belts the better lulus belts were the shit why didnt they hire you to design cid someone draw this amazing character design for them please what you said about the gay marriage thing was the exact reaction that i got from people who were so adamant about vanille and fang not being lesbians in final fantasy xiii i was like i would be so up for a stream of this your youtube stream of final fantasy 12 was the best i played this for the first time like a year ago and i think its the best one ive seen so far i mean ive played ff4american release is ff3 or whatever the one with cecil and it was alright for an oldschool ff but wow that one was grindy as balls this one really caught my eye with how it looked and how fun it was kind of reminded me of chrono trigger battles in that they arent really confusing or hard but they are still engaging 9 was my first and i will always have a soft spot for it 3 it kind of feels like a final fantasy since a lot of ff games were pretty scifi rather than oldschool fantasy this game was the first one i played and finished way back when so much nostalgia and goosebumps youre absolutely right i dont care that the new ff15 has an all male player cast the problem is that they all look the same like theyre the backstreet boys wearing all black like why this and now not even the sexy girl character looks ridiculous fuck that 2910 i remember getting all of 100 to like it but the queen was not impressed i had yelled out like maximus did in gladiator my favorite of all the final fantasy im playing ff13 and as much as i really really love it there arent enough belts i almost always play on easy i know what im about son im here to kick ass and have a good time not to fight the same boss 5 times its not challenging its annoying 1300 when youre nonbinary like moi evrything is gay imma redesign new cid she derves better i only accept slutty video game outfits if it super duper over the top miss me with that vanilla fake gamer boi shit adding belts and gears on the nips would be a epic but how about a belt tube top or belt suspenders with gear shaped areolas showing either way there needs to be art of this what are you talking about quite is awesome i completely agree with you about the easy mode god mode do a full lets play please im down for stacy cosplaying fran this is the right thing p game can be beat within 3040 hours if you use the cheats and focus on main stuff hey it has a fast forward function and instawin fights basically you can do this d oh no not just a quick look seriously this was one of my favorite if not my favorite game of childhood you cant just stop there yes make the final fantasy girl outfits more fantastic i expect more too thank you for the playthrough brought back good memories nipple gears sound painful im seriously feeling this character design you two have developed for cidney haha meanwhile in scuareenix developer taking notes at least seven belts gears on the nipples and an eyepatch that is actually a clock that actually is a telescope eye gotcha pd full gameplay please i completed this ff last year and i think its really good in cinematics and story but i dont really fit with the characters development during the narrative i like more ff tactics or crystal chronicles they got really adult sense in someway full lets play edit awh nevermind final fantasy ix is so good replayed it recently and it was even better playing it this time than when i was a kid favorite game of all time they have nothing to prove sums up my life in one sentence i remember not finishing this game my favorite were 8 and 10 and 102 and 6 for the snes was awesome planning on getting a ps 4 this year just to play 15 this is my favorite final fantasy game 0 idc if a lot of people didnt like it i never seen a lets play of this with a good youtuber that i like remember how tvs used to be like 1p fallsover dies this was the first final fantasy that id ever played and i remember how epic it was it came with like 4 discs for the playstation and i thought that made it even more epic lol lol ok mari would this design make u feel better if they did it 3 black heavy boots belts on both legs going from ankle to knees under them black pants tight because its slutty p her right or left arm its a steampunk arm always showing im thinking a clock necklace because fck you thats why xd than a red bandanna and clockwork goggle on her head or around her neck it would have constantly moving parts with 3 eye glass pieces for one eye and a gear for the other o oh n her weapon a giant freaking rench xd lol jk the ffxv designs are so boring all around xd lol so we need a lady mechanic who dresses like lulu like 20 belts n clockwork everywhere man i love this game that intro song hits all the sweet spots in my brain i never knew you lived so far away from each other i always assumes you were at least neighbours wow if thats the case youre nailing this whole letsplay business good job gals best music in any video game yay d a quick look one step closer to a ff10 lets play you should try xenogears next its another ps1 game it has an awesome story and a cool battle system one of the major miltary powers is run by an immortal queen and the other major miltary power has 4 female elite fighters each representing a different elelment also giant robots do a full lets play please i love love loooove nobuo uematsus music in all the ffs and it certainly contributes to the magic o m g they fucking changed how the little girl at 1340 not cool 0806 some one should get to this fan art the way mari and stacy describe fuck yeahhh my favorite ff game tq very much tt best final fantasy game motherfuckers so what i got from this conversation it is ok to put video game women in sexy outfits as long as they have an eye patch and hundred belts ffxvs character designs overall are pretty boring every character looks like theyre from a bad anime cid wtf did i hear just now lol i really hope someone draws cid the way she should have been designed omg this is my favourite game of all time isnt cid called sydney now or something because a bunch of manchildren were angry that a lady dared to take on the name of cid hi am i first im currently playing this with the characters speaking in jp and holy hell the tearoom and the voice of gwfhn are creepy i almost didnt buy this fantastic game bcz of bad reviewsi decided to give it a try and it is one of the best ff games ive played so far i thought that crystal bearers would have a chance for this game i mean layle keiss belle and jergran would be great heres the key use their annoyance to your advantage you can tell them to shutup disagree what they tell you by offering sarcasm or agreeing example hope esthiem ff lr its a pretty neat system lets player 1 no its not hope its stupid let me control the arc bhunivelze why did you choose hope lets player 2 i agree it is pretty neat and the mechanics are great because of such such and such rule 1 in entertainment dont admit your mistakes own the mistake to your advantage no wonder she looked so familiar oh my goodness the song is a remix from sigma harmonics another hamauzucomposed game gwfhn she sounds like one of the aeriths from kingdom hearts xd there was another

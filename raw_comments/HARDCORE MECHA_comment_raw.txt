is this only for pc cant find a us ps4 version they have it for the japanese digital download but i cant understand japanese to even try to purchase it from japanese account tried looking for uk version but didnt see any cant start the game its stuck at tilte screen with chinese text i have already install newest visual c like developer said but nothing happens i need this on ps4 west asap gundam wing knock off with boring game mechanics we actually have robots that can take shoves and not fall over now tired of these maggots of the gathering advertisements the league adverts are only further making me not want to play that game to boot i like me some big anime mecha wanderbot 2625 did anyone else hear that but think of the big anime titties meme tutorial power ranger mazinkaiser the campaing gundan this is so anime im all giddy this is instabuy for me if it gets ported to the switch in combat zone if you found an unknown affiliation battle mecha without a pilot the first thing youll want to do is either rig it with a trap or if not possible destroy the cockpit im very tempted to do that but i guess its impossible no we have 2 mechs one made by suidobashi heavy industries kuratas which is a highly advanced glorified paintball gun or bbgun the other one megabots inc with was designed as a battle bot here the match httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzoulx8q9um the million horsepower has gotta be an astroboy reference wondering why they changed it from code hardcore to hardcore mecha i see no reason in the change of the title the robots would look cooler if they didnt have over sized heads i thought you were going to reference the dragon star campaign stuff for dd not d20 modern i wish this game come to android so is this super robot wars the sidescroller because i kind of like the direction its going in anyone knows when this this drops in ps4 he used flesh body it was super effective oh and look for the trio of games gigantic army steel strider andarmed seven by nyu media anime giant robot platformshooters i cant reed this is a gundam game the game itself is fusion cod for cinematic metal slug for gameplay super robot wars well you know what i mean that got dark fast the tutorial awesome mecha action literally two seconds later warcrimes up the wazzoo that intro was on the same level as super robot wars but then started the real action hello wanderbots i noticed in an interview the creators of this game had toys from master made and where using some as reference points maybe that could be a stand in until a hardcore mecha toy is released i have the one named apollo and its a nice little shelf warmer and yes you will want to play with it enjoy your vids the actual toy is not cheap httpswwwlatendocomproductspoccstoyshardcoremechathunderboltalloyactionfigure6 the enemy mech design reminds me of the leos from gundam wing mechas thats totally zillas roar from the terrible 1998 american rip off godzilla 259 315 and 329 yknow whatd be cool if metallictron was available as a bonus character or even in a dlc based on his world edit its cycloptic not cycloptine i know its a nitpick just trying to give some knowledge where i can weighty groundbased limitedflying more rugged suits no gold head crests no childpilots well so far this style reminds me more of full metal panic than any of the gundamsand im totally onboard with that at first i thought this was a tenkai knights game this is anime god i love it its a picture of a ps4 controller but the prompt says press a although i want to want watch your lets play but the inner weaboo no joke wants experience this first hand so i hope u understand cool game but i am worry that this game is more center on multiplayer than single player game it seem that this game is quite short as far as i know while we do have a fair few big slow clunky exoskeleton suits ranging from something like the power loader from the alien series down to somewhat sleeker stuff still nowhere near the iron man level the big issue is that even these slow clumsy suits lack a power source suitable for a decent runtime the power loader equivalents looked at by the us military were typically designed to operate with a big cable connecting them to the aircraft carrier they were working aboard allowing one person to pick up missiles and bombs and attach them to fighters etc with speculative plans to convert them to onboard fuelbased generators like large walking militarystyle robots eg bigdog or the enemies in generation zero as technology matures smaller batterypowered stuff does exist mostly aimed at moderately increasing a persons safe lifting strength for civilian applications or a combination of military and civilian ones but it seems difficult balancing to prod so i just beat this game as im writing this and holy crap the final phase of that last boss is kickass not gonna say exactly what happens but i will say that yall are gonna love it wanderbot have you heard about the kirita mech its a japanese defense mech made with smile shot when you smile it shoots is that a megas xlr reference at first i was like ehh generic anime game hard pass then i saw giant mechs and the glorious smooth well animated art style then i saw the sidescrolling action then mech customization like this is battletech all the yes the only thing that could possible be better was if the game had randomly generated metroidvania style levels good good wander has findly play hardcore mecha mechs are cool just as a survey who has seen the megabots match and thought it was really cool this reminds me of games like rampage a game where you can level up mechas and have nice designswhere can i get the game so i can let it take my money yo it is out already im so buying this today definitely a super robot wars with a lil gundam sd in the mix here and there if you listen very closely you can hear the sound effects they use from mobile suit gundam the mechs looks like they could belong in a super robot war game but i just spend my money on muse dash darnit metal warriors is that you the tutorial bit is truly obnoxious hardcore mecha reminds me of old saturday morning cartoons where the worst thing was the cereal commercials does anyone know when this drops on the ps4 fantastic game but it is quite difficult at later levels enemies will attack you from every angle and some boss fights are really frustating ryusei jin ryosei jin which one is the real spelling when the opening scene is a super robot genre but the story is actually in a real robot genre narrative terroristo subtitle armed extremists 730 i just lost my shit when you looked at the dodge button in the tutorial for like 5 seconds then just dodged straight into it reminds me of srw but totally different playstyle im down for this im really digging the style of this game if you enjoyed the video dont forget to leave a likecomment subscribe for more i think this is mini version of gundam sd its quite good i guess hes just not familiar with the sd chibi design if youve ever played any of the super robot wars its basically a tradition fyi this game art direction is heavily inspired by a longrunning mech srpg series called super robot wars i think they did great job with their mech design compared to the original source nice content and covering lots of aspects that go into a game review watched the video and gave a thumbs up some feedback in the first part you are generally positive about the game like fast action graphics animations sounds music menus and ui and in the second half you are mostly negative about core game stuff giving a 355 or 65100 in the end first part really gives me the feeling you like the game then second half you basically say its boring most of the time and not rewarding and not really answering the question is it worth your time if i were to rate based on your review i would give 255 or 50100 and saying its not worth our time tnx zealwood im going to try this what i meant to say was poser krayziebuddha is so stupid how can he say no you dont know and then act like youre a man youre not a man youre a girl hes so dumb also i was fighting with somebody that was making fun of me or almost made fun of me now hes gone also i dont wanna answer you dumb question answer it yourself you know nothing i dont flip burgers i smash them i dont make youtube videos i burn them i also burn contents out of anybody that receives the most hate or complaint whining crying squealing and yelling oh that tears it theyve sorted things out or this day or this week make another hardcore mecha livestream again today the one fatal flaw of this game is not having a backdash or at least an enemy lockon it looks so wonky dodging by always turning away from the enemy awesome videogame i am a big fan of anime mecha robots still hoping vulphaes survived from the explosion well done i like how the transitions between boss fights matches the futuristic theme of the game wait is that larc from rising of shield hero spoiiler nancys phoenix frigate epic best way to play the controls are kinda tough on keyboard for me how does controller play feel does anyone knows when this will drop on ps4 art is superb gameplay looks boring gundam and point click shooter like 4635 oh my god they actually did it they went full anime boss list 0009 vulphaes 1 0312 yimeng 1 0537 yimeng 2 0927 vulphaes 2 1141 vulphaes 3 1518 ludde 2031 terrorist officer 2329 lucheni franz and elisabeth 2950 vulphaes 4 3447 cruzan 3753 laser machine 4007 xerxas final boss 5011 escape ship ending fan of gundam super robot wars and mech anime check out this link for more httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplcp8mddzivrxtlvkdpcpk7qauv7tu93lp its like they took super robot wars and made it into a side scroller reminds me a little of metal warriors for the super nintendo another game ruined by that horrible flashgame style maybe this will sate my mecha game itch while i wait for daemon x machina would love to have couchcoop campaign in this awesome i picked up the figure and was curious of its origins looks awesome cant wait to play it it comes but how soon i hope for a pc version ah so they looked at super robot wars and were like we can make this into an kick ass sidescroller o yes glad that theyre finally showing more stuff but they should really update the kickstarter whenever they release trailers or do anything that concerns the game i really hope this gets a physical release how hardcore is it though congrats on 1k i made a sims 4 with 8 people cause you can only have 18 in a house also i have the cats and dogs dlc so yeah only cats and dogs though theres no hamsters sadly does the controller not use both analog sticks thats a terrible setup if you cant change it lol i can tell how akward controlling the mech is from the video glad too see this game get coverage though its a real gem good video keep up with the good work yo congrats on 1k bro awesome gameplay love your videos also 1k celebration when hey doops congrats on 1k congrats on 1000 subscribers awesome video combo dropped a like for you bro congrats to you combo for hitting 1k to be completely honest i made it to the part in your persona 5 letsplay im late to the party i know where you start talking about gunpla and showing pictures of your collection including some rare ones like overman king gainer and what i believe to be one of volfoggs assistants either gundober or gunglue so i figured i would come here straight away to nerd out on a video that has more to do with robots than persona 5 i know what that guard wanted let me explain he wanted somebody to set up us the bomb 1456 ohhooh that looks just like the first boss in neir automata doesnt it hahha i actually recognized something edit antiaircraft mine i wasnt looking at the screen at that moment so i thought yeah that sounds about right for this translationlevel and then i thought about it for a second i really am astoundingly horrible with anything to do with munitions a weapon to surpass metal gear 249 dont gave me any back mouth boy cant wait 4 the ost looks cool reminds me of cybernatorassault suits valken but with more handdrawn cheap flash animation lol wish the animators in japan went back to the solid look to thier sprites from the 90s instead of the flat cardboard cut out look it only looks good when nintendo do it for yoshis island games i dont see it on my ps store wtf no commentary beautiful i thought the koitsumo thing was eluding to the his mech and the protag mech has something special about it like a ramda drive thing whooo you actually got it daymon thats so awesome man seriously this is the power of the internet at work ask loudly enough enough times in a row and youll get what youre after its actually legit inspiring take a shot everytime daymon offers rocketpunch games to retranslate their game reads videos description goddangit i made the joke too late god this games has so many typos still fun though 1056 yeah i dont really get why you say stuff like that about the audience mechs are always awesome whats the name of the song in this trailer i couldnt find it on the official soundtrack ive played it and it really is anime as fuck its basically an actionpacked version of a super robot wars og game any guesses when this will be added to the playstation store im really anxious to have this in my collection playing super robot wars v now and im on a mecha kick this would be cool to play before i start playing srw t when theyre fighting outside of the mechs they kinda remind me of metal slug so in the main campaign you can only use the one mech i am rather interested ill check it out as soon as i can put it in my cart look great i see 212 mech look like dea blanche but color like geant chevalier lul is there gonna be a physical version of this cant bloody wait theres only two games i bought at lunch kh3 and pokemom moonthis will be the third one soooo can we get a model kit of that space battleship super deformed art cancer this is the best official successor to assault suits valkencybernator and metal warriors srw og the action game editing on point guys i like but i dont have a playstation so i hope this will come to xbox one too yo whats the launch price gonna be again now the next wait for a physical release as well lol im hyped been waiting too long 5 more days launching on steam summer sale oof but i guess its better than holding off later on been waiting on this game for years now glad its finally getting released lol great job guys saw this game at pax east super excited will there be local coop im sort of angry that no one is talking about this gameno one i see a really small number of people making videos about it hell i cant even find a walkthrough with the bosses its a solid mecha game that is pretty much metal warriorsmetal slug successor i need this game tarethur looks familiar on a side note moody is terrible at exploration xd oh man you want to talk mecha tabletop systems am i your man ive foundplayed several i can even provide pdfs for some of them theres mekton zeta which has a pretty cool and extensive system for building mecha but its a little clunky in the weight of its systems like most of the be good at mech piloting abilities are really concentrated and theres a ton for out of mecha that arent really useful if youre running a mostly inmecha game theres also lancer which is still in development which has an interesting modular abstracted approach to weapons and systems never ran or played it sadly so i cant speak to how it feels in play buuuut since you mentioned 5e theres a 3rd party book dedicated entirely to mechs and vehicles in 5e its called the greasemonkeys handbook the easy device have made you complacent d you dont use your booster nearly enough i really want to play that samurai mecha tiny metal full metal rumble when are you going to play it 1627 he actually said gravity chains us the episode was tholian web of the original series they escaped the web by entering the dimensional hole that originally trapped the defiant tabletop rpg robotech for a mecha game when you fought inside the enemy compound and chased the convoy that had ayla fayes team was the one who held up the enemy forces so you could give chase when does nova drift come out on xbox one and ps4 did you know that two gundam games are going to be released in english the first one is a mobile game based off of the gundam breaker series called gundam battle gunpla warfare and the second one gundam battle operations 2 for the ps4 which is a gundam thirdperson shooter set in the uc timeline try red mech gundam wing and g gundam are more shonen anime than normal gundam series they also feature gundams that have the highest power ratings in most power metric reports even bandai says that when they include them in games and series with other series they have to use competitive metrics and not direct metrics that is each series has a key ms that all others are measured against and given a percentage value these values are used in place of the direct measure of power ratings edit also wing is hailed as horribly dubbed and the writing of the tv show was considered low caliber especially in japan the manga retelling and extended story is considered the definitive version of the story for most people this reminds me of earth dawn medabot was fun to bad it did not catch up very well here would love to play the english translation for the 3ds game the bots changed alot in later games i think the last i saw was dating sim girl team game that came out metal gear solid everyone you missed something inside the room before you climbed up to enter the facility the soldiers having a dialogue arent inside there which is misleading you can enter that room on the right at least before you attempt to climb up the facility i wish this was released on ps4 shel you are an amazing voice actor you make those characters ha wander you for got you had you heave vulcan cannon next mission try to use it great vid oh wait this is stage 21 and the episode is named 13 was that on purpose 2741 daymons expressive shouting right here makes me picture some omake for a serious mobilesuit series where theres a defect in the comms system so suddenly everyone can hear everyone else grunting and wailing and swearing during their epic giant robot space battle and its just really awkward on both sides so everyone agrees to call the battle a draw and go home and sit around awkwardly with thousand yard stares this idea is just so funny to me i made myself laugh really hard xd to be honest the thunderbolt kind of reminds me of the virgola from super robot wars z but that might just be because its another bluepurple real robot with glowing blue highlights and because it shares the same superdeformed style as srw thx for letting me know about this game bought it after 10 min of watching your vid broi was so hyped for this game to come out for years and it ends up being less than what it promised so thought the translation wpurposefully like that omg i cant throw m at the screen fast enough for this hearing them so happy makes me happy i didnt have any interest in watching this but its bsg so i gave it a shot i was 100 sold by minute three this looks so good that flashanimation is slick i can totally see what daymon means about the script being wonky apart from awkward phrasing theres omitos everywhere i cant getcha in touch with the developers unfortunately heres hoping your quest is successful oh hell yes this is great ive been wanting to play this awesome game too i think this is a great alternative to you playing a srw game is it only on pc why is tarethur the only one of the group with a name that sounds fitting to a japanese character not exactly a game i would pick up to play myself but im willing to watch someone else play it and who better to do an lp of a game involving robots than bsg ah yes back into his own domain holy crap this game looks awesome ive never really been interested in mecha stuff before but after this i might have to be mecha game exists bsg i am inevitable a mecha game i should have seen this coming are you completely fluent in japanese daymon how did you learn whats your story please play a super robot wars game on the channel i would legit squee the bsg and mecha name a more iconic duo ill wait girls frontline sure looks different from what i remember and here we can see wild bsg at their natural habitat if there is a switch version will be better so when will this come out in the us ill by a dozen and the figurines this is the kind of mecha action game ive been wanting for years gimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimme does anyone have recommendation game similar to this game i really hope this comes out this year in the us does it have local coop so are you ever gonna release this game or did your communist government seize your assets this looks cool worth a college try at least and keep it up guys1 finally its been too long since the last trailer get the sd round hammer already a very good sd figure with many way to pose and play with cant wait for the game and metal fig thunderbolt this gives me good front mission gun hazard vibes im in wonderful work bandai need to hire you guys to make an srw action game no objections very hyped for some reason good job on the editing department makes a film heart happy3 cant wait hey thats pretty good d the trailer alone threw left alive to the trash lol keep up the good work cant wait for release i missed you guys yes finally wait so is the game out yet or so regarding the replication of paintings for book covers if im remembering correctly they silkscreen print the covers thats how they reproduced color images before modern scanners and printers and so on the way of multiplying photographspaintings for print media was pretty much the same in the 70s as it is now largeprinting presses that use four sheets of metal into which a colour is applied paper is then pressed onto that sheet taking the color with it thats the reason you sometimes find prints with one colour misaligned and offset to a side the production of these print negatives was far more involved in the 70s though since you had to create a large enough plate and more or less hand stencil the points on the print sheet where colour should stick being careful not to scratch areas where you didnt want colour i think the how to train your dragon series is autobiography written by hiccup in the story at the end of the first book i think the old hiccup notices the broken spear which saved his life hanging on the wall as a souvenir the younger version of him was writing a guide on how to train dragons which included a dictionary of dragonese and an encyclopedia of the various dragons he met the second thing is after the little sister like character dies now the best friend brother like character dies next this is two time extremely hard sadness whith a why wander learn your norse mythology better its called yordenheim sound the name jordanheim is the correct name also also great video keep up the good work also cold u play more sea of solitude im the first comment for the first time could u like this comment wander i would appreciate it thanks thought it looked good but slightly familiar then i played it and the dev really likes assault suit leynos dont they because this is just leynos with gundams artstyle instead of votoms like same controls and everything except armor and weapons dont take up the same inventory slots and the melee has a lunge wanna know how the game is got cringy af nerds real robot most incarnations of gundam typically seen in a war setting a real robot could theoretically be mass produced and piloted by anyone they also run on more grounded power sources and use lasers and bullets as ammo super robots tend to be huge by comparison and powered by stuff like the power of friendship tend to have access to hammerspace giant swords rocket punches and chest or shoulder lasers are typical weapons employed by super robots most combining robots voltron power rangerssentai are super robots though their component robots might be considered real robots the first segment with the super robot is the tutorial as for evangelion gurrenlagann they are interesting in that they are often categorized wrong supertypes are oneoff or super limited in number usually because they rely upon some form of supertechnology to function evangelions are on the realistic side of supertypes gurrenlagann on the other hand all that seriess mecha are massproduced in some form despite their insane power this puts gunmen in the super side of realtypes think of it as related to that old saying any significantly advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic gurrenlaganns mecha simply derive theif power from its pilot and is only limited by their pilots power gurrenlagann being able to repair itself constantly produce its weapons is akin to an energy to matter system akin to star treks replicators they simply have such a high technology level available to them that it is possible to make use of that it also ties i f71 gcannon huh didnt know woolie hates moms you are quite literally the exact person i wanted to see play this ever since mecha week on sbfp this is going to make me just as giddy as when i immediately bought played and finished this gem feels like a lot of friction between woolie and minh here is minh an idiot this shit is not complicated the robot fight in the beginning was a show it was meant to trick the player thats it and the rest of the game is the gritty fast stuff i dont see how this is complicated a button action says combat lets go it was pretty cool to learn kageyama sang a song for saint seiya 800 this trevor belmont lookin motherfucker unrelated to this video but ive been avoiding your bloodstained vid to avoid spoilers before i play it myself and man it is hard all the warriors are here oh cool blue destiny epyon are on the cover some hardcore mecha multiplayer mechs are only unlocked through codes 47459814 thunderbolt paintball

isnt long but its a lot of fun crimson flame is my favorite from when i play too hes straightup just a grungust his rocket punch even animates the same i remember playing the very first backer demo a long time ago then getting a chance to play it again at pax im glad its finally out its a fun game for what its worth i actually liked the name code hardcore better but this is probably more marketable is it me or this looks and plays like a good flash game from like 2007 please play more sighs wallet already airborne damn it woolie minh are you a vietnamese the art style is all over the fucking board goes from scribblenaughts to armored core to fucking persona please tell me this is on console too 1500 is woolie friend minh like slow or just get the concept of plot setup 1851 woolie thats complete horseshit for a 50 cal there are plenty of videos on youtube disproving it glad to hear woolie preaching the gospel that real men ride each other spread the word my mecha brotherinarms metal warrior was soooo fun i played it at a friends house for one afternoon several years ago and havent been able to stop thinking about it is this on ps4 ill accept this as a suitable replacement over something like super robot wars o namco x capcomfor now as angry as minh is making people in this video at least he pointed out woolie had a lb on his controller at 4717 i have to say that opening was brilliant a 50 bmg can pass within an inch of your body without injuring you httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyrhpe5z93wm any word on when this comes to ps4 in english 1832 didnt mythbusters do an episode on 50 cal rounds and prove that the whole thing of rounds ripping arms off even if they missed was just a myth i friggin love this game but man i would personally love to clean up the translation jank plot dumps are the wrong way to tell a story i dont think there will ever be an lp that minh doesnt understand something and it makes me wonder does minh sandbag life or does life sandbag minh evas are real robots that become helicopter moms on heroin im not even sure you can classify unit01 through 03 since an evangelion is just a kaiju sized human covered in armorseals they also used the most fuckedup os in the history of anime gotta say i prefer reggie over minh i miss woolie and pat playthroughs the really funny thing about shinji in a super robot wars game is that any time they run an evangelion story event it usually takes a huge turnaround because unlike in nge shinji this time has a whole gaggle of hotblooded spikyhaired burning justice fire boys with thick sideburns and unbreakable morals to cheer him on its crazy to think that a story like nge which is infamous for deconstructing the blind paragon justice of robot shows suddenly gets turned on its head by reintroducing blind paragon justice to its characters woolie edgar is probably the second playable character for the multiplayer and morrison your boss is the one that gets killed and he probably gets nancy pregnant and you have to raise the child who holds a grudge against you for letting his father die or maybe looks up to you as a replacement father figure in any case edgar survives morrison dies is minh the pat of woolievs i wonder if he would want to become a toilet if it meant he could live forever when you call something hardcore mecha it just makes me think its porn im dissapointed 432 damn woolie shame on your ass evas are not robots 950 woolie most of the time thats just the first half before they get magical is there any word on when this will come to america on ps4 sold goodbye money hello sweet mecha game minh is tripling down on woolie after the 3rd birthday madness ive had super robot wars x for a while now on ps4 is this only on pc was i the only one who realized there were three people in the room thirteen minutes in matt pat liam are woolies bfz of the past minh reggie woolies bfz of the future and the future is now minh is on a new level of stupidity here this shit is real life son people die when they are killed stop letting minh on the mic looks like a modern front mission gun hazard one of my favourite squaresoft games on the snes chill out minh woolie in srw eva is placed with super robots did cranky construct work on this it reminds me of his animation style it was a message from rooster teeth it might be pretty important fucking how what could important from those hacks they know how to take something good and fucking ruin it is all i know that they have done of note anyone know anything about this coming out on euuk playstation network i can only find it on asian countries psn dont worry minh it confused me too this game makes me miss playing super robot wars so many good memories you know im just going to assume that because of minhs lack of experience with the different mecha genres themes and stories that he just have no reference to what woolies talking about and were all expecting waaaaay to much from him maybe if woolie explained it like its the difference between ninja scrolls and naruto and first they were showing up a light hearted episode of naruto but suddenly smack nope molten gold tomb thats the world were in right now mutherfucker time to buy more shit a youtuber recommended me by being really hype about it thanks you for bringing more cool mechs to my attention wools edit woolie discovers a mechanic thanks to reggie and forgets about it literally seconds later he is also instructed how to block bullets with his notat field and forgets about it by the time the boss shows up this mans memory is worse than arakis i swear woolie may not have liked ironblooded orphans but i hope he at least likes the barbatos designs anybody know if this is on ps4 in the us can only find listing for japan metal warriors was developed by lucasarts and published by konami so i will have to stop wactching the video go buy this finish it then come back and watch the rest so i cant find this on psn despite it being on it supposedly an update patch inserted an experimental control scheme that allows you to play the game like a twin stick shooter but i still like the original control cause the melee direction is still decided by the left analog stick also the game really wants you to dash a lot you can dash cancel melee attacks and its extremely crucial to do so it also helps to fire the vulcans while shooting at closemidrange enemies sorry wools did ur re2 playthrough die i was wanting to see this game be played 545 holy shit this is such a fucking awesome introduction aahh 1045 my god this game is awesome 4950 that track though goddamn i must play this full playthrough when i fucking knew woolie would play this i didnt even bother sending a tweet at him about it man this game looks sick whens the full lp put money on the table for edgars fate woolie the rank 8 multiplayer unlock is a mech with grappling hooks and pile bunkers 2619 bitch thats the cool guy of the shonen heroes and cool guys are destined to die and make us stronger through their sacrifices i still maintain that the best mecha soundtracks came from super robot wars steel beowulf is the fucking shit you know what wont be on this list genlock holy shit this game looks fun minh not understanding that the starting scene was a tv show and that it was used to show the difference between saturday morning cartoons and this universe hurts my brain it hurts a little that the multiplayer menu has ps4 controllers as examples but the game might be delayed for ps4 for up to 3 months i know its not the developers fault though and im looking forward to getting hands on it eventually im even in the game as a civilian somewhere wild i always dreamed that if i were to make my own game it would be something like this consider me awestruck im sorry but minh is fucking awful why couldnt have woolie gotten truongasm instead i was kinda hoping the game would focus a bit more on super robots as the flashy cheesy title screen chibi style and over the top designsfighting are super weird when in contrast to the grounded storytelling and drama i realize that gundam does more or less the same thing but still features more lively and original characters and robots im disappointed there are no jokes about woolie picking the boss character what a start i saw this game on an unprofessional fridays episode they could hardly have been more dismissive of it 2621 so what woolie is saying is trust no one not even your oc itachi evil keep watching the show woolie youre turning into pat now minhs gotta go sorry hes so painful minh seems like the kinda audience that prefers tell dont show and plot dumps directly spoken to the viewer i read hardcore mecha so i was expecting to see armored core videos 1830 your cousin has swindled you this is not how bullets work at worst shrapnel flying from the near point of impact may get you but no more than that in fact if the bullet is of sharp and noncrumbling variety ap rounds and such it will go right through with minimal damage due to not transferring impact energy 1915 theyve missed the screen of that intro 3125 no not picking up the item is not smart holy fuck yes mech content holy fuck no why did you pick minh for this but the robots do become fully proportioned in those srw gamesjust in the cutscenes and special moves for a brief moment b r e a k and r u s oh waitthis is day 1 footage pretwinstick patch ow minh never bring a gun to a fist fight japaneses voice acting oh no my hand is drifting to the exit button for some reason im not sure what they call it in japan in the west we call the mecha that are smaller than super robots but larger than power armor walking tanks chicken walkers and acpa assisted combat personnel armor see maximum metal high powered ordinance for cyberpunk 2020 thanks woolie i dont really care about mecha but i bought this because it looks hype as fuck theres also real robots that can transform into super robots in 3rd srw alpha one of the main protagonists have this robot the werkbau that is basically like an evagelion in the sense that this robot have like regular weapons and one special super attack and then transforms into the dis astranagant a super robot that get this is basically the representation of time and death in robot form in the srw universe is just nuts full lp or we riot minh is so frustrating to watch i love this channel and every thing woolie and reggie do but minh is so irritating listening to the theme song i keep expecting cha la head cha la to be yelled i know its the same guy but they could have put it in a different key or tempo woolie play break arts 2 its igpx the game woolie could have won that boss fight easily if he keeped playing keep away i love when they commentate but i wish they focused more on the boss fight as soon as they start talking woolies gameplay gets a big handicap oh man i wish we could get a full lp of this game chibified mecha i bet pat loves it 3 this looks like a fucking flash game lmao real robo techno jargon psuedotech factions gratuitous death ambiguous morality the hero is usually in or opposing a military supa robo super powered robots possessing some sort of transform ability no consequence for collateral damage villain of the week usually never fights other humans the hero is usually independent and driven by justice like i think that part in the beginning was 100 super clear even on the nose to a degree still fun times brb getting this game i want this the microphone quality 2012 again feat filthy minh i always kinda prefer the more humanoid mecha designs like eva or zoe yoji shinkawa maybe its just because i study a lot of human anatomy all this naruto talk woolie whens more ninja storm literally picked this game up about 2 days ago on the steam sale and thought to myself does woolie know about this and now its here i wish the games translation wasnt so bad it kept triggering my mind goblins and making them go batshit crazy till i could not bring myself to play the game and i ended up getting a refund hope it gets a proper translation in the future at which point i will gladly buy it again full price even hell at a higher price even if only for a translation that does not drive my mind goblins crazy i literally started rewatching robotech and looking up a bunch of super robot wars shit only to come back and find this yes minhs killing me on that ludonarrative dissonance between the player controlling the anime robots and the game worlds robots i swear minh is denser than a neutron bomb im pretty sure he could have just gotten a black screen with white text exposition dump and still not gotten it hardcore mechanography why does the main character have to look so obnoxious finally woolie the evil guy from fullmetal panic gauron doesnt have itachi lines lol most of the time i put on your podcasts and just play them in the background while i do stuff maybe tune back in whenever i hear some hype coming not this one eyes screen glue go fuck yeh need more mecha shit on this channel woolie you havent had your stand for long your going to burn the fuck out if youre not careful i was hoping woollie would play this min is frustrating though in having such a hard time on the distinction between super and real robots it couldnt be more clear even to non mecha fans what is this onnnnn i need this in my veins huh looks and plays like earth war which had the same kinda jank you do you woolie i guess are you just assigning minh lps to c tier games only as punishment or because of minhs seeming lack of a discerning eye for quality fuck man even the company is called rocket punch games woolie is getting too powerful i will now use my robot penis to play this game yo this game actually has super robots in it awwoh well it was fun while it lasted hopefully super robot can become undead one day tbh this made me sad most megazords suck now a days but holyfuck i want to play this the architecture has that cool megaman zero vibe too take my love my anger and all of my woolie do you think the obari sword pose should be mandated by law whenever a mech pulls out a greatsword i waned to love this game but the stealth and water levels are so bad also the controls are pretty bad why cant you aim with right stick edit i was also forgetting the lack of a reload button id understand it if this was like armored core where you have limited ammo but here hey woolie have you heard ab woolie bring me to life has already touched this game kageyama singing gives me enough burning spirit to get out of bed everyday oh god hearing kageyama singing makes even a chicken fight hype af the way everthing moves reminds me of medabots on gba but in hd i love that game but it feels so weird yeah yeah yeah i was waiting for this man this game is a blast to play and kagegama makes this game makes it more awesome how do you sell your mech game jam project that intro i saw this game on steam with zero prior knowledge and bought it immediately guessing this is also on pc cause not a single soul knows when this shit drops on ps4 reminds me of earth wars looks like a good game reminds a lot of some animations and mecha shows now imagine it being made by a larger group in a 3d environment and then it being bumped to the same level of graphical quality as many newer games being released in 2019 artwork is good and all but just imagine that being increased even more that would be cool it look interesting seem like a good gift for my friends nephew i wonder when wander will remember he has to equip weapons to use them he doesnt have the 40mm vulcans equipped hard bodies im surprised thats not a thing hah keep up the good work as a non native english speaker i would say an instead of a before words with starting vowels are bit dumb and hard to remember because this thing isnt in my native language mecha dd can i have a go whos hoping this receives updates translation aside i feel like a lots left out from the kickstarter a souffl is a baked eggbased dish which originated in early eighteenth century france yeah they probably mistaken it for scrambled since theyre both egg dishes ive said it once and ill say it again to the very end chelle is best girl tried to see if i wanted to play cause i like anime but hate easy gamesfirst thing i checked were a bunch of pillow fucking nerdsjust fawning over itsecond was you with a clear response to how the game isthank you mansubbed this game was made by chinese how many players can you play with it reminds me of the super nintendo game cybernator and metal warriors man cant wait till all 15 mechas are released thanks for the review i was interested in this one ever since its first showing but thanks to your review i think im ready to buy it now is this mighty no9 but actually good i saw this game by accident during e3 season and i fell in love with it i also didnt know this was a succesfull kickstarter campaing wich are always nice to see from time to time you have gain a new subscriber btw keep the good work also would you try to make a full review in the future is there a new game in this game it sucks to start over from zero do you get to custom your mech this game looks good could i know the price please todays daily gameplay video features hardcore mecha let me know what you all think of the game below play some fortnite so you rage you should play clicker heroes 2 could you do some more ironsight i love this game its like a anime that no no line was not a bad translation if you understand why shed talk like a condescending motherboss which is another common anime trope welp you should have played with mouse and keyboard or with new experimental pad control schemes its so much better d 2512 ish thats a neat concept for a story like a scifi slice of life thing where you living in a spaceship and like living there hahahhahahaha whoa wander you got the big heavy thick mecha with a lots of dhaka that you ever wanted and it can fly you dream has now came true in the plus side you also have a maximum dhaka battleship at this point wanderbot really should bring his boddly voice back for nancy with word subtext like that soufle sidonia no kishi that is all edit also i view it more like nancy is motherly and has that kind of personality like she is yelling at tarethur like a mother would edit2 yep nancy is the mother and morris is the father cant be unseen now full on spacebound battleship control in a classic style gradius sidescroll combat the scale of this sequence alone could be a game of its own awesome 3337 hyper mega particle beam cannon fire nice game its remind me the 90s era keep up the good work wanderbots breast fire is the ultimate move of old super robot anime mazinger z the series are remade tho quite a while ago breast fire mazinger z crimson blaster mazinger zbreast fire getter robo getter beam guyver the bioboosted armormegasmasher these codes are hidden machines and personal custom machines shared by game crowdfunding players after the setting interface is redeemed they can be

buyjust use code in setting to get new mechas ya call them aces i wonder if we can unlock more mecha breast fire the fact that the jp voice line has him saying cross fire instead makes it all the funnier the translation team arent native speakers thats for sure though to be fair breast fire is also a reference i see youve tried out the alternate control scheme haha im a keyboard and mouse user so i cant say for sure how well it works or doesnt work the left and right bumpers should be the primary and secondary attacks right but then what button is boost how do you boost aim and fire at the same time with a controller gah the keyboard and mouse seems like a superior control mechanism to me lol i dont see you using the vulcan a lot though since you have unlimited ammo theres no reason not to just spam it at the same time as the main gun it actually does a fair bit of supplemental damage great vid as usual im looking forward to more seeing you two enjoy the story so much is giving me second hand enjoyment of the story all over again hahahahah 1703 isnt that just real life wanderbot 2019 mecha needs the days of lots of lots of lots of unfair level of dhaka and super broken thickness take the mecha god emperor op broken blessing i love big thicc mecha wanderbot 2019 first i love how an npc came in screaming the zz gundam opening and then immediately died ah accel world now thats a blast from the past i really enjoyed that series quiet a bit while i wasnt a big fan of the mcs design the series overall was enjoyable haha mind you i have no problem with fat characters but its just his design was so out of place compared to everyone else he looked like an alien though i actually did enjoy seeing his character development the fights themselves were really top notch the final battles just got me so effing hyped with their animations sunrise really went all out did you know theres actually an accel world movie it has some great fights and animation but unlike the youjo senki movie it doesnt take place after the anime instead it picked a story in the middle of the light novels so anyone not up to date with those wouldnt get whats going on lol i watched it anyway just to see the characters again as for hardcore mecha i actually didnt like the antigravity moments at all lol im just too used to the grou the anime your thinking of is accel world great job there liked if she likes evangelion then shell probably like fafner he and maybe she would like gurren lagann my favorite gundam series is gundam x and victory gundam iron blooded orphans is nice but just like wing you wont get much mecha action into later on in the series macross is a little weird in a sense that its a mecha anime mixed in with a whole lot of romance and singing celebrates what about super robot wars animated if you guys are after a mecha tabletop my friend blazbaros is making one from the ground up its called payload do check it out httpswwwdeviantartcomblazbarosartpayloadsolomon733039424 its actually called full metal panic not fumoff that is the ova season of full metal panic check out full metal panic second raid and invisible victoryiv for more its amazing heroic age damn its been forever since i thought about that one the mecha were more like kaiju but i loved the different powers they had i remember there was some weird phenomena where if they used too much power fighting each other theyd go insane and mutate as for the other series were you thinking of gargauntua or something this one guy got isekaied to a water world with his ai mecha buddy though maybe im thinking of something else hahaha damn that train was tough im glad you found a way to trick the ai into shooting the mines lol when i did it i think i just went for evasion and using the vulcan for point defense it was a tough battle for sure though i had the overcharged canon ultimate which cuts off a fair bit of the bosses hp i feel like the add weapons are so poorly balanced lol the limited ammo means they can only be used for one encounter with the exception of a few lategame ones with real impact the rest are probably a waste of money lol instead of reskinning dd why not play mekton zeta a literal game built from the ground up as a mecha anime rpg i know i would be willing to run a campaign for you guys edit also i think the robotech game you refer to is robotech battlecry though it might have been invasion if you were in a veritech fighter then it was battlecry but if it was a cyclone bikepower armor then it was invasion also valvrave you should give another chance it is given a bad rap but it is usually overblown so robotech the mashup that some us company made with 3 mecha animes like how 4kids made that weird mashup of 3 digimon movies and turned into one digimon the movie i dont know 2 of the 3 mecha animes but i know one macross which are exactly what wander talking about i also would recognize someone talking about my favorite real robot mecha anime franchise p basically the story of the first macross was a giant ship crashed on earth and they kinda discoreved about existence of aliens races one of which would attack earth one day so they made the valkyries which are fighters like we have that could turn into the mechas on the same side as the zentradis the giant alien race which simply used an exosuitiron manish armor to fight macross is a really neat mecha anime and is really an musical mecha anime because on how heavily leans into music also really long comment sorry p were you thinking of archipelago of blue steel earlier wander ha wander bot happy thick dhaka mecha 4th of july wouldnt making largehuge animate object golems work for mechs you could use craft points to add flight guns etc right ptsd is coming guys xd heroic age is sort of a scifi take on the labors of hercules the major star faring races parallel the ages of man from hesiod with mankind being the iron race the newest to achieve faster than light travel starfinder is cool even with a bad group my group is sitting on two mech suits we have plans and the technology basis for terraforming mars the main thing is that it involves the same process as earths climate change combined with an artificial magnetosphere produced using electromagnets on the poles with amplifier towers around the martian surface that and using ice mined from asteroids and debris fields both for extra carbon dioxide and hydrogen dioxide primary form of water edit mars is just like earth save for its size resulted in its mantle cooling faster than earths which slowed or stopped its internal dynamo the planets spinning core earths is still going fairly strong partially thanks to our moon interacting with the crust of the planet which helps maintain geothermal activity golem is the specific type of mecha in this game like thunderbolt similarly gears could be mistranslation for equipment or our gear heya nice to see more people enjoy this great anime mecha game ive been watching a bunch of hardcore mech videos and you guys are by far my favorite the whole team commentary and impromptu voice acting is just so entertaining i cant wait to see you guys react to the rest of the campaign its really cool that i can visually see improvement in your game play skill from vid 1 to 4 lol on that note there was a recent patch that implamented dual stick controls for controllers it looks like you guys might still be using the single stick controls which makes shooting really difficult that being said im pretty impressed overall haha when i tried that stealth segment i ducked arse at it so seeing it cleared so easily was lulz on that end segment i see youve found the mp hahaha it would be pretty cool to see you guys cover that sometime too although you were probably right to avoid queuing online the online fights are tons of fun but also really intense with people fly there are some code with special robots you can use in the online game chelle go look up isaac arthurs episode on colonizing mars itll give you information on what would it take to build up a terraformed mars if you guys want to play more mech fighting games i suggest you try and play gundam versus or sd gundam g generation genesis check out nintendo switch games on amazon usa httpsamznto2m1mmh3 can httpsamznto2lzmsms watch more

being a backer and all demo was great very excited to play will be buying it as soon as it comes out earth defense force iron rain2019 so i was going over the the world is your weapon video with my friends and everyone loved it like the art style the fact that you beat someone with a dish pan and your overall demeanor is killer if i could id like to promote your videos let me know if thats alright and keep kickin ass also more the world is your weapon like a fullon playthrough really wanted to back this when i had the chance but a unexpected bill came that canceled my backing out wish it was on the google play store please bring this to the ps4 in the west i think i can adapt really well to that in time even so if i can be a bit selfish can you add an auto aim feature or make aiming a function for the right analog stick in future patches would be really appreciated if you could aside from that i have 0 commplains of any kind on the game as a whole nice the combos are congrats on making a mech game that has weight its even better than several other aaa ones like new gundam breaker lol cant wait to see whats in store for the future from you guys whats good doops the gameplay is just ok but the animation of the cut scene are way too good for such a cheap game wth lol awesome video 1k simple combo 1k combo back with another awesome gameplay video you should try to play bendy and the ink machine nice one simple this looks like a cool looking side scroller id be curious to give it a try codes not working am i doing something wrong thanks for the info i was waiting for a good deal on ps subscriptions if you cant find a plagues tale at gs best buy price matched me for 1999 from 4999 still in their system its interesting hes promoting the newegg ps discount when hes promoted the cdkeys discount before and the price for the annual subscription is at 36 and change great sale thanks i got plus for 4043 or so after black friday randomly online instant code maybe its good to stack a few years damn i just bought playstation plus on the ps store for 45 on the seventh psn asia suck not much sale going on there is only 9 how is slay of spire the newegg deal is still 60 its bull how ps plus used to be 40 and you got at least 2 different games each for ps3 ps4 and vita then they raised the price to 60 and shortly after took that away and now we only get 2 ps4 games for 60 they should have brought the price back down after taking away games since we got nothing else in place of the missing games how long does it take to process before you get the ps plus code plague tale was easily goty plague tale is actually my game of the year this year pick it up for the cheap nobody is complaining about the uncharted collection being free for ps plus they are amazing games its the goat simulator that people are upset about which is understandable go to cdkeys ps plus comes out at 3873 i think i just bought mine last week i bought dmc5 the witcher 3 and dying light ee last night ill be jumping on that plagues tale deal thanks im subscribed for plus until next holiday season so i dont need to stack still waiting for that beat saber sale roadhouse is need for speed heat any good ooo purdy spaceships happy new year world of longplays looking forward to your vids this year so this seems to be before they patched the english translation of the game theres a better translation that is available for update not a mod devs retranslated it this translation is passable the new one is much better cool they really nailed the designs also makes me want to see a assault suit valken cybernator remake a mustplay for any gundam fans happy new years day interesting game ouch i see the gang of three did you in good haha its a little late now but one tip is that during the emp drones phase you just have to dash behind her she does a three shot burst then pauses and turns around but if you dash behind her while shes doing the 1st shot shell whiff the other two shots without turning around they were a worthy enough enemy to get you to bring out the experimental equipment lols though for a streamer that needs to watch their hands and push out videos i totally get it even if you could eventually beat them its not worth it haha hmm on the blocking aspect i think if you get the timing wrong youre stuck in a cycle for example theres a small delay before the block comes up so if you take a hit during that timing you get stunned then have to press block again but a barrage of fire could hit you another time and so on i tend to prefer dashing over blocking when possible to avoid all that as a bonus you can generally dash cancel out o ptsd part 2 is coming guys xd when little sister like character dies in any thing this is a hard sadness does every single block of text have a typo in it at this point its starting to seem like a running gag i might be wrong but i thing what you guys were talking about is called the square cube law the game reminds me of front mission gun hazard it was great game that i played on my snes emulator i downloaded the english translation i may get this game this makes me want to rewatch gundam wander for what reason do you have chelle in this series its not like youre playing the multiplayer mode right now something i wish was a feature would be unlocking the bosses mechs when you beat them like the one at 1133 edit another thought just some colour customisation would be really cool carrie you are talking about the square cube law and it sort of limits the height of a mecha to around 60ft if the mecha is humanoid and doesnt have countertension engineering built into it the woman youre playing this with could genuinely get work doing voice overs for mecha suit ai etc d weapons online engines online reactor online all systems nominal try using mouse and keyboard its a little easier to aim with it cool some of the mechs look like grazes from iron blooded orphans this looks super up my alley but i dont have a pc cool id play it

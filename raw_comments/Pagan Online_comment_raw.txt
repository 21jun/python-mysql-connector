are you not playing archeage unchained fevir what i dislike is that when youre in a stage the game locks you inside a barrier and you cant exit until you do the conditions i guess unless this is changed i dont think ill play even the beta version if theres beta later if sabaton says it is good then it is good this or kill squad that wsad control is a deal breaker for me cant play it like that need mouse click a click to move control scheme would be pretty stupid in a fast paced game looks and acts like a mobile game for pc there is no choice other than path of exile nothing will beat that game at least for the next 2 years i see wargaming i close the site these guys are the kings of microtransactions and lootboxes the caracters remind me of darsiders i dont know how do you gays experience names in this game but as someone who is actually south slavic feels weird with these ingame names istok actually means east drevna kutia ancient boxchest i get a warframe feel from it looks great really into the art style and combat style but not really an rpg is it so basically warframe but in a fantasy arpg not a bad idea ty a lot for the pagan online but cant buy it in steam because they region block asia im wathing a great amount of videos about pagan and the combat feels more boring than slow phase its nice to see a new game not inspired from a game a decade ago you never saw or played diablo this is diablo with great looks i like diablo but i dout when people say it is all new and well i can see diable references in every frame so far funny i already see adria which was also a name in diablo 3 you lost me at co op capable game co op is not available and they are looking at it working sometime this summer i just hate moving with keyboard keys wow i like it thanks for heads up it doesnt look like you can you swap characters on the fly in missions thats disappointing looks like a console game ported to pc crippled by the belief that users only have 4 buttons instead of the typical 104 we have available no thanks bye felicia another instance mmolite game that starts early access sponsoring videosjust another cash grab and drop game remove online until theres any online play just a tiny little suggestion to not i dunno false advertise and piss people off straight up a bad game do not waste money on this buggy garbage i only play grim dawn for arpg genre want to play poe but its restricted in my region on steam so i cant this one looks promising added to wishlist perharps wait for 2 or 3 more patch thanks for the video how many fucking streamers did war gaming pay to review their game path of exile is free and better in my opinion but lost ark online is much polished idk why people are complaining about having transmog only remember a little game called border lands the customization for your actual character had like 2 things color pallet and head swapping lol thats it so idk why thats a big deal nowadays gameplay and story fun and fun even with out the co op the game is still legit yo thats king leoric at 400 i will leave it to people who like to play boring games based on this review i will look later to see if it has changed if not good luck to those of you who play it this game is like an arpg version of dungeon defender and it appears to be set up for the same pitfalls as dd2 had when it was released without supreme execution in both balance and class design there will be a solid meta with little room for player customization that along with tiered difficulty of the same mission is going to lead to the same grindy repetition so essentially a dead game before launch not trashtalking it looks good but no soul is looking for mmolite as albion has proven the last minute or so of the video killed the game for me after kiting the monsters around and killing them as was intended with a grindy combat system the loot is exploded all over the map so now you have to walk all over the map again and waste more time since the central point of the game is to grab loot after a successful encounter this seems like a huge waste of time and would get old rather quickly at least when items fall in other games i can ignore them as i pass through if they are junk that last explosion the player needed to backtrack in order to even see all the items 449 aaaand not interested at all anymore isnt it like a top down arpg style warframe really cool channel second video ive watched already shared both of them great content keep doing what youre doing tried it out pretty good game well polished however it lacks depth at this point in time and i returned it because of this will keep an eye on it though and maybe pick it back up once it gets a little more things added to it hears pvp focused stops watching and leaves good material subbed im being honest lost ark project tl they are the best of the best theres nothing that can compare to those titles no matter what new and fresh games that is released but im keeping an open mind region ban wtf watched the video for the game on steam dont appreciate the satanic aggressive music neither how almost all characters look demonic nothing cool about devil worshiping in games in my book am surprised nobody else even notice these things anymore so big thumbs down becase game companies worship the dark openly and u promote them without any kind of discernment looks to shake up the genre its literally a diablo clone why cant this be played as a dual stick game whats the difference between this and diablo 3 all i feel like i saw was just the same old thing really kill mobs gain loot repeat with this as a paid promotion im skeptical of this one looks like they took diablo gave it a wow aesthetic then simplified it for megacasuals for ps4 isnt wargame one of the most greedy f2p game companies there is i dont think think ive seen a worse customistation or item system in arpg ever 30 dollar early access is bullshit dont buy dont let this ad fool you currently the game is not worth buying and is not very fun to play if this was an mmorpg pvebased it would be great refunded that crap its a mobile game on pc all the addictive stuff while no real gameplay you just kill few waves of mobs and thats it this video feels like a complete different game to what i played yesterday and refunded it was extremely shallow good review thanks alot full skills i love it dodge each attack u are able to success instead of spamming to destroy the ennemies with big aoe ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh sponsored video not interested why would i take you seriously when a publisher pays you money to talk good about their game lol youre trying to sell me a game that hasnt come out yet yikes dude the game is actually really crappy compared to something like lost ark this game is purely abusing the hate on blizzard and diablo ppl playing this are the usuall sheep that will go play diablo 4 as soon as it comes out and hype iteven if its going to be shit this item is currently unavailable in your region gaddem its characters and parts of map are on slavic languagelike igmanmountain in bosniavukashinname in serbiathere even was king vukashinistokin serbian means eastis it connected with old slavic culture wish you would play grim dawn if doesnt have multiplayer is not worth even looking at it this game looks slow as f i have to say this again apparently calling this game isometric is an insult to the developers the artists and to mathematics and geometry have a multiplayer steam classified as single player as someone who enjoys the cosmetic side to these kinds of games its a shame to see your appearance doesnt change unless you get your wallet out and buy skins rather unfortunate seeing as its already in early access and you have to pay to play having to then pay again for skins if it is f2p when release fair enough but until then iill watch from a distance the game going to be free pve focus does that mean it might have pvp in the future but this game is online or is just single player can you play in party with friends ive paid for grim dawn and all its expansions so dont mind paying for a worthwhile game why dont arpg developers understand how important good looking ui is to the atmosphere of the game ughhhh wasd thanks but no feel like the game would actually be better with fewer skills but mby thats just me fevir wth bro i just noticedthe icon changee nooooo i will miss mi mushroom cloudbroccoli diablo immortal copied this kinda reminds me of spiral knights played it not bad but the arenastyle levels are kinda annoying to me i prefer a bit more exploration 27 for early access o so classes like warframe and plays like battlerite game is geoblocked in australia what gives i dont know anything about this game or the company but for what i remember world of tanks was a p2w so honestly this seems like a p2w for me also the screenshot you showed said something about quarterly dlcs so its like an attempt of sub like wow so honestly im not buying this in early access but we will see when its realeased so basically a more limited version of marvel heroes omega hope it develops well if to play the game you need to buy it and then to play it effectively and stay competitive you must buy character classes to me its simply scammy cashgrab doesnt matter how it feels now they will just be building walls in game progression that you cannot cross without buying new released classes and you are fucked after spending 3050 and playing for 12 months you should rethink your review summary as goal of devs is so clear here microtransactions all the way i will not touch this product its a waste of time and money tbh wtf not available in australia no co op no buy not released in oce what youve described is a pvemoba more than an arpg microtransaction cosmetics means ill wait for this to go on a sale its unavailable to my region calling console port the wasd and mouse aiming really screams add a controller i am just not into the isometric camera so this albion and poe just dont do it for me you lost me at hero characters why do no reviewers never mention that the game is region locked and there is no coop play is that because its funded by wargaming is this coming to console would like to try it out but 27 for early access is just too risky i never got used to wasd unfortunately and i gave it two to three hours in alpha i wasnt the only one that went back to our goto arpgs after giving it a shot looks like this game is made by actual game developers who have seen other companies ignore playerbase and were like hey look if we add all this in our game it will be better i would gladly pay 30 just to see this game in action at release another game that will probably be free after 6 months so no need to buy it same story with albion d moba gameplay in an arpg very interesting another diablo clone doesnt even deserve to be f2p up to 8 classes sold crapy 0 gameplay customization like d3 garbage long life poe play vid about pagan online got albion online ads v most of yt rewievs are sponsored so dont expect honest opinions game has solid fundaments for future paywalls so i wouldnt even bother game go na show its true colors very soon not gonna lie if this was free id literally jump out of bed and go download it then text my girlfriend and tell her to download it it does look like fun but its so hard to buy into early access games especially ones that try and be premium games and charge for more expansions and updates too from a studio that really hasnt done a lot in this genre that price is a terrible idea the base game should be free then if you really wanna charge make the expansions cost money but you need to build hype for the game and show that its good before people are gonna buy into it 30 bucks and then pay for maps lmao no thanks all i see is combat where do you actually do the rp in this arpg its just a diablo dungeon crawler this actually looks really good this kind of combat sounds way more like my style compared to the rush through everything vs a million mobs of poe etc im very intrigued dont buy there no coop yet i wasnt a fan at all i am just going to wait for chaosbane not realy good idea to pay for a game when its not rdy it shoud be f2p right from the get go latter they can make it buy to play game not now when its not rdy it wont make me even look at it if cant just try it for free why is it not available in vietnam lol what did we even do to you people an arpg that actually requires you to learn fight mechanics finally so tired of the games where you pick 14 skills to max out then just stand there spamming those skills iis that skeleton dude a playable lich please tell me its a playable lich the clear speed and graphics looks like torchlight 2 seems pretty cool pve focused immediately leaves video this game is modeled like warframe fast infinitely replayable missions multiple characters warframe has 40 different warframes which are all easily maintanable and used for specific tasks and sure every one has mains missions that drop specific crafting materials i guess if they take care of the game and dont get too greedy it can become something big since the monetization seems good im interested wanted to like it just not for me you should always keep a critical hat on but for anything wargaming id wear two why is it not available in the philippines no visual progression besides skins and they have you pay for it and future content will also be paid hard pass quit when i heard it is paid i have been playing only free games recently fortnite apex paladins warface its a trash f2p game dressed as a buy to play dont buy it problem with isometric hack and slash games today is that nothing has improved since diablo 2 was first release some games offer a good game mechanics but lack other things the goal for a new arpg online or offline is to give freedom to the players to choose and customized their character and customized character skills these games provide as such but not everything path of exile and grim dawn for me this games is the top of my arpg like diablo but its still lacking some game mechanics like item customization interesting this cant be bought in australia apparently both steam and wargamingnet come up with dead links if there is one thing i know for sure wargamingnet has never had a game that wasnt pay to win ill never play another one of their games so i pay for they game pick one hero then i am stuck with that hero until i grind the tokens that are specific to other heros and random drops sounds like they are just gonna throw things in my way to try and make me buy things when their cash shop opens thats a big no from me dawg no customization kills an arpg for me so warframe meets diablo thats what i got out of this game so basically warframe diablo so i see slavic lore is on rise in us well was taboo for so long if they make pvp modes i will play this like death matches moba dominion pvp is the key to success now days lets talk about the 1v1 ranked pvp we definitely need one this game screams mobile cash grab but ported for pc complete copy of diablo much that wasd movement is such a turn off for me that i cant even it looks slow and not fluid at all this game have controller suport graphic type is like early beginning of production and not polished at all stylized hand drawn or concept art style the gameplay style is more of an arcade style such as gauntlet mixed with league of legends and a few others it has a more gamepad console gaming feel to it for movement it is very scaled down and simplified regardless of indie developed or not has no impact on the graphics quality or gameplay what so ever nor the time that it takes to build the game neither does the number of developers though it can impact the amount of graphics elements you see the time it takes to implement some things depending on the knowledge and tools of the developer and it can take awhile to handle specialized features and animations and if the developer wants to do a game that has a big story like a full movie production that does take time especially with lengthy animated cinematics but thats about it the only impact on that is the developers knowledge toolset resources h sounds like a cows game based on those mini xpacs not available in the philippines is this single or multiplayer game is it free you forgot the most important selling point on their main website is a icon that says no phones involved it looks great but it feels like a mobile game slower pace arpg god heard me looks amazing but what about pvp ashes of creation is off the table now i have finally accepted that quality mmorpgs are a thing of a past i have now moved onto other genres even then i only play 2 hours a day on the weekends now that i have gotten into a career in cyber security and am living a life of a fulfillment that gaming can never offer damn no coop wtf is this 1997 played the last alphabeta test and cant say it got me hooked it felt like there was an overflow of information coming at me and levels felt very meh it would be better if it went from one zone into another like diablo has here it just felt more like a mobile game system with rounds instead of a full map yeah no tnx this will be a pay2play type of garbage game on realease i can almost see it now just like anything wg touches hilarious that they ask money up front as well it already has lootboxes in it and the chance of them not monetizing this and then probably porting it over to mobile is just about 0 polished turd not saying this is bad but it looks like a moba combined with an arpg region locked cant play this game from australia just play poe guys certainly looks interesting kind of like a mix of warframe the class picking aspect battlerite combat system and diablo duh could be interesting but ill wait a bit until they patch in coop and we see how wargamings hand in this plays out wow this is a very generous review of a very flawed game walk from one room to another one enemys spawn kill them and move on no mention about the barriers between the rooms that sometimes make you backtrack minutes because the pathes between the rooms are blocked no mention about the reuse of various maps sure those are handcrafted and nice but cutting out rooms with barriers while still running the same map is just artifical drag the skills in this game are a joke even diablo 3 has more depth to the skills then this game you can level skills up to get more dmg or cooldown and stuff like it but you cant change the skill at all like dmg conversions from ice to fire for example after playing one champ to the level it unlocks all skills they never change it becomes boring and repetetive pretty fast and some heroes are better by design then others but you always press the same 7 buttons the whole time you play the game seven and most of them arent even fun or a b usually games like this has some exploit at early stages imbalanced classes where one playing using the trickop combos gets ridiculous advantage economically and power wise screwing any kind of competitivefuture balance possible in multiplayer i think that is the reason they decided to playtest the game in early access with a bigger audience question is what is valuable how the tradeeconomy will be will there be reset of chars etc the genre really needs some more casual streamlined games as d3 showed poe is just way too time consuminghc for the average joe looks shit more like a mobile game with no costumization and lazy designs if it was free then maybe itd be worth a shot no coop whatsoever right now and no eta for it aswell also for a hackslash game this has really slow paced combat with lack of movement give it another year before buying cant wait for asiasea release sadly not available in sea at the moment i was really interested in this game until i saw it was published by wargamingnet oh well too bad it could have been a good game for those that dont know wargamingnet is a publisher that only publishes p2w games i highly doubt that this one will be an exception to their obvious money milking cow games that being said i dont really care since there are a bunch of really good games coming out this year so really dont have time for crap publishers like that please someone who have played this game why this game have mixed reviews almost everything youve said about this game couldve been a narration over the top of warframe footage and thats a good thing imo edit its currently unavailable in australia u are better of playing poe wow pve oriented just like every other shitty hack and slash pvp is the real test of skills competition against another human pve is just trash so if wargaming is involved when can we see the first premium heros and do you have to buy a premium acc to be able to compete in the later stages of the game region locked to oceanic annoying so left out not a big fan of the wasd movement tbh you cant dash in the exact direction you want due to the limited directions the wasd keys give you had me until characterskill set locks and wargamming some interesting stuff i hope the combos of abilites are good and interesting waiting for this to become available in my region i like the monetisation method just pay and play and pay to access expansions great its unavailable in my region does it have pvp or plans for pvp game in unavailable in new zealand sponsored by wargaming lol so many youtubers getting sponsored by the publisher of this game so be careful i would read steam reviews much more honest and wargaming sell power in all of their games ya looks liek dog shit im gonna pass going to die faster that black dessert online is this on ps4 yet or will it wanted to check it out not available in your region stupid af cost 30 bucks stopped the video looks cool and fun but still simce to be like a game for android or something like that soo i think its too high price gross it has a warframe style account leveling just play path of exile isnt diablo also wasd what is pagan online a single player game lulz xd f2p soon espz rip proect why tf is this game region locked moving while you attack you had me at that on top of that the art style looks amazing aaaaaaaaaannnnd its region locked cant buy it here from southeast asia not available in my region so its lol and diablos baby looks fucking siiiiiiick hope it come to ps4 sounds like a hype video thats scripted so the video creator can get paid ah i see u are being sponsored by wargaming so am guessing u are not mentioning the cons am gonna be honest here and say i didnt hear u talk about pay 2 win boxes am not sure if u mentioned that or not the wasd control schemes got me intrigued watching every gameplay video all sponsored im guessing there is only one finished char this dude is so full of shit why he does he not talk about the loot boxes that give you rare crafting material used to craft strong items that can be seen as potentially being pay to win or the itemization which seems really lack lusteryour character doesnt change appearance when equipping gear only their weapon does the only way to change your appearance are with skins or the skill trees which are extremely shallow each ability gets it own skill tree but within those trees are just damage increases or minus cooldown or more aoe boring stuff nothing that actually changes how the skills function you should check out wyvern rpg a mmo mobile game i got some gameplay on my channel looks amazing and sounds amazing especially combat and the switching of heroes on the fly but its 30 bucks and not free2play for fucks sake this gives off the spiral knights vibe everything available with a simple click nah bro i prefer loading screens on every window in my game thank you very much sorry price tag too high not touching looks like diablo 3 and i cant say that this similarity brings enthusiasm they want to shake up the genre but they start by shaking up our wallets xddd looks great but wargaming is involved so no thanks so its battlerite single player wish the classes looked a bit more diverse but otherwise it looked great not having click to move is a big turn off to me this needs to be on the switch it was made by serbian developer mad head and that hero that you play istok it means east on serbian boring so basically an mobile arpg for pc 30 dollars and payable additional expansions cash shop also few cartoon cinematics no thanks 419 are you talking about warframe d i think the fact that they want 30 for it in addition to the fact they want you to pay every few months for new content is a huge deal breaker for me with this style of game wasnt this going to be f2p and they better not force that class system i want to play a mage not a tank no matter what the mission is or wants i played trials 3 and 4 really hope they fixed loading times and some glitchy mobs was thrown off a bit by the price too but that means they kept everything else in game farmable so im cool with that the game is awesome love the whole slavic theme pre made character ahhhhhh ffs i have a question ive been seeing a lot of reviews on steam about this game claiming there are lootboxes but some reviewers saying there arent any im a little bit confused about this 27eur for arpg dddd thanks new arpg like paid unlike coop with pve focus like not available in my region unlike yeah boring as hell game looks cool but too bad they are not release for asia yet please release it in asia our wallets are ready how does it compare to path of exile as soon as i found it was made by wargaming it is a huge no from me last time i installed a wargaming game it took 3 months to remove their 3rd party malware from my pc and that was with a programmers help to remove it had to go through my registry line by line basically it ended up being a fresh windows install by the time i was done and if you go try to get ahold of wargaming about it even if you have proof they will deny having anything to do with it and they will say that is a first they have heard about it but a simple google search shows that this kind of stuff has been going on with this company since pretty much its inception phone game this style of controls seems pretty conducive to using a gamepad i am looking forward to this game based on the control schemes alone i am also totally ok with paid cosmetics if the game is free there absolutely needs to be a majority of cosmetics earned ingame if the game is paid for imho yea this game is shit wasd movement is terrible the game is way to simple and it feels so slow this is not a good arpg its a mobile game hub missiontable reminds me of kurtzpel like its almost the same i might play it for lukian im not a fan of keyboard controls where the movement is predominantly diagonal will this be for console too it looks awesome it kinda looks like a cross between warframe and diablo to me in the term of different classes you can switch to that you have to level individually but at the same time you have an overarching account level not sure about the entrance price being worth it though at least not until the game is properly released and if its gonna have quarterly paid dlcs it might get a bit hard to keep up with the expenditure depending on price that said it looks sweet seems smooth and all the best luck to the devs about moving wsad isnt anything interesting most asian hack and slash games have it many years so does this game hurt torchlight frontiers free i hate game names with online on them lol looks good too bad it looks to be too pricy especially for us brazillians and the lack of class customization is a miss imo can i meet other players in this game sorry if i missed the info but can you equip armor helmet shoulders and if yes it also changes your appearance just gotta mention fevir you crush it your review and commentary is so on point for what the community wants and you know exactly what needs to be conveyed when people watch your video you crystallize the feelings and thoughts we have very well i think thats a direct representation of not only your passion but your intelligence as well keep it up man especially in the games you love im a massive arpg and mmo fan and i share a ton of opinions with you stopped watching as soon as you said wasd movement what a garbage decision this looks like a very good quality mobile game the ui and everything the many different characters and even the locked appearence they probably started developing it for mobile but seen more potential on a pc release very interesting feels like an mmo arpg hybrid makes me happy seeing polished rpg games outside than diablo and poe thats the thing the polished can get away with box price or we can keep complaining about the free garbage handed to us over the past year or two the age of actual good products with a box price worth what youre paying for is welcomed in my world hope this game deliver what looks like to be a very promising outcome awesome video home i would worry about video length people are going to find something to bitch about either way lost me at wasd movement lol i dont understand why you have to pay 2299 for a game that yes looks great but has no customization unless your willing to pay more money if they had skins you could earn aswell as payable skins id be much more interested and actually more likely to pay real money for extra skins because id be more invested in the game if you had earn skins that for example one that required you to hit a 250 hit combo to unlock a bloody dripping hatchet or just something unless thats in the game i think ill be passing keep it clean down there this aint no pigsty lol my time isnt worth zero paid products are never bad millennials always want something for nothing is it a good game sure is it a game that is better than poe or diablo 12 nope sorry no offense but i like my game giving me options to play how i want not how i have to play like diablo 3 forces id rather play torchlight if i want a classbased isometric game atleast the loot there shows up in the middle of combat not forcing me to kill low levelrarity mobs and i can speedrun through the already slowpaced gamestyle is a bummer but loot not showing up in the middle of combat is ridiculous i like quality of life improvements like no need to run a long way just to get to an npc to sell your loot would have loved more of an auto loot option too though hate to waste time clicking to pick up loot but its not that bad since they give it in the end and not during battle which breaks combat so thats not bad what i am really liking are the environments the map the icons the whole theme of the game is definitely very polished as you say i might give it a try i am definitely interested just going to wait a bit perhaps looks really interesting one thing that is always an issue that very few reviewers touch on with these online games what is the game like on high ping and when i say high i mean 150400ms gamers dont just exists in eu asia and us and many that view these kinds of reviews have this on their mind some games work well with high ping others literally break and cannot be played on high ping tera gunner comes to mind as a class that does not work at all with high ping when reviewing a new game a sentence or two on how the game feelsplays at 150400ms ping and even planned server locations would be greatly appreciated and go a long way to save time and effort for those of us ping handicapped so it has the mechanics of battlerite but slowed down in a diablo like game nice i have been wanting an arpg that is basically pve battlerite since before even blc existed so this looks pretty fucking hype a shame my computer just up and died ill have to check if there are plans for console release games trash dont waste your time nope not paying a dime on wargamingmicrotransactionkingrussian crap no matter how good it is sponsored review sucks i bought it i like it its fancy cant wait to see whats to come didnt even know about it till yesterday i love the little progress bar you add at the bottom of your videos that shows when every segment ends do i need a phone to play this game its not available on my region on steam wtf region locked sad pro wasd movement slower combat which feels meaningful con wow graphics give me ptsd wargaming is a p2w publisher characters are not customizable hey anyone knows if there will be a wipe after it leaves early access made me want to try it out with my brother thanks for the recommendation i hear this game already has full controller support im in i hope this gets a console release looks amazing although i am very wary of wargaming products their monetisation in world of warships and world of tanks is crazy expensive so this could easily turn into the same thing its mixed on steam major complain i see is everyone says its too repetitive so there are no pvp elements in this game 20 usd for 350 online players d lineage eternal single player edition p lul looks pretty stagnant in terms of art direction another generic cartoon arpg to reel in the kids and their mommies credit card wasd arpg im sold you had me at plays like battlerite 3 really hope something like this could come to console does this game have any pvp mode the only thing that turn off is early access status does pagan online had region restriction on steam cant find it on malaysia not available on south east asia rip was hoping someone would make a pve battleritei wonder how the steam controller or ds4 will perform ill wait 7 more years for lost ark pc only or console eventually im avoiding sponsored vids like a plague whenever ytber makes sponsored video he stops being himself but some kind of twisted version of himself spewing insane praises and compliments the whole time that personality change is disgusting i just cant stop cringing not to mention one loses his ability to be as objective as he can get on the topic cause he did get money for something right that being said i hope they paid you good for the vid looks like a mobile game or a soon to be ported one time locked chests are a free to play cash grab but you have to buy it for 40 is bull shit after seeing some torchlight frontiers gameplay i wasnt too impressed but i might have to check this one out thanks for the heads up peace we get it you got stuck on t3 maps in poe lol you dont have to sell this game by low key bashing path the whole time this game is region locked australians cant play feelsbadman why is this region blocked from being purchased in australia the fuck not one mention of lootboxes cardpacks do you see it ever coming to console from what i could tell it looked like an easy port over you dont have your own character and equipment doesnt change the appearance of your avatar huge blows to a sense of investment and pride in your character in my eyes this may aswell be a moba can we get this game on xbox one it looks really good sponsored so i cant take your word for it then good to know looks interesting but its not available in australia pagan is an amazing game it is entirely built for coop and any leaderboard style challenges it is totally okay to have mains it isnt at all necessary to have certain builds in the game to succeed even so lukian is currently the strongest hero theres a decent skill curve and the most ideal way to play is probably do story missions 80 challenge missions 20 for every 12 levels to be ready with any class for anything in the game unavailable in australia rip i was sold in at least trying this when i heard wasd australia is region locked i dont trust the nature of early access games anymore will wait for further review 30 bucks obviusly going to be premium and op shit because its a wargaming game no thx cheers for being this to our attention looks great thank you for not calling it a mmorpg its like torchlight ii remastered with more sauce looks so damn good unavailable in your region no sale from me i guess i went to steam to download this game then i saw the price 30 bucks lol the more i see of this game the more i feel it is closer to gauntlet than diablopoe thats not a bad thingbut personally i will be disappointed if it does not offer build variantsan interesting gear system an error was encountered while processing your request this item is currently unavailable in your region play path of exile instead after being burned by studio wildcard with ark ill never purchase into an early access game again no matter how good it looks and this looks good ill wait patiently thanks for the great video and information wasd movement does this mean controller support i wish arpgs would be ots instead of isometric wasd is definitely the way to go having only mouse click movement is cancer but i think having mouse click for people who want it should happen shame its not available in australia not available in australia lol can wait for cash shop arrows on this mobile game love the loading bars for segments also your insights into the game mechanics philosophy etc are quite welcome keep it up would definitely want to check this out when multiplayer is introduced but im turned off by the business model i agree with you that we are in the era of f2p the game reminds me of master x master which i loved didnt like the pvp though but i have a feeling this game will do great in both pve and pvp if thats a thing so sad that this game is no available in thailand tt loot boxescards no talents or skill tree repetitive cycle of contentarmor doesnt change appearance and attacking makes you get stuck in animation wish they changed these when it gets out of early access for now it feels like a mobile game a paid video with a honest opinion wtf hey man does this have controller support and is there any plans for a console release why cant they make an mmo with this graphics and playability unavailable in your region for fuck sake i dont live on the moon i hate using mouse click to move in an arpg never liked it in diablo good to know its wasd i love this game already it reminds me of torchlight meets battlerite thank you for this video i never heard about this game d i like the idea of this cant even play this in oce lol theres a first time for everything it is a mobile like game with pay to win aspects looks somewhat interesting id feel better about buying the game if the developers would respond to the many concerns that have been voiced about possible future microtransactions a lot of the systems in place do indeed look made for that purpose i like it gonna download it now this actually looks really fun im sold thanks for bringing this to my attention fevir am i missing something or is every character white i guess other races cant do fantasy smh hard pass how do you always find out about these games lol and you release pretty comprehensive reviewspreviews this actually looks pretty fun tbh whoever told you to say and not have that indy feel needs to be fired from their job actually whoever wrote that stiff dialogue in the intro as a whole needs to be fired i sure hope that was the sponser not you mailing it in the irony in saying it is polished and doesnt have that indy feel is we can see it right there on the screen while you say that and it certainly has that indy look whatever that even means lol the funny part is wouldnt even have noticed how shitty it looks had you not just tried to tell me the polish is a feature all the while dissing an entire sector of the market always up for a new arpg but i doubt it will be as good as path of exile not available in my country yet i am forced to use multiple characters and i cant have that feeling of this is my character also if this is a coop party based well why not f2p model look at poe you need a certain amount of people to make it work does equipping new armors change the appearance d fevir you know since i first saw this game ive been wondering why am i interested in it still determining the answer to this oh ya forgot to say spank me daddy too expensive for too little content being in early access i think it whoulve had a lower price tag until the game was finished being stuck on place due to the animation during combat honestly makes it exhausting for me the wasd movment felt nice but when you get stuck while attacking ruins it ill try this game looks interesting for me looks like shadows awakening but with blizzard like graphics which i actually enjoy and without its interesting mechanics fevir maaaan i played lost ark because you gushed so hard it is easily one of the best games i have played i wanted to play even on your first video now i have a huge la shaped hole in my life is this gonna fix it the quality of your videos never fails man always look forward to them offering a different form of buying your product is a legit business strategy it has several consequences that invariably influences the end product it could work damn i love your videos and how you get me to think hey maybe i should play this game damn no click to move that leaves me out left arm is paralyzed to bad because i was getting pretty hyped to try this one out looks like torchlight and diablo 3 but man that gender lock is irritating istok means east now you know ill keep an eye on this but until coop comes im not super interested love the gameplay graphics and arpgs in general i love the art style this looks like a basic mobile game youre over selling it i know you probably get this a lot ive been following you forever but man so hard to jump in on a sponsored game mobile game disguised as premium pc title interdesting i played about 10hrs last testing window i felt like it was an entire waste of time all of it seems like they have some great ideas this game might be what the arpg genre needs stopped at wargaming it kinda looks like they did a reverse diablo immortal and ported a mobile arpg to pc with a 30 box price the shop at 940 the hub and the ui while in the hub look exactly like a mobile game the services talked about at 105 seem like they could very easily become p2w i hope im just being cynical and this game turns out to be a good thing but seeing as how this company is known for making p2w mobile games its hard to be optimistic boring and slow and asdw move alright fuck this game im actually really interested in this will probably have to wait until i get paid next week to grab it but ill definitely be giving this a try cheers for the video man even if its just a sponsor need to confirm on this one is this game playable offline remind me about this game 23 years from now so glad im subbed to you you always bring me the freshest new games straight out the oven this looks awesome good luck with b2p it will go f2p sooner or later if they want people to actually play i really wish they went f2p im very poor irl and i really want to try this game out it looks okay from the footage alone it looks pretty good do you know wether there will be a console release once the game is finished honestly this reminds me a lot of action rpgs on the phone just without the p2w aspects small hub everything is a click away gender locked classes under the pretext of its a hero not a class d and a lot of grinding i hope its fun will be looking forward to see what you think of it when you explore the game better not game developers game developers ok guys lets make an rpg that either looks like wow or diablo i dont know im not feeling it with this game at all wargamings hands being on this has me really suspicious after years of wot and wows so are you able to remap keys for this game im super interested in this but inability to change controls would be a deal breaker for me pve battlerite thats what ive been wanting o i dont really like buying early access though unless im missing something your armour doesnt change appearance throughout the game except for skins thats a bit meh from my perspective the ad wouldve been more convincing if you spent less time talking about the polish or chose 1 minute of video that didnt use keep it clean down there this aint no pigsty on loop as a way to drive men mad and into the embrace of cthulhu can you talk about loot mtx so this is skill based instead of loot ill wait till you confirm the feel of multilayer no character customization thats a shame anyway as ive gotten older ive come to welcome any returns within the game industry from freemium to polished and complete buy to play releases but sadly this game is competing with lost ark for my attention and that ultimately does it in with games like nioh 2 coming out sometime this year mortal kombat 11 releasing in five days risk of rain 2 and sekiro already in my hands and more on the way there will be no shortage of quality games to keep my attention and pass the time until lost ark launches in na i think if pagan hit my radar during a dry release year i would have easily and gladly thrown 30 at them in desperation but because what i really want from pagan is just lost ark theres little reason to do so when i know exactly what i want is already on the way this is from the company that sells gold ammo in world of tanks im fully expecting very aggressive monetization from cosmetics to actual heroes and even p2w would definitely not go for the early access considering this companys track record steam says its single player d hey man w you covering lost ark and this game im surprised to see you havent covered grim dawn yet with their new expansion maybe give it a go i think you might like it ive always wanted a pve battlerite didnt even mention the chicken 010 also didnt say peace 210 i tried in in alpha and its not good controls are very bad and feels very mobile phoneish it does look polished but the gameplay looks very mediocre obviously thats just my opinion but ill check out oath like some of the other comments have said alternatively ill just wait and pray for lost ark this is feverpeace did you drop that seriously considering buying this first time ever id commit to an early access game as always great informative video fvr been subbed for you for 5 years and your level of polish and editing is beyond some 1m yters keep it up the class system is a turn off for me characters really who even want to play games where you are same with other thousands of players i want my own character my unique look and skills if i want to play some random pve focused game then there are already better games poe warframe destiny and league of legends ps i am not a part of livestock to be the same with others i know most of players are like low iq animals who will eat any shit with lootboxes but this is my opinion and i am tired of how game developers keep thinking that all customers are idiots the real question from me is whats gonna keep people playing this game the art style is nice and all and the combatcontrols seem interesting but by looking at the steam reviews people already feel that the game is lackluster with content and that it feels like a mobile game the fact that this game cost 2699 and has microtransactions makes it feel more like a cash grab than a passion project if the game goes f2p i might check it out but at the moment ill stay away hmmm interesting so is coop active or no on steam it says this is a single player game im sorry but did i got it right premiumstyle game with paid expansions and overwatchlolhots like microtransactions yea it definitely smells like wargaming i would prefer ea over them it looks awesome but damn 30 thats so expensive especially for rpg standards also a price of 27 eur for a mobile game hell no the game locks you up while doing attack animation it is furthest you can imagine from action rpg i think it was a new paladins champion oh fuck this looks good i agree w everyone make a video on oath spread the word its lookin promising finally an arpg not trying to be fucking d2 with the shitty skills and dumb ass health globes 356 hey its fury from darksiders nice addition edit they also have death too looks like he lost a bit of weight though battlerite rpg basically based on the gameplay looks fun i agree id rather pick a main to focus on rather than having to switch between every character two of the casters looked really cool and id rather just try them out idk make a video for oath mmorpg help get the word out for this fantastic mmo will there be a linux version in the future fevir now buy me the game looks ace integrate blockchain assets using enjin and this would be ground breaking isometric vomits game costs money the ingame skins costs money quartaly updates costs money there are better alternatives right now well this looks cool i wonder if ill like it stream looks right it looks a lot like torchlight the wasd movement with the mouse to aim controls are usually used in bulletstorm shooters i really want to like path of exiles but i just cant stand its dull and grim artistic design so this would be a very interesting alternative you should make a video about oath its currently on kickstarter looks promising and could use some more word of mouth 1st time seeing this looks like it plays and controls like tree of saviour neat hope it comes to ps4 sometime looks really good and i love the idea of the combat and the fact that loot only shows up after you have despatched all the enemies alone makes me want to play it ah yes the keyword online a stamp of quality greatness and longevity like the recent revelation online bless online this looks hella torchlight meets diablo 3 and wargaming being a publisher has a decent track record if u ignore their own games 252 welp im aboard now i have long grown out of point and click movement and actively avoid anything requiring it have grown into the actiony side of things was watching just to see what was up with the game but that bit of info alone has made me interested tested the game played around 9h it is pretty bland and boring btw to easy two things when you say paid mini releases are you saying were going to have to pay for updates also how do you unlock characters just by progressing looks interesting but will wait for more people trying it out and the coop aspect of it all but i love that it has wasd movement and is a payed product for once min 359 did you just described path of exile fighting style at first i was like wow this game looks interesting then you mentioned its made by war gaming and my hopes just immediately evaporated still watched until the end but if i know anything about war gaming it is the insane amount of microtransactions and grind in their games i dont even think ill bother installing it this is what i needed after the disaster that is diablo lately feels like an arpg version of battlerite thats a good thing at least for me nice going to download right now been keeping my eye on this for a while hopefully it will hold me over till lost ark releases in the us what appeals most to me here is it being a new coop game that is pve focused as apposed to all the coop pvp rpgs we have been getting where are all these pvp games i love pvp and havent seen a pvp focused rpg since dark age of camelot this looks like a nice aoe fest diablo immortal game thanks i dont mean to be rude but i tend not to watch sponsored videos cuz i never know your real opinion ill wait for a proper video in poland this game is too expensive wtf is this price for god damn early access not worth maybe for half the price it would be somehow appealing where is broccoli oo ey why on steam says singleplayer put it on switch and ill be sold yo do you still play dauntless ive seen your video on it but talk about the game just kinda dieddown hey fevir tell me this game has controller support twin stick and its an instant buy for the fiancee and i only bad thing about this game is the big price tag with games like path of exile being f2p these priced games need to be incredible and it really doesnt look like it to throw 30 at it boring item sistem and brings no new mechanics to the genre why would anyone buy this not even anything about making you own distinct build but shitty heroes like battlerite or something do they even know why people play arpgs whats the selling point i dont get it at all seems like a disapointment after a few hours lol at the spinning i played the alpha of this it had none of these features will probably give this another look this is exactly the type of arpg i was looking for i hate the cleaning the floor super fast type of gameplay to me a slow tactical approach is way more fun than just rolling your face on the keyboard and killing everything it makes you appreciate more the animations and plan accordingly to what is happening will definitely try this game looks great my wife and i have been searching for a new game to play together thanks for introducing this to us well pick up copies tonight wow this actually looks like a blizzard game lol i like the fact that the player skill is more important than items and builds that was the thing i didnt like about diablo and poe i want some challenging pve not grinding items so then i can just spam my way through a level with the same rotation a bit off topic thats also one of the things that draw my attention from lost ark apart from the obvious spectacular visuals so i will be definitely checking it out as i am starving for some good fantasy rpg thx for the video i was slightly interested until i saw the 30 entrance fee and the reviews saying they were bored in 2 hours i think its to expensive wow this looks legit i havent even heard of this one at all also has a bit of warframe feel to it with the mission structure which i really like oh wasd means the game could be played with a twinstick set up for controllers the bar is giving me anxiety tbh what you said about diablo at 8 minutes was so accurate you really know your stuff this defenealty looks interesting will you have a gameplay video on this in the future kinda like a after 1 month release goddamnit every time i watch a video of yours on a new game it cost me money i see what you ment yesterday with there is a game youll hear about in a few days that might hold you over for a bit do wish it was a bit quicker and hope as you said that its not required to play specific characters due to the challenge and you dont feel punished playing the character you like i just noticed the progress bar on the bottom of the screen i wonder how long thats been there someone should make a proper moba with battlerite controls first where do you find these games this is great and all but who sits on the iron throne at the end of the series it wasnt a bad game by any means i enjoyed it far more than poe but 30 bucks for early access makes me pause literally just finished your last video damn dude wasd is so comfy i actually forgot to mention that the game is a pure buy to play no micro transaction game i played it for a few hours more on stream after this video and unlocked another hero it doesnt take as long if you know what missions to do heres a link to the vod of the stream httpswwwtwitchtvvideos417681703 but yeah no cash shop should have been another pro on the list shitty game worst than some mobile games this game looks pretty fun and polished but my godisometric rpg movement with wasdyou fucking monsters should be put down why does this give mobile game vibe god ure tounge must be very big its so far up the devs ass polished game bullshite no alpha game has ever been polished youtube please ban shrill reviews please if this is a review than i am antonio banderas this guy took money to make a little publicity to pagan online actually the game itself suck big times period looks like devilian to me and that didnt end well can you do a brief over view of the full release version please and thank you mr peon another diablo 4 style of game i really hate the way you talk its so annoying didnt buy because there isnt any armor to upgrade only weapons ugh this is a fucking mobile game and you know it thanks bud i didnt even know about this game but will definitely be checking it out now really a wg title that is not microtransaction needed to actually play and progress in a timely manner ok im a lil confused which came first was it this game or diablo cause why this game feel somewhat similar to it lazy peon i only play games you recommend thank you so much for your videos i struggled so much trying to find the right arpg for me i was itching bad this video really helped only 20 bucks on steam wow once again thanks oh yay its a shitty version of diablo 3 no thanks best way to do a sponsor vid keep up the good work thelazypeon i like your videos but my lazy to say anything first ive heard of this game thanks bro could have bought the game right away but no multiplayer ready sad while i havent played it myself and i was interested for awhile there are far too red flags pointing towards cash shop micro transactions and f2p mechanics for it to be acceptable by any means the way characters are unlocked by premium currency and are currently heavily time locked to grinding out the shards to me that screams cash shop you can spend time unlocking or spend 510 to unlock them instantly they are also currently advertising emotes and skins on steam so again cash shop it is or will be live service trash with mobilef2p micro transactions on the way if they arent in the game already if they arent in yet then expect them at release or a month or two later the game looks great graphics wise but everything is pointing towards a f2p with a 20 price tag on it unlike a lot of the comments personally this definitely did come off as sponsored this was a soft ball review of the game and should have been far more critical just watching the video even had to watch netflix just to watch this can you control movements with mouse like diablo or is it wsad only please tell me masha has a bear pet the games godawful dont waste your money very diablo like with modern design and sorta league like characters i like it and been waiting for something like this but i will never buy another early access game this looks like its ten thousand times worse than poe you already know there are gonna be packs on steam to unlock the classes instantly if they already havent added them i thought it was gonna be free since it doesnt seem like a game to pay for but i am intrigued but ill wait till it is on sale hey peon ive been following you for a while now love your videos as you give good insight to games especially the mmorpg kind ive played eso for the last 5 years but in my opinion theyre destroying the game i was wondering what mmo you would recommend as the best to convert to locked characters this looks worse than poe in terms of monetization and that games f2p lol why still online i want some great hacknslash arpg in breed of dnd diablo with sacred and wow influence in big world with proffesions dungeons and npc followers indies or not that would be just great a mix between d3 and torchlight seems cool i dont bother with early access games anymore but i appreciate you covering it looks promising when they full release it around 300 people playing worldwide dead game its good strategy game but sorry i dont install this lack of customization is whats making me not want to buy this game you forgot to tell everyone you cant change your armoronly your weapons oh so the belarusian wargaming is realsing the game be prepared for a lot of tricky milking actionsnot saying its gonna be pure paytowin but anyone who ever played any of their games can confirm this made on unreal e 4 everthing i need to know to keep my distance no create a character thank you for doing such an honest first impressions i will be getting this game as it seems quite enjoyable and refreshing currently i am unable to buyplay this game in new zealand i get the ussual steam page an error was encountered while processing your request this item is currently unavailable in your region i also cannot buy it directly from wargamingnet this item is not available for you please browse the shops website to find other interesting offers asymmetric just learned everything is on client side happy hacking its not available in my region that sucks but i like the game based on your review well im thirty seconds in and know im buying a new game do you know if there is controller support or maybe any chance to release on consoles wargaming no thx played world of tanks for a couple of years and i had nuff of them this game isnt for me and honestly i think this game shows what a sad direction we are heading in for gaming everything has to be instant instant unlocks instant op abilities flashy moves and all that not to talk about pay to win mechanics which im unsure if this game has im talking generally where is the sense of starting a game from scratch take diablo 2 as a reference you start the game using a club and a broken shield and your starting abilities arent impressive at all so many games right now want to give the player everything from the start and i just lose all interest to play perhaps its the younger generation that has lost all patience and wants everything instantly youre low level and you want abilities to make the screen shake look even cooler and impactful when in reality this isnt what will make you enjoy the game on a later level the real joy comes from killing that one tough mob with low level gear and having him drop something a little be whats the point of watching a preview when it is sponsord too expensive for early access i would rather find a job as a game tester instead so i can get paid for testing instead of paying for testing i can see mobile game level mtx bullshit from just 15 min video idk if you are gonna play more or not and if you found out by now but you can sell items without going to a vendor just hold ctrl and left click on the item also heart expands and deals more damage if you whip it then again i guess you unlocked who you wanted to play by now i realy love the controls since battlerite i miss these in every isometric rpg and even mobas like lol would be great with these what turns me off is thisbare minimum in everything the limited number of skills armor does not change your looks very limited customization with most upgrades being number tweaks the spawning from enemies out of thin air it is just walking into a slightly more open area and than bam enemies you killed them bam more enemies even skeletons appear like that which they could change to them coming out of the ground spiders crawling from the trees or why not having them be there in the first place it is frustrating how these games keep going this simple rout as torchlight frontiers does when we had great games like torchlight 2 that made a better job at this but sadly not with that movement system looks like a cartoony diablo 3 jess i need something like that in my android device wargamingnet is the publisher hell no never again i thought this game didnt feel good to play felt no impact on strikes etc so its a no go for me as a hack and slay wsad why no blood no thanks back to path of exile it looks like they used a bunch of paragons assets i like it pagan online except it isnt online this is a top notch review im glad i watched before buying i felt like after watching this that i knew the game enough to like it or not but it wasnt spoiled like most other watch before you buys this is only solo for now this one looks quite cool but not going to drop 27 for early access the main hub of this game reminds me too much of the warrior order hall from legion hey are you going to test air open beta on thai i really want to know your opinion about its current state looks beautiful butno world map not interested a game without a soul refunded it after 1 hour why havent youtube been recommending me your new videos i always have nothing to watch goddammit youtube glad to see you back at full speed lol look slike pegi5 arpg and their asking full price for a arpg when thres path of exile on the market got to be fcking kidding haha it looks rather polished tho some of the ui elements look too mobile friendly hate those hp bars tbh probably has no endgame and replayability compared to path of exile if it would be free to play and cosmetics as their monetization would probably try it out everytime i hear stylized graphics i just hear polygons lazy design and budget cuts looks like a single player game where were the other players nope because it will be full of microtransactions and lootboxes peon can you try looking at era of legends its a mobile mmorpg game thats got that wow feel it looks like its built to become f2p with a cash shop b2p no thx looks like a mix of lost ark poe and paladins hardly to understand his accent ugh godanother top down sorry but there are just too many game looks good diablo immortal honestly couldnt interest me less and poe feels a little too dated for me this one seems fresh smooth and fun ill give it a shot came here because lost ark is still not released in eu been seeing this game a lot would pick it up if mp was intact but i dont need another single player game so glad youre making videos regularly again and that youre getting sponsorship bruh check wow ascension their new servers are blowing up its lit stumbled upon revenant class in a game called skyforge thought how the f i never heard about it maybe peon has never covered it quack you did in 2015 when the game was beta would it be possible for you to cover it again to see if something changed looks cool but steam does not offer any gameplay videos so i am not sure if the game is worth starting thanks in advance phew you look so bored in this how long till this goes f2p hey thanks a lot for this great video and all the info i also made one httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqoyldiwbonw it just doesnt seem to be as good or popular as yours would you have any tips for this beginner compared to you anyway thank you hey thanks a lot for this great video and all the info i also made one httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqoyldiwbonw it just doesnt seem to be as good or popular as yours would you have any tips for this beginner compared to you anyway thank you looks really solid and polished for an early access game characters look cool and very differentiated from each other too great video as always the character with the whip reminds me of the seraphim from sacred another p2w piece of s sadly this game isnt coming to asia first coming into the video i was like lazypeon youre too late to make an impressions video but i actually liked the playthrough with some of your agony not to say in the very least we enjoy watching someone having a hard time while playing as it really helps the viewers how much of a difficulty it would be coming into the game for the first time so far best review yet ty whos playing this over torchlight frontiers nobody thats who thought i might give this game a go or even just check out the cost but sadly us australians cant buy it im sure there are some workarounds to get it but i am not that desperate where does the online portion come into play forgot to mention not available yet in aus store sigh i tried this during the cbt and got bored in the first stage not really sure why i couldnt finish the video feels and looks like a mobile game tbh i wasnt excited about getting a game from a belarussian publisher i dont trust tech from companies under totalitarian govnts but this game was shiny enough to get me to try it i did some research didnt turn up anything on wargraming i still havent hit 2 hrs yet on steam i cant refund if i play more than that its actually pretty good even though wasd is a little clunky i prefer it to click to move because with click to move i always end up accidently moving into bad without meaning to i also like that gameplay is instanced it stops me from getting sucked in too much and i can pace myself better the arpg scene is going to be intense this year poe is king lost arkh will probably come to the west torchlight frontiers is releasing and youve got this game it will be interesting to see how everything plays out once the dust settles poe may suffer death by a thousand cuts like wow did in 20102012 when all the ftp mmos came out ive been enjoying this game though still getting used to the wasd controls it did help when i mapped the attacks to my razor mouse keypad though i love the art style and feel of the game and i am loving that its not another micro transaction game this is definitely worth checking out for anyone who enjoys arpg ps dodgeuuuuggghhh d all these games suck mmorpgs are so over saturated just another crappy mmo that will be averaging 100 players on steam charts just play wow or osrs wtf with that name dont play any shit related to wargaming they have the shittiest customer service in human history im always slightly concerned when a game gives you 11k gear score before level 5 it is generally a sign they have gone mental with scaling and are looking to abuse human need for big numbers but then it is an arpg so what was i expecting game isnt that good much older games are way better then online why cant play with other people peon you probably did not notice but there are 3 difficulties you can pick at the table the game is rather obnoxious of very hard also the game really ramps up when you get to the desert zone the fact that it plays with keyboard movement and mouse aim already puts it on a positive status for me the pure clicking ones arent my thing cant play it in australia wtf game is not available in my region anyone got info on this from australia not available in australia this games not available in my region on steam so its region blocked is says its not available in my region wtf 2 months from now hey guys another check back on pagan online and why you shouldnt play it buy to play has daily login pack owned by wargaming i played enough world of warships to be dubious about how this goes in the future not available in australia yet it seems peon you looked like a viking with that beard hahaha seems like a mobile arpg not a bad thing but yeah they gotta do better can you play with wsad instead of mouse yes but mobile is better review video of pagan online sponsored by pagan online no thanks why it doesnt have in malaysia and singapore this item is currently unavailable in your region rip you playing the air th beta at all its actually pretty well optimized and fun to play only issue is somequestionable dev decisions in regards to time locking the servers to only be open 8 hours a day why is this called an pagan online but theres no other players this game had close beta also with random keys given away to ppl who prejoined on the site i think this game would be more successful as f2p with micro transactions i wouldnt buy the game however if i played and felt it was good i would happily spend money to access other characters to save some time on grinding why is this called online does it actually have any online gameplay other than the co op they will be adding last 20 or so videos i watched about this game are paid promotions wargaming spending that i hope the devs are reading the comments here please dont make the item description windows white if the game is dark and nowhere else in the ui is a big white space your eyes hurt if you mouse over items quickly and a big bright spot flashes if its sponsored peon ups his enthusiasm a whole lot stay awhile and listen to my tale of microtransaction and monetization this game was not good sorry chief lost ark hurry tf up so far this looks like a facebook rpg that runs on a browserand that is bad whats this an isometric rpg not developed in korea thank god i like the torchlightesque cartoony art style of the game and any mmo that doesnt have those stupid looking plastic sex doll character models is a plus for me edit also for an early access game early access is always a huge red flag on steam it looks pretty damn great unlock the guy with the hammer first you can unlock the other characters quickly hes the last starting character you can unlock game looks good but im not a huge fan of having to unlock characters would of been better imp if you unlocked sub classes instead path of exile is better appreciate your honesty and your obvious very true and non biased review i shall be subbing to you keep it up i wish more reviewers where like you is there co op yet and due out next year satanism online i dislike this guy a lot utterly mediocre not skilled not funny not intelligent nothing interesting to say nothing meaningful to say first impressions as literaly first 2 secs impression fucking hell with youtube it keeps recomanding me this guys utterly useless videos and i just click on them right away seeing it s about a mmo but then i realize it s that literally lazy peon guy looter games need to make a priority to make inventory management snappy as an example for all the love i could share about borderlands 2 its kinda shitty in that respect with the selling and whatnot and then there games like division for all the hate i can share about it comparing looting and marking for junk is snappy and it makes cleanup easier i hope they have something like that here if youre selling in batch that issue peon showed where its waiting for server wont be as aggravating finally i uh im honestly surprised the video is sponsored but it really seems legit with the cons list and everything nicely done unfortunately this game is terribly boring looks cool like an alternative to diablo iii will try it wait a secondisnt there already the game called pagan online some typical korean mmo sandbox or whatever until they make more customizations skills transmog sets classes etc its pure waste of 27 euros im dead and im fucked game feels great to play and looks good but i hate all the knockdown effects that really cripple melee yet another arpg where ranged attacks are clearly better than melee will designers of arpg never make melee great again hmmm premise characters you cant fool me i know what you really are a mobile game everything in this game screams darksiders to me im actually pretty impressed with this game might pick it up later is this game not avaliable in asia completely agree with your first 2 cons combat doesnt feel impactful enough and i hate being stuck with the starting characters and the more interesting ones hidden behind a long grind wall tbh i couldnt get past the 5th hour with the available characters could be a cool f2p game but not a game i gonna spent 27 for xd reminds me of diablo sorry for the comment spam but thanks for stating clearly its sponsored would be better if you got sponsored by gear instead of games imo i just cant trust sponsored game previews but youve got bills to pay too i get it youre still the only mmorpg channel i follow so d keep going even peon sold himself to make another 2048th paid review of this p2w crap on yt i just hope it was worth i refunded game is totally shit im never playing a mmo with weekly checklists dailies or login rewards again awesome review as always got me hyped to play this gamebut because i live in aus cant get it yetshame try air no new looks when equipping new armors im out peon i think i might wanna be the woman with the whip me youre inner desires are leaking out oo pagaon online yet looks like a single player game the game looks beautiful too bad you cant create your own character this is why i will never get into it what is your native language i bought the game because of you but why is there no referral link or something so you would also profit from it in the end i wouldnt have known about it if it wasnt for you too bad mate this will be ptw watch it its wargameing after all i dunno man i actually like the idea of unlocking the other characters as you progress not a fan of having too many choices right out of the gate because it detracts from the feeling of accomplishment thats just me of course im sure most others agree with you i love the way you do first impressions just play it and a minimal comments good or bad this is the fourth first impression of this game i watch but its the first one that made me really want to get it expeditions and assassinations will let u unlock faster the heroes this whole video felt like one of those trash ass youtube ads ahh yes the ubiquitous hammer dwarf a staple of any good rpg the game looks realy good and other than the cons you mentioned with which i wholeheartedly agree what i would like a few more character diversity like a undead reaper female with a scythe that looks scary af or a female in giant swords or duals i personaly tend to go that route in all my mmos or games and for someone like me it means a lot if i have a character that is visually cool to me for which i will grind and invest time in isnt that the same guy who said neverwinter online is worth playing classes might be locked atm due to it being early access and not a finished product this is the kind of game you announce at blizzcon not a fucking mobile junk thirty bucks is pretty steep for an unfinished product and poe is free nice job dude thank you for saying your full impressions with the bad sides as well instead of just highlighting the good because its a sponsored video ive played this game a lot even before seeing your video and even though i find it very fun i feel like its missing the rpg in arpg with the lack of builds and spell choice feels more like a moba type game and all of the other content creators ive seen fail to mention this even though some of them were pure arp channels which was absurd to me you are the first one to bring this up even though your channel rarely covers this type of games keep up the good and honest work im sure a lot of your fanbase appreciates it as much as i do this is the best ea game ive tried in a long time it is well worth the money ignore the negative reviews and try it for yourself but be ware the beginning is very slow and it gets faster the more you play its an generic diablo 3 clone why is your chair and you vibrate is it with a dick this guy is a perfect example of what mac worth a buy is talking about notice all the cut edits because he sucks or the game is bad notice how these idiots are sucking up to the devs the review is useless crap i do not think this game is out in australia yet and i would love to give this game a play does anyone know when its going to be released here peon you should give spacelords a try d well i would like to play pagan but 26 for early access is just too risky imo makes video saying he will do rare sponsored videos so he can do ones he enjoysdoes two in a row what kind of combat is it game looks interesting enough smooth but hate the fact you can only pick 3 classes at the start but if its tied to early access and not the main game then i dont mind hi i am from australia and i cant see pagan online on steam early access or wargaming sites is this region locked im glad youre making bank from these dead on arrival games d as someone whos watching for you and not the games make that boyy diablo 3 hearthstone f huh an early access game that doesnt look early access for the most part meanwhile weve been getting full priced games thatre actually early access reminds me a bit of torchlight ii nice vid was a bit in two minds about this game but might be a worth while thing to mess around on also nice to see a handsome gamer answer to your thumbnail without even bothering to watch the whole video fuck no it is not worth playing its on a phone come back to me when you make an mmo for a pc also one that doesnt steal money from your wallet fuck mobile phone games ever go away now not an mmo coop coming soon lol anyway if its b2p on steam so you can just play for 2 hours which should be plenty of time to realize its garbage and get a refund xdddd youre my go to guy for game first looks you make me laugh and are informative i am sooo psyched for this game if it ever releases in aus this game is not available in your region dam you steam i want to play this game just my pc cant handle it i think ccccccccccccccccccccc you should try the mmorpg called tibia its quite a unique game even on mobile developers are getting smarter they give the feel that you get lots of stuffs and they do but when you want to compete in the high level you have to pay this game feels the same dont bother its region locked another downtime game between poe leagues nice extremely smooth gameplay the character sliding on the ground the devs should implement a choice on how you want to play with wasd or with the mouse only much like victor vran has where you can choose out of 3 different combat mechanics this because there are actual one handed gamers out there like myself that would enjoy a game like this but using wasd and mouse together is impossible so devs go implement that and you might take my dollars crafting rng using crafting currency to unlock a loot box even if theres no real money involved games that use this rng in their game progression are like repellent to me im not into chasing a dopamine that comes from opening rng loot especially when there is clear effort into making the opening super flashy and fancy i guess i will be playing this game until lost ark is released on the west thanks for the update mate always willing to support a developer who allows content creators to fairly critique their game looks like a fun game and going to pick it up nice work peon look nice but you said wargaming and thats all i needed to knowfuck this game best arpg out at the moment this game at least has mechanics compared to others and i love how you dont kill every mob with 1 hit while face rolling your face on the keyboard such as with poe and d3 and good boss fights is not in all regions on steam you should play air or ascent i will check it out i love story driven arpg sees wargamings name i gotta buy this 30 dollar early access is a no go no matter what i was curious about this game so i checked steam and apparently i cant buy it or even look at the steam page in australia i playing pagan online for a while and this game is really fun it always keeps you in the right mood only handicap is the level designs as an arpg fan it is like a medicine for me right now wargamingnet no thanks lol i mean if it was open world and not act and mission based sure not available in aus steam store not sure if itd be worth buying from the site then rip gooood morning peon did u try out skyforge currently if u didnt pls try and make a video plllllssss good content as always stay that way not available in your region wipes tear tlp approved me want it me play it a few things to note its a diablo clone its by wargaming who makes pay to win games also mobile games just as ptw as their pc games id expect by release the game will be ptw in some way like buyable loot boxes or purchasable hero shards id honestly avoid this till full release and than a few months afterwards incase they try to sneak drop ptw shit like call of duty bo 4 did tldw 1129 for his review who the hell wants screen shake in the game it gets old really fast and is really eyestraining if they add it they have an option to opt out of it biggest con for me right after the start was it has no click to move only wasd with a game that has no rotationg camera for me that was a killer argument since w has always been movr forward to me and in an isometric game its more fighting with the movement than with the mobs its incredibly a paid review what about the pay to win is there any such great video nice looking game ui design is awesome i want to play but does it have any multiplayer game style also you didnt mention about combat deepness i mean does skills chain each other or talent tree changes the way we play a lot etc wish these cunts would let the rest of the world play game looks pretty good so far definitely worth adding to the watch list to wait n see n keep track of its progress have to agree though being restricted to just 3 choices is quite limiting particularly if youre locked in 1 character for quite awhile its said singleplayer not multi a bit borderline cartooney dauntlesslolpaladins clay dough cartooney colors needs a bit tweaking its regionlocked qq honestly this look great but not as good as other arpg out there poe outclass it and it is free dammit its not available for me yet an error was encountered while processing your request this item is currently unavailable in your region looks interesting but character and abilities animations are just god awful hope they will improve when game is out of early access cant wait for this to come out in my country he is definitely a lot nicer than normal when its sponsored loving the beard peon the game seems to be not available in australia for some reason i checked steam and it shows this item is currently unavailable in your region pagan online alright we need atheist online apparently not available yet in seaoceania their store pages are all down was really interested in giving it a shot no idea whats happening now xd pagan mean pay in spanish lol so they pay me to play it how is this online even just adding co op to a single player designed game isnt going to turn it into an mmo been playing this game for the past week and was wondering if youd be doing a review always enjoy hearing what you have to say and seeing your reactions to stuff im dead and im fucked is this necrophilia could you review about air httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuchhd2cpswt1304s visually this game looks pretty amazing it is sort of a bummer to be locked to 3 classes when you start it does make sense that you can only pick 1 but the last thing i want to do when buying a new game it be forced to play a class i have no interest in maybe after i beat the game with one i like to check it out but when first learning about it i would like to play the class that im interested in where is a chivalrous knight character none of these characters appeal to me i really enjoyed this game until the point where i was getting stunned petrified and ccd to the point where i literally was losing massive amounts of health and couldnt do anything about it many of the larger enemies have attacks that are impossible to avoid because they have telegraphed attacks chained so that you can dodge one but then get ploughedand in many cases instantly killedby the rest its fucking infuriating to the point where i gave up ill come back to it once it gets balanced a little better clicks thumbnail pagan online is a brandnew multiplayer isometric clicks back lets be fair if this was not sponsored would peon have spent an hour throwing a whip over and over and over again what they should do is to make it so you can choose between all 8 characters from the start but you have to buy the rest once you picked a class dude i cant even play 90 percent of the games you review because i dont play on pc but i still watch all your vids cuz they are just that entertaining cant access it from australia the question is is it good enough to leave poe and come here why exactly are they advertising an emote feature for a single player game much less calling it pagan online for that boss at 10 minutes you pull him through the red skull circles on the floor and they put a stacking bleed on the boss last boss of act one is basically the skeleton king from act 1 of diablo 247 really now you call that character valeria even using purple and black for her icons might aswell call her valla and make a 11 copy the whole game and company lost my respect at this point and im glad ive seen this before i gave them my money 416 so i was selling stuff well before the merchant p made me wonder what the point of the merchant was when i got him lol some words looks similar to my own language who developed the game the church wants to know your location a game that is made in serbia in my city woah woah wait i even was at their hq amazing people hope this game kicks off unavailable in australia reee mate you deserve a community medal or some shit for playing literally every trash and smash mmo on the planet so we dont have to damn im sad that serbian developers mad head are so horrid at innovation and handling the user interface of their games i really do hope its just early access and they think of something thatll make the game original cause this just looks like d3 with a better artstyle and more fun heroesalso hoping that the ui gets a complete overhaul this shit looks like they used most of their assets from a mobile game or something eeeck so basically shallower poe with better graphics if i trusted it wouldnt go p2w i might have given it a try but the limited inventory space and locked heroes for some reason make me think therell be p2w elements introduced eventually pass for now for me its still strange that ill have to unlock characters in a buy to play game for anyone curious this game is actually pretty excellent its not incredible but its super polished and is definitely worth a purchase if you are into arpgs i dont think its going to convert anyone that doesnt like arpgs but if you do youll love it dude its okay to do a sponsor your actions will speak louder than words whether youll cover the game anyway or not as long as youre honest and have integrity nobody will mind take care of yourself dont have any guilt sponsorships are a good thing so long as you dont sell out dope beard man good video but the game seems like it is more of a mobile fit meh it doesnt really look like a game i would be interested in playing whenever i hear pagan i instantly remember like a pagan to anyone idc peon just give us video about anygame weekly or everyday xd youtube nowadays 2 boring bought the game myself and really enjoying it since the combat is pretty fluent just dont have too much time atm as i would like to so just 22 hours in imo biggest downside is that u have to choose 1 class and are forced to play it until u lock another class though the 2nd class u can get within several hours of playtime i was lucky choosing anya and i love her playstyle looking forward to the addition of an actual skill tree for more diversity and coop mode we will see what the developers will add as content so the endgame will be challenging and long term motivation 2699 for a fucking early access game how about no still isnt lost ark can it be played with a controller kinnda seems like it has twin stick shooter style controls damn youve grown quite a beard nixxiom would be proud i literally purchased this after watching your video so promotional video win i took a lot of what you said in the video into consideration while playing and i say that i am enjoying it immensely in fact i cant wait for the full game to come out it is a pretty solid game for what it costs this game looks fucking awesome its actually seems to be good all they need to do is clear the moving animations when changing direction while walking wg game no pay2winhmmmmmm selling out once again just curious is this game controller compatible looks like it might handle well with a controller where are the other players or is it like path of exile i really like this game probably will buy it when i buy a pc wargaming lol im out you forgot to mention the clunky unreal movements of characters the legs moves faster or slower than they should when character goes back his legs seems like moving forward not backward the only issue i see with the game is that you have to choose your first hero without having the possibility to try them out first so you pretty have to choose on look and not gameplay by the way to get shard to unlock new hero you need to do assassination mission that you unlock with key that you drop mainly on mission and not campaign battle the first assassination mission gives you like 20 shard to get the cool looking priest who need 30 shards to unlock from what i played the next set of assassination mission give you shard for the first three hero the game is grindy in the end but well it is an hack and slash so it is supposed too moreover no micro transaction so the grindiness isnt a tool to make you buy more and milk your money like a cow for now cause yes we have to remember this is wargamingnet who is publishing the game the kind of publisher who make you pay for special bullets in world of tank for real still cant believe it can exist but mad head games seems never believe somebody that is sponsored to do a review gonna ignore this reviewfirst impression me good game not bad remind me of grim down oh the price is accpetablemm not bad game play why not it is good me hearing early access nope no shit mate i know where this is going i will be back after it finish early accessso a year or two and maybe maybe it will be finish dev why what did we do wrong me u did early access blame anthem looking forward to this game for quite some time now i hope ill be able to check it out soon nice video and as usual valid points mentioned 0336 you know you play a russian game when the crafting menu has a hammer and sickle symbol when do we get a pagan min online lootbox generic shit i cant really see this as a paytoplay game especially not at 27 is everyone sponserd by these guys this game looks right up my alleyi think i may purchase early access yeah that character unlocking bs looks annoying they should have a short intro quest where you have to take each character for a minifight just to get the feel for it before you make a choice might give this one a go if youre an aussie like me the game is not available in our region in either steam or the wargaming site so dissapointed i wanted to give this game a go and no i will not do vpns they come with too many risks and cost too much ill just have to wait i just hope the wait isnt like lost ark online thats if we even ever get the bloody game has he ever done one for allods online just curious i bought itfeels like todays mobile games with better graphicsand got my money back refunded that beard tho is it on ps4 basically if its early access or out of asia then dont bother you can farm the shards for the other champs with the keys from the missions you make its like 2030 shards per run every boss hunt gives you especially shards for one other champ this game looks like a mobile game in every shitty way oceania got shafted this item is currently unavailable in your region there is one good reason why not to take sponsorhip and that is your integrity independence of giving opinion free of any ties to company with their own selfish motives it puts a lot more weight behind your opinion because despite you saying they didnt demand anything you might be feeling obliged to give them good review for sponsorship even if it is subconscious you really should read some material about ethics and why independent journalism is important or in more similar fashion independent reviews yes this is not review it is opinion piece but as soon as you mentioned sponsor your opinion loses any form of validity in my book since you essentially were paid for it even if it is not with money i have nothing against you taking sponsorship but i do have against garbage like i was gonna play it anyway so i thought why not because that is how bit of consumer freedom and independent reviews and pieces die and you dont want the world without those no offe basically another crappy action rpg without real loot instead crafting garbage shit drops 30 for this poop locked camera thats where i stopped watching this is a pc port of a mobile game i wouldnt throw around i expect itll get better without this caveat the majority of the game mechanics are built around rngebas boxes and there is little to no depth to animations level design character development or itemization i realize these people pay you but this review is misleading i have put about 5 hours into the game and one thing that i have noticed especially with some of the bigger enemies the outlines on the ground showing the aoe of incoming attacks often dont show the whole area that you will be hit in i agree with you on the dash needing a lower cooldown all in all i am very much enjoying this game and looking forward to seeing how it will progress through early access into full release peon you have to try out outward its an sandbox rpg with dark souls combat there is coopsingleplayer and splitscreen it looks great and its really fun another con id say is being unable to move while attacking it makes the combat feel dull it should be fixed have to buy the game have to buy the characters have to buy the costumes still in early access hardest pass of my fucking life looks like a decent casual arpg lets see how it looks when it gets released lol an arpg with premium classes via pieces you need to collect lemme guess you can save time with a bit of mtx nah im good thank you just play poe diablo already exists though 27 euros thats a joke right when this go f2p i give it a shot lol this game looks boring af im surprised you arent complaining about the fact that the woman uses a whip no offense but the first thing you usually do in every first impression video is complain about a female character being sexualized they def have a good art team and animation team everything seems in your face and cool looking every sponsored video you do is like thats cool thats cool i love your content just something ive noticed video is wonderfully done like always but the game is just meh i was gonna try the game but when i saw 26 euro price tag i changed my mind instantly early access on that price is kinda too much when you see that black desert is a 10 euro per account and lots of times it goes to 50 discount and recently there have been numerous events that gave them for free overall i will keep an eye on it but i dont feel like its going to be in my library any time soon getting that sweet cash peon hey peon love your vids checkout path of exile again plz theyve added so much 6 acts since last you played not my art style no own character creation mixed reviews i wondered when you would cover this game also you cons are spot on hope they change them also you could always write it in the feedback section of their discord wow this game looks good please add korean subtitle i love this game very lonely game despite it having online in the name i just started playing this game yesterday and its a ton of fun if you can get over the wasd controls it has a ton of potential i want to buy this game but im not a fan of early access games since many of them tend to take years to be in a final state or never come out of early access my heart will always belong to path of exile when it comes to isometric rpg games played more then 800 hours in poe and i always come back when a new league is released but i will keep my eye on pagan online since it looks fun and has alot of loot its definitely missing some features but thats just cause early access the game is pretty great and worth the price ive got about 70 hrs gameplay on it so far and its worth it the combat is fantastic and it can actually be pretty hard sometimes its not a afk easymode game finally a game i am interested why do people want to see blood and gore in games i dont get it why is it called pagan online if barely anything about it is online arpgs are in a truly sad state when developers copy diablo 3 there is even a kind of a leoric boss at the end zero creativity trash ive been meaning to try this game for a while now thanks for the first impression video haha i just downloaded this game also really enjoying it xd online without any online or other player action this looks actually fun 145 it says ancient box on croatian fixed moba like characters in arpg no just no finally a is it worth playing that isnt 20 plus minutes good job this looks pretty cool ima try it myself i love how you list gender locked classes on every games cons except when its sponsored lmao try to be more transparent didnt see any other player online 30 dollars with loot boxes emmmm base game seem decent cant even consider a game that doesnt allow me to make my own character looks exactly like all the rest of its genre prefer to play torchlight frontiers enjoying it so far ive been playeing for 9 hours now looks good and plays really smooth love the controls and polist animation and characters look so good hope they have more waifu characters the game should give you more options for choosing a hero early on i wanted to play a mage hero and had to play something that i did not feel like for quite some time which sucked for me comparing to d3s portal system i also did not enjoy that in pagan you are forced to go to town to keep the questsstory going and that requires a load screen it is a fast loading screen but it annoyed me more and more i would get super cheap on a promo definitely wouldnt pay full price on it very cool lol another paid promotion goodluck god the game looks so fun i sank a ridiculous amount of time into this game already personally i love it and if you enjoy grindy arpgs this is definitely one there are some downsides sure but for 30 bucks this thing has a large amount of content in early access hard to doll out the wallet when such good arpgs like poe are completely free and is not in ea not to mention torchlight working its way here as well nice job appreciate your ability to share the cons it casts the devs in a very good light to me that they want to hear feedback and improve the game further am i misunderstanding is this currently a singleplayer game that will eventually have co op thats called pagan online is there currently no online features at all screenshake is the worst m8 i dont know how you think that would make anything better but you do you nice gotee bro this game is right now in my cart in steam and this video couldnt be uploaded a better moment love you and your beard you handsome man no homo lmao i already know this combo lazypeon paid promotion all pros at the start of video lazypeon no paid promotion all cons just all cons fyi everyone is saying this game is a total money grabbing waste of time these devs have no new ideas and just copy everyone else you can really tell from thisthere is no impact to anything you do stick to poe or path of diablo which are both free until these devs get their heads out of their asses anyone who is suckered into buying this swamp land in florida based on this youtubers blatant shilling is really really dumb reviews early access review posted 27 april the game is called pagan online and they have online disabledwtf early access review posted 28 april wasted 30 all around silly and very noobish early access review posted 28 april looks nice but i just cant play these types of games using wasdit feels so wrong and unnatural would have been nice to at least have the option to choose your preferred method of movement refunded is this diablo immortal this looks like a game you will play for a few hours maybe finish the campaign or so but i cant see the depth other games have yeah no point in bothering with mediocrity i will wait for lost ark daily login rewards kill me already d im just so happy to have poe in my life atm it actually feels like im playing a normal game that you play get progress and log out no required daily login to keep you coming back but actually wanting to play wow this seems to scratch the itch that devilian left behind another sponsored review rangers of oblivion ooga booga lootbox for logging in daily with crafting resources sounds like a curse id play this but its not free sadly peon have you watched avengers end game wooow sick beard lad i dont like the feel of combat if the big boss revolves around running around and pressing shift once in a while while attacking from a distance it will become boring fast also the control scheme is just not for me wasd arpgs never felt right im keeping my money and wait for lostark it costs money in the year of our lord 2019 ugh this reminds me of a facebook game kings road if you wanted to pay for a diablostyle game youd just buy diablo so is this a mobile or pay2win game the graphics for this game are really good unfortunately not a fan of arpgs so ill haveta pass costs too much for it being early access with all that stuff missing wont lie thought the advertisement i saw was just a well made mobile game seems cool but i really dont trust wargaming to not turn it into a microtransaction nightmare looks pretty good tbh the hero unlock system doesnt belong in a buy to play game i agree with your statement about picking 1 of any that are available sucks if you pick a character you hate and have to slog through the game to unlock something that might just end up being just as shit feels like the game was designed to be f2p and they changed their minds shortly before going to ea this is how you do a sponsor no stupid hi guys this is a game ive played 15 mins on a maxed out p2w char i got gifted by sponsor that im never touching again its cool i promise go make me money just straight up normal content with a sponsor note yo wtf this looks way legit first arpg that looks interesting to me maybe ill give it a try im enjoying the game but its not for everyone really solid vid once again definitely not for me looks like just about every other f2p arpg out there only this one isnt free wargaming trionworlds please dont albion online has choose you lazy peon rereview was looking for a new game because craptic just fucked up neverwinter with their bullshit downscaling and all of the builds and powers i think i might be the woman with a whip peon 2019 good video didnt feel like it was sponsored felt like any first impression as you said wheres online looks kind of like torchlight 2 finally an mmo centered around your religion amirite creeg shard unlocking characters for nonmobile fuck off people thought diablo immortal was a joke this actually is a joke its weird how even during sponsored videos you lose your fear of spiders its like youre not even the same person not interested in instanced rng grinding mobile shit will u play classic wow ehhhh imma stick with poe i love this game 3 the only thing i hate bout these games is that u cant make ur own characterwhy do i have to play as an old grumpy dwarfor a whip bitch not for me but thanks graig loved this video dude d damn youre making bank with the paid promotions as long as you show us good mmos then im all for it 90 of pagan onlines videos are sponsored tried the game few hours could be decent for mobile but too generic for pc users nothing compared to poe or grim dawn dayum peon we stan a quality content sponsored combo keep doing you redo blade and soul impressions also watch the new trailer where it will have remastered graphics at the end of the 2019 play wynncraft mmorpg minecrafts server i wonder how much this games going to be if doable 3 can be a full price at launch this sure could be will it ever come to ps4 not my mmo i dont like the art style and mission design good video though nly people who love their mom can like this btw im ubbing to everyone who liks and sbribes to me you make a is it worth playing and the sponsor is pagon are u kidding me everybody who thinks even 1 word is his honest opinion is a idiot albion online is a sandbox mmorpg everytime i watch peon vids sponsored by wargaming mobile game that you need pay 20 to play glad to see you uploading more and more peon appreciate you isometric fuckckckck stop it devs these kinds of games are so niche and shit they will never do as well as any normal 3d mmo can you do a video on eve online im thinking about playing but i dont know is it worth it as this is wg we are talking about asume new heroes will cost around 2080 euros per misson tables instant turn off 1 more albion online ad and im tying a fuckin noose looks mobile gamey cheesy characters single player umm no thanks character seems so stiff was just thinking is peon making video about this game boom here it is lmao 3 cant take these sponsored videos seriously lol cool ill just wait for lost ark to come in 2030 whens the outward video with cryy coming 143 views and some scumbag is subscribed to you just to be able to dislike it first arm the lawyers hell yeah ive been wanting this video just in time for pizza too dude ily early access fact they advertised it so heavily makes me not wanting to play it first nice to see you back to a somewhat regular upload scheme craig missed ya vids first completely true skill animations way too slow master diff way too much punishing half the chars are melee but melee just get wrecked whatever you picked up mobility or life leech skills tedious grind good ideas but game design is misleading for the genre loved the ratchet clank intro song decimator or see you later any left the latest stream from devs gives hope to these concerns they are focusing on improving combat feel and how skills work honest review see ya later this game looks cool it reminds me of torchlight which i really enjoyed playing would like to give this one a shot playing alone is fine by me the game looks interesting enough to give it a shot hopefully ill win a copy cheers ps great review you covered the game perfectly holy hell ive never seen your videos before but your pacing on reviews is perfect you rule dude lol i like your editing style and what they obviously needed the online thing killed me they should rename it pagan byof bring your own friend decimator or see you later i still have great hopes for this game but i cant argue that you hit the nail straight on the head in terms of cons i really like your game review style you should do more cool outro song whats it called why did they make it an online game when its mostly you vs trash mobs in a claustrophobic arena this could have been a nice solo play battleritelike pve game oh well anyway if you still have the key lying around i too would be interested despite its flaws it seems its the closest thing that can scratch my battlerite itch and hey it might git gud after some time this game looks pretty cool because i dont want to buy it so give me the key please the game looks pretty cool becaaaause i really dont know but still has a chance to get better no hey yea that game actually looks pretty cool because im a fan of the idea behind arpgs but ive never really gotten into any because of the whole mouse movement thing this one looks interesting and is visually pleasing since they did make some changes for the better it may grow into something likable someday anywho im willing to try any twinstick arpg since clicktomove needs to go away man thats a shame not polishing your mobs to be always fair to avoid is the biggest sin i see here makes me irate come on 2l i believe in you on finding that sweet battlerite pve that we all desire so much how long it took to get to endgame so cool video but i was expecting like a guide to like this is where you should go to farm end game because no one has any clue apparently and end game is a confusing mess of wtf do i do half the time timestamps for the different characters dameer ranged with pet 437 istok melee tank 848 morokh melee assassin 1334 lukianranged caster 1856 hector ranged scrapper 2354 all these games need to learn about color palettes your land and such needs to be one palette while your characters and enemies are another so you can differentiate them better if they all share the same color scheme it just doesnt work and thats a huge issue with a lot of games these days these independent developers just dont know about this being for gaming even back in the day with mario and zelda character color palettes were very different than landmap color palettes nice demo aven it would be cool to you and kos team up later when the game becomes official great video i appreciate you showing off the different abilities of the characters pagan online is a new hacknslash action rpg launched on august 27th its already available

there any pvp in this game yeah no this is a mobile game on pc i love the game and cant wait for the new stuff sorry dont even want to the wave fighting doesnt look fun to me if it wasnt 30i might try it i love this game much better then poe and over rated diablo 3 your impression was summed up at the end you can go right ahead and use the link in the description to buy this game on steam but that is just my overall opinion wow fucking worthless video pretty much flopped on steam not even 15k peak players300 average players hi what is the song on 705 i wanne play this but need to wait till i get paid again next month as its already been said ill join in and say it too for a loot based game the fact that you never changed your weapon in over 2 hours is mind breaking in this current era of gaming the least they could drop is the same weapon that at least boosted your damage 1 at the minimum increase cc duration by 01 seconds 1 hp or any type of increase in stats the difficulty scaling is like diablo 3s normal mode spikes 1 difficulty every boss fight up to torment 1 through 13 and onward the spike isnt mirrored but most people get what i mean tldr the loot progression in this game is unrewarding and this results in bosses feeling like the typical bullet sponge thanks for your further thoughts always nice to see you spotlight games but to me much better when you further delve into titles you played already giving deeper and thus better insight on the game holy crap youre doing almost no damage to those bosses i hate those kind of fights the mechanics and that character look really cool though ill be skipping this for now but keeping my eye on it as it develops i bought it before watching anything about the game and to be honest its just boring before anything i need to make clear that i didnt get to endgame exactly because the game wasnt fun enough combat ends up just being boring its like every single enemy has way too much life and you endup attacking them without too many mechanics you may be using a ranged character which requires you to kite enemies and this is less boring than any melee character but overall it seems like youre trying to kill monsters that dont offer any real danger to you and also have more hp than it should so its just boring hey stix i have some news regarding caravan stories it finally has a release date september 10th im actually enjoying the game more than poe and d3 its just a matter of personal preferences the game is still at its early years of development granted the time of early access official launch sure the game doesnt have much combat or weapon or effect depth but give the developers more time to polish the game further in the months or years to come again it boils down to preferences at least its fun for me and im enjoying the game for the money spent ive only unlocked 2 heroes out of 10 and theres still so much to do getting origin gears and crafting them into legendary and farming for recipes to craft those basic gears to legendary getting my butt kicked in master mode for the sake of having fun this character movimentation is weird whats the name of the song at the end of the video its quite cool seems like i have to stick with path of exile and black desert online for now only 30 dmgs oh my xd yeah the one thing a loot grinder needs to be successful is actual loot and a sense of progression this game just doesnt have it plus as you said the boss fights were way too long for a single player and you definitely dont want a tank for those fights because tank dps is so low pagan gets a 510 reminds me of path of exiles someday are perfect game will come im hoping mine is going to be pso2 but it wouldnt hurt to have others that can truly entertain my mind much love to you good job on the video even though i dont like the game lol xd game needs to make combat more impactful like goresound from weapons etc so what about character costomusation i believe ther is none exepte skin for can you light me up on that plz that the only draw back i have frome geting the game i wish the best for pagan personally i felt combat was too unimpactful and progression is akin to mobile games very short linear levels with invisible barriers when i started to struggle i switched to lukian i struggle no longer combat is lacking depth damn this game looks cool i found your channel through the first pagan video it was vukashin wasnt it xd ps i toldja id play with ya anytime d ive got chars of all levels xd cuz i pretty much just main lukian for dumb hard mode memes if you ever play again after this vid hmu im definitely maining the game 3 3 3 whens the wow cl review coming i was really into this game at first when it first released on early access however the development went completely silent for weeks almost up to a month they apologized on the steam message boards and said it was due to a holiday sometime early september i would need to check back anyway it took them forever to add the online multiplayer some reason i got a bad taste in my mouth when the development team went dark the lack of communication is what did it for me i enjoyed the game and i hope they become successful however if they dont update the community this game will die steam showed only 100 people playing at peek times not good doesnt look that exciting to me at all lol but thanks for showing the game to answer your question at 707 you took 999999 damage you died because the defense target died read the bottom text on legs they all have special powers he is so op mine is lvl 27 cant wait for coop lukian is very powerfull because has lot of aoe spells i play 4 classes kingewitch istok ania and he is the best imo ahhh yes the class that everyone plays cool game too bad its partially associated with wargaming it makes me skeptical about microtransactions and pay2win type of bs is this playable with controller bacongo will add youas usual agree with your comments all my support to your channel and to pagan online hey thy after a few hours i got back to being bored with the game i was kinda expecting more like coop instead of basing it to categorical fights they should have based it for example material drop based example random fight for drop 1 2 3 random fight for drop 4 5 6 and so on there is no point for someone to do coop with someone for a few minutes if they are not hitting the same material farming and also the coop being stuck to normal mode is pretty derp and yeah masha is abit great now with the rework of melee and her evasion fix but 32 is overall really low considering its a locked value awesome vid see you in pantheon just bought the game having a good time so far just subbed i like your accent and good informative videos like the game got lvl 27 on lukian but the total amount of players dropped drastically it has 250 people online now on steam do you have any idea why istok wrong its a nerv you had with 50 stacks 5 250 dmg with the skill even 500 base dmg 500 1000 dmg before the patch now you get per stack 1 means 50 stacks 50 dmg with the skill 100 dmg base dmg 800 900 dmg and you lose the stacks if you press f i hope youll become an official partner for the amount of work you do for promoting this game hi ridanis here i expected the video to be up later as you mentioned glad to see it up earlier thanks again for the content and the coop games also the final wave message seems to only appear to the party leader when i hosted a coop it was showing over and over and over as you said another thing that was change and i didnt see it mentioned on the patch was that they lower the values for the crafting exp gain when we reforge an item now when we reforge a blue item like for example a blue level 5 amulet we will gain 5 exp instead of 40 this is co op like when you play alone or with a premade party right isnt like a fully mmo ex wow where theres an open world and multipla players interacting want to play pagan but cant be sure of this this probably has no endgame compared to diablo and path of exile seems like a arpg for casuals they should just made a moba with that style could have probably compete better when trying to compete with diablopoe rofl kind of liked that dwarf tho d bullshit online this game is so so bad dont lose money on this gameplay looks interesting but it seems to be like all these shitty pay 2 playmobamicrotransaction bullshit game if it was free 2 play i could undertand this but wathever love the ui very clean and effective my only worry is that it looks like its designed to be migrated to mobile eventually pagan means they pay money in spanish v nice graphics are you kidding me fuckn yawn if they payed me 3000 a month to play this id pass good thing you dont have to manually click on gold lol its interesting but in my opinion it needs some more auto attack animations to cycle between because i find the same repetitive animations quite boring this and torchlight frontiers will keep me busy meanwhile lost ark comes to america name one good game that has the word online in its title theres no such game i love the animations and the fact that someone managed to make a minimalist ui that doesnt look like its from a mobile game the battle chest at 1724 do you need to finish the encounter before it locks to access it aesthetics and gameplay look fantastic i am excited to see where this goes even signed up for the beta color me intrigued i was really looking forward to this gameafter seeing this videonot feeling it this doesnt even look good enough to compete with torchlight let alone diablo way too cartoony the very same mistake they did in diablo 3 sigh i miss the good old diablo 2 days so much mobile game on pc with boring combat looks cool would love to see improved physics especially on those hard hitting attacks wsad for movement this game is so so bad dont lose money on this is it a solo game cool more class like assasin archer and mages or blend it with nice game but lost ark is way better than this 030 after hearing this had to close video lol jk come on man really never played poe what are you doing ha ha ha straight up a bad game do not waste money on this buggy garbage either give us controller support or an option for mouse clicks and hotkey the abilities its a little jarring to have the wasd setup only let us decide ya no loot boxes lets see how long until they implement he option to buy shards in the market place many of the features look like this was designed as f2p game no you are saying it because its a sponsored video youre just also saying it because you enjoy it that aside ill probably check it out so their ad dollars have been well spent no controller support but the wasd movement makes you think it was originally designed for consoles really wish there were more skills seems like an overwatch rpg for sure no lootboxes i saw on another video there are card packs dude those are the same thing they sell for goldnow cmon guys dont you have phones jk smilyface developer is mad head games from serbia and publisher is wargaming please update that give shout out to small studio played for a few minutes shy of 2 hours and refunded on steam the control was too clunky for my taste too many bad experiences with early access games its like giving the developer money in hope the final product is as they promised or hope they finish it at all its not a new game though a new expansion did just come out for it but if you like arpgs youve got to play grim dawn dont let this ad fool you currently the game is not worth buying and is not very fun to play do not care for the loot system at all it is a loot heavy game with half of the potential loot cut out not a fan of it and wont buy it can already tell that skins are going to get tied to microtransactions eventually i have it and what a great game too much ads gonna remove this youtuber from my list not missing out on much except some clunky combat and instanced battles on maps that seem much larger than what they let you explore in each mission literally walk 20 feet after loading to fight and go back to the pantheon also the position of ranged enemies that seemed to do no damage but continue to poke you is annoying af i like the idea of the game but feel it was poorly executed or maybe even implemented in the wrong way will pagan be on console too wasd in a rpg no thanks are there minionmancers and monks i like cruching enemies under a bloodthirsty hoard or being a whirlwind of fists and death bought it on impulseits cool but its takes a while to loadits kinda like a pve battlerite crafting lots of loot wasd movement no loot boxes im in love with everything about this game and how it looks really underrated arpg but with grime dawn and poe it is a tough market i like this better though as it actually do not feel so much as an arpg if that makes sense and wasd works great d but it is grindy and dungeon crawler like there is a lore fluff to this though a bit weak i bought this after watching this and fevirs video real polished and so much fun couple of minutes into the video and ive noticed that you get staggered by trash mobs that wont be enjoyable for very long it would be cool if it came to console this game kind of stinks i would suggest looking at other impressions this is a little too friendly i suggest just waiting for chaosbane this game is just ok remind me of diablo pretty cool vid if u can please give us more updates on news and on yours experience on the game gonna buy it right now rip boredom tks arekkz is this game worth playing solo hmm not sure how i feel about it making you grind shards and just having a chance to get the ones to unlock the character that you want to play if you want lots of alts then great but feels like it might be a bit frustrating to put however many hours into a character youre not bothered about just to get the one you are that and not having other skills to change to is a bit of a killer for me at the moment certainly looks like it has potential though gg just bought it it seems very cool but the only reason im not buying is that they are saying they will release dlcs quarterly and you have to buy them each time over and over again its an online game but its single player i dont like this buy skin stuff this game looks so free2play with ingame shop whats the endgame region locked here in skorea as well very odd since arpgs are huge here seems a missed opportunity is this free to play yo major respect loss for arekkz at not shredding this game i downloaded it played it for 50 minutes and demanded refund it feels like a mobile game converted to computer i know its early alpha but the game is clearly incredibly shallow even in terms of arpg buyer be super beware and get ready to demand refund as you get close to 2 hours played if you even make it that far nice cut at 805 with the hammer still flying on average how long will it take to unlock the other characters game time wise this is kinda insulting towards hmm maybe actual pagans aka me runs like a mobile game everything is so slow and you call it fast paced lol hmm no loot boxes doesnt mean no mtx i assume since you didnt mention it you werent allowed too are the cosmeticscharacters you mentioned tied to mtx i know you said you can earn characters through pick ups or is everything earned at a reasonable rate in game seems like they forgot the online part no coop early access or not stupid af so your appearance doesnt change when obtaining new items looks like torchlight meets path of exile which you must play something i will absolutely play amazing game with good quality gameplay game is not free it looks cool but plays like a mobile game not sure about this one seems like an overpriced mobile game to me been playing for about 10 hours already solid game really liking it its not bloated all the fat has been cut and fun btw zero microtransactions everything is ingame sorry if i missed this but how is the multiplayer hey arekkez kurtzprel is going to be releasing on april 30th on steam you can even go check it out now and the best thing is that its freeeeeeeee first impressions and paid video hm hm hm hm how can you give fist impressions with paid promotion of course its good seems nice in some way but at same time gameplay looks slow something i never realy liked when it comes to arpg i feel they best when you do dmg fast and a lot reviews seem to point at this being a port of a mobile game on pc or being built from the ground up with the typical mobile monetization things in place the game was so baaaad on the closed beta it wasnt even an rpg in usual meaning its more like arena with bots enter kill all stupid bots exit enter next very boring but most of all it has nothing with slavic culture mythology or paganisp telling u guys as slavic pagan try it check it delete it people on steam reviews are saying there are lootboxes there are loot boxes that give you rare crafting material used to craft strong items i can see this potentially being pay to win in the future so is it worth 30 i love the minimalistic ui very good indeed seems interesting just not 30 dollars interesting atm interested in this game wolcenand lost ark hammers are cool btw i would like to play this game it rocks nice review ltr man this and grim dawn make me a very depressed ps4 player path of exile is by far the number one arpg and its completely free seems really interesting i am not very versed in arpgs but i dont know why more games dont have combo effects a la spellbreak damnit another top down arpg that is currently pc only please let this and lost ark come to console keeping an eye on it for sure but i dont think i will early access it not yet at least this game is obviously a pile of shit how much did they pay you bro mobile port with garbage keyboard mouse controls and a ridiculous price so what is promising just looking forward to lost ark looks kinda cool pity it looks like steam is regionblocking australia for it first and foremost i respect all of your content from gaming to working out you have a style of grace and fun with each video but my question is this where do you find the time yes i understand that being a youtuber could be quite lucrative to play all these games edit them and then provide the content to all of us while keeping up in the real world looking over the reviews there are several mentions of card packs that have rare crafting materials in it and might end up being pay to win whats the monetization looking like so far should check out path of exile and grim dawn grim dawn is much more like diablo than where path is its an rpg and items wont change our characters look then meh i feel ive missed something why would pagan have a different meaning to a londoner specifically serious warning for all that are interested in pagan this is published by wargaming a publisher famous for greedy microtransactions und milking their customer base they will add shady stuff to this game later on dont buy this game yet if only its available in australia lol lost ark lite version looks okey will try it out if it comes to console i tried this game but ended up refunding it its ok and could certainly be good but isnt there yet hopefully on full release some of the issues will be fixed and they rework some of the systems so it doesnt feel like a mobile game in regards to craftingprogression pretty nice but the enemy seems quite easy like any basic moves will easily kill them in my point of view of course this is first impressions so im waiting for more in depth one nice vid though is it going to have any multiplayer why online is it like an mmo so online part of the name its just a gimmick are the missions multiplayer pagan online online yet single player looks like it has good potential though ive downloaded it to test it out love games like this also no loot boxes thats great news so after you complete the 50 hour campaign whats to do after please tell me this isnt only on pc it looks cool but the question is does it have enough content youre a arpg fan but didnt mention grim dawn wow you really need to dive into path of exile if you like this genre i burned myself out on it in its early days so its hard for me to get to the new updates but for a noobie like you itll be amazing actually looks pretty swanky might have to check it out something to tide me over until that new warhammer arpg at least few questions though so if theres no lootboxes but is there any other form of monetization beyond the initial purchase im assuming the cosmetic stuff but can those be earned ingame as well and the three characters you start with are they randomized or the same for everyone is there a way to try and grind for a specific one or can you purchase them outright if you dont luck out with one that matches your preferred playstyle not available in australia the game looks really nice but the seriously slow pace of traversing and combat would drive me crazy i think gotten too used to going bat shit crazy in path of exile killing whole maps in fantastic fashion in a minute or so no coop really you got me when you said movement using wasd i am gonna try this game now since i dont like this ganra that much because of the movement controllers i tried getting used to it in games like path of exile but never really gotten used to it i played this sometime ago and i did enjoy it waiting for release though region locked sadly saw my last name on the video pagan came here in matter of seconds thats great theres no loot boxes thanks for the honest early impressions thx for the content love this game seems cool but i really am curious how it will evolve in the long run d could this be i am the 1st comment timestamps for characters kingewitch 115 anya 313 istok 500 morokh 620 lukain 738 valeria 951 dameer 1135 masha 1317 im going to buy this game just for masha damn such a sexy class no summoner i unlocked lukian now trying to get masha and morokh d anya is the only cool looking one out of the bunch masha looks like an outright gypsy with valeria right behind her looking like a slightly lesser gypsy skins in a arpg no gear appearances seems like a crappy money grab so they can add a girl in leather with a whip but no sexy guy wtf thanks for the video man it is very helpful would be awesome if this game made it to consoles its like an arpg without all that rpg nonsense how come you have 115k subscribers but barely get 1k views on most of your vids is there a meta build for this game yet peria chronicles im intrigued by this game but im a bit disappointed in the limited skinscolours each character has it would be nice to have more than just four styles also how big is the game does it have storylines and non storyline missionsside quests like poe or d3 for 2299 i want value for money as im on a budget for gaming now mate if you do know wolcen lords of mayhem could u tell me in short term if you want which one seems better wolcen is already out a while and i own this one so im curious thank god finally a good looking game based on slavic mythos and cultures is it possible to restart a characters skill tree and get your ability points back skins what about armour you equip does everybody looks the same the characters that im most interested in are morokh masha dameer looks pretty fun too tbh all characters looks interesting i like how the game look but the real question is is it worth buying it is those gems somthing u get or pay for is there any p2w in the game this game actually has a cool character lineup i like how the rogue looks lol thanks a lot for this video consider getting it i look a demeer or lurkia as mains morkth or what his name is seems a bit tame rare crafting materials for stronger items insides loot boxes lmao hello random person here watching a random channel playing a random game i just want to say thank you for a great video and a needed one because it actually isnt that easy to figure half of these things out since i maxed out every character just liked fooling around with them and have had a blastbut sort of got a little loost right now what to do next so big thanks nice thx you why can i not see the full ability tree it limits my choises a lot more than before hi on which expedition i can activate the idol of wisdom why are you legacy 21 isnt 8 max nice video help a lot ty tips or guide for the last stand thanks hi how do i upgrade a level 1 legendary item i got a gun for hector a level 1 legendary but how do i upgrade it anyone else notice dukats name changed to dabor while the shop was open i just realized i been here for about 24 years know just cuz your voice a important question i have is does the look of your equipment change when you swap weapons for example looks like a diable 3 clone made for mobile gaming too bad its gender locked i still dont get it how we still have this regressive feature this game looks ok but there is a few things i dont like about it the ui is pretty horrible it doesnt look like it fits this game i skimmed your hour long video and the combat didnt seem to change much looks like your just using one shoot action and rolling maybe i am wrong idk i never played this game there is some brilliance in the game as well not sure if i wanna spend 40 bucks on this its looks kind of bland at its core and i dont know if wasd works in this kind of game i guess it might because you didnt seem to be pushing too many buttons during combat the boss fights seems done very nicely kind of reminds me of raids in mmos but on a solo scale that is some of the brilliance i am seeing just a lot of little things look lame too pagan is too expensive they should switch to f2p and sell heroes in the shop with the option to grind hard to unlock them with the ability to get like 23 for free from playing the game glad pagan is getting worked on as a big arpg fan i was very much looking forward to its release but have yet to pick it up after reading about the state of the game really hope they are able to pull it together because it looks like its got some good things going for it this is the first im seeing of tribes of midgard will have to check it out really hoping for a grim dawn 2 in the next year or two darksiders genesis is the first game ive preordered in over 5 years big fan of airship syndicate and at just 20 its looking worth every penny crate entertainment has been working on a city building game for a couple years now they said theyd love to make gd2 but they want a break from arpg for a little bit before anything happens with that im happy with the pagan online update but i have a problem it is just quality of life things and pagan needs more engaging and large endgame because if they keep going this way of fixing bugs and no teasers or a glimpse of future content the community is gonna give up and if the community dies the game dies i mean the lore book that was gonna be in the pantheon was announce on directs like a lot of time ago and still nothing and i dont wanna brag but ive done a system like that of collecting things and ahowing in another place as an exercise in unreal engine 4 a long time ago i dont know whats happening there but they need to hurry up or have a better management and deadlines at least in my opinion man i love pagan thats why i hate seing it like this wasd or click to move who wins kinetic you dont play lost ark anymore how do you compare pagan online to lost ark does it live up to the lost ark standard good vid question for you or anybody here ive never done early access if i do early access for this game do you know if my progress will role over when the official game is releaased cant wait for game pad support is it now playable with a controller or comes it next time ill get it when the gamepad support is implemented so let them know the sooner they do that the sooner ill get it publisher how will we monetize this game at a later stage when everyone has already bought the game gamedevs we will put in some card packs for crafting mats instead of making it drop in game i have played pagan online for about 7 hours i normally play arpgs with a controller if i can or click to move for games like path of exile diablo is to easy path of exile i love but gets old this season sucked i like pos pace and its engaging combat finding the right character play style dodging attacks and its learnings curve i look forward to seeing what they do with multiplayer personally im gonna wait on it to see what happens like with i cant remember what its called but its promising turnbased jrpgstyle game but like that game this one looks promising so lets hope for the best edit ok just remembered the name its called edge of eternity and its an indie game by midgar studios seriously check it out hey kinetic you should make a sekiro shadows die twice blind playthrough not a big fan of arpgs but this one looks pretty fun i definetly like the buy to play thing you pay once and then you play no bs afterwards like a lot of other games coughcougheacough brought it day one at first i was kinda disapointed but then after 2h something clicked and i cant put it down i still wish for bigger maps and more exploration but apart from that games great and i love the artstyle any news on coop looks promising so far i bought it so far having fun and the game has a lot of potential thanks for the video and informing us about the game i personally dont mind with click to move in a game but if giving the option to choose i would go with wasd all the way you can check out pagan here httpswwwpaganonlinecom what should we cover next looks cool not feeling having to keep switching characters for progression thou man for 20 bucks with no sub this doesnt seem bad at all informative as usual i dont know if its me growing up but games like these that looks amazing entice me much less nowadays even though i think the gameplay looks pretty fun its rare for me to think i must have dis excellent as always game needs more players nice vid bro i never really played games like that but u did a good job at making it seem interesting great video love the game actually seems interesting but the repetition you talk about would kill me great video man you have to buy it in order to play it fuck i tought it is free to play so i dont bother with it 1 on auto pickup great video and great game from the way you play it i will definitely try it thanks to you looks decent for what it is but for 30 they better not try to fuck me over with pay2winmicrotransactionpay2progress bs is this game online let me slap that ass i still cant complete the last master difficulty to unlock end game have every character to 30 pretty damn good gear on all of them but i guess im not skilled enough to see what end game is its a shame because i really like this game but i cant even see anything past level 40 never ever found an idol of wisdom sad you forget to mentionthe higher the tier the higher you need legacy rankby getting hero souls leveling all you characters you get legacy experience i just reached level 30 got 4 characters unlocked but i need to level these to got my tier 6 item unlocked for my anyas weaponglnice vid y not directly to this guide nur my question is where can you change the profile picture of your hero i know you hab unlock skins nur those pictures in the bottom never saw a way to change those nice guide man watching every single one keep it up man so they nerfed dameer too badly 67k dps 12k hp 11k shield lukian is laughing at current endgame p im waiting for new content patch nothing more to do 106 didnt see that coming stealth 100 i am very interested in the game but i am also very skeptical about giving 30 to wargaming another clickfest i am currently playing poe2 and this would quite fit in that but i dont need coop so who knows this looks cool that sounded like takahata that voiced alucard im gonna try this out when co op releases when did pagen come out how does crafting effect the item level of a base item does the item stay at its original level or does it get adjusted up to your current level on reforge ill be giving out the keys for the pet after 24hrs of posting the video so make sure to get your entry in i started playing with masha in prerelease but elden is much more fun to play with i enjoying the game so far currently leveling up elden so i can progress with campaign id like to have a gamescome pet elden is looking like a snack right now not gonna lie also give me the pet i want it the game youre refusing to mention is diablo 3 made it to the end of act 6 having fun so far didnt want to jump in endgame before release elden would look really nice with a gamescom pet i love pagan online i have played since it was in ea cant wait to play elden he looks amazing it will be good with something fresh to the game d want that amazing cutie pet the only reason i did not get the game is the wasd movement i would like if there was an option for point and click other than that game looks like a lot of fun will wait and hope for a point click option and might get it as always great video you would get me interested in something new right before wow classic i havent played too much as im kind of waiting for 10 on the 27th im enjoying it feel like the arpg market has been suffering a bit but this game does feel polished animations are smooth for both your character and your pet biggest issue i feel is the name kind of makes it seem like an mmo arpg when the game was first announced that what i thought it was honestly im just glad to have a new fairly polished arpg and while some people complain about it i actually really dig the wasd control scheme and im a sucker for games with cool skins or ones where you can get a pet leo asks a question about game tack i dont know havent really played the game that much leo asks another question tack no idea need to play more voice acting seems present can i download this game standalone without steam tack cork and leo is a triple threat can we see more characters 1021 this joke right here boring slow and wasd move not an arpg this is neato when is worldstar gonna upload fights again going to be having lots more pagan online content soon so be sure to subscribe is there matchmaking like can you play with other people is there any word on if pvp is planned with current systems it seems ripe for some awesome pvp modes is it worth 30 there is no armor loot so your guy always looks the same unless you change skins that sucks nice game one question why dont make this game true open world final wave lol wtf is this this is not an arpg with big levels that can rival diablo or path of exile free to play pay to win cash grab thats what it is nice art and animations but the wasd controls turned me off real fast i uninstalled is this using dow3 engine it looks like a terrible moba lol amazing animation and art style blizzard level polish is the controls battlerite style thats awesome too bad its only 2 players max online looks very slowgoodbut too slow looks bad because the combat seems to not give much feedback and there are not that many enemies cartoonish looks are not my cup of tea and the loot cards are iffy the style and color is not fitting the game lets see where they go with this this game looks good but i dont like the art style its seems to cartoonish for my kind of taste does it have controller support i could see playing this with using the back buttons and the pad buttons oh wow those animations are beautiful is there online or is it solo pvp way too cartoony the very same mistake they did in diablo 3 sigh i miss the good old diablo 2 days so much whats up with all this modern arpg that obsessed with cooldown if this game for xbox one is well uh oh wargaming is it going to be pay to win mechanics deal aoe damage and spam left clicks while watching particle effects and trash mobs die tankspank bosses and dont stand in the red circles yeah tons of mechanics to this combat alright king vukashin is thin another antiserbian propaganda wow its soo freakin smooth oo its literally tingling my eyes now that is some fancy animations there it will probably hit big when it comes out at least if you clone something clone the best in the genre that is diablo 2 not 3 pleaser continue with pagan online no many youtubers forget last epoch so excite to try the coop good info good tip re not crafting legendary items yet tyvm thanks for clearing up some looming questions you literally released this video after the update changing all of it released the protocols son has returned i might start with this today then switch to the ptr we might get the patch twitchtvbluddshed kingewitch is freaking hard basically if you dont learn the cc or heavy damage attacks of monsters you get straight up wrecked because you need to use your dodge to avoid them ive asked this on another video but never got a reply so hoping for one here is there an option to change hotkeys i started with anya and felt pretty hampered early in the game but she gets so much better with some gear and upgrading abilities i unlocked lukian and loved him but struggled once i increased difficulty so went back to anya i just got the assassination mission to unlock the barb so ill be eager to see how he plays so what is the easiest class you suggest to start with controller support kinda hate wasd ty for the info is this game wave based i started with istok which probably is the strongest of the three starters followed by kingewitch and then anya although she just received some buffs playing with istok teaches you bad habits though because ccs are not an issue with him and you facetank everything what are those tirangles above portrait for couple seconds like 825 with arpgs i play mainly with a controller and that works best with melee characters and builds so likely will go with the tank or barb i think this game would have some decent pvp much like battle rite it would be really interesting to see a lets play of this game the combat looks like fantastic but doesnt it feel a bit too limiting when it comes to character building they should allow for at least some freedom in choosing the skills at the moment its more of an action game with the rpg element i cant play this its not available in my region so lame great vid love the way you explain and elaborate on things pleasure to listen to what about content in this game does it have enough right now to justify buying into it now wargaming is associated with them so im slightly skeptical about paying 30 for access lol it is a free to play see a new arpg video proceed to look on steam and reviews about it saw its not an arpg at all and tons of shit about that game proceed to close the video looks fun only problem is that the player base is pretty small lol this game is going to be pay 2 win bullshit with everything being locked behind gems on top of the price you already pay for the game there appears to be almost no customization very little choice looks like utter trash to me id say avoid this at all costs unless of course youre an idiot very good well done analysis thank you i can see that this game is not to my tastes but there are a lot of people that this type of play will appeal to i prefer straight up attack and defense no synergy or skills buffing other skills all those skill rotation games become too mechanical for me have s good one its a great game im about 20hrs in with 5 heroes unlocked definitely worth buying and going to be even better once multiplayer comes soon nice vid thumps up so a game i have to pay 40 to play and then even cant pick whatever class i want at any given time no thanks sounds exactly like the wargaming bulshit i thought it would be this looks really fun and ive been asking for wasd arpg for a long time all this combat footage looks like it takes place in an arena type zone can you go into more depth about the maps how the characters traverse them types sizes etc game with online in its title without any multiplayer thats just silly price seems a bit steep for what you are getting tried to buy the game just now got an error message this item is currently unavailable in your region looking forwar for my king to be like yours its like poe but for turtles i looove this game nice mix between diablo 3 and dota 2 cant wait to be finished on 100 hey if it isnt torchlight 3 im not seeing the online part of this am i missing something hyped just because of the music xd amazing name for an amazing tittle waiting this game is so so bad dont lose money on this what is this a d3 rip off what music please name of track cool game but sadly i wont buy it cuz its gender lock i just wanna know the song they used i was glad to see my fellow serbs are making good looking gamewhen ive seen that wg is publisher i wont buy it i wont play it this scumbag company doesnt deserve to exist i must make an eu account to play the alpha bummer sorry but your laws are kinda scary i may check this game out when i can make a us account and play under us laws thanks anyway i bet they will add an russian medium just for the balance of the game diablo with battlerite controls and graphics very interesting cant wait to try it out way too cartoony the very same mistake they did in diablo 3 sigh i miss the good old diablo 2 days so much cool music but bot related to the game i guess the graphic style is that same disgusting comic look thats used in d3 and torchlight pls make arpgs with a grown up looking dark fantasy look like the gothic games with are no arpgs btw i know or diablo 2 this is what you call a blasphemous game nope sorry looks really good i love thus style of dungeon crawler i hope they implemented a great storyline ill prob play this soon i hope it comes to xbox one bcos i prefer consoles looks fun like a really budget path if exile lol downloading it right now with a friends extra trial key it seems alright but if it turns out to be a p2w mess im out please dont be pay to win with microtransaction or premium gold amunition trash i think this is copy of lol league of legends it is torchlight looks like wargaming needs money from us its free to pay i think it looks good people like me i get bored from games very fast i like to play fast and there is nothing left to do like diablo after a point you just playing playing slashing same enemies same monsters just new levels and items its not bad people loves diablo because of it me either lol i love wargaming games not p2w in all like orion so good to see new games from wargaming this is trash when i can download it it looks nice but ohnestly this looks like torchlight and as far as i know there we will be soon playing torchlight frontiers so i guess rip pagan when will gaming studios stop copying each other trying to ride hype trains this looks like hott garbage im here because i heard this will dethrone diablo but this looks like a mobile game to sweet for mei past some know the name of song i dont understand the dislikes for me this looks like a very good diablo clone with an interesting setting and some fresh character classes music and video editing are top game looks like a trash free to play just downloading it to try it tnx wargaming for trial keys people who say this looks like a mobile game have you never seen torchlight or diablo the game looks pretty good now how it plays and how its monetized are two different aspects looks nice like diablo you just need to make sure it has some interesting lore and not some generic lame storyline and lore to keep it interesting i hope this game would be challenging looks like torchlight so if i udnerstand this is hack and slash but moba the only good thing from video is the music pagan online emperor constantine is rolling in his grave looks so cartoony disappointing and yet another medival setting yawn get creative please only 3 classes and i bet gender locked im gonna pass diablo clone as someone that played diablo for years this looks nothing like a clone its just the arpg genre doesnt really deviate much mobile game for pc its an alpha teaser trailer and its probably going to be free to play as well as ported to multiple platforms game doesnt look too bad all in all not saying im going to play it a lot but i am going to possibly try it as usual so many whiners in the comments im curious to see how this game will be wait a minute where is the bear chick there is an awful lack of bear riding girls in this trailer ill just stay with wot is this multiplayer or single and is it only doing constant levels or is there actually an open world concept cause if the only game play is what i see in this video its nice but it will get boring pretty fast next christmas this shall be known as league of lootboxes its nice to see them try something else even if it is banking on the disapointment of diablo immortal i wouldnt play this i dont like games that has blood in it though i play world of tanks maybe invest more money into your failing tank game before you spend more on another game diablo immortal is coming to pc thats why wargaming dont have the time to deal whit the mm in world of tanks d d torchlight is that you behold spoiled gamers in the comments awesome d reminds me of all the old school games back in the 90s would see on tv lulz lol that shitey music though torchlight online has not released yet pagan online it looks like the league of legends and the diablo 4 mixed mobile game on pc sorry wg but it is my opinion but interesting if wargaming are involved in the project this definitely will be pay to win with bad balance and mediocre game design sorry but after more than 6 years in wargaming games the only good thing they had was total war arena and they killed it i know that there is no big gaming company that creates games with passion anymore but rip wargaming games let that greedy ship sink and please for the sake of arpg genre make the game dark not like its coming from disney channel i dont need another comic style isometric trash game sorry war gaming you have other qualities turn off the music and watch this again hello torchlight 2 oh wait torchlightis that you so this looks like a reskin of diablo immortal very bland i think the art style looks neat very wowish which i liked but only three characters to choose from and it looks like theres little to no variation in weapons just abilities melee only no ranger or mage type characters i think attempting to bust into the dungeon crawler market is probably a poor move considering ruling titles like diablo iii grim dawn path of exile and others that at least on face value appear to do the genre better than this i dont play any games with online in their name not releasing to nintendo switch do we get a mobile version you do have mobile phones right so what about itemization and crafting arpg aka hack and slash game cant extist without crafting and good itemization no matter how good fighting system should be is this like a mobile port or something do you guys not have phones what we cant play it on our mobile in 90s 00s we have balls to play dark games now every game looks like fortnite another copy of diablo and looks like its a bad one also i can smell the microtransactions dont you guys not have phone reminds me a lot of torchlight oo looks like diablo 3 ripoff still better than immortal tho lost ark better for memore realistic character music sounds like some 90s industrial crap so pretty much batteritepoediabloill give it a try but doubt its gonna catch on well its better than diablo imortal 1 out of 10 pathetic mobileconsole shiet pls use a darker color palette just make what diablo3 should have been if it was not worldofdiablo 3characters 0 custom in 2019 rly this game stink mobile game looks nice when is it coming pegi 12 a competition for diablo hack and slay lol wargaming huh so i guess its going to be p2w at this point im more hyped for diablo immortal i hate this artstyle so much way too many games use it ground textures look like from a ps23 game super boring and saw it 1000 times in other games zero creativity expect p2w like wot i love the graphics and overall artstyle i just hope its not gonna be p2w soinstead of showing something unique boss mechanics that you told for example for this game you just made a teaser with generic arpg gameplay looks typical and in no way as sellingvideo overall game look diablo 3 art style darksidersbattlechasers gameplay battlerite so obvious what new premium tank is that welp ive already quit wot boooooring yawns oh look diablo immortal on pc diablopoe killer only 500 peace of shit looks cool but knowing wargaming its more than likely going to have p2w features its sad that wg puts effort into this garbage when they have a gem on their hands wot that needs a lot more attention especially now we can always choose to stay clear of this game dont we have phones only a diablo is good enough its like somebody made a tf2 version of wow but as an rpg is this what the world of tanks players have been paying for when are you dropping the premium defenders and warriors looks slow as hell is this an out of season diablo immortal clone new game new customer so its wargaming they need money wow epic new game of wargaming no se ingles asi que corriganme v dont like the comic artstyle sorry i want my dark gritty world its just one of those stupid games that every 10 age kid plays lol i though its mobile game and then i saw pc keybinds hope i can play this one on my phone seriously the energy bar should go vertical and not horizontal this isnt a street fighter game between this and path of exile the choice is obvious looks good but the characters are ugly please do a character creator and not set characters nice torchlight style hack and slash with moba off lol i realy bad and absurd game shame the title has that online on it too would love to play this game offline premiums shells must be gone fo a few days daaaamn and this song tho wheres the online part are there not already about 10 games exactly like this one why make another looks like a mobile game but for pc one mmorpg please i want this on steam 3 do we need phones for this the only question singleplayer i did not see any frame with 2 heroes on the same board why then online so now they finally realize that wot is dying and are making something else looks like a type of landfall game but it sucks oddition 99 diablo 3 ripoff even the levels looks so similar d this is diablo 4 i seen diablo 4 hype xd in spanish pagan means they pay so its definitely a wargaming game so another bad game by wargaming cool is it gonna be as entertaining as tw arena animations looking rly off and stiff well its aplha i looks a lot like titan quest like the stuff dropping on the ground actually pc mad lads i hope free downloadable like as wot first since when john snow plays arpgs im confused you gotta cool name should of spelled it as pox because it looks cooler good video i missed you pohx i know i was in the hospital for 2 weeks with out internet exept on my xbox i was allowed to bring good to see you back im a simple man i see a pohx video and i hit like youre 100 right i miss the days where u could just go buy a game play it over the weekend or two and then that was it nowadays every game has to be infinitely playable with coop pvp loot systems skill trees endgame progression and itemization character builds etc etc why cant we just have games u buy play enjoy and then move on i liked those games forced to play a charackter youre not interested in first iconsider that a bad game btw 2 player multiplayer is called coop i dont understand how the people who produced this game can actually believe someone will pay 2030 usd for a game when there is poe and other 10 games very similar that are cheaper or free u should try warhammer inquisitor martyr so league of legends champions goes arpg m8 going to classic i assume so is free hnng classic join us on herod horde brother kinda stif gameplayto colourfullnah il pass been looking for a new game to play kind of done with poe been playing the same game for years will see what 40 brings but cant really see myself returning without some big changes currently playing star trek online not a perfect game but it will do for now i have the same problem with poe atm i play the game and have fun but i have no motivation to keep making videos for it i ended up going back to dragon saga for a bit which is a chibi artstyle action mmo you choose from 4 classes at the start then job change into a more specific playstyle at lvl20 which only takes like 2 hours to get to and can unlock 2 more classes which start at lvl20 shortly after no tab target but even after all these years theres still some desync issues so you can take damage even if it looks like you dodged properly i know you like clicker games and i found dragon cliff to be pretty fun despite its one massive downside rpg clicker game where you can build a team of 45 depending on the dungeon affixes with i think it was 20 classes to play around with however even though its a clicker game it has no offline mode at all offline as in gamepc is off so you have to leave the game and your pc open for hours at a time if you want to do heavy g for me it doesnt feel like hs at all i dont think its bad game but i got bored pretty fast it plays like mobile game and i dont like this system skills and mechanics seems fine but i just dont enjoy slashing enemies like in other arpg games and for me this is the main reason why i wont sacrifice more time for this game im guessing you got the recipes gauntletmastery as i have personally yet to see a single legendary recipe in the game so far on gauntlet normalthx in advance if you respond the only fix i see for the low level legendaries is for the devs to make legendaries only be equipable from legacy rank 5 and up and those under this lvl they should transform them and make them legacy 5 only then they could be useful hey probably shouldve said no paid lootboxes my bad there is a bit of a joke here that i dont think landed with the card packs huh okay kind of riffing on the fact that they use no lootboxes as a selling point of the game that said in another comment i posted this lootboxes dont have to be a bad thing only when theyre skeezy if its just a pack you get for doing some missions then meh if its something they decide to monetize then theres an issue i dont know of any way to get card packs in pagan other than by doing missions or just logging in let me know if there is any other way i didnt see any way to buy them when i played if its not monetized then i dont see an issue with it its basically the same as a chest at the end of a level at that point where what you get is randomized anyway if it is monetized in some way then thats an issue most arpgs coming out as of lately are all more like a without the rpg rpgs base a setting on story lore and playerbased decision wich are totally contradictory to action games no wonder all arpgs are shit nowadays now you got a fantasy style game with a scifi ui minimalistic non immersive and of course will be called used as placeholder since its in early but im pretty sure itll be launched like this in the end not only that all missions and levels are instanced and further define the game in a very limited mindset removing depths and intrigue hopefully the social aspect of trading will be the game changer because as i see it no arpg require anyone to be played online to be soloed its a competitive dps fest out here on all games out and anyone can do everything by himherself in all arpgs ive played so far i dont think this game will make it to a successful competitor to the diablo franchise hopefully ill be wrong ive got it seems this game is built for microtransactions the game is overpricednot worth it just great an error was encountered while processing your request this item is currently unavailable in your region that mxm flashback sniff sniff that is not fair the makers of world of tanks closes video have you tried a game called closers it is wg they will have ways planned to frag their customers like in their other games if you played world of tanks you will not play this xd it will become a pay2win or after a level a pay2play game with rng that castrates your wallet just saying that the top comment discussing how biased this review is was deleted me interest on the game and click on the link steam haha not available at your region me fuq cant wait to play together the shitty thing about the paid promotion on the bottom left corner of the screen means that youtubers cant be honest if they are then they dont get promotions anymore if i didnt watch every one of hives vids i would have skipped on it for this reason i can already hear my teammates yelling dont kill the fking chicken i was kinda hyped for this game but refunded very shortly after trying it out not worth it wtf is a wibbles also this doesnt have any rpg in it unless loot is now considered rpg you can farm specific character shards they are linked to assassination missions and u you only need to run it like 2 or 3 times to unlock a character more than 3 charsyou need to unlock is a great game many potencial sorry but after playing grim dawn i cant go back to these generic characters created games anymore why the hell do arpgs devellopers insist on having premade characters its insane its like they think we have to do everything like diablo give us some character creation and customization ffs not thanks i will pass looks like ftp phone game sad cant play it on sea loot boxes are not cool in any form shame on you yea incoming microtransactions this is wargaming the world of warships clip got you a sub congratulations lol man honestly i kinda miss mxm warcraft 3 reforged can have most of that if not all xd looks like dogshit free to play games already exist with more content and variety in gameplay not available in australia give us your thoughts on subverse hive lol id love to play this game but cant im region locked out i am forsaken i am not good enough the darkness its so dark so cold forget me loved your crack about getting synchronized with fevir i had just finished watching his video on this game right before i watched yours dont worry youre still funnier seriously keep up the great work i really appreciate your videos 256 oh its pantheon rise of the fallen daumi thought this wasnt supposed to come out yet xd selling point no lootboxes also but there are card packs dont let this ad fool you currently the game is not worth buying and is not very fun to play wow im here for pagan online and got albion online add xd pagan online in early access out now but not in your region great vdo as always no lootboxes the game has card packs soooo those or kind of like boxes and theres loot mats in them grabs pitchfork for real though lootboxes is only an issue if you need them to gear up properly if its cosmetic or not very impactfull its fine imo awww rip mxm you made me feel things ill be honest you said wargaming and i cringed a bit but after watching the video the game looked incredibly fun and i will most likely pick it up and or try it as soon as i can i find that i trust your impressions on a game a lot i also tend to like the same games you give good reviews for and you have never recommended a game that i didnt like so theres that as well on another note great video funny as always seems your videos are among the few publishers that consistently put out good content plus yours are consistently funny which is something i enjoy very much speaking of wibbles dont forget to subscribe to the wwmc on youtube for new videos daily war gaming is a company that doesnt deserve your timemoney but if the pay you then i guess cards packs no cash shop that isnt going to last call me negative all you want how many times have we been told no cash shop only for the devspubs to add a cash shop especially when they have something that is painfully common to cash shops ah wargaming the premium currency bullets that are strictly superior to normal bullets are not p2w company id be wary even if it was f2p but with an entry fee no loot boxes card packs containing loot waaait a second card packs so loot boxes rofl wow wtf no character builds or customization this sounds like shit yeah yeah more arpg stuff who ca wait chicken i am in its from wargamingnet swiftly moving on from the p2w shitfest this is sadly likely to be its good game arpg with wasd movement interesting combat where you press more then 1 button to attack and cool heroes system similar to warframe also no loot boxes fevir cry and hive the holy trinity of mmo news 3 when this coming to steam edit okay not on my steam yet i had already bought and love the game before i watched this but if i had not your video would of seduced me into it wink wink nudge nudge devs give him that golden chicken now just fyi i went with wibbles for my first hero d anyhow awesome job as usual hope to see you out there i will be the one who could not afford any vowels for my name every time hive said pantheon i got more and more depressed because pantheon rise of the fallen isnt out yet fuck me i actually liked mxm and was looking forward to it despite being a shady ncsoft title thats right wibbles slap him when he is bad p p p lol that golden chicken mechanic reminds me of the cuccoos thatll pop up in hyrule warriors in particular aka dont hit them between the hordes of enemies which of course can be difficult to avoid since the game revolves around using giant flashy aoes though in that it was to avoid the annoyance that comes from pissing off cuccoos compared to the reward you get from not killing them but why is it almost 30bucks i feel a little expensive for a d3 clone card packs are just loot boxes with extra steps i like i just got albion online ad before the video even starts on my phone xd didnt know you were a follower friend fan whatever of cryy cool no loot boxes but we do have card packs this game looks great but the controls are horrible they are all over the keyboard with only 3 on your mouse i hotkeyed a few to other buttons on my mouse but it was just a pain movement control with the mouse would be far better they said they didnt want to do that because it slows combatmovement down but as you said the combat was slow this was for me because the controls are all over the keyboard 345 so let me get this straight there is a random golden glowing animal that comes that im not suppose to kill and instead im suppose to let it live to get more from it im not sure how i feel about that rule of thumb is to kill everything if it has a health bar that i can attack and it moves there is a good chance i should kill it if has a health bar and doesnt move still kill it if its random golden and glowing especially suppose to kill it now youre telling me im not suppose to kill it wow they really are trying change things up i dont know if im ready for something that different tried the game for about 4 hours yesterday couldnt really get into it combat felt unimpactful slow the enemies are uninspired granted though its technically smooth for early access standards and i dont get why they put the more interesting characters behind a tall grind wall the starting characters are mundane wibbles wabble but they dont fall down ah yes world of warpeople pve focused finally shut up and take my money if the character got renamed to wibbles or maybe wipples upsidedown bs i think thatd be grand uhm newsflash cardpack lootbox doesnt matter how you get it otherwise the game does look cool path of exile needs some actual competition besides diablo 3 this unfortunately just isnt it thumbs up on the video but pagan online but no co op nice 90 of the people i follow on twitch and many of the gaming channels i follow have a sponsored video on this seems pretty desperate from wargaming throwing all that money around to get some attention to this game also wasd in an arpg is pretty unplayable at least to me ill play if it becomes free let me try before i buy and it doesnt have lootboxes it has lootboxes hiveleader please just because they call it card packs doesnt mean they arent just lootboxes hey hive you looking forward for star citizen looks interesting enough but not the 2699 type of worthy investment of interesting for me ill be looking for news about it time to time im sure but chances are i wont be purchasing this one i dont love the fact that theres no armor and so your appearance stays largely the same apart from your weapon half the fun of arpgs is to see all the cool new loot it also opens itself up to skin purchases if they arent already implemented which i dont love in a buy to play game zelda players know how to treat that chicken i love how the games website threw shade at diablo immortal by mentioning that you wont need a phone to play this it isnt click2move ill try it on that alone click2move is a cancer might be late but best pagan review so far you touched on a few things the other tubers didnt thx i dont typically find interest in arpgs though they are apparently being produced like crazy lately but im a massive fan of moving with wasd rather than clicking this has my interest i gotta say im sad that the gaming industry made me so pessimistic that when you said no loot boxes all i coud think of is not for now and everything like that i appreciate the fact i got a pagan online ad before this video about pagan online they tried to do your job for you telling me about the game looks like an arpg i can get behind ill wait for co op before i pick it upnice vid hive so an arpg with some heavy warframe inspirations from the mission and loot design not half bad not half bad have you played victor vran my man love you all mighty leader this is gonna be an unpopular opinion but i really dont like the view point these games go for looking down on them like this take me out of the experience every time the sneaky bastard fevir always jumps the gun you were right on time sir would also not hate a lil golden chicken you can unlock characters rather quick with assasin missions taking only 2 missions to unlock some heroes as each mission gaves 20 shards more assasin missions unlock the higher your might level gaving different character shards i foresee a lot of people wanting to be wibbles on a saturday night not me though no never cough what no lootboxes literally has times boxes of loot smh more seriously though i can totally see how this ends up being monetised to hell later on but card packs is loot boxes cryy is still around dang also game looks fun and i want to play but cant justify a 30 purchase money is tight enough as is but even more so with this dame fuel shortage i went with wibbles too no thanks nothing from that studio will get y time or money that said hope it finds its audience never heard of pagan online can anyone tell me if in the game the is some sort of visual progression with the charchters armors weapons skins and stuff like that just cuz every single day no loot boxes from war gaming are we sure were talking about the same war gaming studios yep thats theyre logo theyre lying they will add loot boxes it will be pay to win they treat all there games like cash cows and always do things they say they wont do edit they also dont listen to testers about balance issues prior to updates paid game with free to play model hard pass i love this video as i do all of your content been watching you for years now ill be hitting you up on twitter echothrume i will just put it here coop is implemented but needs some fixing u unlock heroes by doing assassination and it takes literally 1 or 2 runs 138 dont need to know what your bedroom is like hive yay another upload and more is coming lol just as you said thanks for reminding me of mxm now im sad again i loved that game xd official launch patch notes

whale u are the stone giant that flattens the statue of course and the special snowflake and her mount ea ubi ab would like farming money too but the difference that wg do not know how to do it dudes please stay in f2p model i spent more for your games than on aaa titles 600 vs 60 for each what do you think will be better this game looks like 2010s production is this going to release on ps4 at some point the moment when the first thing you see is a lootbox waifu characters im intrigued way too cartoony the very same mistake they did in diablo 3 sigh i miss the good old diablo 2 days so much world of wargaming please ad paladin bubble i will play this game another pay to win lol cool medivial game i wanna try it trailers starting with a lootbox safe to say its not p2w cuz they lose even with loot gear yo pagan where is thar promised gameplay video and did you begin adding players into the closed beta i just see silence after the teaser no in game images no videos no gameplay texts nada it looks interesting but the longer you wait the highrr the hypem and you dont want more hype then you can eat remember we are not mobile gamers we expect much and much to expected just so you know its gonna be 100 p2w interesting yea game from serbia better then new diablo go go madhead and wargaming moba or mmorpg mmorpg pleaseeee this is world of tanks in fantasy where is gameplay which tier is the bear 2 or maybe 4 the bear is maybe a tank rpg ah oh wait world of tanks gold shots remove when hey wargaming i subbed and i have a request pls make a world of war planes blitz for mobile it should be fun like and reply if u agree people finaly not a ww1 or 2 game it still will be better than diablo immortal damn i feel the arrows are not so much penetration and the ricashes are again only golden arrows to drag if you play for the class archer when you have a full ad team and feed the malphite another pay to win game but is it sjw complying yes i will join the trials thnaks for the game just in time for diablos downfall great timing jesus is mick gordon composing the soundtrack wow and we does not even know what genre this ist xd if this is designed like diablo 2 with skill levels item system uniques with predefinded statts rolling from 80100 strength not 1100 like d3 runewords and good dark noncellshading graphics for adults then it will kill blizzard if its designed like diablo 3 cell shading or any sort of this graphics your franchise is alrdy dead and you can stop with it noone will play it except a few people if this is free to play and financed by microtransactions you guys have lost from the start so when is pagan online blitz this looks better than diablo immortal i wonder if i need a phone to play it fine i ll try it cos i like world of tanks so i give a try to every wg game malphite rework finally trailer looks great i have hope for this game tired of diablo and blizzard is this on console okay now this is a anime im hyped for will this game also offer op premium tanks in spanish it means they pay online is this going to be a new premium tier 8 yes it looks good but all these games look the same now you can barely tell them apart anymore ohh what a lovely surprise cant wait to try it moba rpg what is it the voice of that guy saying pegi 12 reminds me on minecraft is illuminatie confirmed wtff yay a new game i hope this game is free ill stick with diablo and its christian roots pay to win ive got one complaint about world of tank blitz im so freaking tired a plan and the opposite teen gets out there and disappears youre sitting there looking around the pic of shot and bullet comes out of nowhere and you see where the bullet come from and nobodys there i think if you cant play the game right you got to be disqualified when you cant play it all this disappearing it needs to stop new core engine exists wargaming ok lets use unreal engine all you have to do is not to fkuc it up with p2w while blizzard is failing wg is doing just great you already got my atention with world of tanks if this new project pagan gonna be sort of world of warcraft or diablo 3 i will be done with blizzard it seems too casual for me i bet that this game will implement microtransactions in the future for the pleasure of the players new game from wg when i read the title i thought that it was the spanish verb for paying the bear is sooooooooo adorable im in i hope please i want to try this game i believe in you guys wargaming what a surprise im so excited to play it pogchamp never expected another mmorpg o what about the

thats a league of legend like world of world of warcraft xd pass wargaming will make the grind in this ridiculous like all their other games so that you feel compelled to buy whatever microtransactions are needed to boost your leveling this wont be much different than di aside from the controls obviously the online part should be a big red flag to those who hate the idea of di will

best games do you guys not have phones and they all died in the first wave eof seriously wot as pointed out on reddit hunts rewards are less lucrative than i thought theyre pretty terrible actually nice video again economy feels better now i totally agree the game feel better the only thing i would change is hunts i would prefer an achievment system with a long term completion and rewards can you really say the game has economyif there is n trade great content as usual thanks for this vid steadily improving is the name of the game why are action rpgs so scared to have a playerdriven economy i think its a huge reason why path of exile is so popular even with its subpar trading system the online in the name of this game barely even means anything at this point im hoping they add some sort of player trading in the future chicken before idgaf chicken now ooooh chicken careful careful careful run around waste ur time aim properly going to twitch now since the reset i got to just 350k gold i got super lucky with rerolling missions that saved me a lot of gold every time i hit the reroll button my heart was bleeding seeing 5k gold disappear xd invested into stash tabs and one new color for a valeria skin d compared to the millions of gold i had before now getting a new skin color is something iam looking forward to unlock can he talk is there any updated beginner guides for start characters cant seem to find anything updated at all dude i want them to make crusader character so bad i want to deus vult i find the freezing super gratifying this game launches the same time as wow classic facepalm the avatar in the middle of the skills and abilities look like the night king dude do a hector one show all abilities for him too hi vulkan did you test the co op does it have the delay or did they fix it is it me or walkingattacking animations look a bit off i hope players give this game a second chance i hope devpublisher keep working on it to make it better very awesome quick guide was the first thing that popped up when i googled it great video thanks for sharing knowledge how the hunt missions work great video can you change the difficulty mid game good video man very good explination as to the process to unlock characters keep pagan stuff coming it absolutely worked for me keep on releasing these cool videos thanks that helped a lot great tutorial about shard collection inb4 million views hi nice video you should add a link to your twitch channel to make it easier for folks to find you on that platform after watching the video some people say that they have change the system because everyone just stack physical damage even it is outdated it helps very much you sir are doing a good job now its become more clear to me as im playing this game as a newbie thanks you very much this video so usefull for me and its the same after patch 05 right wonderful video thank you so much for explaining this for us great vid man but im curious why do you think the devs meant to have so many characters focused on physical damage do you think they simply threw that into the backlog just feels weird that you have casters with abilities that are physical damage centric even though their visual animations include fire or lightning or am i crazy thanks again stp thumbs up for this nice vid i knew all of this just by playing the game it was just more a feeling that im getting stronger when increasing phy dmg but now after ur math my feeling just got confirmed good work i seen you in discord talking about it and just subbed i am about to watch your video about being stuck at 11k rating lol i did not know that int and str sould be focused last so now i may be able to gear better looking at it like that so clear thanks a lot for the video keep going thanks for all your vids really great great video any chance you can give us a rundown of which heroes should prioritize armor and which ones should prioritize evasion math teacher thyworm excellent explanation for new people in the game even with that music in the background it looks kinda underwhelming for me i really want lost ark god i hope this is on mobile so i can enjoy the autorun and microtransactions s everyone in the comments are a clone of each other cloned from comment section of another diablo 3 clone comment about that game being a clone this actually looks nice and super clean i like it def gonna try we need more good arpg torchlight clone blizzard shoot their golden goose with diablo now everybody wants in the trailer is masterpiece why do companies make cinematic trailers no one likes these at least throw some gameplay in it but whats that song though i no longer believe a crap if i dont see actual gameplay if this game is another kill 30 of this and that im out its an mmo im so glad this highquality trailer informed me about what the game is about while entertaining and engrossing me in its world and stood out from the crowd oops wrong trailer wait whaat is that ornn sejuani and katarina and malphite league of legends players comment below if im right what is you malphite i bet its isometric hype hype hypehopefully will not be a simmilar thing that happend at blizzcon hot on the heels of the diablo failure but path of exile has a hell of a head start there should be called a drawf and his hoes 010 017 is that a loot box in actual cinematic trailer of the game xd this tells us nothing looks like a very generic mmo trailer to me this trailer remind me of smite old trailer wowie their cgi movie department is really coming along now they just need to show us what the game devs are upto o great a cinematic trailer that has nothing to do with the actual gameplay i need a gameplay not a cinematic c so its a diablo style game k cause halfway through the trailer i totally thought it was going to be a moba maybe like battleright so what the hell is it battle the demon horde minions only if you open the loot box winning not guaranteed life not insured no money back guarantee a no moneyback guarantee also known as a satisfaction guarantee is essentially a simple guarantee that if a buyer is not satisfied with a product or service no refunds will be made tada hmmmokay then knowing wargaming this will be grindy af malphite 105 goddamn it this is a raid i cant see you cant see so what all that matters is can the fuckin bear see thats a raid not available on mobile phones 010 what dont you guys have phones generics ville the game isnt that the monster from frozen in the back when i seem pagan i was hoping for something celtic but it doesnt seem like that i hope this is the hacknslash we deserve great trailers are a dime a dozen these days wont give a sht until seeing some gameplay looks like its coop dungeon crawler will check it the upcoming hacknslash arpg set in a universe inspired by prechristian myths i seen this trailers in almost every single mmo out there is to generic and not impressive generic fantasy cgi trailer for generic fantasy mmo this game is about what exactly looks great hope plays on xbox wow this looks just like another mediocre mmo rpg 045 i throughout that was a twiiik at first wow they really invested a lot of time in this trailer than the actual game i bet this will be trash af screenshot me just to remind you guys overkills the walking deads trailer was also awesome another online cash grab trash warhammer chaosbane will probably be the best solution for players who are hungry for a new and better diablo announcement trailer aint enough need gameplay trailer this christmas game looks great me 5 seconds in eh looks alright a little generic me 40 seconds in b l o o d m a g i c generic trailer that tells you nothing coming on mobile ohhh cashing in on the post blizzcon blizzard nice moves also that trailer was pretty awesome cant wait to see gameplay not exited because the trailer starts off with a loot box third this video is now mostly outdated almost everything i complained about is fixed i will do a follow up video soon love the age of empiresmythology music pretty rough review for a beta lol take all that shit you dont like and bring it to there attention is that not the point of a beta i think its worth mentioning that this video is somewhat outdated and most of the issues you addressed are fixed your video is 20x better than the sponsored popular guys who spend a ton of time talking about useless details keep it up im first one who made a dislike on this vid yay now i need to explain a reason i think ur opinion is to rude for this game im waframe alpha tester and u was comparing this game with warframe bad idea but mb u forgot that warframe exists alot longer than this game and on start warframe was alot worse than pagan bugs lots of mechanics problebms and my favourite craft system right now in pagan there is only grind for new chars but in warframe grind also was doubleshitted with craft to carft a warframe you need 35 days on a start was more bcz cross craft didnt worked and its was 45 days after you spend 1 week or more to get all blueprints to get a new frame u will need to wait 45 days before u can play it that was making me raging on beginning all the time but they also from start tryed to get as much money as possible and craft can be ended in 1sec with payment there was alot more problems i just told about my most hated so please dont compare warframe and pag yeah yeah we get it you didnt like the game so you just trash it right away and no i didnt play it yet seriously not one positive thing to say about it super informative my guy great review you hit the points right on if they change some of that stuff it could be a good game there really should be more wasd arpgs i hate having to click every time i want to move my character good review yo i didnt know this game existed but that was a great review told me everything i needed to know in a mostly concise manner great job very entertaining i think the game is pretty polished for being early access ive seen wayy worst i think it has some real potential it will be interesting to see what they do with it ive enjoyed my time playing it thus far i think its a buy if anyone is on the fence if you want a good arpg with wasd movement you should give victor vran a try that tristram background music dude i was looking at the description for steam store page link of pagan online but instead i got a free game xd thanks dude love your vids so diablo but battlerite this was dope thanks for the posting man keep up the great work im kinda excited for this game actully it seems great not a slam dunk but room for improvement and development team seems vocal and chill im definitely going to check it out thanks again love the style of your videos you are really entertaining man also good editing and choice of music d i realize this was done a while ago but he has more mobs spawning now was my first day playing and had anya of course i was only level 10 and could not get him down enough before he caught me with one last hit and i was toast think ill do some side stuff to level up a bit more and then he is minethank you for the video great gameplay hey guys update here coop wont be live for a weekcouple weeks so if youre trying to play with friends please know this i just found out so 2 hammer tards and an sm queen wish devilian was back to destroy this bad d3 clone pvp in this game pagan online disclaimer this game is not coop yet the devs are finetuning the coop experience still and you can only play solo at this very moment whoa look at all that loot my god i feel like im playing borderlands or something how many classes will there be just looked the game up on steam and it only shows three classes o there cant only be three right the game is decent but you must be deaf if you think the game has amazing voice acting also wargaming is not the developer of this game just the publisher pagan would be a hit if its free just got into pc gaming im quite excited to start this journey this video got me out of bed at 1am to turn my pc back on and download the game so i can play it the following day thanks for the good one loved the detailed description subscribed damn chicken this makes me replay torchlight series and appreciate what once was beautiful reaction and skill matters i want to believe nice first impression that click to continue on loading screens got me a few times too too bad i only had 2 days to play the preview though so this game is not free to play sorry but i wont pay this game to play not in 2019 darksiders 3 fury rip off come on wargaming you can do better 903 upper left side of screen shows then challenge requirements that one was not to get hit for 18 seconds this game looks really good but needs more characters 306 why are you sure because there is backdoor economymacrotransactions behind the question not now but in the future 240 ue4 doesnt know how to cpu multithread ue4 aka uselessengine4 020 every video you can see about pagan online is sponsored legit scam approved by youtube valve looks great how are they really going to make their money the real question for any live service mmo f2p b2p etc game i find this game most adequate n i mean i really like it this looks like a game meant for cell phones i thought this was a mobile game and was pretty hyped nahstill waiting for lost ark i am gonna play solo all the time i dont have any friends who play games will the game be free to play another way it is not worth it i hope they dont make the game easier once people start complaining thanks looks and sounds like garbage bring back the core values of arpgs the fuck is that sentence they never were lost lmao fun fact wargaming is the publisher doe mad head games is the dev nice research edit nice content lying outright beautifully optimized my arse youre a good shill you fucking idiot looks like a fucking mobile game so im not surprised cryy u are a badass but no offense man our standard of mmos seem to be dropping horribly its 2019 and these games are just not that good were taking anything we can get limited customization in 2019 well no customization at all ugh how is the ptw aspect i understand they have some such and the game is also 30 potato online except that its not even online looks very torchlight this girl is an absolute copy of fury from darksiders 3 can you change the button layout in the options cant wait for consoles release rip this item is currently unavailable in your region id play arpgs if they didnt have the isometric angle hi cryy dynamis from aa here keep up the good work 3 to be honest for a 25 game it looks way to much like a mobile game looks like a toned down diablo 3 which tbh is not good as any arpg fan would say diablo 3 is one of the worst arpgs nowadays if you compare to poegrim dawn and consider the price differences those 2 beat this without even trying if it was f2p i could see this being a fun option to jump in with a few friends but right now i just dont see anything that makes me go wow i must pay quite a bit to play this if you wanted something similar you could get torchlight 2 which has been out for a very long time is much better and often goes on sale for like 3 and has alot of mods to further augment the game im having fun with this game surprising good for a early access but i still think is a little bit overpriced sorry but character looks ugly tfw still isnt an mmo out there thats replicated psopso2s gameplay and boss fights why another iso when warhammer chaosbane is so close i think calling this amazing is bit too much it looks way too generic ui is boring combat doesnt look very intuitive animations are meh graphics are like d3 with brighter color palette i had similar negative vibes when my friend called soul worker amazing and groundbreaking not my cup of tea this game is not available in your region mad love for the aussies review a new game called oath mmorpg steam link doesnt work httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp992640paganonlineutmcampaigncryysidsidpkw4svure1w5y8pes9iwomrdle14vvfi7yqr0f2283fl8sux2p10hxxg49o6q0trmenbdicyxtyxlvpluu1fedpgejyqanxm3dknu08dwgfs5ew25ulviyxroiqnp6d85w5wjdxaylqoctfsbinkdfvp5kizekoczytnd5iho2qkifd7pfbkggbukzcxadqzd5lje7iolcs3s0xneputmmedium12922utmsourcewotcpulpsnpaganearlyaccessinflsteam home oops oops sorry an error was encountered while processing your request this item is currently unavailable in your region i cant for the life of me get into isometric arpgs ive tried a lot of the popular ones and even obscure ones but this specific category hardly ever grasps my attention for very long and the only one ive ever liked got shutdown lol i would consider to buy it if it is 3d first person or over the sholder i just want some nice game i am sick of all the battleroyal games these days and this diablo like games damn they really made a diablo 3 clone in 2019 huh didnt they see what happened to that game no available in australia which is why i have not heard of it until now looks exactly like d3 very original looks ok but it hasnt the deepness of theory crafting like poe or grim dawn the game is very streamline and a bit generic to will see im looking forward to this so much wondering though if i should play pagan or lost ark when it releases in russia wow wargaming is pushing this one hard with all the sponsorships for mmo channels get that coin cry first of allgrats to mah boi cryy for that sponspon get dat money second thank sweet baby jesus that its not a mobile game not a big fan of premade characters genderlock the multiple characters thingy is such a turn off how can you even play when the microphone is in the way of the screen lol would really piss me off can someone explain the legacy system we saw in the beginning of this video went to go to the steam page its unavailable in my country really im in bloody australia tt rpgs in general need to scrao this birds eye veiwing angle sucks the immersion out like an 8 yr old on a caprisun this game is just not worth it its honestly just not worth it as an arpg experience with how limited it feels in gameplay scope all these nonglobal mmorpgs coming out and were stuck with fartnite fuck sake im dying from starvation of good mmorpgssssss ive been noticing a lot of the games coming out lately are isometric is this some kind of trend or oh hey that looks kinda great lemme just click that li not available in your region because fuck australia apparently excited cant wait for this game nice game though its region locked too bad the fact that this game has no character customization outside of microtransactions and equipment doesnt change your look is a huge nono to me next anya looks bad ass slight darksiders vibes from her it would be amazing if this game got controller support the control scheme seems perfect for it a more skill based game where your experience and movement mechanics matter enemies walk in a straight line towards the player and attacks completely stop movement graphics look bad and it has microtransactions i cant tell if this is a joke this game looks static and boring looks sexy thanks for sharin coop coop 2019 8 characters ill just play ultima online this game is like a finger nail of a real game an arpg that has micromovement baked into their attacks thank god thats what made me love lost ark not being locked to the spot every time you attacked its so much more appealing and makes for smoother combat and not available in my region yay this video is gave me the same vibe as ur revelation video cant stand poes lag and graphicsthis looks amazing eh it looks ok but i think ill just hold off for lost ark once it comes to na in 2090 game honestly doesnt look like my thing if it was a bit more free form in terms of characters where you can create and build your own character id be all for it but this really just looks like diablo but worse guardians of ember on the other hand seems to be an arpg to look into im actually looking forward for this game wargaming isnt a money hungry incompetent developer the only thing that killed word of tanks for me was that wg showed blatant favoritism over russian tanks which affected how they balanced their game i want a key going back to core values of arpg more skill less equipment bruh these people have been under a rock the last 25 years in my mind arpgs have always been about equipment aside from that it looks cool looks lame arpgs need to be done really well to be decent has it meanwhile a click to move option i just couldnt play it since it had only wasd when i tried it and cant really control a character with that in a game where i cant rotate the camera gender locking will cause it to fail in the west even if its a western made game and i sincerely hope not gender locking is not popular for the western player base i dont get why companies constantly do this that fact alone makes it a hard pass regardless of gameplay for me wooo something to play aside from warframe and grand chase madness until lost ark comes on a side note have you ever tried the grand chase remake just in case you havnt but liked grand chase httpgcmadnesscomdownloads just make sure to put the full thing in a new folder then extract everything to that folder stay a while and listen kain can you use a controller with this game tia i hate changing character insane how good this game is sounds like wargamings sponsoring hand is shoved up your ass working you like a puppet clicked on the steam link in the description got this this item is currently unavailable in your region reminds me a bit of torchlights series with a dash of d3 which means i dig it thx for the heads up sir i love cartoon artstyle in games imo it usually age better looks pretty stiff pass cry did you see the new peria chronicals trailers anyone else notice the movement looks like your sliding on ice not a pro or con just weird looking edit btw looks good torchlight thats what i expected which is shit respect for wargaming will play if its f2p reviews on steam are mixed and no greatsword class buying to test for myself anyways make me apprieciate even more how good lost ark looks tbh honest doesnt look that good where is archeage d this game will do until lost ark releases so thats why everyone sent me this link meh biased opinion that sound effect after the a1 cracked me the fuck up its going to be free right 3 you cryy see you in game sometime i havent looked much into it but to be honest mts on a 27 game im not a fan of im not saying they are greedy assholes ea or whatever but im just not a fan of it even if its just cosmetics if youre going to add mts just make it free i dont know choose how are you funding the game p2p and f2p monetizations and very different you cant just use both aside of that the game seems fun but having static abilites and not being able to level them up or having perks that modify your skills and give them extra effects or whatever seems like a horrible idea at least in my opinion that part seems boring as well as it being instance it seems as i said i havent looked for much info and things may change but it seems pretty far into development seems like a game id have fun with for like 4 days and then i wouldnt play ever again downloading right now hearing smii7ys yeet at 0058 feelsgoodman i dont get the fascination with topdown isometric camera angles to each their own and all that but i dont know how you can do any roleplaying in this roleplaying game if you cant immerse yourself in your character to experience the world in this kind of camera angle makes me feel like im just a bird flying overhead rather than the character i would be controlling cant tell which arpgs theyre getting these core values from early access nah fam nah i dont understand why they keep making these games without character creation of course the archer class is a female those two things alone eliminate my interest in the game i hope you get paid gud this game is top 10 sleeper i dont like the idea that only skins change your look another diablo this one seems even less customizable that d3 wargaming sees the diablo blunder at blizzcon welp hold my beer theres money to be made looks okay i guess practice client for lost ark 3 ahhh if only it was free to play so that we peasants could also join together in hell isometric residentsleeper whip wait when you attack with normal attack you stand still in one place that maybe will be a down side for me hey cryy they may not sponsor you but have you tried path of exile as well as its end game before cryy have a look at the game oath please its going to be the next big thing definitely adding this to my collection finally a decent game i just saw the same one from fevir 3 oooo ive had my eye on this game so happy to see you made a video on it im looking forward to it nope we just want archeage first design is horrible hate that cartoonish stuff have there been any changes in the latest patch to your video about dmg explanation is there everything the same about spells and attacks about heroes nice video but how u get the green shield bar dont found any options or iam blind hi where can found the sacred offering for assasination kablar this game is 2 slow how the hell can they call it hack n slash i loved that part about the bear that bear is already pretty stupid but fine make it even dumber xd so its still pagan offline excited for controller support crit build is insane i kill the dragon for like 3 min but at the beginning he suck does harder difficulty drop more shards where you farmget your shards for your characters i am high as a kite happy 420 im checking out every game but nothing does it like paragongood times im loving this game so far and cant wait for the multiplayer to start how you celebrate this with every action d pagan showed promise but majorly failed to deliver if the developers give some respect and listen to the pagan online community this game has huge potential to become a reference among the genre sponsored content game is trash saying that wgs product will not have micro transactions is extremely brave to say the least its a good game honestly its a lot of fun plus i love the lore edit yes i know people are pissed about the wipe controls are horrible tho rhykker why in gods name are you recording argp gameplay impressions in 30 fps this is arpg were talking about man not auto chess wtf arent you supposed to be the god of all things arpg pretty sure you can afford it my brain hurts right now more so than when i became an atheist unbelievable the next unique game after this will use arrow keys to move char lul ps whats the point of the red circles if you dont even have to dodge them if you can just face tank them with no real penalty honestly i wish there were more rpg games based on germanic myths and folklore its a really crap he gets money to say good things about these game the steam and wargaming pages are both broken for me region locked unable to playbuy this in new zealand not available in australia slavic myhology doesn exist thats just a nickname of bulgarian slavic or old slavonic bulgarian this game is using old myhology from balkans before christ but very badly abused in a demonic way greetings from bulgaria downloading now looks sweet not good for people with one arm i was disappointed to hear this i am always on the lookout for point a click movement games to play with my friend who is unable to use her left arm did anyone not get paid to make a review of this game holy shit all you streamers got paid to make this vid and none of you are being brutally honest why every diablolike has to look like wowd3lol clone visually oversized armors colorful effects painted textures im sick of this crap i want diablo1dark souls style realistic dark gothic graphics please gods i miss the wolcen alpha translation of this video i have been having fun i was paid for this bs this is complete reimagining of arpg genre this game was ported from mobiles and is a barebone garbage i havent reached end game there is none you have predetermined skills there is no variety on a side note opening points of this sponsorded bs rykor says this game was made like someone who made it didnt have pre existing ideas about the genre then the first class he discusses is a tank classstank freakin classplease stop selling yourself rykor says game is fully fleshed out and has quality that is why it has bad reviews on steamlol please stop you can unclock skins micro trasactions alert might not be there but will be this is not an early impressions video its a paid promotional piece lets call things as they are reinventing is quite a big word this just feels like a more arcade take on the genre its cool but i really dont see it stick with the current arpg customer nice video though this game is region locked for taiwan looks like a mix of wildstar t2 and moba 20 euros to pay to bet a testwhat happens when they sell less than they expect over time and shut down servers happened to bigger studios i can see how this is based on diablo great graphics but so much diablo not a bad thing but when you say this is brand new i doubt your review no moneygrab transaction yes please i much rather spend 4060 up front and own the game with everything in it micro transaction is an instant turnoff stupid greedy moneygrab bs i would end up spending hundreds of since i am a completist and love to masquerade so i avoid games with that feature all together edit i see many mention that this may be turned into a p2w too bad still better than cosmetic micro transactions but micro transactions all the same boo honestly id rather cosmetics be the thing they monetise if anything you say they have loot boxes but you only get them through other methods yea right now that might be true but the fact that they have a box of random rewards already sends off red flags they could easily change their mind in the future and now people have a way to just fork over tons of money for crafting materials which is ptw at least with cosmetics it wouldnt be ptw these danger zones of area attacks are a real turn off the wasd controls of pagan online feel awesome plus the animations and tactical combat are just the best in the arpg industry was a bit surprised but i dont think i can enjoy other arpgs now i will say that im not a huge fan of the mapgameworld though id rather a big open map that you slowly progressquest through woooow sell out the game looks like fortnite do they have plans to bring this to mac os this game will suck balls dont play it its from wargaming it will has shitty microtransaction and unfriendly mechanics ask any wot player 2 years and game will be dead like total war arena i an already predict a few issues just by looking at the video 1 bs encounter with bs attack pattern that is impossible to avoid and survive unless you are obscenely overgeared for it 2 due to said bs encounter there will be glass ceiling after glass ceiling that require hellish amount of grind to get pass 3 with the grind comes the microtansactions that are just making your progression faster and totally not p2w stop shilling its really disgusting hows the pvp d3 lied like a mofo about pvp stole my money this game looks like the devs were developing a moba then realized that genre is dead so they repurposed the assets to an arpg locked out from au on steam and the wargames man first arekkz now rhykker its cool be sponsored dont get me wrong you deserve money for your work but mate this game is far far far away of beign symilar as is presented the movement is a joke and not for the wasd factor battlerite have the same system and its great but this only allows you to move in 4 directions its a really movile device type of movement and then the scenarios are hallways with waves of enemyes its painfully obvious that at least in his foundation is a movile game again i dont have problem with the sponsor but same as you and i assume a lot of your audiance here i love this genere i play this games since diablo 1 and is really sad see content creators that i like push a mediocre game like this there is peopple that really trust in your opinions and i personally bought this game for your video fevir and arekkz only for uninstall it few hours later i will not unfollow or dislike but is disappointing and i will take literally hundred of videos out there saying that it is amazing and yet it has low rating in steam makes me think it looks very good but i dont want to finish the game to then have to play it again when full realease comes i am looking foward to full release another garbage game from garbage company wargaming online but you cant play with anyone skip very very interesting and movement control with keyboard is best thing i could ask for a game on pc the game is dull you can just see the microtransactions that are gonna happen in a couple months if the game is still around by then point and click is stupid anywayeverything should be wasd looks like a shity mobile game for pc i dont think you mentioned anything negative from monetization stand point its very slippery slope i imagine they will add new heroes that could be unlocked with money that would have op abilities potentially making this game p2w god can you kids in the comment section stfu and stop being salty about sponsoredvideos sponsors are one of the reasons rhykker can give you all the other content besides pagan is asolid well put together game that does bring a new style to the arpg genre it will not be my main arpg but its a solid game and i enjoy playing it every now and then the achilles heel of this game is wargaming what a shame my big question is is the loot going to be shared in multiplayer is loot that drops just yours or do you have to be the quickest to hoover up the loot will this game be available on phone thats a shame i would love to know his real opinion on the game and not just a sponsored video cause yeah sure the game have some good ideas but an arpg where you cant customize your game style at all with no skill tree alright there is one skill tree but useless as fuck so anyway got bored after 20h of gaeplay its super super rptitive and slow and not thats fun let pagans light shine upon you all lol rhykker is just killed you in divinity original sin 2 even consumed your sould for a source point how can you still make videos given that this game seems to be about tactical combat am i correct in assuming then that it has no very weak life leech and regen mechanics ive always felt that element being able to heal up to full in no time is the reason why games like path of exile have to be balanced around gear and oneshots so much rather than player skill mind im asking about the power of leech and regen in pagan at endgame not just while still leveling thought id let you know this is not available in australia an fps background helps with this love the graphics omg just bought looks beautifull and well designed thanks for the advice im sorry but the top comment should be that it is obviously a game that is meant to be exported to mobile as soon as theyre done testing it on pc it is a closed map mission based arpg i told as such to the devs after the closed beta they are misleading with their little no phones involved logo when its blatantly a copy of some mobile arpg structurewise be aware theres a huge mobile game vibe to it dont care for the loot system at all these games literally live or die by loot and all this game has is skins you only get accessory items to actually change the armor of your character you need cosmetic pieces that you buy from a store lame but stutter step is what separates the men from the boys this art direction is such a turn off so far this game is one of the few games released that i enjoyed playing mostly because theres no microtransactions and i hope it stays that way dont like the loot system u just only pick up the white stuff the rest is crap well the control scheme made me uninstall the game in trials iv in cca 30 minutes so i would advise every fan of diablo game to not spend money on this game its really different and not in a good way in the first 30 minutes i was constantly thinking that this control scheme is obviously designed for a controller in hand and at that point i would probably play more but not gonna bother on pc with console controls does a paid overview states he didnt even reached whats considered end game in this ea stage yeah rhykker stop shilling please dont go that route you conveniently didnt addressed you get forced to play with the first class you choose which you may not like for hours or days depending on how much time you have to play the game how stale the class unlock is etc every video on this game is sponsored xd wargaming needs it i suggest wg to give it to me for free with all content considering the huge amount of money they made from me playing wot xd rhykker i have concerns so this video is very positive you dont give a single criticism of the game there are questions i want to know the answer to that would be part of any normal game preview that you just dont address 1 so this is a full priced release without microtransactions great fantastic how much is the game is the game a good value for the cost how much content is currently available 2 the game is early access but it doesnt feel like an early access game awesome good to hear why is it still in early access what has been announced for additional content is there a roadmap you mention that there will be coop in the future are other multiplayer features coming will there be any dlc or microtransactions when its out of early access 3 you note some features that are different from other arpgs you spend some time talking about how the movement feels different this does sound like a good feature but you dont make any i played one of the betas in march i think at any rate i hated the movement system i too have played a lot of fps games but the movement and attacking sucked and i provided that as feedback maybe something has improved but what i experienced back then turned me right off the game people r being paid to play this no ty pagan online is crap there is no longevity in a pve moba game i dont do early access i want to see what its like when it launches its a wait and see right now not really liking the unlock classes thing most games have there classes what happens if you are like me and only play certain class types in games its a wargaming game 100 guarantee it end up p2w every game they have ever produced is do not buy into this ad bc the game has potential but that is about it for the time being it is a giant grindfest in which they force you to play heroes you do not want to play just to get past a bunch walled content and that would not be so bad if they had not done such a bad job on the controli am not talking about wasd and the animation locks yeah but did u mention how gear really dontchange your look of your character you need to buy skins to look different so fu cking dumb bought it and refunded 30m later clearly this was being made as mobile cash grab but after terrible diablo immortal reception they decided instead to push it to pc ui definetely tells that it was intended for mobile platform why does it look like a mobile game seems very low resolution even in fullhd it is wargaming there will be microtransactions question is will there be character economy reset before coop coming i just want lost ark this might keep me occupied until we get a western release in 2055 is this your honest opinion i cant tell but half way through the video when you stood up i saw your pockets stuffed full of cash please explain if it wasnt wargaming making it i would be interested have to wait and see with those guys they are really bad with their in game stores if you have played any of their other games you will know what i mean if coop will be implemented later then so might the ability to purchase skins or the cardpacks mtx lootbox anyway time will tell hey rhykker this is folks upcomink releasink doesnt seem like a reimagined rpg looks more like the mobile rpg formula brought to pc with differences corresponding to what a pc can do better than a phone theres no way the devs wont monitize those card packs and you absolutely know it does rhymes have a learning disability sucks its not available in australia i love the visual design cant say im excited about the emphasis on coop as a primarily solo player myself but its still worth keeping an eye on the online thing is whats preventing me from giving it a shot though you can smell some preparation for some crappy microtransaction scheme from a mile away somewhere maybe its just me being paranoid and i do hope thats the case but its hard to not be at least on guard against this crap these days i have it its very good i mean i log and do stuff and when i realize bum one hr as a father thats a lot of time it looks nice but i hope you can rebind that wasd crap otherwise its a big nono for me you can tell this is a sponsored video i dont see your opinion about this game and i can tell that you are holding back on the things you dont like about it for me there is no rpg in this game you dont choose your spells they are fixed no gear outside stat amuletsringsweapons no sets items are boring with no meaningful synergies while i understand that you want to do these sponsored videos from time to time remember that many people watch you because of your opinions and watching game commercials might put them off especially if they rush to buy a game because of videos like this and the game turns out to be meh since you are not mentioning its flaws in any case hope to hear your actual opinion on this game soon b2p and looks more like f2p dont see reason why its b2p also it looks as a mobile so called action rpg where they think everything is rpg where is a character and runs around killing things round is over with a thougher fight then loot and u can upgrade eq1uipment with weaker ones untill it comes to a certain lvl then if u get htat lvl u do something with special material and upgrade ur wep to 2s tars then grinding again for better equip and so on and so on some does it better then others but same boring shit this looks as just like that but those are f2p this is b2p why would i bother playing this if i have this on mobile now for free i simply dont like it didnt from the first time and especially with wargaming involved like it even less itll become p2w soon anyway so gl to all who bought it ull have fun i guess hope it was worth it i have to admit the encounters being locked off areas with waves is a huge turn off to me that seems like something that will get old very quickly it seems to lack depth as well looking a lot like a mobile game looks cool im not impressed with this video sorry its not addressing a lot of clear issues that the game has at all the pacing of the game for an arpg is slow at best there is a lot of walking without doing anything between encounters and encounters are repetitive and slow loot is not inventive or special at all its just simple stat stacking and its just a total copy of most chinese arpgs in the market im not expecting to bash the game but this review isnt honest like this i would prefer a neutral stance and put the facts of the gameplay forward objectively or if you highlight things you like also highlight things the game clearly struggles with played it for 2 hours refunded it holy shit its horrible it belongs on mobile 0 character customization and grind for days to unlock all the classes is this world of warcraft what can you expect from world of insert anything here bad game dont recommend really enjoyed the video i think i will be trying this out this game is awesome ive played 44 hours so far and it keeps me going ive been playing wargaming titles for over 6 years i want to but i am a little skeptical about purchasing a game from wargaming when i can already see so many different potential areas for microtransaction fuckery in the game already world of tanks is their bread and butter it is littered with pay2win fuckery and deadly slow balance issues that take months to years to see any change im glad youre covering this game sponsored or not i hope this game does well im really enjoying it to be honest i havent had an arpg that had me want to sink these many hours so quickly in it since diablo 2 i know it wont be for everyone but i hope the game gets the attention i feel it deserves great video though rhyyker does this have offline mode does it have controller support looks like the control scheme would fit that first time ever i dont agree with you rhykker game look like shit sorry bry but still sub crafting reminds me of warframe there are quite a few similarities with it actually itemization is almost identical to skyforge they went blizzard on this one picked few good elements from other games and made them better as a package so people were majorly butthurt when diablo released a stand alone game on mobile yet people would be happy to play that garish already looking like a mobile phone game on pc is there going to be an online exclusive mode like closed battlenet from d2 because lets face it without that this game will be irrelevant pretty quick i think it feels to much like a mobile game i miss the depth and thlught it was more skillbases with the wasd and mouse aim would be good if i could play it in australia they forgot about us down here i picked this up when i saw several other people doing reviews on it and it plays well its got a level of polish a lot of other games dont have however this is where the good things about the game end there is a serious lack of content and no multiplayer i returned it and will keep an eye on it with the possibility of returning once more things have been added im certainly going to keep an eye on it nope not even rykk can sell this piece of crap whats with the lots of question marks around the character so i cant look like a clown because the devs got lazy to make a few extra equipment slots great looks similar to tree of life ill keep an eye on this as well as last epoch i like how theres no microtransactions in this buy once only game just like the good old days thanks rhykker you know its a challenging game when it takes you 1 hour to kill a pack of spiders to me the ui looks like any mobile games wanted to try but not available in my country tt looks ok ill stick to path of exile though pro tip you can reroll an item more than 5 times by the way it just keeps the 5 most recent rerolls on your screen fack rykkergot me on no microtransactionsno lootboxes from now on my mouth did not hold back the smile thankx for bring us and put all that info on a video very well explained thankx again keep going d theres no way to buy card packs yet the game all smells like you can pay with real money for everything and why do i have to unlock heros i mean i pay money for the game already why are heros locked in the first place the fact everything screams we can implement microtransactions for other things then cosmetic is just plain bad atleast in my opinion it is basically a doom in or quake in a arpg setting go to arena x and fight off several waves there is actually nothing new for this game except the wasd movement maybe i shoot too fast with what i am saying but i never trust anyone they say it will not p2w or we wont implement micro transactions apart from the sponsored video controversy the takeaway from this video for anyone watching closely is this this pc launch appears to be a paid beta of what will eventually be released on mobile platforms where the monetization strategy will likely be more inline with the games quirky and fresh design choices for the pc arpg genre thats not necessarily a bad thing mind youit gives pc gamers an option to play a promising title on their gaming platform of choice paying attention blizzard this looks like it has the depth and gameplay of a mobile game pass wow this game looks great i am in need of another arpg to fill diablos void and that isnt poe are you enjoying this more then wolcen im both excited about this and wary ive enjoyed playing my first character istak same as you and have really enjoyed the gameplay as of now but it feels like it could be heavily monetized and manipulated down the road and wargaming having the reins im always going to be dreading a disappointing announcement down the road thats going to usher in heavy mtx reliance and p2w i just cant trust them but itll be fun while it lasts and ill definitely get my 30 out of it just dont want to get my hopes up because this game could become so damn special if fleshed out too torchlight frontiers am i a joke to you any arpg where the character movement is that slow ruins the entire game when they add coop multiplayer ill give it a go yet another company that ignores the the asiapacific region the game looked promising too what a shame oh well back to poe who the hell tucks his ears inside his hat never much cared for wasd rhykker 1 dont listen to justin z it isnt justin y 2 does this have the dodge roll like wolcen nice review youve always been honest you fail to mention though can i rebind wsad keys to arrow keys seems like a fresh take on the genre look forward to you reporting on it as it develops click your pagan online on steam link got an error message pop up then went to my steam account and clicked search for pagan online and found nothing guess i am not interested as it seems to be not available for me your health bar doesnt even move if it is easy as it seems its a pass i love how well pronounced clear and informative this guys videos are you should check out moonlighter on steam and switch its very similar to this idea in terms of unlocking things and directional combat its a nice little casual game where you shopkeep by day and dungeon delve by night i guess i should expound on it a little more considering your generosity its banned in australia lol we cant buy in on steam as someone who is at end game have almost every character at 20 and have 10k spread between d3 poe and grim dawni can honestly say this game is a breath of fresh air and i love it its creative its different its fun and there is a lot of room to keep making it different from other games in its genre i recommend it to any arpg fan yes it has its problems like most games do none are ever perfect but it really is a great game im excited for the future of this game its already beaten wolcen grim dawn and d3 for me as far as content and polish its unfortunate that most negative reviews i see are people who dont like their initial character choice and arent willing to put the time in to unlock a different character for what youre saying it reminds me of some mobile arpgs where you can move and dodge while attacking on any direction but anyways being wargaming itll surely be a great game damm this game looks smooth combat looks very flawless all it needs it proper endgame and coop i wanne play this with my friends and id deffo be buying it hmm i think i am interested in this game this looks surprisingly good might have to snatch it and try it myself tyvm for covering this i played a moba called dead island epidemic back when it was still being developed and it also had this kind of control scheme and i honestly have to say that i am not a fan it is very uncomfortable to play and use abilities that way pressing on wrong abilities or having a limited bar of abilities because of this setup is very common thats a personal preference but i find the traditional arpg control scheme much more fluid even if you cant walk backwards or strafe while facing something if they put traditional arpg control i ll mind buy it they do it in victor vran they ll do it in chronicon i want it here too i really wish this was free with a warframe like model seems like a mobaarpg fantasy warframe the buy option seems broken at the moment both on steam and wargamingnet sad and strange sponsored shit to cartoonish for me lol speaking of tank i hate rpgs that has a tank class but cant tank anything this game is literally the fyre festival of arpg i downloaded and it took me 40 minutes to realize its a terrible terrible game stay away and save your money unless you like playing what feels like a free to play mobile arpg on your computer a few days ago when it came out i found it on steam and looked at some videos it looked nice but i wasnt too sure of what made it unique and then i wanted to find proper game play videos online but there didnt seem to have for a proper review great timing d may i ask of those who are playing this what is the pace of the game is it frenzied like poe or kinda crawlish like grim dawn this game looks awesome anyone know ig gtx 770 can handle it so is the game actually any fun i am really 5050 on this one some systems i like and some i dont just from having seen a couple videos rhykker also something that surprised me positively is that the gear your characters can equip depend on your account lvl not the heros so you can have a fresh lvl 1 hero with full epiclegendary gear also assassination missions are the best way to get easy hero shard to unlock new heroes can reroll more than 5 times also btw also i think i read during ea there wont be mtx but that it could come once game is released think i read that somewhere rhykker always criticized sponsored videos about games that he simply doesnt likethey pay him for his point of view its a risk they are willing to takehe is aware of that he gains absolutely nothing other than already paid upfront for sponsored videos youre all simply fanboys region locked i wish it wasnt so wowwarcraft 3 fortnite simple style i know it looks great the character selection screeen looks really good but the combat looked kinda boring but i wont judge it based on that alone but it was weak slow and stale i dunno poe looks more fun so this is a moba pve only game i played the game and im following their and i can say this video is not sincere sounds like you got a wargaming note and you just read it a mobil games in pc i skipped this game on steam because i don t like cartoonish games the game seems really interesting though after watching your video added it to my wishlist my first thought hm reminds me of torchlight pass great game for year 2005 its hard to wade through the alpha releases in 2019 are they a real alpha or a finished game called an alpha released to see if people like it so they know if they should continue development and put more manpower and resources into it thats kinda what this seems like broooo online in the name and no coop this game and its mechanics look like they are build for exactly one thing microtransactions do you honestly think they wont put them in once they have sold enough copies just 3 characters to chose different looks just from cosmetic skins locked skills cards instead of real items now where have we seen that before one time only usable crafting recipes a timer on lootchests on the map perfect for selling timeboosters maybe the freaking thing is from wargaming common if that does not smell feel sound taste and look like microtransactions what else does if you stab this game it probably bleed microtransaction this indeed looks interesting graphic style reminds me a little to much of torchlight though but aside from that i might give it a go when it comes out wishing for more grim dawn gameplay oke so in the titel it says onlinebut what is so online about it yeah coopi get it but will there be rankings or like hubs or anything so if i want to play character that is not unlocked and there is no character that is to my liking i have to force my self to play the game until i unlock new character that i dont know anything about and risk doing same exact thing again and again until i find class that suits my style that reminds me of people who make video games but are not playing them just because of that fact im not even going to try the game something to think about as developer we are not living in age where we have limitless amount of time to play video games kinda shame that it has such a bland art style slavic mythology has a very distinct visual representation which represents a reflection of slavic people customs and traditions if i wasnt expressly told that this is game about slavic mythology i would have no idea that its there just by looking at it wasd only movement killed it for me otherwise i thought it was fun while i played in the closed testing and if you can get over the wasd its actually really interesting but as i said wasd killed it for me been hooked on this game it feels like darksouls and diablo had a baby that was raised by warframe its much better than any arpg out there right now i feel bad for torchlight frontiersthat game is really bad almost 50 hours in very very good game lets be real though the masses are not going to play an rpg with 0 mouse movement they hurt themselves with this idea imo i remember playing some arpg that had wasd controls im quite sure if that game was sacred 2 which has kinda wasd controls ws for moving and ad for turning or something else might have been able to remap those i fail to see how they are pushing the arpg genre forward the copy from the steam page with this game it doesnt look bad but looks pretty generic to me certainly not something i would personally spend 30 on i was in the closed alpha build the game is seriously just a glorified mobile game the maps and enemies are uninspired when you clear a map you unlock harder difficulty of that same map so you have to grind the same old maps again the maps are bite sized as well which really feel like a mobile game map enemies dont drop any form of health orbs at all so you have to spend money to buy gold and if you dont have enough then good luck on getting more through micro transactions the story is honestly negligible and the loot feels lackluster dont play this dont even support this is this a single player ive been yelling in the comments for a wasdcontrolled arpg for some time now and now that it has come out i feel that they dont exploit it enough by staggering the encounters you slow down the pace wasd controls are meant to speed fights up imagine diablo 3 but enemies are faster but you dont need to stop moving to attack the game just got 10 times faster requiring 10 times more skill and focus i guess ill have to keep yelling though this game looks really cool im definitely gonna have to check this out all you is enter a timed arena and grind forever im pretty sure that this game is gonna go f2p the shop is already set for microtransactions i watched a couple hours of streams for this game before i bought it i do not regret my decision and will be happy with my purchase as long as the developers keep updating the game as they have so far i thought id elaborate on some things in this video 1 battlechests they are timed chests that spawn in story missions you will get more time to get to it the further away it is but most of the time you dont get to know where it is on the map right away youll have to guesstimate depending on the time you were given to get to it 2 crafting you can reforge ie roll a new set of stats based on the recipe used as many times as you have materials for however only the first roll the four latest rerolls will be available to finalize from 3 multiplayer according to a post on the games subreddit as well as their steam page coop was already in one of the trials their term for beta tests however they took it back out again because they didnt feel that i i like you rhykker but a review sponsort by the publisher hmm rhykker you mentioned you have a choice of one of three heroes to start then can unlock the rest as you progress which three do you get to start with and can you unlock the rest in any order was interested in that last character shown masha just going by the character descriptions on the official site but ive yet to see any gameplay of her so was wondering sounds like they are doing something very similar to victor vran edit it actually looks like victor vran did it better its basically swordsmagic warframe and thats not a bad thing isnt this control just like battlerite if you like this you should try that its the same but only has pvp profile also it has amazing characters and style interesting because when i played it last week i thought it was a complete pile of shit the forced wasd makes it feel like its actually a twin stick shooter almost a bullet hell and the whole novelty of the unlocking characters wears off the second you realize that once they are unlocked theres nothing but cosmetic bullshit to use that system for the crafting was asinine the classes were shallow and the itemization was twice as shallow fortunately dins legacy is also out so atleast theres something worth playing out there the microtransactions will be added in later soon as they get the coop implemented im all over this wouldve helped to know if these footages are from your own or just a load of gameplay videos from elsewhere mashed up with just your face talking over it asides from that i cant tell whether youre even excited for the game or not useful input however was your observation how its like a moba and it was more build in progression than money grab lootboxes thank you for the video honestly sponsored or not i do feel you were really honest with the game from my perspective watching your video got me hooked immediately no need for hard sale the game did it itself as im a big fan of warcraft universe and the cartoonish nature of blizzard games im still playing cataclysm expansion cant wait for classic to come out this looks absolutely awesome to me graphically the encounter scheme looks fun as well especially as i saw you encountering different types of enemies in those bundles or packs who were doing very different things and some classes might have an advantage versus certain types of mobs over the others which might cause some balancing issues sure hope not but it would also bring a very unique multiplayer taste where you want a certain combination of classes for certain encounters whilst against some other encounters you wont do super well cant wait to see some awesome boss encounters this type of a game is unique very very very boring game ive played it 45 minutes and it was enough to make me ask for a refund the characters are so repetitive to play and their design so boring biggest disappointment in a while not worth at all on its current state i have wanted wasd in arpgs for so damn long cause it just feels more natural for me and less straining on my mouse hand it does look really interesting im already wanting to see the other classes as they look neat looks boring lacks of complexity next dude thanks for this video when the alpha die wolfs are starting to fight for throne hey guys i was born yesterday i think its really cool that they added card packs that you earn in game only and have no plans to add microtransactions trying this when i get home good vid keys for assassination missions consumable recipes for crafting items premade skill sets for chars seems like warframe to me looks like a mobile game lack of skills build options and looks a lot like already released games cant say i am interested at all can you rebind all the keys to any key you want this is the biggest game killer for me hard to believe this is still a thing in 2019 but alot of arpg that i try either flat out dont let you or lock out some keys too cartoony for me honestly brought it day one and i was disapointed at first but after around 3 hours something clicked and now 25h later i can say game is awesome i just hope for better exploration and new skill tree this one was actually confirmed by the devs to be updated with one of the upcoming patches and its gonna be hell of a ride oh and artstyle is fantastic max party size anyone knows pagan is fun except for legendary items they are level locked which i dont like similar to how diablo 3 was like when it first came out id wait till it has content multiplayer etc pricetag is steep for a cat in the bag i want a baldurs gate dark alliance iii or another champions of norrath game loved the snowblind engine titles this game supposed to be f2p wargaming gotta be wargaming been playing this for a few days now is there a resource anywhere about which stats to shoot for with each class ive been playing the lightningfire mage focused on items with int and lightningfire damage i personaly do not like the artstyle i have been playing the game for some time and to be honest game is a great both story wise and gameplay from states of the bugs you will find them here or there but only once i was stopped by them lore wise its done amazingly since im from slavic country all things that are mentioned in the game are the most important and well known for me game is a strong yes one fact that is quite nice in your main hub sell vendor is called dukat dukats are old currency from serbia rather shallow on the subject of itemization do the items change the skills in meaningful ways like in diablo or poe otherwise the game is just kind of dead on lvl 12 i really wish d3 had a wasd function for certain builds like hammerdin i would love it i like the idea of crafting a batch of 5 and choosing the best roll sure its fun to gamble and whatnot but its never a nice feeling having used all your resources to get something dope only to end up with a broken item or something worse than you started with so no skill differences there doesnt seem to be a lot of variation in items also there must be best item setup option if the skills dont change so builds in the traditional sense are out the window what is the endgame of this thing minmaxing a preset best gear setup for your character that someone will find and post day1 yet another arpg that isnt coming out for mac bah i get mr rhykkers point about wasd but for me personally it simply doesnt feel right in isometric environment when your movement keys are horizontalvertical oriented and your dungeon layout is diagonal there is this odd uncomfortable feeling in my brain this game really looks amazing thanks for doing this video i ask myself why everyone is praising that shit game its stale no skill adjustments always the same maps only weapon skins changes all other armor is costume you need to buy with ingame currency and the only difficulty tha game offers is the ridiculus ammount of cc mobs have the bossfights are pretty nice tho how many of hours in single player thanks your first impressions didnt have any negatives biggest problem about pagan is that its made by the creators of world of tanks so im sure they will add ways to make it p2w at some point yeah whats the point of the sponsored videos where you cant say anything that is bad about the game youre literally paid to say good stuff about the game if you sellout at least label it in fancy coating like ima suck the shit out of this games ass the review wasd move slow combat waves after waves after waves in closed sections is this a mobile on a pc port whats the sense of having so many tiny damage numbers float onto the screen at the same time you cant possibly process all of that info at the same time especially when theres already a health bar there too kinda silly way to present information imho im having fun with this game it has a lot of good gameplay stuff and a solid core from the start however its an early access in a pretty early state well need at least a few more months to have an idea if this game will have good content or completely fail also i think they shouldve waited a little longer to enable coop and online modes on day 1 of early access it would be much more beneficial for the game in general overall its an action hackn slash with some mmorpg controls rpg elements are still pretty bland developers seem enthusiastic about feedback on discord reddit and steam so lets wait to see what they can do for now ill still play pagan while i wait for torchlight frontiers and a possible version of lost ark seems like the arpg version of battlerite wasd movement finally a proper arpg the game looks smoothbut the design of the monsters and characters is very plain and boring looking for a hey rhykker this is folks comment that pet tho i prefered torchlight looks like a mobile game shitty ill buy last epoch on april 30 235 why is thrall killing taurens it looks ok like it is actually worth a try but it is so primed for microtransactions to be added after release that at least one year has to pass to make sure it will stay as good as it is presented at launch going to be trying this out when i get home today it looks great so far bought pagan because of your description because this looks like a good game to add to my rotation of games thank you for the awesome review 727 im pretty sure in 1 year there will be purchasable skins damn it blocked in my country shame this company really has money hum almost all gaming youtubers that i follow made a sponsored video about this game uhauah i bought this game played it for 34 mins wasd controls are horrible refunded it looks absolutley terrific this game really looks polished im surprised im having a blast in this pagan online initially i wasnt interested but given that this is published by wargaming a company known for their extremely good support of their games it got me to try it glad i did the game is really fun and addictive the combat reminds me of bastion and the map split up into encounters reminds me of ftl do these seem like fair comparisons looks cool will give it ago whenif available in my countryi tried wargaming scare me though having played world of warships on and off over the years still not reaching end game due to the unnecessarily long grind pagan is still early access so the no microtransactions feels like a no microtransaction yet still going with grim dawn in the interim though at least pagans not an epic exclusive so will keep an eye out for it ahh a new video from the bestintroyoutuber is out that game really looks good plz revisit it at a later date and give second impressions its not f2p yet but as you mentioned there are a lot of mechanics that can be abused for micro transactions i bought chaosbane last night because i wanted to play open beta this weekend fml considering i am looking to play something while borderlands 3 releases i might pick this up it looks interesting enough and 30 bucks isnt too bad even if i only put 100 hours or so in it thats odd this game is region blocked for me through steam im in western australia message site error this item is currently unavailable in your region this looks like smite got ported to an arpg graphics remind me of torchlight a lot but honestly it looks really boring the combat looks sooooo slow maybe its the character youre playing but i had to fight to keep my attention with this video my issue with this title right now is the fact that it feels too much like a mobile game i need to get past what you said here the framework of an arpg need to view the game differently and i think ill enjoy it a little more ill give it more time make more videos on it myself on my impressions and go on from there this game looks like some cheap ass mobile game looks like a game ported from mobile for those interested in this game the devs have stated they are working on a new more advance skill system however they wanted to focus on bug fixes and qol needed first the game is incredibly polished for an ea and is showing a lot of promise let me guess cartoonish cashgrab shit the homepage of pagan online has an emblem no phones involved shots fired the ui really ruins it for me looks really fun tbh i think ima try it reminds me kinda of battlerite the battle arena game but arpg seems interesting i hope you cover it a bit more especially upon release yo rhykker long time follower and fan man i love you but you really shilled out on this one i mean i get it you need to pay rent and sponsored videos are ok but come one dont try to pass off as good game a piece of trash with an inbuilt microtransaction system that will most certainly be used in the future what i really really dislike about the game wasd movement microtransanctions in a fullpriced game through cardpacks similar to hearthstone and other gambling games that reward crafting materials in order to create powerful items locked skill tree this is not an arpg its a thinly disguised moba built upon a microtransaction ecosystem thats a hard pass and a big nono this item is currently unavailable in your region rekt i know for a fact from years of watching your videos you are being insincere i see and here it pass its a solo player or coop wasd movement in a isometric arpg isnt really new a steam indie arpg called chronicon great game btw used this control scheme oh yeah victor vran as well ive seen other videos about this game im not gonna buy it im waiting for an arpg that has fewer but tougher enemies and those enemies can use the same skills that you are able to use to add more of a strategic way of playing the game oh my im early haha i would call it lol style arpg is this a real review or sponsored review good vid ya i am pleased with the game so far super fun the have big plans for the game to work with dlcexpansions if it takes off so i look forward to play it more and more was waiting for you to cover pagan awesome so when can we expect a review of the game that isnt sponsored by the publisher i feel that it completely ruins the point of your video respect rhykker you are awesome had to return for a refund wasd movement never gelled with me i just bought this game last night thank you for this video im tired of playing and ive never seen so much drop in the game as it has in your videos the drop currently in the game is very low keys recipes good quality epic weapons everything is low you should analyze this because this game is already dead thanks again for your vids in my opinion we just need a good reforge system actual loot system is good and we just want to minmax stat or gain spcific stat so it would be better to farm material to reforge one spcific stat or to randomly gain one stat id like to see blueprints changed to reusable items in a list it would provide the much needed collector action to the game supply all the hoarder completionist gamers with another reason to play reference path of exiles crafting table system they need to add a trade in recipe vendor say 3 useless ones for one good one of choice heshe could handle mats to a lot of grinding for little reward seems not much fun to me on the reforge you should be able to refund 50 of materials used in the ones you dont want what they couldshould have done with crafting is the ultimate end game since they never really released a full contentcontext of whatever their plan for the next few remakes for release is this is just an idea what if crafting gives u the ultimate end game which is limited to and not exceeding to and not greater than the content what i mean is it will be the best item u could get for the current content which means it will be level 48 good stats and not rng based since it already looks like 001 chance of getting a recipe 001 chance of craftingrerolling a decent stat from it the current state is just double kill on rng play which is totally useless since once u get thru the patch theres no point of continue farming for the same item then after a month a new content comes level 58 i feel so as well everytime i did craft something or did a reforge the result was the same i didnt know if i should laugh at the result or cry because i have wasted so many crafting materials another problem i see is that highlvl missions drop almost no epic crafting materials i get a shit ton of legendary crafting mats and artifacts and its nice to have those but sucks if i dont get any legendary crafting recipe overall i have decided that i wont craft anymore until the crafting system gets changed nice video im new to the game so not much to say here but easy build to follow and like that you include squence of the spells as wellthumbs up for that still a good build thx playing similar ability tree for a while now its very solid and the suvivability is great hey thanks to this build ive reached endgame bosses and here is a question can you make some video with lukian boss killing build lighting wall is great for trash mobs but it lacks dps for bosses probably some fire build amazing build was able to clear level 29 assassination at level 23 on master difficulty granted i have 14k might so that helps a little too first this build is super good for the master difficulty missions to progress further if u guys didnt try go give it a try d after unlocking all the missionblocks and played a good amount of gauntlet i had to face the hard reality that i cant handle gauntlet on master difficulty with valeria or anya both have the dmg they just die lets say fast but now i can tell you guys this build is 35 min of pure relaxed put a cross here and one over there in master gauntlet sure you will need some gear but the cc this builds provides is by far enough for the gauntlet and pls note of course you will get oneshot by some enemies if u fall asleep and having a new wave spawn on top of you is a problem if shift is on cd but from all the heros and builds i have tried this one did very good for me and i had a great time especially if 2 min are left and some ninjas jumpscare you out of nowhere yes fun fun fun great build thanks for all the guides great build bro keep it up the great content need good build for masha the reason sigil of perun is so good is the 60 lightning resist when you stand in it im hitting for like 500k at only 6k might using that and chain lightning first build niceeeee ill try this build lukian is my favourite character for now im using a sunfire build but im not in the end game so survivability is not a problem thanks a lot i hope more vids like this nice build guide very well explained thank you for that could you make a dameer guide hes the one character im still struggeling nice build guide i run something similiar but i take sigil of perun because an extra 50 damage is massive especially when you have things linked thats crazy crowd control right there timestamps combat 0004 0603 hero statistics 0630 0750 crafting 0750 1110 hero forge 1110 1320 it does look a lot like a better graphics diablo u talk toooo fast too hard for non native speakers no skill customization this is awful no nda for pagan content will this be free to play spiel mal bitte tales of wind bitte bitte bitte spiel doch mal league of legends mit sword of the stranger musik genial manu lets play glp tvpo das ist diablo reaper of souls fr arme xd ich empfehle world of tanks spiel mal wieder sea of thiefes kannst du mal sea of thieves mit dem freedom squad machen also ich finde das spiel cool spiel noch mal ring of elysium das ist palle ich habe in meiner kindheit headsoccer und cartoonwars 3 pagan online nice game weiter so coole videos was ist das alda was ist das nices video colles spiel mach weiter so im quitely creeping around your videos no thy im not missing im just here hector is fun to play with i have a kingewitch but i stopped at level 18 because melee in this game is horrible with flinching luckily the devs are fixing it no way flinching should be in arpg can you share which skills to invest first for hector also can i upgrade a level 1 legendary weapon to a higher level does this only works with weapons i have a shield that i wanted to upgrade and i cant even put the shield in it as of december the clanking dead is still working amazing how fast you farm both gold and sacred offerings thank you best part is you need to only reroll it once and can do it infinite amount of times important make sure to do it on master difficulty so you dont have to do 2 runs i played this game a ton pre launch and never found any legendary recipes am i doing something wrong i have a lot of the materials but not recipes i just the game yesterday enjoying so much couldnt have done it without this youtube channel amazing content helped me so much subbed how many times can poor kablar die xd your videos are always incredibly concise thank you for that i really love the new fabled attributes the whole system is great except the rolls that are meh p show us game play plz epic timing is epic rip diablo im still trying to figure out best stats to minmax what would you think the best stats for istok would be im thinking physical damage spell damage bonus strength fortitude what did you skill for anja was this done in hard mode i barely did take any damage in this fight on normal mode so far its one of the easyest to do great explanation trouble i have is getting those damn globes in the first phase and having to use health globes how do you guys get the statues turned soo fast mine take forever and i can never get them facing him cause at some point the statue resetspissing me off thanks for the vid didnt really know how to handle the boss until i saw the video heya how did you got phoenix pet d hi this build is good for the solo great video how u get 39 skill points i only have 29 on lvl 30 how do u have 39 skill points and what do i need to do to get that many ezy nice video is there any way to level up faster im trying but i pick up anya as my first heroe and now i get lukian but in history is a bit hard to pass the act 3 any suggestion s having a script is fine but dont read it like a newscaster just talk the early access of pagan online is available now grab it for its lower early access price now httpbitlymmobyte pagan online is a brand new hacknslash action rpg launching on august 27th this is exclusive footage of the launch version a week before launch sub like and comment for a chance to get codes for a discounted price and an exclusive ingame pet decimator the dragon check out the mightgloryclub hashtag on twitter for more exclusive content is it just flat damage are there any burning dmg poison bleeding stun blind knockback etc wait you spend 30 dollars on a game and you cant use all the characters keep talking about your wife bud its what im here for he rambles for a little over a minute review begins at 117 wow this is boring i think you shoud stop talking about how you got your hands on the game it comes off as boasting how you got 2freegames that will just lead me to not realy trust your opinion on the game shit gameits true i like hack and slash but i dont like the name this game suffers the same issue that all top down action rpgs do yeah some elements look kinda cool but its not enough to make me want to pay for this over playing path of exile i bought it and returned it immediately its not really online you cannot play online with your friends wife etc online play is extremely limited pay to play no thx so 8 h is to short to give a game like this a good review imo played this game in alpha not worth imo not enough satisfying content and its wargaming nope you should visit warhammer online private server return of reckoning is this game have pvp contents cool but no fist weapon or class i think ill pass decimator the dragon aww yeah aww man thanks for showing off the dual dagger rogue i so want to play that class 4 player is still coming just saying why did you get a key for the game way after it died off games already dead next i enjoy it but it is definitely not the easy ride one might expect from a game like this looooooooooove it i can see myself getting lost in this thing forever or at least a very long time wait till you have a little styx d see how much time you have to game with lol wargaming as in world of tanks developerpublisher oh boy here comes the pay2win oh jeez just watch you forgot your wife lol too floaty theres no commitment to each attack yall have fun multiplayer needs more players 48 is a good maximum game looks fun im pretty tempted to try it what is it 40 though the game seem fun one thing i dislike is the skin like cloth system i like to see my helmet change and gear in general that is what made me play mmorpg atfirst to costum our gear and all this one seem every one is the same exepte if you get out your wallet how is endgame its worth it only 2 players you said if they dont change that then me and my bf are still gonna play this together if we can im excited wargaming pay2win been playing world of tanks its all about premiums we need more pagan online content oh a 25d hack and slash d just like dark blood online 3 when its out of early acess i will consider playing it this kinda looks like twin stick shooter does it have xbox controller support on pc looks rly fun but its not so much online if the max players is 2 top down games feel way too dated to enjoy any more i will just stick with tera kurtspelz and might try blue protocol which is full of action packs mmo that satisfy me the most and ur still alive after u played that alone can i get a heart from mmobyte remember when games had demos good times more games need demos or trials to try before you buy the problem with this game is that despite the name online its just a dungeon hubbased coop game the only thing online about this game is its hub where you see other people to invite them to your 2man party meh its a pass for me only 2 players at a time is a real bummer so how is this much of a online game if its only 2 players at most this looks good thanks man this is my type of game a shame i cannot afford it i just hope it becomes free to play at a later date yay second cool game anime first one oh thats something interesting to watch something new looks nice thank you nibory you assumed the dragons gender so it got offended nibori as always enjoying the video now have you ever watched animeirrelevant questionok so is your character a vampire are their dragons that you can play as in game which team do you have your money in for paragon remake of improvement and most importantly how have you been aight what is up everybody newbori here i love your legendary intro i dont know why but is alway so fun to kill dragon in a rpg good fight bro la tercera es la vencida hahaha is this game just like dark souls the lady who you thought has tambourines is actually using a weapon called chakrams id also recommend a great game called kingdoms of amalur reckoning happy belated bday game is trash returned it after 1hr and 45mins of gameplay feels like hot garbage and every mechanic is built to fuck you out of time rather than money its all just more of the same repetitive bs happy bday if you like the wasd movement you could always try diablo3 on pc with a 360 controller takes some 3rd party programs but i thoroughly enjoyed my monk weird vermintide league of legends combo happy birthday happy birthday path of exile why cant most youtube game videos be like thyworms always mastercrafted thanks for the awesome headsup nice vids again thanks for all this fresh news i feel the game is going in the good direction i hope this will continue and i cant wait for the new heroes the cold dual wielding seems nice finger lickin chicken nice vid brah who the fk disliked this vid keep up the great informative work i used to enjoy the sin of perun so muchi built my entire build around it d great news and great coverage as always thanks for your dedication thy isnt it leaks edit didnt see the leek in the photo nevermind d is it time to comeback to pagan i have a very good feeling for bfp2 i cant wait to test new builds d i been trying to fight morana for hours now i can handle all rest of content up to this point without much issue but morena lets out some kind of invisible attack which seems to follow with those orange lines coming out from here and i instantly die worst yet but i have to fight through 510 minutes of enemies to get back to her then instantly die any idea what is killing me how to avoid it im trying to keep my eye out for some sort of telegraph but i havent figured it out yet you didnt seem to take any damage when she let out the lines so it must be something else instantly killing me or some mechanic im not seeing perun god of thunder they actually used the northeuropean pagan god and his slavic name the protoindoeuropeans called him perkwunos russians called him perun balts perkunas perkuns finnic peoples piru perkele hitites pirwa indians parjanya gauls taranis romans mars norse thor httpsenwikipediaorgwikiperkwunos come on man change the intro i got faith in ya to make better one that does not blast super loud music bad buggy game dont get scammed dont trust their company i cant wait to see more really enjoying the way you play and present the game hey aven1017 that link opens for swag and sorcery not pagan online excellent video btw mario sube el camino oh i was wrong video nice gameplay new to the game thx for the info pretty fun game my favorite hero is elden although ranged heroes seem to dominate at the moment the dragon looks sweet and i just picked up pagan as well thanks for the vids as always i started playing yesterday i love this game already i srsly want to progress in game hope i win i just started my playthrough with hector and that dragon looks pretty awesome hey are you gonna play darksider genesis too bro cool game bro well onion looks really interesting and fun so once i get the game in like 12 days ill play with her but since i really like scythes and stuff i wanna get the legally blind scythe guy can you make a video bout him next or are you making them firstly for the starters and then the rest also the pet looks dope af can you play this game with a controller on pc i usually like to play mouse but with this top down perspective i would like to play with controller thats the reason why i never picked up diablo xd eyy been meaning to find a guide for this game i cant believe i won it d my discord name is finn9729 while im in the crafting tab i have no ui to tell me my crafting level and stats ive looked at videos on here and they all have the stats and level am i missing something here or is it a bug i really like the new changes it brought me back to the game the new skill trees add more customization also i was able to use my controller for some of the basic gameplay now which makes my wrists happy keep up the good work with the videos i want a new class supporthealing type server reset nonono never play the game 032 iam going on a boat now you know shit is about to get real when thy drops some f bombs on those mother f kers im aroused now thy whatcha gonna do boi i still didnt get whats new in the character skill tree is it not the same thats a lot of dislikes in world of tanks biltz how do you earn season coins why would you make it p2p who doesnt like to be always online not just that actually you pay developerplatform so they can take your user data and exploit it in the future you already know you will exploit users after early access period is done everybody does it some even start earlier like ark devs releasing paid dlc while still in ea gabe epic approved this scam how is this relevant you guys use the same engine and owner of engineepic games doesnt care about anything but out of sales also platforms where your game is at have the same goal goal is to collect out of sales more sales more money why play moral game wargaming group limited has approved tax evasion as well when you buy their products your cost include tax that suppose to go to your country but they never pay tax because they have corporation in tax haven ordinary people like you and i who buy your game pay 50 of tax on our income they just split them like mtx and people will think t so thats how u waste our world of tanks money nice looking how you butchered moo and dropped its support i dont see any reason why should i try any new game from under you hat finally diablo 4 but does it run on my phone edit their website literally says no phones so no it doesnt admittedly a funny jab at blizzard yet kinda crazy given the games success shame it costs money were waiting for it to be like wot now i wont play this that is weird looking ww2 vehicle i was actually happy to see this untill i saw the comments stop tying to copy warcraft and put your efforts into saving world of tanks before its too late requirements both minim and recommended wargaming i am looking forward to play it d sorry but i cant i have more work do to in wot so its a warcraft from wargaming mhew you wont wanna know how many times i died to the beginning of phase 2 thinking how the fuck do i dodge this looks like the fight has been updated to now include adds during the first phase thanks dude thank you very helpful need veles guide asap pls huuuury tia thanks tough boss thanks for the continued content would you please reach out to the developers and publishers and tell them this needs to be on nintendo switch with offline mode wasd in a hack and slash arpg hmmmi have to find out how it plays out i got a legendary item un the stage where you unlock the craft station xddd a couple of questions before i buy steam or through their website what classcharacter would you recommend im ready to have fun click to move is stupidest thing when you have awesome wasd mechanics i just hope the lag in asia issue will be fixed not even start playing it but read lots of comments about the extremely high ping from asia players ive been watching this game since release the only thing i dont like is how the overworld is so empty no monsters and you only fight when you reach a spawn point and they come out of thin air and your also walled in i think they should add overworld monsters so its not a walking simulatior from each spawn to spawn i would remove the walls when you enter a spawn area and maybe add like a portal for example that cant be damage and its hp goes down when you clear a wave just so its not monsters spawning out of thin air could be a portal pile of bones if its spawning skeletons a web if its spiders so it fits the environment i just think it would give the game a lot better feel and gameplay warhammer chaosbane is better i think so i clicked the key giweaway link did there what had to be done but now i dont have any mail altrough it said i got 1 new item and no its not in spam neither in main letter boxand i got some advertisement email wtf is this vulkan no key but some viruses i got keyloggers why didnt i get the key but got some garbage in my email box too many games these days do everything for u people get lazy as fuk not mention kids they have no clue how old games were ever heard of gothic23 middle europe hit back in the day suuuper dupet hard i was legend on my school playground when i beat wasp with first knife lol they made sweet game for fans with way better wsad control just give it time and enjoy boys x you can see true pure soul ppl made this game give them credit instead of those no content triple my aaas games made for lot boxes and copy paste shit good clip tho you know what i really ask myself about this gamehow can you say pagan online with no multiplayer is this game multiplayer has trade man already loving this game and these changes keep things interesting and me a reason to keep returning just need to buff dameer some more and a few more characters seems cool they added stuff like aurasbut have they added to the coop play in game i heard it was pretty shallow great video also i have really been enjoying the game yes it has had some issues and is some still there but i really like how the devs interact listen to the players i hope the game grows tbh been waiting for controller support took them long enough should have been in from the beginning the game is a twin stick game not sure what they were thinking i really hate to get staggered in this game it feels overly punishing and takes away the control way too long otherwise im slowly starting to see a good game here paid content or honest review because reviews on steam are so mixed some guys say theres only 1 viable character viable for endgame etc still buy2play zzzzzzzzzz also imagine streaming on mixer lul ninja is a fuckboi maybe after remnant from ashes sorry i read the title and had to comment d lmao what a different turn out its been p game iz amazing recomend enough i can not excellent reasons agree with you in wasd we trush when is co op mode is coming and how many will be love the game for the price it is a steal very well made some bugs but easily forgivable because of the overall package thanks for the recommendation httpswwwyoutubecomresultssearchquerypaganonlinefpsdrops another reason one of the reasons why dont buy pagan online httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtuax0gnz3nw cant buy site errors love the game so far sorry but youre probably right its just a buggy game still but try to switch between two gears multiple times rapidly and youll see some strange stuff the gear piece can actually give you more spell damage after you switch it 24 times thx 3 i just started playng i got one question u think they gona add trade system i mean just thanks d in general ur videos are just helpful af when it comes to pagan online i rly like this game and i am also in love with all the deep math shit behind it d which is more exciting to explore than complex i would say i wonder how many ppl stack spell dmg on any hero transparent games and ppl who reveal that and make it easy to understand are just awesome d n1 work ps once we have the wiki page updated ill edit the link into this comment this formula is more easy to follow weapon damage elemental damage elemental damage bonus ability damage modifier attackspell and is true to all except lukian primary which inculdes all elements then add lightning lukian is fun but weak anytime he can not move like when you have to defend a small shrine just bought the game why hasnt anyone talked about the long ass screenload times he is super buggy right now lots of times his abilitys dont even fire off at all man i just got him today and i really like him but hes really hard to play going to take me a minute to master the two god ability thing is this a hack and slash mmo lukian looks preety good when the game starts april cant say ive seen this game before looks good i been trying to fight morana for hours now i can handle all rest of content up to this point without much issue but morena lets out some kind of invisible attack which seems to follow with those orange lines coming out from here and i instantly die worst yet but i have to fight through 510 minutes of enemies to get back to her then instantly die any idea what is killing me how to avoid it im trying to keep my eye out for some sort of telegraph but i havent figured it out yet you didnt seem to take any damage when she let out the lines so it must be something else instantly killing me or some mechanic im not seeing i literally die everytime i meet here within like 30 seconds due to whatever damage i am taking before those orange lines shoot out of her along the ground i dont get it so do you have to kill the blue souls after each kill of her or just kill her till it all stops thanks for the content man

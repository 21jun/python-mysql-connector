can you turn off the voice acting 12025 right in the feels voice acting in these types of rpgs needs to be refined a bit better make it actually real sounding dialogues rather than sounding like reading from a script looks cool but the animation is a bit too less frames 45 dollars for 2d graphics this looks like mana khemia my all time favorite rpg gonna buy this for sure honestly feel like this game is really disappointing there is no interaction between the 8 main characters at all you just find someone it gives you an option to take them along you play through their intro and never talk to them for the rest of the game excluding like 1 or 2 dialogs that are easy to miss while the game is beautiful it feels like it misses out on that charm and funny moments that really made these type of games enjoyable chrono trigger to pick an example most people will be familiar with had constant character interaction where you learn more as the game progresses and other party members will help each other through the story you had fun little mini games and interesting moments there really isnt any of that in octopath there are literally be cutscenes when you have a full party but the game acts as if you are alone since the story is so boring the dialogue feels like it goes on forever and you find yourself tempted to skip through it hopefully theres a mobile version soon like battle chaser truly a beautiful game from the classic graphics to the epic sound track great voice acting but i would turn it off to really feel like i was playing a classic like final fantasy 6 suikoden 2 or chrono trigger this game reminds me of nothingbut the creators did an amazing job designing that gamethe music the combat the storyits almost as perfect as ffix hopefully this game will be more appreciated this game reminds me of suikoden cant wait to play this game with the new nintendo switch lite 2019 graphics archbishop with 2 daughters wtf is this shit that pervert archbishop has been banging those nuns at the convent is this game good or not tell me is it just me who kept thinking this too good please dont kill them the bso in this game is fucking amazing i dont even play that kind of game but i downloaded the demo and meni cnt expect that i love it i love the sountract the story the fight scene was so strategiciloveiy even the psone had more animations on the sprites stupid indy oldware crap for mobile look great as screenshot but not so great when you feel like keep hitting an image when playing with such a character there should at least be an option to hire mercenaries or at least have 2 knights in your service since she is a squishy you would think that with her background having step father as a holy bishop he would at least be able to give her a bodyguard or 2 but if i liked bravely default and final fantasy a lot would i like this looks dope definitely going to get this and hold on to it because 20 years from now this game will be worth 200 dollars or something like that lol 45484615 evidently haanit is not the only character in the game that speaketh that peculiar halfgerman variety of old english forsooth many characters not all of them infrom swarkii speaken this peculiarfor lacke of a better worde dialect i finish zelda and i confused to choose between xenoblade 2 and octopath traveler for my next game this octopath graphic is classic but i dont understand why people love this game i think i must try this first the story so far seems super boring though lol oh damn i dont know anything about this game but first glance it reminds me of ffta good vibes the game is very similar to xenogears but hell in that game each opponent had its own attack animation and there is no such thing so it is 3d scene with 2d charactors this is a stunning game but the voices annoy me why do they sometimes just say half the words or just a different sentence altogether wow im bored holy shit it is like if saga frontier and final fantasy had a illegitimate child from a onenight stand and we picked up the baby from the hospital i want to buy this game so badly cause i have a switch this remind me of terraria cool feels like the 1990s in high definition who needs cinematic looking games no one thats who all the bosses big like that i was expecting to see a little dude lol omg this has so many final fantasy vibes from when final fantasy was from squaresoft currently giving hours to this game hands down best game on nintendo switch looks boring as fuck finally square made a real final fantasy thank you square and now a ps4 version please switch sucks oof the lack of animation is a shame despite being an awesome game remind me of tactic orge this game battle system is boring played too much of this kind in my life this game reminds me of an old veteran classical legendary psone game called romancing saga or saga frontier shut up and take my money now can i just thank you for starting with ophilia and going to cyrus because my mind wants nothing more than following the octopath order just bought a switch should i get this or zelda imagine a successor to symphony of the night with the quality of sprites that game had and this type of 3d effects and lighting i dont think the world would be prepared for that the stylised graphics of 2d bitmaps and 3d graphics is gorgeous i love the music so relaxing and beautiful wouldnt it be great if this came out on steam square should make a smrpg 2 in this style and have the old cast and party members like geno and mallow again ohhh poor choice starting with ophilia i saw the trailer of this game and it looks really awesomethey dont makeem like this anymorei repeatthe designers dont do rpg strategy games like this no more i envy you for being able to play this right now lucky you mister soundtrack and dubbing ruined the classic feel 257 its the lewd trissa scene ok now i need a switch 300 hours game not being able to hack and slash is why i cant purchase this is so cool awesome cant wait for this friday you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye it reminds me of stop motion animation octopath traveler is like how the really old game looked to you when you were a kid wow this game looks beautiful will it ever come to ps4 i still play ff tactics and when i saw this a year ago i had to have it now its on pc im getting this for myself the kids can play with the ps4 so keen to get this on my switch this reminds me of valkyrie profile im so excited to play this game ive been slacking but im going to play this game this fills the bravely default shaped whole in my heart pretty well final fantasy advance anyone this looks like the real ff6 remaster this is the next generation of rpg games and i hope that many more will come after this definitely getting this game when i get my switch that is great jrpg with lovely music theme i really like how this game is intimidating when we fight bosses with big illustrations and this game reminds me of the best jrpg game ever suikoden ii from the city view and character equipments i will play this game on my pci cant wait to play this game after resident evil 4 one of if not the best rpg game ive ever played 1010 for me so its flawless huh kudos to the reviewer this game is a masterpiece expect a classic rpg with vintage cbaracters and sets but with 3d hd animated backgrounds that brings you on a epic ride that will satisfied the adventurer in you im stuck cannot get into the hollows fight arena doing a playthrough on this game you can watch it on my channel you beat an incredibly long game and fifteen minutes later began again i envy that kind of free time to play games but of course great review seth perhaps its the golden filter vibes but reminds me of valkyrie profile silmeria on ps2 despite older graphics art direction was lovely 136 theres no absolute evil or weapon theyre all fighting in different ways no world ending calamity to rise up against and if you though shrine of the runeblade was hard i just bought it i love it so much the job system is entirely new it was also in bravely default so glad i bought this game 3 59 bux so worth and the best ign reviewer award goes to seth macy cpy is back he sounds like he played the game as a review you guys failed thats not even close to a review xddd sounds like u r just bad at these kind of games my favorite game on switch so far along with breath of the wild but i have that on wii u so is this or fire emblem th a better choice dam might buy this game as result of the review so passionate it looks fun so its saga frontier on the switch edit played demo yep its psxs saga frontier but on switch aka romancing sagasnes n psx currently 30 hours into this game and for the most part i agree with this review especially the combat love it but the stories are really really bland and i just cant care for them especially since there are 8 stories and the rest of the party doesnt play a part in another story makes it really weird and disconnected sometimes i like what they tried but they did not achieve that goal for me dont play this game for the story but enjoy everything else it has to offer i will finish at least 34 stories though this video is nitpicking and biased i win bye bye no you are nicpicked and biasedi winbye bye nope youre nitpicking and biased i win bye bye you need all your characters for the one ultimate evil after you finish their stories aww man i love this review thank to y ou mate 1010 ign has the worst reviews on earth my alltime favourite game ever is suikoden 1 or suikoden 2 its really nice to see a game like this being made we need more games like this i feel like this game falls flat in the story department because of what is expected thus far from most jrpg stories where there is a over arching enemy or threat that brings the team together to defeat it where its a grand tale of adventure against a giant threat when this game is more of a segmentedslice of life approach to the genre where the story is just meant to understand the character better and their growth and not a means to introduce a larger plot the guy who create this game is a legend the texture 2dness with the mixture of its animation of 3d make me cry cant wait to play this game xd oh geez reminds me of saga frontier and i was not a fan port it to the ps4 jeeeeeeeesus biljon of gamers want this game ported whats the actual problem well yeah wanna buy pc version but some how price is still to high for 1yr old game just played the demo of this gamei tried to get into it but its so repetitive with random combat every 5 seconds i got bored and gave up i just found my new game is this a multiplayer mobile game loved this review dude no world ending calamity well you may have to keep playing finnaly the true final fantasy 1 and tactic succesor aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa the staff point is pretty accurate d loved every minute of this game so far thanks for this video dude im not going to lie this review 100 made me buy this game you really sold how much fun you had with this game great review i love this game so much miss you game more reviewers like this guy please pocket edition would be amazing cant remember ever seen such positive comments for an ign reviewer lol omg im excited for this game to be on pc just been released today steam tomorrow camelot are you looking this is the future of golden sun this is how i wish more retro 2d game where remade like this dang bro you really like this game u can hear the passion in this review everything of game square enix have somethings beautiful and great game definitely sold me on what appears to be finally a great revival of classic turnbased roleplaying games game looks great but i hate that style of combat so i sadly wont be able to enjoy it why am i here i cant even afford a switch one of the best games on the switch it does have a final boss with all of the characters after you finish all the main stream stories for the characters imo rather than just a picture and stand there battle i like it more if they go to the front of the people they attacking and get the contact animation just like suikoden so its look more like a real battle but overall its okay ill definitely play it reminds me of the old star ocean it sounds like this guy didnt beat all the storylines and didnt get the true ending how does ign get away with doing reviews when they dont even finish the game 140 thats where youre wrong this game was designed for people who are critical thinkers i love this game i think this might be my favorite 9310 too much fun ign absolutely no negatives immense praise not a 10 why not ok so either im a moron or the side quests in this game are the worst gaming has ever seen nothing is marked or explained about any sidequest sidequest is a guy saying boy it would be nice to have a group to hang out with then nothing no marks on maps no direction whatsoever on how to complete it am i missing something or do they expect people to wander aimlessly until somehow the quest is completed by accident wtf now im regretting of my ps4 i only played gow4 and hollowknight in it fun game interesting design poor stories and writing wtf why the mild storyline spoilers this is supposed to be a review channel and i watched this to help me to decide whether to buy i didnt need to know things like there was no ultimate evil ending etc a strategy turn based jrpg with one liners great music shut up and take my money this game talk too much before begin i love octopath but you keep repeating how you spent 50 hours on this game even though its not that much it was my understanding that when you do finish all eight stories there is a world threatening baddie monster this is my second jrpg so far first being xenoblade 2 which was eh im digging it too much im only 40 hours in with plenty more to go im in love with this game the only thing i dont like is story segments are played out as if theres only one character like with boss fights some are like so you came here by yourself eh completely ignoring my other party members other than that this game is fantastic must buy for switch owners who are fans of this genre a job system wow thats never been done before its olberic the warrior not the knight the graphiscs beautifull i downloaded the demo and played for 30 mins damn i love this game i would love a new game like ff tactics or vagrant story but any remakes like that one should stick to the old formula and look a remake of parasite eve would be amazing if they did it like they did with resident evil 2 but what i truly would love is a remake of xenogears i need a switch well play it more its just romancing saga with the gameplay of bravely default i bought this over xenoblade 2 and im setsuna and im not disappointed ill be getting this when i finally get my switch i love the graphic look very pretty this guy is excruciating to listen to so over the top i finished octopath traveller and it was okay calm down bro im going to play this and pretend its the true golden sun 3 which other platforms is this game on be careful playing the demo youll want to buy the whole game i know i did lol 24 minutes of gameplay doesnt make me want this game glad i watched the review as well you know i think its charming and somewhat sweet that theres little connection between the stories its just kind and capable people helping each other achieve something great and looking for company it may be unrealistic but its something pure and thats what makes me love it as much as i do i love this game and im glad the reviewer does as well bring golden sun back on switch nintendo please i cant stand how small the text is looks like golden sun for gba with bad graphics quality haha theres an optional final boss that links all the stories together in lore mostly with the backstory of an unseen hero who inspired several of the travelers and a secret villain who drove several antagonists to commit their crimes this is what lets go could have been take notes game freak youre getting schooled i just dont think it worth 60 dollars in any case the first impression the graphic looks so last century and then the price tag just shocking me i am just liking this video because it exists not because of all the love the commentsection gives for a lovable reviewer who loves the gamer dont know if that sounds depressing or hopefull you say it xd so this is like the golden sun in the gameboy get bravely default best final fantasy game in years i preferred octopath and kumquat i love this game because this type of rpg i enjoyed when i was in primary and secondary school throwback thursday lol no word of a lie psx was my last console im 37 final fantasy 6 and chronotrigger are mandatory every 58 years for me kids are getting a switch for christmas and im buying this game immediately and word is with the success this game has had that the designers are working on another similar project that will be more in line with classic rpgs common goal and common antagonist i cant wait to play this and anything else that pays homage to classic square games i wish you could upgrade skills and weapons its a shame for this not to have dlc new characters and classes legendary itemsthe possibilities buying this for myself for christmas i loved the demo anyone here that saw this game as nominee on the game awards and thought the art style was beautiful i really wish they would remake chrono trigger like this everybody seems to go for therion on their first go xd seriously im thinking of getting this xenoblade chronicles 2 or disgaea 5 i just bought a switch any recommendations is it worth it this reviewer was a breath of fresh air first time ive watched an ign review in a very long time was not disappointed dude love your personality seth macy you think 53 hours is enough to take on the hardest bosses in a jrpg think again to bad they didnt talk about the inal dungeon that was amazing i masturbated to the graphics i know that he likely didnt have the time to reach each but saying that nothing ties all the story together couldnt be farther from the truth and without spoiling too much there is definitely a overarching connection and worldthreatening force at the very end its like dragon quest but super awesome two of the four shrine bosses can be cheesed with a dancer divine skill on a cleric reflective veil this is beautiful but i still have bravely default second in my backlog p dude the way he was talking about it made it sound like he wanted to marry the developers and have kids with them and give this game a 10 this game looks pretty cool too bad its switch only 99 score for the reviewer for this 93 review score game alright nintendo buy xenogears copyright and do it right i want it i want it now and i want it bad dont like the graphic style 136 cough true ending cough fortnite had a better score than this i need this im buying it i like that you have 8 completely different stories its about each persons journey it doesnt have to be about a big baddy to unite them all theyve made it so that you have more reason to play this game its called replay value instead of releasing everything to dlc down the track what a great review definitely one of the first games im getting whenever i buy a switch i agree that the one big thing holding this game back is the lack of interaction between the heroes the optional dialogues after you start chapter 2 come up short because they are not voice acted that should have been a must during development even if they wouldve had to throw in more data its a mixture of minecraft and an 8 bit styled rpg it could be like final fantasy taticsthe combati love this game style great review ill definitely be buying this game now best jrpg in years played it for months and never get tired of it music is fantastic dude finish the game before reviewing there is actually an ending calamity boss and the 8 stories actually come to 1 and its all caused by lyblac lady great review awesome looking game one thing sets me back from buying this game though i thought it would be like final fantasy 63 in japan why is their no absolute evil power in this game and i would have expected that all caracters would join together and send out in groups you can form i still wait for a jrpg game that can beat ff6 also i missed the humor of final fantasy 6 the wicked octopus the opera scene still i give this game a go one day their is so much love from developers in this title you have to own it also its build along with fans love this guys enthusiasme no bunny suit or puff puff 9 out 10 oh wait sleep with hookers in every gta game 9 out of 10 okay this will be the first game ill get for the switch spoilers no absolute evil to fight well now we know he hasnt been to postgame is thatpersonality i schmell off this reviewer love this game this game is giving me kono subarashii sekai ni shukufuku wo vibes for some weird kind of reason luv this game keep supporting it worst game i have ever played 050 i would like to clarify yes characters are 2d and scenery is 3d but those are merely visuals the characters can only be controlled in 2 dimensions x axis and z axis climbing stairs does not mean the y axis is controllable a jump button would ign needs to use this guy more frequently for reviews i love tiltshift graphics when done right wowlove this review but it just made me a little overwhelmed considering i just got my switch and this gameseems there is much to do first of all stellar review secondly keep training youll beat those hidden job bosses one daythirdly there is a story connecting them all much more deeply and there is a world ending calamity to boot just dig deeper and search harder and i know you can find it the answer is closer than you think the artwork on this game is amazing i played this game and except for what i think is what i think are some of the cheapest enemies in gaming history i really like this game ive played this game for at least 150 hours and im still going because one of the hardest bosses ive ever faced in a long time i personally have an odd nitpick with the blend of realistic settings with the spritebased characters as i think its a little odd i dont know if the contrast works in this games benefit or the opposite buuuuttt if they ever made a sequel i would love to see where they go from here because i think there is so much potential with this game although i sometimes hate the enemies at times beating them to progress is so much satisfying i love the characters and the story and found myself crying laughing and getting angry not enough games give me that emotional involvement and i thank octopath traveler for existing and the music is topnotch its like some xc stuff up in there hey ign maybe keep seth around for a while for us plz se now makes rpg maker games yeah whatever crappy nes game alert radiant chronology cloneeeee hope this game will have a mac port a zelda version of this would be amazing just bought it great review p i miss the pros and cons id give this game 1010 i bought my nintendo switch the other day i saw this game in the shop but decided to put it back and watch a review to see what its all about now i know its a mustbuy getting this after i finally beat botw i gotta get to playing sm odyssey as well man switch made me buy so many games i cant keep up lol this guy should review every game for ign or at least narrate it sooo where are all the people that said octopath wasnt gonna sell even close to a million hmmm nowhere you guys seemed so positive just got mine today i think this needs to be updated in light of the events of the final dungeon the games great but something disturbing me when i play and then i stop because of that why the characters dont talk to each others maybe i didnt go far enough to get to the main point of the game but now im a bit disapointed by this game im a huge fan of final fantasy 3 and bravely default but i dont find myself on octopath travelers or maybe i have to continue to get fun with it while i dont care for the old art styles anymore since growing up ill give it a shot when i get my switch rpgs like witcher 3 are too beautiful to make time for this ancient 16bit stuff but i will make time for it eventually the best review ign has had in a long time please now final fantasy tactics 3 on switch and golden sun too we need them this or xeno blade idk which to get game of the year yay therion is my favoriteplus he was my firstthen i chose haanitthen tressaand now olberic an ign review with a passionate and knowledgeable critic and one whos review i completely agree with what sorcery is this while the 8 different character stories couldve used a little more connection between them oh boy are you in for a treat it really sounds great but i tend to not play these big games because i can never finish them im overwhelmed by them final fantasy tactics sequel with similar graphics please silicon studios knows how to make jrpgs with bravely default and bravely second game looks neat but i just hate jrpgs and turnbased combat turnbased anything just ruins the game for me how could you rate octopath traveler lower than fortnight if youre still on the fence and up for another perspective i reviewed the game as well its a more in depth review than this one but i still keep it spoiler free others have enjoyed my style you may too hope to help looks neat never going to buy a switch though did he say there was no end boss the first real system seller this year at least for switch did you know that the most searched thing in japan for a while was octopath traveler ps4 loved the tone and excitement you brought to the review this game is now on my topuchase list i need some advice i cant beat chapter 2 of any character i unlocked all characters and even grinned for hours and still die ive been wanting to play this game since i heard about it and this just made me want to play it even more great review tbh if u get a switch just buy botw mario odyssey octopath traveler splatoon 2 and you now have enough to play for a year this nerd is the nerdiest nerd and im loving it calm down bro no open world not 16 bit era can we get this say gut to do every ign reveiw this guy has clearly played the dam game that score better be high for octopath traveler edit yeaaaaah got this game today after initially being slightly sceptical about it but oh was i wrong having even the slightest doubt about this game being a masterpiece i chose therion as well to start the game and it is such a joy playing it i am actually not really a fan of turnbased rpgs but octopath traveler along with the divinity original sin series is a major exception i mean even though it is turnbased it sort of feels fastpaced the combat is easily accessabble and a blast to master the world is beautiful as far as i can tell since i only started the game a few hours ago the graphics are so fricking special they are an awkward delight to look at and the music the music is simply great and manages to convey the right emotional state for any situation the game has put me in so far who do i believe ign or dunkey 93 not enough battle royale 78 too many turns the name is dumb as hell but ill check it i wonder if someone is gonna make a fan made comic like fire emblemabout what would happen if all the main characters meet up or something else sooner or later this game reminds me shovel knight people loves it and i simply understand why what the heck this reviewer is awesome ign keep using this dude although i appreciate the review i cant help but think that nowadays reviews are made with a ton of bias i couldnt for the life of me get into this game nor was i charmed by it i did like ff games but that was then im not sure how to explain it now ps4 players are begging for a port of octopath traveler how does it feel to beg for a port to be honest while i liked the games mechanics and the music is wonderful the story has some pretty cringey lines the writing could use some work just my two cents hey where is igns the persistence reviews i didnt think id come back to this to cleanse my eyes after viewing dunkeys toxic review of this game this could become a classic jrpg way to go se you still got it also fair review is there a benefit downloading the demo if i own the game already like how pokemon sun and moon gave you ash greninja do you get an exclusive item but dunk hated this had to come back here to wash the bad taste of dunkeys review out of my mouth videogamedunkey dumped this game but ign gives it a 93 so i think the game is worth to try out because both just were investing their time in it already to review it ive honestly never seen a game with graphics like this before and the fact that its an rpg game is awesome one of the main aspects of what makes a great rpgjrpg game and determines the ultimate experience is the graphicsatmosphere this is only my opinion of course but i just bought this game the other day and im truly looking forward all that this game has to offer so far ive played a bit and have not been disappointed im sure the game only gets better the further you get into i used to not like rpg games when i was a kid cause i thought they were boring andor pointless but as i got older i started to get bored of all the mainstream video games and wanted a new gaming experience then i started to play rpgs more and for some reason liked them alot rpgs are not for everyone but i think those who dont like rpgs just dont have a true appreciation for video games or understand the heart of rpg games its more than just a game you get to engage more and see a story un go watch the dunkey review d the shrines to unlock the classes arent hard to find they have a unique minimap marker and are all in a level 20 zone ie chapter 2 level geographically near to their respective characters starting area i picked all 8 up before starting each characters second chapter and none of them had a boss guarding them so i dont know how the reviewer is coming up with that atm im 40 hours in and i am still working on chapter 3 and ive unlocked chapter 4 for a couple characters so far my biggest complaint is that you cant substitute out your protagonist this leaves 1 character always struggling to keep up with the other 7 yet if you want to complete the game on a single playthrough they all need to be relatively strong to one another primrose chapter 4 starts at level 45 yet cyrus the guy ive used the least is only level 25 by way of a whole lot of grinding despite haanit my protagonist of choice being 43 and ophelia olberic and primrose the rest of my agro does this game have any water sections like out on a ship it seems like there are large water areas on the map this game looks boring to me but i wish i could try it this review sold me this game im buying it tomorrow thinking of getting this what do you guys in the comments think worthy successor to classics like chrono blade 93 for a generic rpg game such an awesome game ive only been playing for five days and ive put nearly 50 hrs into it already youre actually defending this game i swear ign only rates based on how popular a game is this is why i dont trust them any more you can tell by the enthusiasm in his voice that this man loves his soy ho marge not coming to pc not interested they need to make suikoden 6 like this i very curious about this game because stock for this game is very rare when i get a switch im gonna try to get a switch on boxing day for this game is this a nintendo exclusive too much pixels seth macy more like seth macuck 78 out of 10 the sprites should been more high dev and the battle choreography should have improved even more i know gacha games which have better sprites and battle choreography but alas this square enix we are talking about they should drop any ff clone and final fantasy and only focus on kingdom hearts and dragon quest anybody here in comments purchased this game is it worth 4999 realistically i cant decide whether to go for it or not or would xeno be a better rpg between this monster hunter and zelda i think its time for me to pick one of these consoles up fantastic review btw one of the better ones ive seen from ign best game since like 20 years o d bravely default lol this wont age well in europe other than the uk so im gonna wait and get it cheap later on haha i have a questionwhere can i see my enemies hitpoints it feels like i have no idea whether to be more risky or safe because i have no reference point to how weak my opponent is contrast this to the fifa 18 review on the switch sounds like bravely default gameplay why does he he sound like it has never be done before cool points to anyone that can tell me how to play through the stories should i finish each character one by one or do all the stories together chapter by chapter im lost haha another lame game for switch turn based rpgs sre wsy too old as well as ff tactics styles pixel drawings 93 is a deceptive score made by ign great now i have to get a switch i thought you need to 100 a game or be close to that to review it all i remember about this review is 53 hour i love how most of the comments are people begging for this game to come to other platforms when in reality nintendo funded this game so it will most likely never come to any other platform in all honesty though what struck me most in octopath besides the gameplay storytelling and graphics is the soundtrack battle1 decisive battle2 stillsnow and journeys end are very pleasing to listen to psa turn 1 charged donate bp into triple charge sorcerer spell instant kill on all mobs talks like hes learning how to read and mincing each word what in dafuq this was really encouraging for me to buy this game ign should put this guy on the spot light of their games reviews friendly reminder to boicot square enix until octopath traveller gets released on ps4 let them know that we wont stand by this switch exclusive bullshit we dont want that nobody does i wish the old final fantasies can be remade in this fashion now why cant square make a final fantasy game like this i feel like thats what older fans have been wanting for literally decades at this point wonder if this was not a nintendo exclusive if the score would be as high i feel like the voice acting for your characters is a little lackluster during battle as they very often repeat the same things during fights very little variation on their lines would be my only complaint for the game so far tbh love his enthusiasm ign you do a bad job review video games you and gameinforer to damm short and surprise you givein this game a 93 i will do a way better job reviewing this game la la land of jrps just another reason to buy a switch didnt hear of this game before this video definitely something i might wanna check out thanks for the heads up the new final fantasy this guy should do audio book recordings got octopath traveler add before the video this is defo a daemon hatfield gameplease be excitelolscoop looks more linear than games of this kind usually are hope not i hope this means we get to finally have a super mario rpg sequel soon did you know that octopath spells out the characters name here is proof ophelia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alphyn theroin haanit whats is about i dont get it whats the big deal about this game that i dont own the switch let this man review all your games i got an ad for octopath traveler on the video about octopath traveler too bad i dont have nintendo switch i guess this wont be coming to ps4 i love the way this game looks but man there are too many effects i wish there was some way to dumb down the filters a bit ive found my reason to get a switch this looks so beautiful and fantastically put together goty confirmed imagine ff6 remake visualy like this reviewer was excited like a little fangirl before a bieber concert picked it up after remembering that i havent played a square enix rpg game in 3 years played for 8 hours on my day off and its just phenomenal problem is the game is running out of physical copies even in japan im surprised the music wasnt mentioned thats one of the things i definitely noticed during the demo sold im getting the game i feel like the pricepoint of this game is too high it costs more than botw at least in my country but eventually i will buy it first day buy for me been waiting forever for a worthwhile jrpg is square enix finally understanding that these are the games that matter is the golden age of classic jrpgs returning or do they need to see 15 xv more failures to realize a reviewer who went into a game to enjoy it i want this on ps4 one day has past since the launch and the physical copies are nearly sold out worldwide and sold out in japan this could be the beginning of a jrpg resurgence i want to buy this but i also want to buy bayonetta what should i buy first just got it who should i start with just got this game and im already hooked i really want this game but i cant stand turn based battle system respect for my fellow therion main i was super pumped for this game im only about 56 hours into it and had no idea about a job system im super pumped to get there thanks for the review i thought there would be a 3ds version o3o game looks great but i still cant stomach the thought of dropping 400 on a switch with a controller and a game maybe if they actually supplied a controller with their games console i might reconsider haha waiting for price drop this game looks amazing game is 50 oh well must buy this game looks so dope that art style please use your mouth muscles more when talking you dont have enough enunciation in your speech sounds like an awesome game too bad its exclusive to switch you are right but i wont buy it art style blows serious question but did the 8 character gimmick remind you of saga frontier that game was bad but i imagine this game is much better than saga looks like absolute trash its 2018 not 1990 wow a reviewer that is genuinely interested in his game and provides some interesting points you mean 53 freaking hours i havent seen a switch exclusive game that has a score of 8 belowall switch game has a critical acclaim and positive reviews so there is 8 characters that mean 40320 ways 8 factorial to start the game jrpg are games about menu min maxing basically diablo for the sedentiary minded the game is awesome thats it thats the review go buy it is this a switch only game so you can play the same story from 8 different perspectives or 8 completely different stories whenever i see classic jrpg i remembers rpg maker and how much i spend my time creating my game i seen this in the nintendo e shop and fell in love with the artwork i am very happy to see that it did well literally cant stop playing this game dude chrono trigger remake like this would be amazing clicks on octopath review gets octopath ad at least its related to the video content for once sounds great all except for the break system in combat that sounds to much like the generic break system from final fantasy 13 so you just rock paper scissors your way through the handful of attack types till they break then hit them hard it was super simplistic and boring doing hope this isnt that but it sure looks like it wow this review actually has depth and enthusiasm bravo seth we need more reviews like this worth the wait for sure right now as im laying the 1st 8 hours of the game each encounter required me to press a and sometimes navigate to a healing grape using the dpad awsome im not saying the game isnt fun im saying this review is bs this is such a cheaply made review i would even call it a ign classic pathetic this bodes really well for the devs cause now they can use this game engine and remake a bunch of their old games its a winwin for everyone i got a octopath traveler ad before this video i think im going to hold on to my money for dragon quest xi goddamn it nintendo i guess i need to buy a switch now thank you lord turnbased rpg from square if you choose one character and play through the stories of the others while on the same file are the stories any different than if you chose those characters this game has the strength of the golden age of jrpgs octopath traveler 93 dark souls 91 uncharted 4 91 fortnite 96 a lot of indies games are better octopath traveler is a jrpg dream come true this sums it up what nintendo only so 300 game it is then he acts like 53 hours is a huge amount are you trying to sell me a car jesus christ can you guys please add subtitles or even autogenerated subtitle options that would be really neat thanks this review is not at all bias you can tell by the constant compliments he gave the game with obvious critical thinking it is like he reads it off the reviewer guild provided by the game creator again not bias at all was going to get it until i found out it turned base battle system i wish they make a sequel to mario rpg like this one the amount of the word love said in this review says so much about the game is it possible to disable the vignette damn this game uses a way too aggressive form darkening everything except the middle of the screen such a shame primrose story is so deep who else chose therion on their first play through no one wow do they say sense of pride and accomplishment now every video as some code word are they keeping you hostage bro if ign gave this a 9310 that means everyone else will give it less than a 710 skip welcome home squaresoft i find a lot of the complaints about the story and the writing in reviews of this game pretty damning its the one thing that can and often does really ruin a jrpg for me i dont trust your reviews anymore is there too much grinding in this game when was the last time i used a staff for attacking any time that it had an elemental bonus saving me mp any time that it inflicted status on enemies healing party members with a cure based staffdamaging undead and saving mp aeris in final fantasy vii yuna with a maxed out spere grid in final fantasy x and so on and so forth sounds like the reviewer never thought outside of the box with his mageshealers when playing jrpgs until now now i kinda want a ffvi remake with the quality and aesthetic of octopath traveler i would get it but theyre trying to charge 60 for a 16 bit game and they didnt even give it a name but i game on pc d man i saw quality the first 5 seconds please let this guy do more of igns reviews he wasnt monotone but actually very enthusiastic and i liked his energy overall a review with life passion and enthusiasm excellent review seth keep up the great work give this reviewer a raise 93 for a game that is not fps or call of duty is ign under new management or maybe the next cod is getting a 25 please bring it over to the 3ds can a pc user get some love here probably nintendo will not gonna port this lovely game to pc so sad glad to see a more traditional 16 bit style jrpg again oh how ive missed you you cant say three separate contrasting locations are the most gorgeous ragnarok is back this guy should have reviewed sonic mania 710 doesnt have crafting ign id play this game purely for the art style have they improved the save locations or added the ability to skip text faster i had to fight the big boss in the dancer demo 6 times to get it right and had to levelequip up i want to buy this but i dont like wasting time stuck in rerunning dialogue does anyone know if nintendo is done with the 3ds i ask because the next fire emblem will be on the switch shitting rn i cant wait to play i cant play this game the font is too tiny looks worse than a psp game what a joke wish it was on ps4 bruh that graphic alone is enough reason for me to buy it 010 couldve been an animal crossing announcement love the game but it is an unbalanced grindfest after you finish all the first chapters oh man i really like what i m seeing here im gonna have to get this game after all this game gets 93 ah ign u have no brain what a wondeful reviewer therion is best boi tres cool been playing this for a few hours now and its incredibly deep well worth the price this was a great review thanks loved your personality in this one more ign reviewers should put the enthusiasm in that you did 50 though i love this kind of rpg old graphics with a twist of modern graphics plus the content looks amazing 93 out 10 no sony allowed imagine saga frontier with this art style how awesome would it be if they made a pokmon game like this the ad is still playing and im going to guess 75 60 bucks roflol theyre out of their frickin minds maybe worth 99 cents maybe my hands is shaking dude to me it is a 10 i dont get why it is a bad thing that the characters dont share one goal like one evil dude who wants to destroy the world oh no instead of one generic story we got 8 unique ones how bad this is a switch exclusive noooooo i cant afford to buy a console solely for one game im heart broken cant wait until i can emulate this in a year or two will this be on ps4 soon is there a japanese vo in this game this is exactly how crono trigger needs to be remade another crappy nintendo game red dead redemption 2 is gonna crush this game love this review with this guy should i complete all chapters in a single characters story before moving on to the next or should i keep them all going at once im confused and i dont want to watch the whole video for possible spoilers my compliments to the reviewer and the game trust me people as fun as it is to play games with far cry 5 graphics is sometimes it aint everything games like this must be tried and appreciated by everyone why are nintendo rpg ui so awkward kinda reminds me of how xenoblade was beautiful environments but crappy character designsmovements this game looks incredibly gorgeous i cant wait to buy a switch and play this game if square enix ever redo ff5 or ff6 they should do it in this style i was expecting ign to bash this game next day i was dissapointed wow im shocked they actually made something worth playing keep it up nintendo how i wish square enix would make another ff tactics with such graphicsnonetheless played this demo before a game worth playing indeed the battle system looks like bravely default this review sounds like it was recorded in a cupboard under the stairs i really want to play this but i really dont want to buy a switch not a nintendo hater loved the wiiu and didnt stop playing mario kart 8 online until a few weeks ago i would buy a switch just for this grew up with this stuff too bad no pc for this game the storys a little generic but you dock points because it doesnt interlink or have an overarching boss the most generic route imaginable and you act like this is how games have to be the reviewer makes it sound like 53 hours is a long campaign lul oh wow if i didnt want to buy this game before i do now i like when 710s get high scores from ign to sell consolesgames much better than xeno 2 cant wait to add this to my backlog really looking forward to this to bad the supplier for the online store i preordered from had trouble delivering on time so it looks like i wont get my copy until monday to the people who picked therion first in the demo im ready are you is the battle system like grandia why the hell are you in the comments buy the game everyone seems to start with therion this guy is real on his game whats the best way to go between towns lots of roads have higher level enemies and are restrictive i have the huntress and the thief but from there is seems likei would have to run to the next town and try to flee from enemies the enemy scaling is weird and i dont know how to easily go beween towns to get more characters without having to grind to get stronger as someone who hasnt really played much of jrpgs should i give this game a try man this dude seemed to really like this game overated i thought it would at least be a 95 this is a really great review just started playing the game im loving it so far idk how jumping between save files works so if you meet a protagonist to add to your party you can choose to play their beginning and if you finish chapter 1 of their story you can grab them whenever at the tavern but do i need sepperate save files for each character how do i got back safely to the point i met said character how do i know chapter 1 is over how do i switch back to my first character of choice without losing progress this get me even more hyped for the last night let the casuals play fortnite i will be playing this game instead a real gamers game are you kidding me i just spent 100 dollars on wolfenstein 2 and crash lmao now i have no money for this and i want it so damn bad for me personaly game of the year only smash is really strong too at least it should be jrpg of the year the real final fantasy 15 we deserve based on what was said i was expecting 97 at least but still im glad to hear the game is a hit ill definitely be picking this one up right away worth the wait i couldnt handle a game like this looks fuckin awesome tho this game alone makes me want the nintendo switch hopefully the switch is supported for many years to come as i wont be able to buy one for awhile already started playing my copy but you know since the ground work is already done how about a final fantasy 6 remaster using the octopath traveler engine been loving it so far only complaint is i wish the colors popped a bit more its a minor nit picked but theyre pretty washed out greatv freaking game though the water should have been 16 bits too the switch has become home for the jrpg genre and this game cements that statement hopefully we can get a bravely default port and maybe a sequel 93 not enough octopussies ign please review more games waitso if i pick theron and meet the scholar does that spoil his story or i mean are there 8 different starts or honestly just get this seth guy to do all the reviews from now on i still dont like this 100 point system whats the difference btween a 93 and a 94 or a 92 you could have been the next golden sun isnt this game going to get released in ps4 this is what happens when the devs use feedback from their fans to make a great game i really appreciate the enthusiasm in this review so exited for this game now playing primrose my main love this games so much seth macy is the hero we need imagine the reviewer talking about his first steps on mars instead im downloading the demo to try it out is the game worth playing i like rpgs but somewhat for jrpgs now port it to a real console like ps4 come on when you get a octopath traveler ad before watching this video i personally wanted a 12 switch sequel but i guess this will do the switch library is getting pretty strong how much does one of these cost again can we get this guy to review other rpgs from now on i want this so bad but i aint got no switch now do this to chrono trigger everyone who pre ordered at gamestop make sure you demand your stickers and foil trading cards that are supposed to come with it my local gstop manager lied to my face and said it didnt exist and i literally had to embarrass her in front of customers by calling other game stops in area and asking them about it which lead to me realizing she was hoarding them and very embarrassingly had to fish one out for me after i called her a lying thief the art style is beautiful only problem its on the fuckin switch honestlydoesnt look to great for mefinal fantasy vii is one of my fav gamesso i might check this one out later if theres a salenothing about this game screams impressive for memight be wrong i dont own a switch but we need more rpgs like this vintage style is this an ad or a review we need rpg with this kind of art in mobile game isnt kit the same character with ramza or marche from final fantasy tacticsadvance so what are the negatives so is there something compelling to drive the plot forward the reviewer mentioned that there isnt some world ending boss or weapon etc but is there a villain or something that is driving the game toward an end goal i ask this because i tend to dislike rpgs that have no real driving force for the group to keep going example the modern atelier iris games with their slice of life story plots just do not hold my attention it doesnt have to be an end of the world scenario but i need a compelling villain for me to stay engaged in the game i am just old school in that regard i suppose great review he makes you want to play the game even if you never wanted to i played a little of the demo this game is fun and this is coming from someone who plays zero jrpgs this looks promising coming from someone who has lost some faith in square still not interested modern warfare 2 got a 95 this game got a 93 let that sink in man i really should get a switch im tired of this kind of gameplay just give us ff 7 remake already this type of review is what ign used to be about this man wanted to make me buy the game twice lol reviewers and haters talking about the characters not being tied together find all 8 do their stories then talk ive been holding out on the switch for forever now but this is the kind of game ive been waiting for might go and get me one also fantastic review ps4 version when really love the old style rpg ign you reviewed a video game soooo japanese or english dub better great review someone who doesnt sound like a jaded hipster is pretty refreshing 9310 would listen to a review from him again reminds me of the ff mobile games mixed with ff tactics which is not a bad thing at all really bad voice acting but a fantastic game xbox fans ps4 fans butt hurt that they have to buy a switch for this one this isnt an rpg because there are no dialogue choices that affect the story and world or character customization just another linear turn based fantasy game kudos for a great review just picked mine up cant wait which game should i get octopath traveler or xenoblade chronicles 2 was the review recorded in a bucket it just sounds odd is all i dont have switch no pc release i love this kind of game what dose the j stand for in jrpg i looooooove this battle system theres a faaaantastic whatever seems he liked the game now octopath is available and its very well recived from everyonewhat i will ask for after that is a new bravely game as its also inspired by the classic era of turnbased games and more games from i am setsuna and lost sphere devs beside more eterian odessey and other rpgs from atlus beside nintendo reviving golden sun to bring back the golden era of turnbased jrpgs beside the other great modern rpgs and we can see the days of snes ps12 of rpgs gaming comeback in a very great way one of the few reasons why i want the switch this looks incredible this is why vr is so great you get this amazingly cute miniature effect without the selective blur played the demo for this on my friends switch it sits comfy next to zelda on my to get list for when i buy my switch i am interested because of the art style alone cute charming 16bit sprites in 3d while keeping water light and fire in next gen artstyle perfect combination 320 that sense of pride and accomplishment never gets old i want to know how does this game compare to fire emblem i wish this comes on steam sometime later they still make these dull turn based games why we have 3d graphics and combat systems now damn now i gotta get this comments number 1000 yey yeeees square enix is back the stories not coming together is a massive oversight what were they thinking can we get a ps4xbox one release please i hope there will be plenty of storyline dlcs for this game with more interactions between the main characters otherwise this game just seems to have everything a jrpg fan needs been waiting forever for a game like this 93553574347643664221 but it deserved a 93553584347643664221 my favorite games growing up were the golden sun rpgs on the game boy advance i get a huge sense of familiarity when playing octapath traveler release is one day to late for my vacation are the current 153 dislikes from trolls that dislike every ign review video i doubt anyone will see this comment but did anyone know ign path to cave of origin you can enocunter snow marmots i didnt see that on ign guide thing so i was curious cuz i encountered two side by side oo i have a game store next to my work place and my shift starts at 12pm but im going in 3 hours early just to play it haha this game looks really fuckin cool i have the game yes can i create my own character the voice of the reviewer is sound like the narrator from pokemon lol why would anyone want every single fight to require strategy that sounds like such a great way to get burnt out this is the best thing happening july 13thother than my birthday not surprised this game was made by the bravely default team anything those guys touch is pure gold black baron will foam his mouth for this i seriously found it a boring old school game im generally not a fan of jrpgs but xenoblade chronicles 2 for example made me spend over 300 hours on it great another switch winner dude octopath used my dream 3d art presentation i guess i just have to make my game why is the demo so looooong i still just cant quite muster up any interest in this game low graphic game with unreal engine 4 style why is pixel graphic used so much imagine an mmorpg with octopaths graphics hhhnnnnnggg too many travelers not enough paths edit is that meme still on going or did i just killed it this is the game im getting a switch for how tf did this get 93 the demo was so boring damn you guys are fast maybe first infact is there a journal for side missions i want this game so bad rpg of the year too bad i dont have a switch ps4 pc can be played on vita game scores are getting meaningless ign gave this game 93 the exaclty same score that witcher 3 had so you are saying this game is equality amazing as the witcher let this guy do more reviews its ashames such a beautiful aesthetic is wasted on an rpg game of the year right here i want nintendo to get square enix to remake earthbound using this art style have this mam review every game please can you hire more reviewers like this please come on ign i believe you can do it this review sounds like a man who has never played a video game and is blown away that he can do anything come on man this is clearly inspired by the playstationsaturn era of 2d meets 3d ala xenogears snes never did that please get it right kind of disappointed theres no over arching plotline that connects everything but still going to get it for the fun gameplay this game stinks this reviewer knows is it true that whoever you choose at the beginning of the game you are force to keep him or her in your party in that entire play through i heard you can change them at the beginning but what about endgame content i need an rpg for the switchthis shall be it is this better than ffxv too much staff attacks not one mention about the music lesser scores have gotten mentions in reviews this one deserved a mention for yasunori nishiki nice review but i dont imagine myself playing this kind of game to old school i think pass the graphics and gameplay really turn me off love the enthusiasm behind this review i could easily tell by your inflictions that youre so passionate about this game i came into this video expecting a typical scripted review but i was surprised by the passion looking forward to getting my hands on this awesome jrpg sethmacy please make more reviews youre great mute the voice acting its amazing i think square should do a ff6 remake with assets from this gameheck maybe it could be a switch exclusive ive been craving a meaty rpg to sink my teeth into cant wait til the game arrives tomorrow butdoes it have behemut this game is my dreams 65 too much traveling great review actually i just got my switch a couple weeks ago im glad i picked up this console after see this game review and i ve already preordered it cant wait to play can someone explain how the multiple characters stories work do you literally have to play through the entire game eight times to get all the stories or can you switch back and forth between characters in one playthrough and complete all stories that way im so confused this guy should do the review of every gameeven for xbox pc and ps4even mobile start doing all of ign reviews wow this game looks horrible another flop for the switch i legit thought this was minecraft it would have been great 20 years ago i dont care today my boyfriend preordered this for my birthday a few weeks ago 0 ive been helplessly waiting for 12 am all day today lol super excited for the graphics and change in difficulty compared to the jrpgs weve been forcefed the past few years how did gow get a 10 while this got a 93 the lack of a world ending calamity or other big tie it all together baddie is actually refreshing thats quite a departure from most rpgs and serves to give this one more of an anthologycollection of stories to be separately appreciated it a way it sort of makes the game world seem more believable as a result each one has a little story to tell and you get to see it all through their eyes i often find the one ultimate baddie parts of stories a bit overdone so if this gives 8 compelling stories without going too far it sounds like an amazing game to me i wish i knew what games this reviewer cos looking at other medias scores it seems he enjoys anime tiddies too much well written seth youre awesome maybe this rpg can change my mind on the repetition of action rpgs cool now hopefully square enix actually starts supporting the switch and put tomb raider final fantasy and kh3 on the system dont tell me some bullshit like the games wont run this doesnt mean octopath traveler is bad but that square enix said theyll be heavily supporting the switch so they better put third party games on it you too ubisoft im glad octopath got an amazing score but the reviewer sounds kind of fake just me okay what a great review so little said about the story thx for a half assed review cant wait for tomorrow 53 hours the way he put emphasis it twice seems like thats a lot of gametime which isnt for a jrpg playthrough if that was from a playthrough of choosing one character out of eight only then would i be impressed very welldone and enthusiastic review one of the best review videos ive watched in awhile so excited for this game i wanna get this and i dont even have a switch yet wtf 53 hrs just for one character i didnt like the way the review was organized seems like you retold the story rather than summarized it turn based combat is still relevant must have rpg game need this in nintendo switch bravely default mix with earlier final fantasy games which was essentially bravely default kinda wish all the stories tied in together better depending on who you have in your party if thats the case probably the only big negative i may have must buy i have friday and saturday off and will be at best buy first thing in the morning jrpgs have always been with me since the nes final fantasy the demo prologue was incredible this game is only on the switch fft2 next please cant wait to play it this reviewer is great where are all my bravely default fans at ign not enough water 41 ive been playing this for a week its fun worth 60 bucks not really but 40 yes definitely getting this game after i beat zelda havent played a jrpg game since fire emblem birthright im really excited for tomorrow i wish i wasnt working all weekend this is the reason why i bought nintendo switch thank you square enix for this wonderful game nintendo game so 9 or 10 rating and everyone will defend it lol is there an option to turn voice acting off always felt like va is not entirely necessary for rpgs like this calling it now this will be at least nominated for game of the year and best rpg it might win rpg if nothing supeior comes out but thats it this game looks so fun it might get a art direction award too reminds me on the last remnant ign needs to hire more people like this he sounds so excited to talk about a game he clearly loved and thoroughly enjoyed he also seems to love jrpgs and also be very knowledgeable too i give this guy an a this is an ign review i can get behind and agree with seth macy keep doing what youre doing it happens to me just like when i had see ffxii in ps2 amazed with the graphics not trying to be that guy but is this coming to androidios hope this gets out to playstation this is rubbish this is gonna sell so damn well cant wait to stream this got an hour left on my demo to get me trough till release day take note tetsuya nomura you might learn something literally clicked to skip to the end to see the score i wanna go in as blind as possible ive been waiting for a nice throwback rpg for a long time im pleased to see it score really high cant wait to dive in later tonight dammit how am i supposed to play this and fortnite at the same time this could be my game of the year great review and you can tell the reviewer really enjoyed playing it and knows his stuff ooooooo wow defo gunna check this out such a genuine review i can tell you really enjoyed the game cant wait to pick it up this score was a little bit too high this is an 80 at best ill take the review with a grain of salt since the game wasnt completed by the reviewer im getting vibes that its grindy and a little repetitive but still looking forward to playing for the presentation and combat tomorrow cant come soon enough wait what a person at ign with personality dont let the flame die out seth macy this like is for you not ign another solid reason to own a switch grumble grumble grumble cat wait to pick this game up tomorrow can you put the voices on silent this game drips saga frontier from every single pore a must buy the art style the game mechanics the music the characters and their story its all just so beautiful i havent been looking forward to a game this much since breath of the wild and i know it wont disappoint i wish they would have changed the name this game remind me of final fantasy tactics i cant wait for this games release tomorrow its going to keep me busy summer long love the review especially your passion and enthusiasm 93 too much main characters after hearing the enthusiasm in the reviewers voice i thought he was going to give it a perfect score glad to see the 93 though wow great review im hyped octopath or captain toad i would usually go octopath but i hated xenoblade bc i couldnt stand the battle system and this is also a jrpg im guaranteed to love captain toad but i might love this more ive had this game on my radar ever since it was first announced not sure when ill get my hands on it but at least i wont be disappointed love the art style and the feel of everything in this game i really hope they continue this as a pillar franchise and would love to see it flesh out further woah 93 impressive this guy needs to review every game theres something wrong with you if you like this game or games like it just played the demo and gotta say this game is amazinghopefully it gets ported to other platforms ill wait for pcxb1ps4 or mobile the game deserves to run on a higher resolution those sprites look bad yes im so glad you enjoyed it great review man glad you got to review a game you actually wanted to review i cannot stop talking about this game recommending it to everyone i know ive posted three videos about it even with two more in the pipeline excited to see you do another review love your writing and syntax because of this game i bought a nin switch they should remake chrono trigger and earthbound like this the look is cool but i dont get the people losing their minds over it in so excited for release cant wait you guys didnt let me down i was hoping it would be a 935 review the battle system annoyes the fuk outta me because in right handed great game play great graphics and great rpg factor 1outta 10 this is a system seller wow 93 excellent im even more impressed by this well written review nice job im kind of surprised i havent heard anyone compare this game to romancing saga its the same basic principle the moment i saw the thumbnail art i knew i would love to play this game buying this how did ign beat this game but no one one else even came close primrose all the way 3 is this ps4 needs a ps4vita version someone send a review copy or a gift copy to the people that made i am setsuna maybe they will learn a thing or twoor rather many things on how to make a game with a heart and soul now i want a ff6 remake using this method of art this game looks beautiful it certainly has my attention maybe this game is an engine demo for chrono trigger remake the game is amazing ive played the 3 hour demo and cant wait to play more my only gripe is i wish the characters interacted with each other more as it stands if you do one characters your other characters disappear in cut scenes and have no dialogue or do they express their own thoughts on the situation maybe its too much to want everyone to have an intertwined story line but it would have been fun to see the characters talk to each other more this is all based on the 3 hours ive played so far and maybe things are fleshed out more and i havent gotten there yet i really hope so the game is fantastic otherwise finally a traditional jrpg turn based the background music the ffvi style graphics with modern enhancements for me this is already my goty 9310 too many paths i hope switch owners actually buy this game hahahaha im sorry but bullshit i like the game but you reviewers are so biased and ridiculous depending on genre and platform so many people saying boring thats really sad to see what has happened to gaming turn based rpgs are looked down on by recent generations that just want to shoot or play something more mindlessly that requires less precise attention and can be played as relaxation younger people today find it hard to appreciate something that isnt fast paced action which is truly sad gonna go buy it now because australia the project was started by masashi takahashi and producer tomoya asano who previously headed the bravely series as expected it shouldnt be less than 50 hours lol well that was an annoying review he talked like if it was the best game ever created and he only showed a game that is a simple turn based type of game probably this guy never played a turn based game before dont get fooled people this is nothing new octopath just adds a bit of nostalgia not sure how much this cost but is no way a full price game i didnt care for it im not a fan of it anymore but man you sound like youre genuinely excited that i now what to consider a purchase i use to love jrpg but its so boring nowadays but if everything you say is true then im going to look for more reviews before officially buying it the only thing that disappoints me to hear is how none of the stories connect that much and that theres no bigger threat thats exactly what i was fearing otherwise looks great cant wait for tomorrow this is the year of the octoling 93 out of 10 not enough path rpg of the year im gonna buy a switch for this game and smash this dude talking sounds like a cheesed fan boy took away from the review dont let this dude narrate any more reviews why did he open this review like he was about to slam this game the game has nice snow and desert effects 93 10 can you skip the cinematic if you defeated by the boss in the demo this is super annoying to watch the same cinematic over and over again so there isnt a big main villain or calamity that effects all cast members across the board well thats kind of disappointing im older and busier now when i do have time to play a game i dont want to have to sit and think for ages on how to beat random battles youre supposed to be able to plow through those this game sounds like way too much work for me i need something mindless 93 he sounds like it could have got a 9510 thanks for the insight tomorrow i have to sell the game and only played the demo for a while it remembered me of my old ff7 days i loved it seth should read more of his reviews i was holding on to his every word great review the game sounds promising wow i was not expecting anything above an 85 truth be told glad the reviewer had such an amazing time with the game this is definitely making me reconsider my decision to not purchase it this is gonna be the golden sun of the switchlooks amazingcant wait to pick it up tomorrow i like this reviewer he speaks with a lot of passion comments right now port beggars that begging to have a port on their platform haters saying im not buying a switch just for one game realize they just envy and desperate i thought this game was like 40 not 60 a must buy rpg review is sponsored by n ign love ms and n money f u c k i n g c o c k s u c k e r s where can i see how many hours i put in a game people are saying that the characters have little to no reason to team up and dont really interact this review is so basic so they didnt technically complete the game cause they said they didnt do all the characters or a final chapter how can you review it then can we time travel to fast forward to tomorrow to play this game hell yes to the yesssss fuckers thats right im getting mine tomorrow ill be playing this game tomorrow all day great 355 too much grinding sorry chrono trigger reboot need a sale to pick up a switch my copy is on the way care of ups hurry up friday i know what ill be doin this weekend wish it came out on ps4 looks cool not a switch hater i just dont own one i love how enthusiastic this guy is you can tell how much he loves the game this is pretty much saga frontier 2018 and thats not a bad thing score 93 too many jobs i cant wait i really love the demo its remind me of jrpg i used to play in ps1 area divinity original sin 2 xenoblade octopath turn based rpgs have made one hell of an epic come back and i love them you can tell by his voice that he is in love with the game is it just me or does this dude have a lisp nice this game absolutely stunning when it was revealed back then deserve the praise i say wheres wheres justin y octotrash do the main characters acknowledge eachother at all finally a review that isnt half an hour long only subtitles japan and english this game is really expensive bought switch couse of this game incoming switch haters is there a single review out there from someone who completed the game how do you know there isnt a unified story when you never completed it kudos to this guy i really enjoy his review seth your enthusiasm for this review makes it all the more exciting to watch d as a huge jrpg fan i have never been so excited for a game this is going to be the must buy game for all jrpg fans and will probably give final reason to pick up a switch i cant wait can we get a final fantasy tactics sequel with graphics like this i thought it was sociopath lol so we still cant be absolutely 100 sure theres no super ultimate villain if you havent done all the characters stories there probably isnt but still looks pretty but boring ive been torn on this for a while in the end the footage at around 30 secs was enough discovering a chest in a cave im in finally a guy at ign with some personality im worried if this game have to much filter gonna wait on this just bought and recently started the trails in the sky games really really hope they use this engine model to remake games like ff5 and 6 shoulda been on ps4 as welloh well suikoden 2 remake with this art style please how tf did fortnite get a better score than this masterpiece oh sorry it didnt come out yet so i cant call it a masterpiece but really cmon it came out and yes its a masterpiece 93 is the new 45 at last ign hired a decent reviewer lol i dont believe you this game seems repetitive as hell i do find this game really interesting but i cannot help but think the artstyle is a bit too bleak i wish this review went more in depth about the story as a story nut i still dont know whether to buy this or not even the best gameplay in the world wont make me want to waste 50 hours on a meh story anything about the two player mode so bravely default in different name we want the pc version the only thing im bothered is that seth says super nes instead of snes or super nintendo this will probably be the first thing i pick up once i get a switch 93 not enough guns i hate rpg but for the first timei want to play this this game will stay exclusive to nintendo nintendo has publishing rights over this title outside of japan and help with the development of it similar to what happened with bayonetta 2 and square even gave the octopath team an exclusive switch development team love this game turn based ftw this game better be a goty contender wish this was on ps4 looks like im gonna have to dust off my switch i use staff to clobber enemies with a white mage back in ff1 all hail my amazon prime account and the 20 percent off i get preordering every game lazily designed game something to make note of some people who data mined some info found a song called final battle you can find it on youtube sounds amazing that many people that have finished a few individual storylines havent encountered yet so there is still hope for a final chapter of sorts but best to keep expectations low and be excited for what we know is in the game for sure thanks to steam summer sales i have no cash left to buy this right away plus next month we got monster hunter for the switch and pc coming out in the same month this is coming out in a awkward time to buy new games but ill be buying it at some time perhaps in a couple of months i cant wait i took tomorrow off lol nintendo killin it once again despite having a late start to this generation ive been waiting weeks for these reviews i didnt want to buy a switch for just odyssey and botw this may be the game that finally gets me to cave not that this is a system seller but what finally makes me purchase the console a must buy this will determine if i buy this game first time im actually using reviews to help reviewing the reviewer 9710 an honest review rather than a bias review i like the enthusiasm of this reviewer traditionally gamers were too lazy to read reviews so they choose to skip to the score now we all want to skip videos or look down in the comments to see a number numbers mean more than videogames now everyone going nuts this is a 60 game in 2018 whatever you say this aint worth it i am all too pleasantly surprised by the end score definitely let the million to two million mark to reach before this year ends 93 amazing this game is amazing i want this so bad but i just have too many other games to get through one question is this game gonna be exclusive to switch temporary or permanent the reviewer is in love with the game since it serves as a nod to the classic rpgs octopath traveler review scores digitally downloaded perfect 5 stars famitsu 3640 gamexplain likesalot ign 93 out of 10 nintendolife 9 out of 10 excellent nintendoworldreport 9 out of 10 eurogamer recommended gamespot 8 out of 10 the games machine 87 out of 10 im so hyped im emotional seriously ive been championing this game since its announcement and the fact that its so close is surreal everyone buy octopath traveler i wish the sprites for the characters were bigger apart from that its awesome the background artist must be pissed all that effort put on it and it got blurred out clasic and so beautiful platform 910 to much 2d better on xbox one x i was really looking for dynamics between them and see how their paths cross not making the characters relate in interesting ways or not having dialoguesbanters really disappointed me though that was an expectation i set up myself due to the premise nothing that the devs promised or anything woahhow did i not know there was a job system now ive found a way to get even more excited about this game why is does this footage have a border around it not scaled up from the capture so happy i preordered octopath traveler as a huge golden sun fan i got all the right vibes from the first demo and even more so with the second demo this game with the story graphics replayability and stunning soundtrack will satisfy me in the jrpg genre for this year and my desire for a long awaited new golden sun title cant wait to play it this weekend ffvi with this art style do it square o philia c yrus t ressa o bleric p rimrose a lfyn t herion h annit great review so excited for this game it looks absolutely beautiful and i just love the art style goty hopefully this spawns a resurgence of more games like this and a new golden era of turn based jrpgs it can run on smartphones im so excited tomorrows the dayhopefully but hows the story 93 day one confirmed on point review by seth macy 93 out of 10 is an amazing score for nintendosquare enixs octopath traveler be sure to buy it tomorrow folks this review didnt really say anything he expanded on the combat but thats it 78 too much enemies 93 beautiful and well deserved exclusive matters who tf is seth macy pc and xbone are irrelevant ps4 is where the games are at here come the sensitive girls first favorite character anyone has any recommendations for what game to get next i dont think ill like this just got a switchand got zelda botw obviously lol idk why but it gave me old school paper mario vibes like in the mix of 2d and 3d graphics the different partners with different abilities its very nostalgic and i love it so this game is my first jrpg and im kinda struggling i really really love the game so far but right now im stuck on ophilias second chapter boss the giant wolf whose name i cant pronounce and i dont know if or how i can beat it im very frustrated ive battled this thing around 5 times and it was a loss each time each of my party members are above the suggested level 23 mine are all 26 and i dont know what to do should i grind for more levels or grind for more money for better gear or what hopefully more experienced people will lend a hans 3 i picked it up for 50 at game stop with the buy 2 get 2 free deal and im loving it i did buy it and i love it i dont really like turn based fight games but i like this pretty much looks gorgeous i would have liked full voice acting people love the concept of multiple interwoven stories but they forgot dragon quest did it a longgg time ago with dq v it remembers me sooo much suikoden thats why im gonna buy it my main char is cyrus love how he is lvl 60 now and the rest is like 4550 and cyrus keeps on being op and blowing up the screen looking for something to play after fire emblem three houses new to these games if anyone sees this would yall recommend this game to me tf with that thumbnail how are the stories intertwined they seemed completely independent to me just started playing it on pc my first impressions the ost is really beautiful and the story prologue despite being quite long is interesting i just got ophilia and cyrus right now it looks more like xeno gears than ff6 this looks incredible but ill wait for the price to drop a bit it feels like breath of fire and i cant wait to buy this this close to fftactics i love jrpgs and i appreciate the overall polish of this game visually it looks very well put together but somehow unfortunately i just dont enjoy playing it reminds me a bit of when i played trails in the sky in that it adopts such a dated and generic fantasy theme which lacks any sort of originality however at least trails had a very unique combat system with the quartzorbments octopath traveler has the most uninteresting story following a generic and unoriginal dated genre of jrpg and to top it off it lacks any kind of depth or originality to the combat system its a real shame because its clear that the developer put a lot of love and care into the games production but they unfortunately skimped too much on originality and creativity to deliver a game worth playing in my opinion doing a playthrough on this game you can watch it on my channel this is more of an after you purchase i love it very fun i have no problem at all grinding its part of the game its not even a little bad to me fighting is the fun of it this game reminds me more of saga frontier but its fucking expensive for a pixel art game it took me about 15hrs into the game before i found out that you can double or triple your boost and near i can tell 50hrs or so into the game there is no major quest that needs to be done no major villain that wants to dominate the world that your whole party is tasked on defeating just personal quests for each characters granted there are bosses in that said personal quests so only play 7 hour and then deliver a hash review i actually like the thumbails but this is kinda lazy 7 out of 10 it does something for everyone no main plot which makes game a bit boring same system for everything in game like location story itp no movies there a lot things what this game dont have but still its not bad if you have doubts play the demo i grew up playing final fantasy ii on snes and this is a nice throw back to older style rpgs so far ive been loving the game save points are not scarce and are usually placed where you would want them the way more games should be turn based anytime i see one i look into it because it doesnt happen enough what if i told you that you can boost past x 2 i know its intuitive but i would have mentioned it ok im off to see if dry aging a 1 steak is a good idea see ya debated between final fantasy 7 on switch to replay and this game glad i chose this game and i logged 300 hours on ff7 fifteen years ago this game is the shiznit i am 2 hours in on night two and loving it i have little kids n lady and work and still managed to log 2 n half hours of saved data first two nights this game is absorbing my all my me time and it is time well spent i am going to have to set time limits to go to sleep xd my question isonce you start meeting all 8 travelers is the game complicated enough to hold maybe story paths depending who meets who first like shadow the hedghog the game but mixed with crystal chronicles were the characters kinda form bonds based on your choices or is it more like pokemon dungeon were recruitment doesnt effect who you choose or start with its always going to be the same path of dialog 1 year later game comes to pc i found it kinda by accident and i want it but 60 ist lit bit too much i think gonna wait till 30 and then hell yeah no second thoughts stealing content wow sad note to self block this channel grinding in games is fun if the battle system is fun it makes sense that if you have to do something fun over and over again it wont be too bad having something to work towards in each battle helps a lot too in tales of the abyss for example you could level up your skills by using then a bunch and unlock special skills if you use each one enough times this means when youre grinding youll usually be trying a ton of different skills and getting used to them all totally dont mind grinding that game you are bias and nicpicky so i win bye bye 910 wish it could be more like suikoden its just one more old school jrpg theres millions of them going back to the ds this is no different boring as shit ugh just say i have not finished the game right away so i know i should look up another video before you pirate it came out to pc recently but im going to wait tell i can get it for 30 dollars or less i love this older style of game but comparing it to ff3 or even ff5 is extreme its a shadow of those games as far as storyline as for grindiness no rpg fan is a stranger to that but the necessary strategic elements of the battle system increase the grind exponentially more importantly if youre any kind of completionist you might want to keep this game on the shelf two words can succinctly describe the experience save scum most games have it to some degree but it really is a built in component of this games design you are going to spend more time running back and forth to save points and reloading than in any other game youve ever played combined the rng is a total lie so much so that youre going to save even if your chances of successful stealing or gleaming are above 90 total nightmare never grinded at all if you rotate your characters ended up overleveled by chapter 4 someone let me kno honest opinion is it worth buying a switch as 1 of 3 games other 2 being smash and fire emblem we need bravely default for the nintendo switch cyruss first hour is a pain you will suffer took them a while but finally the true final fantasy 7 is made its a mix of ff so ct and some others is almost a mix of some of the best of jrpg welp looks like im buying a switch what if someone made a jrpg but where u customize ur own character with dd style stats and gear like turnbased dark souls if only theres an mmo with this kinda of format starting game more similar to secret of mana 3 on choosing protagonist and sub allies so its saga frontier dude sounds absolutly not enthusiastic about this game lmao ophilias sprite is so cute whos back now that it released on steam a weird japanese game is sonic if only this game have pvp too you should not review an rpg after playing for less than 10 hours heres your thumbs down im pretty hyped that this is coming to pc ill be getting it for sure i love old school ff the way it has multiple characters to choose from each with their own story is more like the saga frontier games i dunno if its just me but you sound annoyed that you have to do this review sold at spiritual successor to final fantasy vi i love ff6 this games demo was very very chatty but the gameplay was good felt good to play a proper turnbased rpg again im 10 hours in now and cyrus definitely is my favourite character but yes definitely his first hour is tedious especially with him olberic therion uve not touched yet as i started with the ice witch woman forgot her name and ive got primrose cyrus and thereseive not touched a jrpg everi mean ever never never and i love this game its amazing i like combat system diversity of characters individual stories i dont like story pacing im currently at my 6th character story feels like a neverending introduction with no main story progression at all so far it has been 6 unconnected stories starting over and over grinding even if i like the combat system the actual battles are mostly random encounters i hate loosing my time the good thing is theres a character ability that allows you to reduce the random encounters the bad thing is i think it is needed to get to the right level for part 2 the game will be a thumbs up if the stories end up being connected and build towards a grand story the game will be a thumbs down if in the end the 8 stories thing is just a gimmick and theres no point to it finally its coming to pc june 4 this game was worth a purchase for the score alone the battle system feel to me more like bahamut lagoon for snes shoutout to fans of the saga series great game i played beat and loved it however i hate how i can see how much wasted potential this game had i was looking in the comments to see what people think of this game and jesus thanks people now i know i gotta get this game tressa is best girl also i totally agree with the combat the combat is definately a struggle when it comes to bosses i had to do ophilias first boss about 5 times because of the explody bois the guy summoned however my characters were very low level at the time because i skipped a lot of battles as well lol one explotion was 300 a hit and that was basically a garunteed death for orphilla who had the lowest hp and a 2 hit kill for the others i had basically had to unsync the explody bois by breaking them 1 at a time so when it was ready for them to explode i had time to heal everyone lol but this game is insanely strategic lol i think its important to note however that there is a save point right before the boss starts and a merchant near the save point that sells u healing items so u have ample resources i just starting out and it reminds me of chrono trigger 10 hours into the game and i am not enthralled with the story like i should be i love jrpgs but im story driven i cant be happy about grinding if i could care less about the story battles mechanics are great though just wish the story was there for the rest of the game hi im falcon and just like square enix i dont get why you all want traditional jrpgs seriously why does every time square makes a turn based rpg everyone goes why did that sell so well we dont want hyper innovation we want the next one to be better then the previous it took them 20 years to make a game in the ff line better then 6 so dont be shocked why everyone wants a 16 bit game it is all over steam and for god sake never value graphical quality over game mechanics and story otherwise youll end up crying like an anime fan on prom night i love it ive been playing for a week now such a great game for the switch and my first game as well money is worth buying this game for the nintendo switch says game of throneswalks out of the room i hate that show im not sure if this was covered because i halflistening but the boost system goes up to 3 extra but you have 2 remaining please ps4 this kind of reminds me of saga frontier this guy has an annoying tone of voice he sounds so bland and tired and not interested in what hes talking about and he makes this game sound so much worse than it is first video that i really dont like from this channel dislike it pisses me off how overated this game is for example the characters sometimes feel so shallow only a baby could enjoy it the battles are fun tho ima wait for a sale i really really dont like jrpgs that being said the demo for this game was great and id have the game bought already if i didnt just buy lets go pikachu something felt unique with this game that kept me interested whereas other games like final fantasy i couldnt play for more than 10 minutes without getting bored tried bravely default with the same result makes me want to switch i agree with everything youve said add it this game and find it to be among the best modern rpgs ive played in a while earthlock is another one thats good its so hard to find a good japanese game to commit to i actually really enjoyed cyrus introduction why do i watch this video when i already bought the game i have never enjoyed turn based games this however i am enjoying very much what are your guys parties the demo is amazing being able to play 3 hours worth of the game for each character so basically 24 hours of gameplay for free i hear that the developers of this game will utilize the art style for future games that they might develop persona 5 was more fun and better but ot was fantastic too break and boost reminds me of xenosaga 2 great video i recently lost my thumb in a workplace accident and i found your video while trying to find games that i could play with one hand overall a good video thanks why does he sound drunk lol maybe its just me boost isnt double and works different for different skills you can give up to 3 boost at once and wont get one if you used a boost move that turn i dont like this game one reason to buy squirrel enemies have an attack called these nuts one reason not to buy squirrel enemies have an attack called these nuts i dont think its fair to the game to criticise it because you had to play through the prologue twice granted im really happy that youve enjoyed it and i am also really biased cause this is my goty by far my only gripe is because i have never had any love for oldschool jrpgs i dont like looking at it as an homage at all in my opinion if this game came out 15 years ago i would have loved jrpgs for a much longer time than having skipped out on them as a kid in favour of platformers racing and fighting games my favourite character was tressa and my least favourite was cyrus this is because cyrus utterly ruins one of my favourite things about this game which is figuring out opponents weaknesses just by abusing his passive long story short i love this game and im glad you do too the reason that it was easy is because you finished two chapters and your highest level character is level 7 the combat is scaled if you are only 67 hours in and you are a ways in there are 4 different ways to interpret 1 you actually are that good and are about 3 chapters in on pure skill and you have learned about olberics favorite color 2 you lied and finished therion and haanits chapter 1 and almost finished with cyrus but its too darn hard 3 you watched other reviews and said meh good enough there is actual proof of this 4 a mixture of 2 and 3 lol why are you complaining about grinding its a jrpg what did you expect i find it hard to justify an 80 price tag for what is essentially a snes game bought it at sale and its so good if this game had a bit more balancing advanced class switch main character earlier better lategameaftergame and maybe a better replayability it would probably one of the best jrpgs ever imo im not too far into the game i bought it cuz the art style looks amazing and reviews were good so far im glad i bought it although it should be cheaper but whatever character customization the announcer sounds super hungover prove me wrong wow this trash wins game of the year these before your buys are legit my favorite you save me a lot of money lol this game is not perfect by any means but i still freakin love it this reminds me of fire emblem and did you finish it in the end would this game be a good place to start for someone who has never played a jrpg before yes buy the game its unique an many hrs of gameplay but only if u like rpgs its repetitive like all rpgs most of the stuff you said in a negative way yet talk about how good the game is it seems like this is what everyone says abunch of negative shit but then how great the game is cause everyone else says its good this reminds me of suikoden for some reason i dont know if i should get this game or not im not really an rpg kind of person however the plot itself seems well made i also do not have the time to play this game the most time i can get is maybe 2 hours a day im kind of leaning more to get the new pokemon lets go pikachu because it is generally easier consider my age 1214 and please help me decide makes me think of golden sun on my gba lol theyre showing random footage of the game the point is what hes saying stop whining about where they got the video from you little tools i was dying to get this game and finally got it a few days ago and i already have a whole 24 hours played oof i was excited to play primroses story after playing the demo but ended up choosing therion as my first one honestly i feel like out of all the stories his is the best i skipped everyone elses and like you said cyrus was really boring but he warms up to me since his skill set is like good also another thing that really got me into the game was the fact that you can get jobs like secondary skills for you character like you can have therion have his primary job theif and then add another job which will be considered a secondary job you can have his secondary job be like hunter warrior merchant etc except you have to find shrines around the map in order to get the jobs rip well thats my rant prims story ist so good cyruses aswell the stories intertwine i am 25 hours in and i havent seen any entwined stories just a few chats post cutscene this isnt necessarily a complaint but its misleading to say the stories intertwine throughout its more like they run adjacent to one another so the battle system is just bravely defaults but more complicated lol this reviewer needs to lay off the drugs i have to watch this at 125x just for it to seem normal what about ingame cutscenes reminds me a little bit of golden sun miss that game so much o another switch game therions quest is fantastic hey i cant progress unless i steal this quest item with a 3 success rate stealfail stealfail stealfail stealfail stealfail reputation in town goes down reload save repeat such good game design this guy is rightit takes 50 to 60 hours to finish it basically good game lots of grinding i chose therion toooo this game is amazing im 100 hours in and still have a lot to do i like all the side quest stuff the optional jobs are great as well as the bosses some of them are really hard too the optional dungeons are good too have some good equipment and i love to do every option for each townsperson and buysteal all their stuff and scrutinizeinquire for a hidden treasure as well thats why im 100 hours in and still havent beaten the game i have never played a jrpg before is this a good game to start into the genre what should i be warned about jrpgs it actually surpasses most of the snes rpgs it was inspired by and even defeats treasures of the rudra and chrono trigger because the formers pacing was too short and secound chrono didnt put as much effort in the story as octopath did one problem i have with octopath traveller is that the stories of the main characters barely intervene with one another they just happened parallely with no connection between them for instance didnt the party you take with you show any interest of the story of the character whoms story you are playing to put it crudely they are merely bystanders and do not engage in the conflict or story of said character like for instance olberic when i first played his arc i had a team composed of cyrus main protagonist trust me a good choice his studying skill makes fighting enemies and bosses much easier and tressa if you want to get money really fast good choice as well and none of them talked to olberic or showed any reaction the main pr is this similar to pokemon i like very much that you like it but you could sound a liiitle bit more enthusiastic and excitedit sounds as if you were dismissing the game but in reality youre not at allthanx tho for the nice review god i cant stop playing this game i was wondering cuz i picked cyrus in the demo and it was so boring but i havent played it much yet looks more like saga i can see why you steal content reminds me so much of my days playing saga frontier 2 on ps1 67 hours lel thats not even brushing the surface of this game its more like saga frontier than ffvi totally reminds me of ff3 secret of mana and chrono trigger one of the best leasson here even the graphic is meh but if the gameplay fantastic wonderful and so on 2d game can beat well famous final fantasy 15 let see sell chart of ff 15 and octopath traveler since both made by square enix square enix the king of jrpg genre this or zelda i cant say im a jrpg fan but one of my favorite games ever is chrono trigger and this game is giving me the vibes with every hour octopath traveller is like live a live but this time they released it to the western audience im very skeptical at this game at first but after i watched some reviews on this game plus a recommended by a friend im gonna buy this game ive played the project octopath demo first and prologue demo though so maybe im gonna buy the physical copy of this and the art style of the cover is really good i saw this game and i remembered my fav game of all time chrono trigger this game is a must buy for me 218 how dare you say my boy is tedious im letting you off with a warning this time if you like rpgs where you play through different character stories play live a live on the snes you go through different time periods and the characters intertwine fates at points dont get the game its bad rly bad m not kidding you sound stoned in this video i know everyone keeps saying this recalls old school ff games but for me it really echoes breath of fire 3 both aestheticly as well as mechanically im glad i watched this video because im about to go buy it best combat in a jrpg is still persona 5 i just started and i chose therion first i decided to choose the last character i saw who was therion im watching this before you by after i bought the game but im not sure if its any good and its pretty good i watched after i bought it lol copy of radiant chronology basically suikoden 3 story mechanics so pretty much if you were born in the mid 90s then this is something you probably wont like i grew up playing rpgs like ff7 so this style of gameplay is too old school for me the game just looks too much like a phone game or something is this guy reviewing octopath after only six hours i guess this game is really good i wish i had enough patience for these type of games idk why i like good graphics not gameboy type not my style before you b what sorry i was too bussy giving my money to square thanks gameranx now ive been ensure enough to buy this game too it is by all means perfect why do japanese games disrespect your time so much i just finished ffxv and it might as well be fetch quest the videogame i abolutely loved bravely default and bravely second and im a little bit dissapointed in this game story is to normal it seems that the only things you can do are enjoying the surroundings and battlethats it bravely made so many things a lot betterspeed up battle animations so that you can grind without getting bored and you need to go to a special area to change your characters i think its not a bad gamebut its much worse than it could have been and its way to overhyped like the console itself i meanhow do you get into contact with a friend on your switch yeahyou cant even after this video and hours of grinding looking for a why i dont get why people think its so good i get that grinding isnt for everyone but why the fuck is this the next big thing it makes no sense if you want to call it another decent jrpg that brings back some of that enjoyment from the past you can thing is even if it is that that makes you like the game i dont get how its so damn hyped im fine with it being decent but how is that not the ceiling in this game or possibly even this genre i saw someone compare this to an uncharted game and while i dont really like uncharted i laughed pretty hard and just rubbed my eyes with one hand asking why why why i really dont get it this guy said that the first hour of all the characters especially cyrus was literally hell how is this so fucking good i dont hate the game at all from all the shit i have watched it seems truly and i mean this fine thats as far as it goes near the end of the video he sa thank you ok i want this game now they took alot of golden sun and put it in this i just picked the merchant cause shes cute 3 procceds to have cool characters that i love and anna from fire emblem so is this game a grind how many hours does it take to complete i dont really like jrpgs i openly own this one n tokyo mirage n i love octopath reminds me of pokmon before you buy it should buy it whoever made that thumbnail eeuuhhhh you should test also trails in the sky and trails of cold steel im loveing it has anyone used therion as a dancer he terns into a buff and debuff unit its kinda nice alfyn is my favorite character i like his look on things unsubscribed because you guys are thieves i didnt think i would like this game i didnt even play the demo but bought it from the store impulsively i have never played a 2d sprite game or jrpg in my life i that kind of guy that only likes big titles like dragon age skyrim fallout etc butthis game cought me i cant put it down i love the style the soundtrack the characters gameplay and strangest of all i even love the battle system wow so glad i gave it a shot i am only 2 hours in but loving it already only thing i dont like that much i s the random encountersits too often like every 10 steps also i hope when i get my party i can do combo attacks with them and be able to strategize in battles if thats there it would be perfect to anyone that is on the fence about this game buy it its worth the price im the last kind of gamer that would love this game but i do buy it octopath traveler after you buy title is fixed not a big fan of the art style jrpgs or japan in general but this game has me hooked it reminds me of ff6 and chrono trigger above all else if you are into these kinds of games then buy it its amazing i started with olberic and ended with ophilia i chose these characters given my biases from playing previous games i highly recommend starting and ending with these 2 i recommend this based on their combat abilities and the stories the rest order doesnt matter though haanit hunter is the second most powerful toon imo primrose is the only seriously underpowered character this is coming from playing the first chapter of all characters and leveling my max to 21 the game balance may change as i advance the game is a boring grind fest with basic story with no char interactions only thing good about it is the battles but they get old quick dont make a video before youve played more than 10 hours buddy completing chapter 1 is not enough to review a game on great can we have a new final fantasy tactics next i want to like this game but i just cant get into jrpgs ive never cared for them whatsoever love the art style reminds me of final fantasy tactics gets a little challenging at chapter 3 and the grind is real sometimes as far as im concerned all you need to know before you buy this game is if you have enough money or not ewww turnbased i love this game primrose has the best story from what ive seen so far damn only for switch i need to weigh my options now smh this has to be the best thumbnail yet octomom trampeller old school squaresoft you hit the nail on the head right there video games were banned from my family when i was younger which meant no final fantasy games however now im an adult and i freaking love this game a major fault that i have with this game is that its structured for you to do each characters chapter all at once and i think dividing the players attention across 48 stories is a bad idea as you become less invested in each as you spend more time learning the characters in a different one i think if you were able to complete them one by one while still being able to size up your party would be nice the other more minor thing is the side quests as they arent really explained you talk to an npc with a side quest available and they say something vague and thats all you get more often leaving the player confused as to what to do or where to go especially if you just want to complete some side quests just for the lootexp that you will need for the inevitable grinding that can be a overly excessive if you just want to complete a story without interruption overall gameplay is really nice and the stories seem really cool but trying to get invested in the stories makes why do u have to fk every game up like that thats ur opinion u use for content if people like the games they will buy it theres refunds i dont think it relies on nostalgia at all as you say the only issues it has are issues other jrpgs have so as a jrpg it is outstanding oddly enough although other people complain about grinding i havent had to deal with any at all granted im just about to finish the last story chapter for the last character completing all eight stories and i know from allusions in the game and some spoilers i failed to avoid that there is a post game dingeon perhaps there in lies the grinding but throughout the story i would just take a weaker character along with my three tougher characters and theyd manage to power thru particularly your starting character see the starting character is the only one you cant remove from your party until after their path is concluded but if you do everyones story in a somewhat sensible order the game suggests levels for your characters story chapters then your main protagonist who has been along for every quest will be an absolute beefcake most of my party is about level 55 currently and therion is at a whopping 70 and thats just organic exploration with almost no grinding i bought a switch and i dont regret it im tying to figure out if im going to really like this i mean i play a lot of different games but im not sure is this game worth it for someone whos never played jrpgs before this game seems interesting but i never got a chance to try the demo it reminds me a lot of my dnd sessions you got certain classes you can multi class it gets more fun as the gamesession progresses only thing different is that it replaces the comedic vibe of dnd at least my sessions with a more story based game you have some good points but 67 hours of a 50hour game its hard to provide people with proper reviewbefore you buy new pokemon games should use this art style im sorry but this was better than ffvi better music team members can jump into each other roles art design is unique i went with tressa as my protagonist and made her a scholar for her secondary job and she gets really strong has anyone whos played child of light played this my mom is looking for a game like that and i think this may be it it does look good but id rather buy it when its not 60 played the demo im addicted already going to buy the game finally something that i can invest in to play besides skyrim ugh i cant wait to get this game i have it on preorder im gonna go pick it up from gamestop today im so glad i wasnt the only person that had a very game of thrones story telling vibe for this game game of the year square enix needs to port bravely default to switch you can also use boost to 3x or 4x your attack if you havent noticed yet all these reviews are about to make me impulse buy this game i want it so damn bad but i havent played a turn based game like this before looks so dang fun though love the way this video is going at it but what i do not agree with is that the story is generic lately most games are about saving the world and trying hard to be about something bigger but this one has neat various little stories that are bite sized and are so perfect as a portable otherwise the ups and downs seem accurately represented in the video i dont think its fair for you to penalize the game for being repetitive if youve already played each characters demo all at 8 characters brings a different view point and unique story the length is also great as it keeps you engaged in each characters story and longing for to see what comes next i would have though octopath would have been along the line of the saga series mixed with final fantasy shouldve waited for this episode idk where else to post this but the stories do come together in a way you just have to be a bit observant and not illiterate to catch it dont know why ppl are saying they dont tf did you expect idk why this game caught my eye but i want it i like jrpg but havnet sat down with one in a long time now that i have a switch its time to invest again i wonder why no one compares this game to saga frontier for the ps1 peter coffin ive been following the game since day one played the original demo about four times about 10 hours total then i put even more time in the prologue demo and now im 20 hours into the full release i love it to pieces but so far the story is a little lackluster to me though it doesnt ruin the experience i mean hell i loved fire emblem fates and the freaking avatar was my favorite character 150 hours in that game and still playing if that doesnt tell you that i will play a game with a fun battle system even if the story and characters are less than extravagant then i dont know what will so while its not for everyone i absolutely adore octopath traveler you give credit to the redditor yet or nah im gonna buy this wen my sad card comes therion in my fav i love the game and spent maybe 20 or so hours in a few days not the hugest fan of the combat system but its fun in this game when u face the bosses definitely a grind dont forget to level up all the characters ophilias story is tedious and poorly done id have to choose haanit as my favorite along with cyrus coming in a close second this game is fantastic zelda and octopath are the major reason to own a switch as a former big fan of gameranx i feel somewhat obliged to help spread this information about their extremely unethical tendency of plagiarizing videos made by smaller channels below i have liked two reddit posts by people who have had this happen to their videos please read over their posts and decide for yourselves what to do with the information the most recent one httpswwwredditcomrnintendoswitchcomments913umzgameranxmadeanarticleoutofmyvideowith the one that made me unsubscribe httpswwwredditcomrps4comments7oo1sogameranxbasicallystolemyvideo to the folks at gameranx i really enjoy the content that you make and the community you try to foster but can not endorse unethical journalistic practices like this i understand it is difficult to maintain high quality content on a daily upload schedule but you can at least sight your sources and give the people who put in the work the exposure they deserve i hope this doesnt fall on deaf ears quit stealing content from small creators 3 is there chinese version for this game in canada is it really that hard to give credit to smaller content creators its a shame because i really did enjoy this channels reviews severely let down this teams lack of professionalism and genuine passion for gaming yay confirmation that this is my kind of game which i already guessed but confirmation is good is there a difficulty setting i was watching some dude on twitch that was saying deaths were permanent would this be a good jrpg to get into for someone that isnt really familiar with jrpgs at all gameranx what do you say about the allegations that this is a stolen article and that you plagiarized this from a smaller creators video httpswwwredditcomrps4comments91838bgameranxhasplagiarizedyetanothersmallutmsourceredditandroid this is some serious douchebag moves fellas grating is a good word i started off with haanit because of her skillset and i liked the location and i heard the dialogue was ridiculous and good for a laugh i laughed for about the first 3 minutes then i was like why the hell is all this false olde english necessary there are so many lines that would actually be very elloquent and prosaic if they didnt add a st or en to every damn verb in fact when the translators got lazy about the psuedooldenglish the dialogue was really fantastically written why couldnt they just hold back some i found myself getting more enjoyment out of proofreading and editing the dialogue in my head that actually reading it which took away from the story i almost started over as the thief but chose to stick with it and learn to ignore it and now i actually enjoy it not because its good but because its so grating its funny again i chuckle every time i hear haanit say let the huntingeth beginineth at nice video to bad you are content thieves you guys need to stop stealing peoples videos without crediting them how many times have you been caught doing this your e x c e l l e n c y the game story is basic in my opinionbut its a good game if you want to just chill and spend your time if you have nothing else to do boo stealing small content creators work gameranx sorry guys i like your vids but with yet another problem with you guys taking content or not citing sources im gonna have to pass and unsubscribe from your content you have a responsibility and its would be really easy for you to spot when your taking someone elses content be better article in question

unverified statements about the games mechanics are great too people stop bitching about stolen content nobody cares in a week no one will remember or care like the last time stealing content goes to show how much of a piece of shit you guys are ive been a long time sub of this channel but the content theft from the smaller guys has gone too far now im out i appreciate your review but i wish you had gotten further into the game before making this 67 hours only gets you through a few of the prologues had you gotten further i think you wouldve realized that the characters dont actually weave together in a way that affects some larger meta story its a great game but i think some of your descriptions are misleading gameranxs favorite character is thief haha i picked cyrus as my first dude and i thought it was awesome damn dawg stop stealing content what i dont like is the characters never really talk to each other stop stealing content stop stealing content stop stealing content i want to buy a nintendo for this game maybe on boxing day this video contains clearly stolen content httpswwwredditcomrnintendoswitchcomments913umzgameranxmadeanarticleoutofmyvideowith how many times do we

httpswwwredditcomcomments913umz report these guys stealing content from small makers and even giving wrong statements channel blocked btw i wouldnt be surprised this gets deleted at some point httpswwwredditcomrnintendoswitchcomments913umzgameranxmadeanarticleoutofmyvideowith wish the game had a bestiary and you could switch out your protagonist from the active party without having to complete their story but other than that its a really solid title worth having i know they were going for nostalgia but the graphics during combat straight blew if square enix popped more games of this quality and type out theyd have more of my money unpopular opinion but final fantasy 1215 just hasnt done it for me really enjoyed bravely default its sequel sucked but i guess i just miss indulging in the deep stories that hold my interest over 50 hours and the absurdabusable broken combos i dont even mind hitting road blocks the addition of extra classes and hidden bosses made me giddy i came for the nostalgia i stayed for all the new stuff it brought to the table is this really worth 60 i preordered so i got it day one im 9 hours in with 5 characters unlocked olberic primrose alfyn therion and hannit and im truly loving it the characters are really relatable and the game makes you care about them quickly and not just the playable ones either the combat is fun and addictive it can get grindy at some point but at least it helps to level up really fast overall i think the game is excellent and i cant wait to find what it has in store for me cyrus in the first hour has info on why we have 8 travelers man this video has too many peters cyrus is legit my favorite opening i love his background and how he decides to leave very cool story i suggest you dont skip any of his dialogue this games art is some of the most beautiful ive ever seen i think they pulled off the 25d exceptionally well i really hope it goes multiplatform at some point so im not tempted to buy a switch just for this game so pretty much if you have ever enjoyed an rpg this includes pokemon fans waiting for pokemon you should try this game best rpg released in a while including xenblade chronicles 2 i own both no favouritism i think its great its one of the first games where i didnt care too much about what the reviews were preordered it got the game have been playing ever since plus it looks freaking great too bad its only on the switch the only way any of the stories intertwine is only relative to the secret dungeon otherwise they all be seperate not sure yet if i want to but this pokken tournament xd or mario and rabbids which one should i buy nothing ive seen of this game is compelling to me but im glad it seems to be doing well it seems unique if nothing else your voice so whiny and you sound bored i got 5 mins in and had to stop it there the only thing i wish is that they interacted with each other more throughout the game why is it that jrpgs dont show you how many hp an enemy has left and when did this become the norm he does know that you can use more than one boost at a time right hope golden sun make a come back well this is odd you guys are saying that the stories do intertwine and yet ive heard others say that the stories do not intertwine at all which is it i agree bought ir cause it reminded me of old school rpgfinal fantasy and its by square enix so i knew it was gonna be a good story that will require a lot of time i have about 6 hrs in rn and your the nail right in the head the switch trailer that explained each characters storyline made me want to get this but it is so expensive soeh this game plagued with something that old rpg used to have exp only given to party members youre currently controlling meaning if you wanna progress with specific character story and you dont use that character often coughtressacough you gotta grind in some area for lil bit im debating between octopath traveler and xenoblade chronicles 2 any suggestions i have no clue which one i want isnt it more like seiken densetsu 3 where the story is different depending on the starting character with rpgs theres a good chance the start will be grating and then the rest of the game will be swell say persona 5 for instance people always mentioned that the first 810 hours felt like a drag but the following 80100 hours were excellent and very fun i made the bosses really hard by having a 4 level decrease so rn im at lvl 40 story bits and i went into it with 36 and those bosses were tough took multiple tries and trying to optimize every round that made me enjoy the game so much it reminds me of the golden sun games ultimately all stories become game of thrones can someone buy this game for me 3 i do have a switch i was unsure if i was enjoying the game or if i was simply continuing because of the money i spent but once i discovered the secondary job system i fell in love as everything gets more complex strategies get crazy and the costume change is awesome 70 hours in this is one of the best games i have played in a longg time loving it also if youre going to compare it to ff6 its the second half of the game after kefka destroys the world this game has way more in common with squares saga series you also dont need to get all the characters you can get just 4 and the subjobs of the other 4 call that team a and beat your starting characters story arch otherwise then start the other 4 as team b really you can do it anyway you want but youll definitely need at least 4 characters with subjobs to beat all their chapters how im playing it got all characters and subjobs and am doing my favorite 4 first while equipped with subjobs of the team b once i finish my starting characters chapter 4 ill figure out how i want to progress then game of the year the hd rumble with this game is amazing like when opening a creaking door and shutting it its like did i just hear that so it felt like it in my head nope it actually feels 11 like opening a creaky door and shutting it thats 1 example of many i thought hd rumble was just a buzz word but more and more things are being done with it that impress me before you buy its fucking amazing now go play i actually have to say that im not a huge jrpg fan but for some reason i love this game so far i think how they did the demo was genius let you play and decide to delete it if you didnt like it or bring your save file with you if you do is a great way to sell a game imo this is the only dude i like from gameranx i just played the demo because my zelda hasnt arrived yet i must say i love love love this game went into it with less than any expectation and it got me played the three hour demo felt like 20min this game is just pure pleasure imo i never thought i was into that kind of games fug iii want this game yea therion forever ff6 has a baby with seiken densetsu 3 and it just freaking worked i went in thinking i was gonna be playing some bravely default doover but if bravely default is momo then octopath is all might hopefully that helps this game is close to the same level as xenoblade thanks ed helms love the vid love the game zelda mario death road to canada old sonic doom and wolfenstein blizzard should just put diablo 2 lod with some graphical enhancements and gameplay features like levels as well as new classes thats what i like but after falling asleep during the video i think you know i dont like jrpg at all glad i watched enough to see what it was before i passed out yea im playing it now i absolutely love the battle system amd how every character has an ability in the toens but the character intro drag on cool points to anyone that can tell me how to play through the stories should i finish each character one by one or do all the stories together chapter by chapter im lost haha did you know that the first letter of each characters name stands for octopath ophelia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion haanit the artwork i seen for this in the nintendo eshop was enough for me to buy this ive played the demo not knowing what to expect but after trying out i was like wow its like a final fantasy game from snes days im like man i gotta get this game has so much of an old school rpg feel i absolutely love the game awesome story great ost all around fantastic nonlinear story progression job system is fft inspired and the synergy once you get the secondary and advanced jobs is flawless 9510 for my personal score my only gripe is how you need to do a little grinding just to have your more nonactive characters ie your team b catch up on levels because they dont share the exp along with your active party and yes i totally agree with the traditional squaresoft feeling not se i wouldnt compare it to ff6 its more like that overlooked gem on the ps1 saga frontier also a squenix game making a review of an rpg with 7 hours played pathetic the demo was fun i think i may go pick it up i love this game im personally going with primrose and hannit as my two favorite characters also quick tip if youre struggling to grind dont use the fast travel feature it makes things a whole lot easier to get up to level for i think square enix had older gamers in mind for this just bought the game me and my gf are gonna be competing for my switch now ah well 502 spirits haven mercy good lord i wish it wasnt an exclusive i cant justify spending nearly 400 to play one game review my a i went with haanit the hunter she my fave so far i am honestly shocked as to how much i love this game no thanks ill buy this when it comes out on ps4 eventually the exposition bits remind me of how the first three wild arms started the rest might have but i only did the three so is there really any value to replaying as a different character if you play through all their stories anyways also ophilia best girl i dont like that you cant solo run each characters story so far i really like the game and a few of the story lines but for me so far tresa is my favorite character plus she gets me extra money too lol im someone who likes rpgs but doesnt like turnbased battle systems never did i did play the old school final fantasies and i did enjoy them but what i enjoyed about them was the story and the soundtrack not the combat because of its classic look i gave the octopath demo a try and i enjoyed it far more than i thought i was going to i never thought i would hear myself say that im enjoying a turnbased rpg but i actually am something about the way octopath does it is so damn enjoyable it doesnt feel tedious like the old school final fantasies sometimes felt it actually feels fun and rewarding the game is so fun and so beautiful and the music is great as well i admit i have a habit of not finishing my rpgs but this is one im going to make an effort to finish im 10 hours in so far and im loving every minute when im at work all i can think about is going home and playing octopath traveler heres a few tips for beginners because this review doesnt inform you of some of the more obvious pitfalls and just how deep this game can get be picky when choosing your main character you cannot change your main character until chapter 4 of their particular story which is actually insanely late in the game pick someone you think youll like storywise since its pretty easy to compensate for any shortcomings later on get all of the characters to start off with the game scales with the number of characters in your roster and the sooner you fill it up the sooner you can run into larger groups of enemies that make it easier to level this is also the best way to choose who you want to have in your main party and who youll take with you up to chapter 4 get the secondary classes early each character has a region and when you walk into that regions chapter 2 zone you will conveniently see a new mark on the map these are shrines that grant access t playing the game atm fave charakter is cyrus less for his story than for his gameplay mechanics im loving it collected haanit ophilia and tressa so far next im going for therion its so much fun and i love the music great game worth its price this looks old game a before you buy after only 7 hours playtime doesnt even know you can boost up to 3 times lol its more like a saga game with a bravely default smt sorta battle system its not very close to final fantasy your prolougedemo data is supposed to carry over so maybe if you deleted the demo or havent transfered it then it can be annoying to redo the character begginings didnt they have the same battle system in bravely default just got a switch for this game so its pretty much saga frontier for the switch they should do a rereleaseremake of saga frontier or xenogears you say ff6 which i can certainly see but wouldnt it b closer to compare it to the saga games or more specifically the romancing saga subset everything in this game looks soooooooo bland even the title font and the enemies dont even have animations man so many great games coming out i need to stop being broke real fast lol i bought it a few moments ago after the demo picked cyrus finished his beginning area and set off on my adventure got to one save point without any random fights then tried to back track every fight was one vs four died every time because flee never worked after about ten tries finally got out and set off on the right path to get ophilia boost can also stack up to 4 times which he doesnt mention but you can to incentivize players to hold off using boost so early or donate some with tressa or a merchant to do massive damage when shields are down this guy sounds like louis ck not gonna buy cuz owning a switch sucks the english voice acting is just awful the game is fantastic though olberic therion and haanit these are the ones that i found to be the most interesting you are wrong solely because theres no rose of the prim variety on there might have to buy a switch this game reminds me of saga frontier great review i agree 100 just got to say way to commit to the thumbnail lol soo is no one gonna say how the power ups look like kaioken super sayian and super sayian blue lol because they do i started with primrose and her first quest was quite interesting to me and kinda dark the writing for cyrus in the first quest is kinda slow and campy but i think its a throwback to snesera jprgs i would kill for a ffvi remake in this art style wow i didnt even know about this game i have a switch and i love jrpgs im playing xenoblade right now so this is next when i get the money lol i was already going to buy the switch at the mario party release but now i am going to buy it next week lol i loved this shit it looks amazing thumbnail hello why are the graphics so terrible i looked at the octopath travelers edition and they charge you 90100 extra for junk probably worth less than 10 how dumb are people even though there are 8 characters there are actually only 4 path actions oberics challenge and haanits provoke are both a way the get villagers out of the way of secret houses therions steal and teressas purchase are both a way to aquire items from npcs cyruss scrutinize and alfins inquire are ways to find hidden items or information about the towns and finally ophilias guide and primroses allure are ways to summon npcs to join your party temporary thats the only thing i didnt like about this game falcon creek review but are you drunk you just seem to be slurring a little bit feel better bud i felt this was more saga frontier this game is similar to saga frontier oh the good old ps1 days excellent game enjoying it a ton fair and honest assessment of the game too these nuts nintendo should focus entirely on games and stop making bad consoles i want to play this and zelda on ps4 liked the game but what happened to golden sun that game is better this game made me hack my switch so i can get it for free psince its the only game i actually want to turn my switch on for i dont care if it takes me 5060 hours sorry to burst your bubble but there are at least 100 hours of content my main team cyrus scholarcleric tressa merchantapothecary olberic warriorhunter and primrose dancerthief this team works pretty well the others 4 will probably have secret jobs as their secondary job thanks for the honest review i found the introductions to be fun but once out of chapter 1 on all the toons i found it to become meh almost asking myself why i continue to play i think of this game like chrono cross when you have different characters either they interact or dont which i love about it its awesome game and hard the same time but least its great i got the game already up to chapter 2 and got a warrior job system for any my party members to use beside haanit who is a default warrior class only 67 hours played get out ive never played a jrpg but i decided to buy this one for some reason it looks pretty and im genuinely loving it the pixel art of this game really really reminds me of star ocean 2 back on ps1 im pretty far it about 67 hours in a 50 hour game the characters interact but not in any substantial way when did grindy games become an issue psh what are you talking about cyrus story stsrt was fun this game is incredible you said your playtime is 67 hours thats not even close to the meat of the game why is the thumbnail like that it could have been anyones head on there nothing will feel as grindy as bravely series granted those games are beautifully done game looks dope ill have to scoop it up looks gorgeous yet im going to wait for the hd remake of tales of vesperia one of the best jrpgs out there imo i remember that after 20 hours it felt like i had just finished the tutorial without even noticing that ive been playing one xd sulks i want it so badly i have been waiting for se to make a game like this and it just had to be on a damn switch damn you se damn you nintendo prepare to take my money im so surprised he didnt mention the artstyle of the game its absolutely gorgeous and probably the reason why i might buy it i think the greatest gem of this game is the writing from the story elements to the inspectinquireand for people who doubt that go see the guard just outside the ravus manor he needs to chilli think the team really nailed it i have a switch and i have to be honest i dont see the hype and its not like im not an rpg fan final fantasy 7810 the kingdom hearts series etc are some of my favorite games and i actually just beat ff7 again this year and enjoyed it i think its just the graphics i dont wanna contradict myself here because i literally just said i played ff7 and enjoyed it but the thing is that final fantasy 7 came out in 1997 so it has an excuse to look that way this looks like a freakin gameboy game you telling me they couldnt at least make this look like dragon quest or even botw idk thats just my thoughts not knocking anyone for liking it though ok thats my mind made up gona get this game one of the best switch games out yea thats not sayin much but luckily im a jrpg fan 60 for this shit oh hell no i thought it was 25 this game is not worth a full priced triple a game nintendo is tweaking this is a spiritual successor to saga frontier imo sorry gameranx but there is no before you buy with this game you just buy i get strong secret of mana vibes from the game to be honest i only could play the demo because my local store has sold all its copies like a lot other stores as well but i definitely will buy it and i will like it why does this guy sounds drunk every time he reviews stuff i never played a turn based jrpg game once i downloaded the demo and iam kinda interested do you guys think i should get it i love zelda botw witcher 3 and other rpgs but i never played final fantasy before why would a scholar and a cleric help a guy rob a mansion minutes after meeting him there are some problems but i still like it that terrible old english in haannits story was the most painful where is before you buy onrush i wanna see a review of that game plz d never heard of it dont have a switch stopped caring the thing that stopped me from instabuying it was the lack of 60fps why does it not have this this is my first major jrpg and im so hooked on this game the combat is a lot of fun and im having a blast playing it the play characters story separately then meet together wild arms from psx did it 20 years ago this game is already so circlekerkd on the switch subreddit when this game was anouced i instantly bought a switch played the demo and hell this game is sooo brilliant the music is just wow the characters are cool the stories are great sometimes you know whats gonna happen before it happens but nevertheless i love this game this is more of a first impression than a reviewi expected more from you gameranx i want chrono trigger in this engine i have to wait until august 31 to get the game so no spoilers it reminds me a lot of romancing saga not a fan of turn based jrpgs anymore but this game recaptured it for me i love it and its perfect for the switch the before you buy for any jrpg 1 is it functional if yes go to point 2 if no dont buy 2 do you like jrpgs if yes than buy if no dont buy this is one of the like 5 games im buying a switch for falcon you should play seiken densetsu 3 this game sounds more like that how come weve never seen falcon i know he has a human face is sonic not a weird japanese gamefranchise itself the only opening i didnt really enjoy too much was ophillia random battles in 2018 no buy already preorder it for 4799 this is america at first i thought that thumbnail was a clicker never found myself needing to grind especially not in the first 10 hours either youre skimping out of random encounters or your stragities against bosses are not good enough only 8 hours that seems like way too little of time for a review i could not agree more with you in every single way its a great game and i bought switch because of this game i dont really care about story more about battles so i grinded a looot i just miss a lead to what to do the chapter 2 quest of characters are lvl 20 so i just got all characters until i reached that level am loving this game 3 i started out with haanit and though i was initially thrown off by the olde english speaking i find that it lends a nice uniqueness to the characterim really loving how different each character is theyre not just people who look different and have different names but actually different people with actual personalities i want to strangle cyrus sometimes and i honestly love that he has such a vibrant personality to make me want to strangle him loving the different stories so far too i think its great so far only a few hours in but once you figure out the boost system and proper times to use it the game is a blast didnt expect this to be good at all its now one of my favourite games its do good also i love alfyn my main therion and haanat so much great review but you didnt mention that you can skip cutscenes so that people who may not want to sit through cutscenes know they dont have to ive watched a ton of your guys reviews and this one kinda got to me at least beat the game before you review a game especially when its so story driven i went and checked out a couple other reviews and sadly i was disappointed with how you presented this game this was one of the longest videos i watched and noticed lots of things in other reviews that you didnt mention love you guys but i think you either jumped the gun or missed the mark on this vid sorry first thing i do when i enter a new town is run around and steal everything from everyone its great 1010 its so nice to finally play a jrpg again not since pokemon lgfr and i think this might be my favorite game of the year so far i just played the demo holy shit i wish my debit card hadnt just expired i think primrose has a really good exposition been really enjoying it so far but i hate the lighting engine and depth of field with a passion wish there was a way to turn that off i want to be able to see the pretty pixel art i think that this game is mainly defined by your opinion sure you can say this for any game however this game is either great or meh depending on your opinion i think everybody is able to enjoy at least parts of the game and the game in general is great the battle system is fun and enticing but i hadhave some problems with being incredibly over leveled and just beasting through the game without to much effort this isnt necesarily a problem since i can just try to avoid encounters more for a while but it is a bit of a turnoff that the recommended leveldifficulty doesnt change based on your progression save the first chapter for the 2nd through 4th characters you get 67 hours ive already put 30 hours in this game nice game but the reviewer should really lay off the booze so the stories do intertwine ive heard other people say they are completely separate and characters rarely interact with each other outside of just having them in your party reminds me of radiata stories for the ps2 also by square enix bravely default with pixel art its actually the same and i love it i played the demo when it first came out and replayed it like three times and told myself im buying this on launch day this game reminds me of golden sun on the gba one of my fav games eva gonna be getting this for sure so my take and im just starting each characters chapter two quests is the game is a lot like saga frontier in its storytelling where you have the 8 different stories and there is minor interaction with characters not directly involved in whats going on but it so far is just primrose is the star of the primrose story because there are no other major character same goes for every other tale so far not a bad thing but i am feeling like the game doesnt really make me feel like the characters are connected and thats probably because at least so far every character you didnt choose to start on seems optional as far as battle it feels very similar to the bravely default system while you cant go negative on your banked actions like you could in that game i view the posts a lot like spending default in that system to get more benefit the system in the other game as a bit broken as 4 characters all going to 4 on every battle was often enough to win any random enc oh my gosh i started with cyrus i thought i was just bad at the game to be fair i kind of am who else picked primrose 1st prim ftw why is he talking so slowly my main is primrose love this game so much so addictive especially hannit story love catching monster like pokemon im really enjoying the game if youre like me and you were a child of the 90s and enjoyed all the jrpgs of that period then youll find a lot to like here if youre new to jrpgs this is a good one to try but just do some research and get an idea of what youre getting into squareenix put out a demo so i would recommend trying it first just to get a feel for the game before buying i love that demos are making a comeback side note nostalgia moment i became a fan of crpgs because of a pc gamer magazine demo disk just a few minutes of baldurs gate was all i needed to know i loved it the same was true with octopath traveler i started with primrose myself i like dancing in real life and bardsupport type characters so she fit my bill also i love that her color is red this game is kinda trash its pretty boring three days in and i have like 30 hours send help pls lol im enjoying cyrus dont have a favorite yet though they are all fun in their own way therion is my favorite too i hate to say but this isnt a very good review really the game shares more in common with skyrimopen world rpgs than regular jrpgs after you finish the 1st chapter of the character you chose at the beginning you can go anywhere you want mind you might get your butt whooped but you have that freedom i noticed that theres a tier system when it comes to areas surrounding that large lake is the intro tier and when you pass that is when you get into the real meat of the game mobs get much harder quests open up and subclasses get introduced i recruited all the characters first so the game was very linear but i didnt have to and the game really opens up after you finishskip the intro phase i have heard a lot of confusing reviews on this people complaining about the early game and saying there is no real main story so i appreciate this video helping clear all of that up i prefer reviews from people that have beaten the game or at least come close if it turns out the game has a really underwhelming second half id want to know about it the trade merchant can buy things off of people but at cheaper prices while thereon just swipes it off of them and he gets way better loot those elemental soul stones are really really good last year we had persona 5 this year we have octopath traveler next year we get kingdom hearts 3 too latei bought what no love for primrose in best stories hers is the most interesting to me so far though i havent finished yet so i cant completely give her my vote how about beating a game before making a before you buy wish i saw this before buying lol battlechasers does everything better better battle system better characters better dungeons better jrpg all together lets just say im not happy with my purchase i purchased this game as i watched this video i never done that before lol im about 20 hours in i love this game is the narrator dr lupo im actually so glad you brought up the pain of the dialogue i want to know everyones stories but man it can be painfully slow and how about ophilia saying your excellency in literally every sentence i had to turn it down because it was kind of embarrassing with my girlfriend giving me weird looks after the 100th time she says your excellency besides the long sometimes repetitive dialogue i love the game you said it right the first hour for each character is so slow but once you build your team and get out there its so much fun kinda long but before you hate me hear me out i played through multiple intro stories on the demo to try and get a decent feel for the game i dont really like it maybe ive just played too many rpgs at this point but the whole game just feels too easy bosses in particular are simple spend the first couple turns to get the shield broken max boost whatever your strongest attack that they are weak against defend if it says anything like the boss is charging some ultimate attack blah blah repeat until victory dont get me wrong the game has some serious upsides it is beautiful i wish other similar rpgs looked half as good the enemies look awesome the spells abilities look awesome just awesome all around on that front the music is wonderful and seems to fit perfectly with what is going on at any given moment no issues with anything music or sound related the writing story is bland at best but i can forgive that to an extent this is based off playi is it true that if you complete everyones path you unlock a final path this guys voice is perfect for making a caricature when he says do and it sounds like deeeeeeeewwwwww is it me or the character head and hair sprites looks very similar to ragnarok online my darling my fav games are sonic and jrpgs so keep on rocking this game is a little to hardcore for me im not smart enough pokemon confuses me for gods sake lol as a college student in brazil thats important to mention because a 60 dollars game in brazil is equal to about 240 reais brazilian currency i cant afford this game but i want it so badly hmm all these reviews make me not wanna play since the story just dont intertwine why are you reviewing if you havent finished the game i like the game overall i started playing as haanit the only repeatability in the game is changing your protagonist since you have to always have your protagonist in your party it forces you to level up your other party members since there is tons of things to buy i may try playing as tressa the merchant just so i can buy everything in the game im about 25 hrs into it right now and i just started chapter 2 i like the transition in music from chaper 1 to chapter 2 definitely do a few midlevel dungeons before doing chapter 2 i picked haanit for my main but my priest forgot her name is turning out to be a beast one of my favorite thing very few games do is allowing exploring i like to travel to as many towns as possible i run through zones much higher level then my characters and try buying gear im disappointed that you didnt mention bravely default because batlle wise its almost identical really appreciate the honesty mate well done octopath is a really interesting unique and also beautiful game like seriously the art style is amazing the combat system is complex in its simplicity with only a few mechanics with some varying between each character its interesting to see what combinations you can make some of the stories seem pretty cliche but have that kind of anime flavour to it which i love great game would recommend falcon always knows me pass but dont hate it ignsucks ooo i went with therion too cos i like thief characters and he randomly had the best story imo im liking the hunter one as well so far i wonder if this game is better than bravely default series good review got a couple of things to add this game is as unlineair as it can get the amount of freedom you get is out of this world compared to other jrpgs where you just have to follow a lineair path where players can get stuck if you screw up your party or something the world is jam packed with side quests puzzles little stories of npcs which can do different things when you interact with them a side quest revealed that an npc was adopted after confronting her about it she set out to find her parents later in the game you can find her again in god knows where i find learning the game a bit tedious nobody explained to me that there are secondary jobs what all the stats mean and how much they influence you in addition gear is godlike getting one good elemental damage boosting weapon and you basically double all your magic damage teambuilding is amazing though each character has individual traits that are so immensely useful the thief can open locked chests i think im gonna buy it i like those 2d ff games i picked haanit and she is basically op to the point of broken if you want a challenge pick someone else i have never played a rpg except pokmon would any recommend this to me so bravely default is 1 but octopath is a close 2 then bravely second is 3 wait you didnt finish it 903 holy fuck this guy talked so slow that if you put the speed to x125 he sounds actually normal like legit like normal talk speed xd i normally dont play jrpgs but i was hooked by this and i cant stop playing im already 17 hours in 20 if you count the 3 hours from the demo and it seems to just keep getting better the battle system is a lot of fun to figure out and it reminds me of the strategy of child of lights timed combat the story is well told i only wish there wasnt such a grind between chapters but i understand that is usually a big part of these jrpgs its funny that i enjoy playing this game more on handheld mode than on the tv this game is overpriced shir i tried the demo to me if jrpgs had less text to read i would enjoy it more i found myself spamming the a and b button to get around and get into battles i hope this comes to pc either way i will download the emulator and play the fn game on my computer this is the most tasteless blend of 2d and 3d i have ever seen i mean just look at the character sprites tearing in the battle screen is it as good as botw im glad theres hope that the game gets less painfully dry after the intro because damn if the game was going to drag the horrible dialogue on and bloody on through the entire thing it wouldnt be worth the purchase imo i always see people comparing this to final fantasy but this is much more like the saga frontier games to me anyways it seems like its pretty good and look forward to playing it definitely enjoying this game worth the price even though i paid at most 100 for the wayfer edition i hope nintendo nice enough with this game and make it multi plaform iv had an odd relationship with jrpgs the only ones iv played are final fantasy x and x2 both of them are good games but i get stuck at a certain point both times because of a boss then one day i decided to try again on a new save file but keep the old one to try again later and saved the new one on top of the old one but im going to give the genre another shot with this game i think im one of the only gamers ever that hates rpgs and doesnt care about the story in a video game ive tried to enjoy these kinds of games but i just cant play it anymore after a few hours anyone else think hannit is hot as hell i liked the demo so far but i fear it will get to grindy along the way i like the stories and design but i dont have enough time to play so the grind is tedious if you play your reviews at 5 speed you sound like a drunken mess its the best really enjoying my time even the times when i got way over my head in location vs level too bad i already bought it some weird japanese game the fact that you made falcon review a jrpg is one of the many reasons i unsubbed this review is exactly how i feel about this game i really really loved the bravely series and i feel like this is the next step in classic jrpg evolution this part of square enix is doin great stuff for me the demo did a great job with giving the player a large variety of content had the demo not been so good im not sure if i would consider purchasing the game ophelia 3 this is the ideal visual style you may not like it but this is what peak unreal engine looks like the bravely defaultoctopath team at square enix is killing it im playing the prologue now i forgot it came out so i installed it friday i really like it and i am planing on buying it but for now ill enjoy the 2 hours i have left ps i picked olberic and let me just say his story and gameplay is one of the best in the game im playing it juggling between this game and ys viii almost done with ys viii then i can focus on this game but octopath is amazing and refreshing as for fave character primrose i feel her hatred and cunning and its beautifully dark will you make a video about my hero ones justice if you like golden sun for nintendo game boy advance then you will love this and i loved golden sun great game when will we see your face very fair review i love this game but i have a jrpg bias too so grandia and child of light are not turn based combat its pretty much the same as an atb but the turn progression can be cancelled postponed the ui might be similar but not the underlying game system the game is honestly fantastic im only around 20 hours in and im still having fun with it as well as once you unlock a certain mechanic the combat gets more strategic on what characters you want to have in your party and what you want to give them and what roles they should play in your team and it is just great the story is a bit average but you still feel for the characters when they would expect you to i have been able to predict some of the plot points pretty easily but that might just be a small subset but overall i will say the combat is fun and engaging the story is a bit average but with good characters to back it up and the design even for me who is not nostalgic to this style because i started with the gamecube is beautiful in the pixel art and the backgrounds and animations are astounding i would say a solid 910 overall do not sleep on this game its so good it feels really great that not only do i get my nostalgia drip but im getting it in a new and exciting package ill buy this game because its great and also because i want to encourage square to hold on to their roots as much as possible and keep releasing new classics its really good but its not great the structure is too wonky the writing to uninspired for it to be great but i highly recommend it to anyone who like 90s jrpgs just be ready for lots of pretty fun grind and not a whole lot of actual adventuring you know they should make this for a old retro game like sonic 1 or mario just for the fun of it ok wait i dont mean to break the forbidden rule not to ask but has anyone actually seen falcon and who the hell is he and where is he at all i always thought you and jake were the same person i loved cyruss chapter 1 man i dont think you put enough hours into it to really give a fair before you buy assessment im about 6 hours in myself but i have read that the game really does open up and change as you put more hours in there is a job system that i havent even touched yet at the 6 hour mark edit didnt even talk about the job system in this video come back and make another video after youve invested some time in this and im sure your opinion will change great commentary and thoughtful analysis ok going through all the characters in the prologue demo was your choice you cant complain about having to do them again when it was your fault that you had already done them just an fyi this video completely incorrect in saying that the stories intertwine the stories are completely separate from one another and while you can have multiple characters group up there isnt really any reason for the characters to do it and the stories do not have any connection between one another there is no overarching narrative love it 30 hours in now wondering if there is a little falcon running around kicking power buttons i have 2 and thanks for the heads up on do nothing thats new to me additionally i thought about the vinyl approach to gaming and even bought a nes classic glad i never opened it and just let her play the switch btw oldest is 6 and cries when she dies too much in mario odyssey is great at arms mario kart and dance games no puns on other related games that is octopusyou have failed us just another reason to start looking seriously at getting a switch i actually want to play it as a successor to bravely default and bravely second not final fantasy vi iii you can boost your characters attack up to 4x by hitting r multiple times as long as you have the charges noticed in the video you were only really ever doing the single boost im happy they finished octopath traveler so they can work on bravely third body horror thumbnail can you guys give out news or do a redo of top 10 rtsstrategy games for pc or console please i already bought it though lmao one thing that got me hooked the soundtracks ug i done did my time back in the days of nesps2 grinding my life away bout done with that im getting to old and impatient to grind for 4060 hours in a game that is actually 8 if you turbo grind on an emulator so i wonder how long it will be til it winds up on steam olberic is definitely my favourite character but ive enjoyed almost all of the openings so far tressa and cyrus has ones that kind of dragged on and havent done haniits yet other than that the characters all meld together very well honestly it reminds me more of the saga frontier series and bravely default than ffvi but i havent even really played the demo much maybe an hour i plan on picking up the game tho loved the demos love the ost pushed back by the price not for my standarts at this moment but i only have one question do the baddies names form traveler like the main cast does with octopath gonna pass on this one cause real thugs dont grind therion is best boy why cant there be a through and true jrpg that allows you to kill everybody and i mean everybody fable style is that too mmuch to ask dude youve played for 7 hours and your trying to review the game xd you for real clicking on a before you buy video and hearing falcons voice should be listed as the dictionary definition of disappointment wow i feel like the only person who doesnt think this is a very good game for beginners the bosses after chapter 1 are really long and can be pretty hard ive played almost 20 hours this game reminds me of minecraft with a shader mod d sooo its a knockoff saga frontier the fucking thumbnail i agree it is really refreshing and fun grindy yes but fun ive always never understood why they want to change something thats not broken turn based is still king in my eyes not worth 60jpg reminds mine of the good old days of golden sun but without the djinn hopefully this will have the best elements from saga frontier i can dream right eh ill just play through breath of the wild for the 4th time lol honestly if you enjoyed the bravely games youll find something to enjoy here but especially the art im having a ton of fun but i do wish theyd included that feature where you could pick encounter rates for random battles like the bravely games could do you can skip cutscenes by holding b like i did for cyrus because id played him haanit in the prologue i do wish hed mentioned the bravely games because the same team made this game thats how it was pitched on the switchs news thing when it first popped up great review as someone who is about 25 hours in the game there is still a lot that is open to me and half the entire map for me to explore also much more rpg depth when working on characters chapter 2 and beyond loving this game so much and i cant wait to play more im sorry but i find the game to be very meh the combat is extremely repetetive and doesnt really evolve through the course of the game begginging to end its just find weakness break defenses boost repeat the story is extremely cliche though oddly i found cyrus to be the most enjoyable i do think the game looks prettybutoverallill take ffvi or mother 3 over this any day now before you crucify me this is my opinion not fact 20 hours in im hooked to this game and never want to take a break spent my first 13 hour playing it non stop i have not done that in over 10 years lol 6 hours played only aint enough to say buy it or dont buy it because the whole games opens up with the new jobs and later chapters fun fact wind is the weakest element in the game because it is wind also you can ptu everybody in a dancer outfit for battle if you want to well 1 at a time yes even males how long is this game is this a 20 hour game or closer to the ff 80 hours i got bored pretty quick the battle system seemed great at first but it soon gets pretty dull especially with the severe amount of grind going on absolutely not a fan of the constant amount of enemy level scaling going on either i get theres no other way to execute the game route but it just feels so forced and stagnant in rpgs when the freedom of difficulty is fixed there a post game boss after you beat all the other bosses you can actually go super saiyan in this game i love this game the hannt boss killed me 5x with a party of 3 its is one of the hardest beginning game bosses spoiler that thumbnail the title looks to have very similar font to dark souls before you buy ye like im paying for anything thanks for mentioning the first hour of the scholars story there was so much cringe that i was honestly hoping square would do a rewrite hopefully the rest of his story will improve this is probably irrelevant but i really hate the aesthetic choice low pixel counts pixel arts combined with highly detailed environment and shader quality no just no the game is like dont know if it want to be a full classic pixel game or modern high detailed game thats the least unrealenginelooking unreal engine game ive ever seen o you do realize the demo was 3 hours long and let you pick the main character you wanted the could go meet others after their prologue and do theirs then you could transfer that data to the full game so you didnt have to do it all over again that is one messed up thumbnail this is hands down the best rpg released thus far this year imo wait holdup like ff vi that sounds amazing weird me and the character therion have very similar names mine is tharian why is everyone mad about this being an exclusive like half the ps4 games are exclusives no one cares and here everyone freaks out the intro sound is too loud no one was gonna play it anyway thanks what about the music just picked it up due to this video also had to buy a switch lol skip this video buy the game ez you mentioned it had an ace attorney feel to it would you believe im watching this after waking up from a nightmare where i was being chased by police for stealing a new ace attorney game is it weirder ive never played those games ever or even had interest in them yet here we are you cant put a review when youve played for 8 hours ive played 10 hours and havent even completed everyones prologue yet pro tip if falcon is narrating change the speed to at least 125x just so he sounds like a normal human good info though an hour can be a long time i highly disageee with you i hated therion backstory and his motive to go out was absolutely moronic to me but cyrus was entertaining af and glad he was is my main character wow only 6 to 7 hours why are we here this is the kind of game that makes me go out and buy a switch which i did with octopath i did the same thing for zelda ocarina of time and ff 7 the game is so good i dont want to wait for a port to a system i currently own i want it now shut up and take the money store i just love how many great channels are taking their time to highlight this game its awesome to see how can you make before you buy video if you are not finish the game i played the demo and i love it i really dig the more accessible jrpgs but its 90aud in the eshop so i guess im waiting for a sale wish it was on ps 4 or pc octopath is great wish they could remake ff7 like this i enjoy it but i feel its writing isnt epic enough also i noticed every single boss fight is exactly the same kotaku has some negative opinions about this one maybe you will too if you spent more time on it only for switchthat sucks be amazing if they ported final fantasy 7 8 and 9 to switch tbh this is something im wondering but what would anyone say to a multiplayer battle system that works as follows online player characters vs online player controlled enemy has enemies stats what would you think about that i actually bought a switch just for this game well im gonna play other games on the switch as well but this game was made for me this is the game i was waiting for even though i didnt even know i was till i saw the game for the first time i love it if you dont use fast travel as much you really dont have to grind plus there are some random enemies who are harder to defeat and give like 8 lvls worth of xp i went from lvl 8 to 15 it just continued bravely defaults styleright low key want a switch to play this like sure theres other game but this is the exclusive i really wanna play the amount of times you repeat yourself is painful to watch not trying to be rude just makes this review a bore and it feels like you are just trying to prolong the video past 10min mark falcon is definitely better at this than jake reminds me of saga frontier while this gaming doesnt have the best looking graphics possible it would be fair to point out that this makes the loading times refreshingly fast this reminds me so much of seiken densetsu 3 3rd game in mana series loved how you could choose your main character and it completely changes the start of the game dragon age did that too definitely does add something i cant bother listening to reviews after only 67 hours of gameplay thumbs down surprised you didnt bring up saga frontier since this was really similar in the interweaving stories im pretty new to rpgs overall and im not sure if i should buy this game usually rpgs dont attract me because of the boundaries i wasnt really hyped for this game in the first place however i did enjoy the demo is this worth the 60 for me the game reminds me of suikoden hey falcon would you pick octo or xc2 i know theyre different styles of jrpgs but story and gameplay wise why would you pick one over the other just got 20 hours in the game 6 characters on lvl 20 with chapters 1 complete just unlocked 4 secondary jobs this game is awesome to play if done right even the grid is not bad reminds me of chrono trigger that you naturally level up to put a challenge but sometimes its inevitable i would only play this in handheld mode just cause it feels right i wish it was on pc a review after 67 hours might pick it p after my exams drink a shot every time falcon says the word intertwine i know its not a reviewbut 7 hours of play isnt enough to make an accurate impression this before you buy does no better than playing the 3hr demo looks good once i done bravely default 1 and 2 i will get this started as therion as well i like stealing stuff asap its a saga game with a title change ive played loads of pokmon games but never any type of japanese jrpg would this be a good one to hop into just with my pokmon prior knowledge you lost me at i havent finished the game already bought lol im loving this game so far i started with haanit and ghisharma was quite difficult i didnt have any other characters at this point and he was very difficult i enjoyed this but took it as this was going to be quite a hard game seeing as that was my first boss and it took me like 40 turns and 15 potions i do like jrpgs but ive never liked turn based combat you said the story wasnt that deep story and character development is the main reason i like jrpgs so it disheartens me a little if the story is not that good i am setsuna had good artwork and music battle was decent but the story was lacking which disappointed me havent finished yet though also you mention that the battles are easy is there a difficulty setting people hate ff13 because it was so linear but i loved it battle system though i would prefer to pick each characters move but i got used to it and how you really needed to use embarks and debuffs for even the weakest creatures the character development and voice acting was top notch too how is the censorshiplocalizationregionalization did they change a lot when porting over to the western market i may have missed this but what about the ost would you listen to it on its own does it really set the mood this is also another important factor i listen to final fantasy music regularly and eac i do appreciate falcon doing before you buys too if you are a jrpg fan you absolutely have to get this gem we need the pc version falcon is jake and i refuse to believe other wise looks like a great game and cant wait to get my hands on it thanks for another awesome before you buy 14 hours in im normally not a big fan of turn based rpgs but i adore this game i must say that this game is amazing the story has me hooked i chose primrose as my character primrose story starts in sunshade city of a thousand pleasures this is where we meet primrose the prostitute the story opens up in a brothel where primrose one of five prostitutes is sleeping next there is a dream sequence we see 3 men in black savagely killing a man in cold blood in front of his daughter primrose primrose wakes up shaken by this dream and declares she will have her revenge the other five prostitutes are jelous of primrose because she is the masters favorite on account that she brings the most coin in by dancing in the local tavern by day and working the street at night the prostitutes tell roseprim that there is no hope of running away from their pimp helgenish who the girls call master the last girl who tried to leave was beaten half to death and thrown into the gutter just then pimp helgenish enters the brothel and commands the girls to go to the if 1992 and 2018 got married and had a baby this would be the game they made steam version when it feels like bravely default and i like it a lot reminds me of the golden sun games i have no interest in that game but two thumbs up like always im just here to point out you can never put ped in front of ophilias name how are we okay with this guy doing a review after 67 hours of play get out of here with that thats so bad its not even funny ive been waiting for this game since it got announced over a year ago and it was completely worth the wait great game is there too much grinding in this game everything i play is a jrpg of course im gonna get it octorock traveler sounds good but ill wait for balancing patches someone promote thumbnail guy i have a switch and all but this game should be on ps4 as well so i could buy it for 30 in a couple of months since its a nintendo game it will be 60 until the end of the consoles life the game looks cool but tbh not 60 cool cant understand why squeenix made this one a nintendo exclusive id love to experience this but i hate turn based rpgs they just feel ungrounded and out dated like we dont need to do that anymore so why are we i cant play this cause i dont have a switch superb review i wish theyd port this stuff to pc why gamemakers dont focus on story now a days like they used to during ps1 era games like suikoden this could have been a perfect game but story is the weakest point of the game is the character integration similar to suikoden 3 i love falcon i however wont be playing this game i found my attention drifting off even with the review of this game i do really like the graphical direction of it though pixel art mixed with more polished graphics thats pretty cool anyway nobody probably cares but thought i would just add that thanks well already picked up my preordered so bought already unfortunately for me i dont really have time to sit down even for a couple of hours at the moment to dedicate to getting a couple chapters done until midweek i think this is the game thats going to make me buy a switch would you say this is like saga frontier with the multi story board wow he said straight up hard no if youre not into jrpg so its just a game that stays in its niche ill wait for a sale too expensive right now probably be a year before any significant price change i doubt this will have replay value hell having new game plus which it doesnt would most likely kill the old school challenge sounds like an old game from the snes days live a life graphics like romancing saga theres gotten to be quite a few games on switch that id really like to play but i still havent bought one yet this may be the game that gets to finally get one wish it was on pcoh well why did you have to go again from the prologue if you could transfer your file from the demo i am already 6 hours in too late this game was horribly boring if you played the demo and felt conflicted i suggest buying a used psvita why so you could buy classics such as chrono trigger my brother has tons of classics on his vita and i have been playing them over this game im sorry but this game is simply aesthetics with not much substance steam is another option man this game takes me back to breath of fire 3 times the thumbnail ive never seen such a beautiful face ill buy this game on a sale cuz i already have a backlog of games and other stuff to do first i will emulate this one day hopefully it much of a turn base combat guy but i love a good story game i wonder if i should try it out sorry but a review after 67 hours if the game is 50 hours long that doesnt really tell me more than the 3 hour demo complaining about grinding in a jrpg is akin to complaining about dribbling in basketball dont waste your time if you dont like the grind i wanna play this so bad because i love the japanese style and paper mario is one of my favorite games of all times which is also turn based combat its not the same obviously but this games combat obviously looks better this game has convinced me i need a switch mario rabbids almost got me there but now its a certainty your videos are awesome keep it up the thumbnail tho where the br mode just look at how damn beautiful it is uhh what do you mean by their stories do intertwine bcs they kinda dont me tries the demo once using olberic thanks to the switch news thingy hear the voice acting experiencing the gameplay and the graphics though damn this game is good then after 30mins of play decided to go the seveneleven to bought switch prepaid card then without any hesitation bought the game and after playing it for 3 hours i start to kinda like and disliking it a bit maybe because somewhat i got sleepy when playing im enjoying it a lot and have put 13 hours in so far i started with therion and have met with 5 others but now im mainly just wandering around osterra and leveling up my party wheres the im jake baldino part where is jake bald eagle too late i already bought it at first i thought the thumbnail was some abomination from the last of us i was just looking for your video on this game earlier today but solid graphics and story line is fun so far sub chapter 2 progress i usually base my purchases off of what your review of them is tho but this one it was kinda a impulse buy but worth it 9hrs in looks like you did more bitching then any review out there on youtube land this game is at least a 9 most places i really like the game it looks great however i really wish it would come out on different systems especially pc switch only means i have to go spend another 200400 system for 1 game where is crash bandicoot not worth 60 i hope i dont have to buy a switchagain to play this shity game its a jrpg of course its grindy i want to play this but not bad enough to buy a switch so unless something else comes along to push me to buy a switch or it gets ported over to pc or ps4 im out of luck not gunna lie this is a game i would love to have on my ps vita right now i only have the demo and i love it one thing i like is that if you already know a persons back story or just dont care you can skip it and go right to the character associated dungeon ps tressa is my favorite so far could have been hannit except i cannot stand the way she talks ive put about 6ish hours into it so far and im liking it the character introductions so far are ok and im really looking forward to getting into the meat of the game i want this but i cant justify to myself to pay 50 for a retro style game too bad this isnt on ps4 at least this seems like a game sony would snatch up oh well why do i always get a netflix thumbnail anyone notice the typo at 729 for lord geoffrey best thumbnail of before you buy who tf is this i pre order this game and so far this game its pretty good people dont think this is gonna be an easy play i die so many times you actually need to put the time to learn and see what this game can offer so yeah this game deserve to have a least 910 its not perfect but its the only classic one up to date with theses type of graphics so this game its a must buy if you play xenoblade 2 or disgaea 5 and of course if you own a nintendo switch that thumbnail isdisturbing i understand that a lot of people compare old rpgs to final fantasy but this game is more like squareenixs saga series which i herd no one say youre voice is awesome eagle i also like therion he was my first pick as well but if you didnt know you can hold down b to skip through all the dialogue and story if you already seen it or for reason dont want to look at it all one of the main reasons why i liked this game was becuase it reminded me a lot of pokemon how some creatures are weak to some things the pixel art movement and pokemon games storys always hooked to me and so far but for 2 that i wont say overall i thinks its a good game hey does anybody know the name of a game that is like an open field in war and you can choose a hero to fight with different abilities and everything is like old oriental or something i remember it having a long name i used to play it on ps2 but i cant remember the name like others i have not completed the game and i do enjoy it the thing that gets to me is how fast the game eats the battery so mobile play is spoilt to some degree that thumbnail looks crazy why am i watching before you buy after i buy it am i the only one who thought this was some sequel to octodad unmask yourself to the world falcon octobussy that looks and sounds like seiken dentestu 3 aka secret of mana 2 though obviously different combat why did i have to hear maybe and kinda multiple times make up your mind i understand you can be neutral toward something but when ppl are looking for an opinion especially when its is this game worth buying neutrality does not help your argument i love the channel but dislike this review enough to not finish hearing your argumentreview ive gone in completely blind bought a switch a few weeks back and didnt even know this game existed until last week didnt play the demo either game is pretty good just got the final character and about to start the 2nd chapter for my protagonist but yeah very repetitive go to one town and complete that characters mission then travel 10mins up the path to the next towncharacter have had little to no character interaction within the party therion is unbearable so hes permanently banished from my team i have oberic alfyn and primrose and ill probably keep cyrus but the only downside is that his interaction ability is basically the same as alfyns besides that the actual combat is pretty fun so grinding doesnt seem like much of a chore falcon is the man the writing and voice acting was way to cringe for me i liked the scholar intro is not the best but is good i just reviewed octopath traveler too and im finding it very interesting to see other peoples opinions on it i completely agree the prologue of some characters can get quite dialogue heavy but i did enjoy the story as a whole definitely one of my new favorite battle systems out there love your channel guys keep up the amazing work this was a really welldone more indepth look that i was expecting compared to the normal before you buys nice job falcon gimmie more weeb shit falcon i think the one thing you forgot to mention is you can skip each characters backstory if you want kind of important given you made a point to note it was one of the less fun aspects for you the game is awesome i recommend it i played it yesterday like almost 8 hours so you had the game for a while but have not finished it ughits kinda all kinds of bothering me that enemy humans get these detailed sprites yet your team has the same sprites as in the overworld i feel like either your team should get the detailed sprites too or all human units only have their overworld sprites its the inconsistently also related but different why do human enemies specifically bosses i think grow to massive size in battles are they not drawn to scale this game looks promising too bad its not available for pc that thumbnail is just stupid lol this game reminds me of golden sun anyone else it looks great but thats a 40 dollar game audacity is a disorder falcon says the stories intertwine yet ive only heard the opposite from everyone else whos reviewed the game why is it on switch only it makes me think about tales of phantasia on the game boy from the old days i cant afford the game right now so im just going to play saga frontier ps1 game on my ps3 already bought it oh here before 10k views o lol nobody owns a switch tho they shouldve done this on xbox pr ps4 marketplace i dont like that when you change class you get a new art for your character but only in combat why not change it in the world as well the thumbnail confuses me why not just put in a pixelized head is it only for nintendo the art style is amazing i started with the thief but im not sure whats a good balance for a party im thinking the hunter or scholar now that code vein has been delayed i regret not pre ordering cock to shaft traveler on amazon lol that thumbnail i like jrpg but not so much turn based combat literally the video ive been waiting for not sure why but i really cant get into this type of game presentation i grew up with the original nintendo and super nintendo so its familiar to me but not enjoyable not sure why i dont even need to k ow the film al verdict if this video its an rpg on the switch and it looks amazing very very meh honestly only in nintendo switch already bought it and like 10 hours in it lol wish it wasnt an exclusive but ah well ill get me a switch one of these days ive seen this thumbnail numerous time when its about zombies or other horror games but this is the first time i got kind of scared by it by a pixel jrpg game good job gameranx can we get a reveal of the legendary falcon you can use multiple boost charges at once as well to deal massive damage romance options i need my ships think i might pick this up today seems quite similar to the suikodon games got it delivered before it even came out i love the game so much imagine having that for a head you sound board while reviewing this a friend of mine wanted to buy it or rather the 100 collector edition i told him the same thing i will say here this is a homage for the 16 bit era jrpgs if u didnt grow up playing such a style then please try the demo first and decide dont follow trends and buy it just because this is the next big thing on the switch if ur a young player who grew up on modern games try shining resonance or soemthing like that ps screw amazon the delivery date is june 19 to 24what the crap why did i preorder this for then is this game on pc whis is shit one of the few games that ive preordered because i instantly knew i would love it its not perfect static npcs not a fan of the blurry edges even with the dark corners settings changed and i wish all of the main dialogue was voiceacted but definitely not disappointed yet octopath traveler review after 40 hr of playtime when this shouldve been final fantasy 15 not actual 15 not a fan of the storycharacter structure guess i will wait a while and maybe pick it up if i am in desperate need of a game thankfully i didnt invest much time in the demo i played enough to know if the combat was terrible or not and at that point i stopped as i knew i would play the full game so thankfully i only had to rpelay a single chapter but i understand how it could be annoying if you had already done it that look gud id buy 20 if i could but 1 is fine for now i also got free stuff from gamestop for being 2nd to buy the first guy ran off like an idiot easily my goty if you build up battle points you can also tap the right bumper up to 4 times to have an ultra attack just fyi things that could have been better personal opinion when an attack is boosted its animation should change according to the number of boost you use for example a fire attack without boost should be a simple fireball and the lvl 4 should be an enormous explosion on the ennemies the armor and weapons should change our characters appearance i was kind of disappointed when it didnt also i dont know if theyll have a common goal later on but it just feels like they all just group up together because reasons if you get me it would have been better of having a story where they have the same goal everyone is searching for something someone and they just group together even tough their objectives arent the same at all i was super excited for this game but ive already played 10 hours and i dont really know how i feel about it now on one end i adore the game design and above all the soundtrack and yet for a game that is pretending to be a game this review put me to sleep im very conflicted on whether i should buy this or xenoblade chronicles 2 it looks great but idk for 60 any opinions from people playing earthfall please i got the demo and thoroughly enjoyed it few things annoy me like tressa and haanits entire characters but yeah cant wait to pick it up didnt even bother with earthfall lol did no one else experience the switch sticker shock with this game its an old school low res jrpg so i expected20 maybe 30 naha full aaa 60 price tag wtf nintendo why is everything for switch a million dollars when i can usually get it on pc for 2 bucks can anyone convince me this is worth a aaa price doing review when u just played game for 7h i am 15h in and still feels like i just started very rushed review becouse you dont know what happens later so cant really review it best turn based jrpg persona begs to differ 60 hell no there are better rpg for 99 on my cellphone you should be calling the turn order an initiative meter its easier to explain than how you said is this a good game for me to jump into jrpgs never played one before hey can you do a review for slay the spire its an amazing card game too late already bought tried the demo really enjoyed it might buy it later this week we need a final fantasy tactics 2 or remaster i loved that game so much just played my 1st characters intro and i played tressa i love it i love the cute little story i love the combat and i love that we are getting a modern classic jrpg 15 hours in the game and i love it so much no doubt its the best jrp this year 1st comment i have posted on this exact video one question would my gf like this im kinda disappointed in the story set up for me the individual charcters stories should be been side quest congrats to those who like this game though its just not my thing for lack of grand story definetly my goty on switch this year im completely addicted to it its a love letter to old school jrpg fans wait so can you complete 1 characters story without doing another characters story hearing falcons lovely voice in a before you buy my day is complete use this engine for ffvi remake falcon jake all day everyday i was about to pick this game up until i saw the price 60 for a game that looks like it is from rpg maker no thanks can you do something like best games on mobile for a specific year or genre gonna play it as soon as my copy comes in the mail xd primroses story is so good tho id like to know when grindin became a problem oh gamers these days before you buy i think you mean buy just buy i love that the thumbnail is just a guy on a horse coming out of a headless suit thanks for actually calling them boost points everyone else keeps saying bonus points and it makes me very upset for no good reason thanks for the video i enjoy the alchemy stuff in the game combining ingredients to heal and buff in this game this sounds awesome but i am biased as you can tell by my pic time to get a nintendo switch i approve of that thumbnail im like 4 and a half hours in and loving it who reviews a game they havent finished opinion discarded shit thumbnail my favorite is alfyn so far i have only gotten half of the characters so far i like how alfyn is at his core a good guy but can be a bit of a smart falcons narration is mind blowingly boring and boarder line ranting in nature i mean i get the fact that a lot of people enjoy games like this but i just dont see the point rpg jrpg have never been my deal but thats not really my problem we have these powerful pcs and consuls and there are soooo many games that look like there on sega or nintendo idk just my opinion cant wait to play this one day on my pc so its it worth spending 60 or just waiting until get it get a sale i love the game also played the demo looks like the thumbnail guy just said screw it 47th comment like this comm an found 10000 tommorow damn it thesnk was first i probably wont be buying his game this game is great i havent completed it yet but im loving it i wasnt able to experience the snes era gamecube was my first console and i didnt need nostalgia to have a good experience the turn based combat charactersand story is worth it in my bookand primose is the best waifu and has a dark story evolution of assassins creed please what a nice looking gamehope we see future games with similar artstyle who calls themself falcon doesnt matter buying it regardless of the outcome i love the state of that thumbnail is this game of the year octopus scavenger immm the last to say im first im a simple man i see unicorns and i click not first already put 12 hours into it i feel shame got the wayfarers edition yesterday so far my personal game of the year heres hoping we get bravely default and second on switch andor a sequel my mom calls me special it makes me happy my friends call me special it makes me sad first its lonely in here first view oh hey its falcon second first never been so early easily a goty contender is octopath your favorite switch game let me know win octopath traveler httpsgoogljes3kq win thimbleweed park httpsgoogls2vemy want to meet me this weekend retropalooza houston httpretropaloozahoustoncom what about next month on the 10th game on expo httpsgameonexpoazcom use the code wood to get 10 off game on expo full event tickets my first jrpg and i love it truly overvalued game with 8 cropped stories i wonder how many blogers flatter this game oh my gosh theres a sale right now definitely getting this game dont mind me just here to justify my purchase legend says hes still playing octopath why are you yelling talk like a human being and not an overhyped internet character you have good thoughts on games please deliver them like a real person would in a real conversation you can play the demo version over 100 h wow manyouve really enthused me towards getting a copy of this game your energy enveloping this title is infectiousreally it is i dont have a nswitch just yet but i am looking thru the games lists out there and checking out the reviews for what appeals to meand now because of your relentless enthusiam i am enthusedlol i totally agree with your take on the graphical style its a whole new genre of art that has been pioneered hereand yes its already been knocked out of the parkanddont get me started on the music youre right music is huge in game and in film you can judge a film as lacking just because the atmospherical score is not right its the same with games not epic when it needs to be not sombre enough when it needs to bethis stuff can really have a huge impact on the visual story telling aspect get the music right and most of the time you have doubled the creditibility of that media so right you are the music rocks like a led zep this is the random question but how on earth do you beat gareth from therion quest favorite things about this game not mentioned the difficulty is legitimately super challenging but in the way where it hard without feeling unbeatable you see how you can beat it and even if you loose 100 friken times to a boss you know its beatable but its still high quality difficulty which i apreciate its not unfair its just good at being challenging 2ndary jobs and equipskills there is a seccndary job for every one of the 12 gods in the lore 8 of wich are the starting classes for each character and 4 are advanced jobs you have to beat level 50 sidedungeons and bosses to earn and are insanely powerfull ontop of this each character has 4 equipslots for equipable skills and each class comes with 4 of these equipable skills whats amazing is you dont need to have that class at all to still use that skill when you unlock one of them for your character and change to a different seccondary class you can still use them so now you have 48 equipable skills possible for this game is frickin lit am i the only one that has the actual paid octopath traveller but still wants to try the free eshop one going to get it next week on black friday for 40 maybe i should have played it sooner the only thing i hate about this game is that there is some much good dialogue and i have only 4 hours in but it is a very good game almost the best i think this game is an overrated piece of crap thank you for your attention i really want to play this game just wish i had enough for a switch just bought a switch last week and im feeling a renewed itch for jrpgs havent played a jrpg since final fantasy viii no particular reason just got into western rpgs and competitive shooters and was sidetracked for a couple decades i want to get back into the japanese stuff and this game looks to be perfect this game holds a special place in my heart because this was the game that me and my boyfriend relaxed and played together he had played the game i hadnt and we just cuddled last winter and went through it together for the week he was here visiting it was special and will forever be nostalgic to me i unsubscribed to other youtubers who are reviewing switch games coz i think uare the best reviewer out there and ur content is all i need before buying a game stay awesome sir who are you kiddin if you havent skip any of the dialogues how is it that you cant properly pronounce sir olberic its like they invented a whole new style and perfected it at thte same time yes yes soooo well put well made this game is incredible i havent had these kind of sleepless nights from a jrpg since ff6 its my favourite rpg ever one of my favorite switch games well worth the money all the characters are great cept the apothecary have no problem skipping this guys boring storyline its an awesome game but the plot is really awful hahah looks like mexican melodrama tv series ok time to talk about the bad things 1 too grindy 2 in battle visuals were terrible compared to order similar games like golden sun and valkyrie profile 3 plot and character development are fuckin terrible wtf are you drunk the games writing is horrible the characters dont interact at all between one another the party banter is laughableludicrous please the game forces boring griding the battle becomes repetitive after you understand the breakboost etc etc the stories are so cliche lmao men as warriors women as weak i played it while remembering ff vi and ix and it didnt reach my expectations wtf im shocked everyone in he comments is saying positive things google youll all see everyone else outside this video agrees the writing is horrible no offence but im shocked at both the game itself and the positive video and comments you havent played many rpgs if you find this writing good the guy on the video saying the writing is perfect wtf edit the story arcs are all dialogue dungeonbossdialogue i dont normally even play turn based rpgs but this review got me interested so i dow loaded the demo and now im going to buy it liked and subbed to answer the question yyyyeeeeessssss bought this game off the street cred of square and the first 5 min of this review i just ordered octopath traveler from target it should get here on thursday cant wait to play it i just got the nintendo switch yesterday and the only games i have for it are zelda breath of the wild pokemon lets go pikachu and now octopath traveler i am going to prepay for pokmon sword and sheild next month cant wait for those to come out in november not to mention the travel banter is awesome 100 agree thanks squarenix for this game just bought my switch a day ago after seeing this review definitely buying the game after i finish zelda its also on pc will never waste money on it on switch id rather buy exclusives its a white panther but totally agree great rpg i have put over 180 hours into my save file and let me tell you every second was worth it bought it last year when it released and finished it this year right before three houses dropped wasnt sure if i even wanted the game but there is a 3 hour demo u can play and get through 3 1st chapters from 3 different characters anyone playing this game recently sorry not feeling it ratings should be relative battlechasers has a better story even does this still stand true more than a year later i really want this game and i feel like i would enjoy every second or every minute of every hour loving the fact that i have it but idk if i should still look for and buy the collectors edition haanit and therion are my favorites too octopath traveler ismeh you are nitpicking and biased bye bye i win please merry me i m female this is my father accountso lets get togheter this game is great and all but all of the side quests are super vague and they dont help you at all honestly i think that at the end either alfyn or cyrus has the darkest story and its also just amazing at the special side quest when all of the stories intertwine and fit together and it all just blows your mind and its amazing i love this review and equally love octopath travelor even though i have only recently bought octopath traveler i love it so far the first chapter of primroses story my favorite story had so much emotion and it also gave me a very strong will to kill its boss not because of the difficulty the boss was pretty easy but because of how i felt about that specific character i even finished her chapter 2 i only stopped for today because my switch battery was low i didnt want to play on the tv since i was worried it would overheat my switch go buy this game its smashbros ok ok ok sold subscribed belled etc thumbs up beating the game and putting 140 hours into it it reminds me so much of rpgs back on the original playstation this game was such a breath of fresh air amid free to play games and yearly call of duty releases i too have the collectors edition wow this dude loves this game so desperately that i might find it in my heart to give it a try took me forever to get into it i just wanna say that if it werent for me watching this review i wouldve never gotten this amazing game and fallen in love with it thank you for sorta unintentionally introducing me to one of my favorite games of all time im near to finishing this game whats a good rpg on the switch thats as good as this no i played it for a few hours and i didnt like the game i know what you said mate but im sooo glad its not exclusive anymore i cant afford a switch right now and now that its on steam i can experince this amazing game for myself just got this on my pc as i recently sold my switch looking forward to it and the inner child in me is excited to play it good review its like a combination between romancing saga and final fantasy 900 thats literally bravely default idk why this game got so popular its basically bravely defaultsecond but pixelated does anyone else get that feeling where you want to play it while youre already playing it never a fan do jrpg but this is good the graphic and sounds is so amazing stop yelling youtubers need to dial it down a notch therion is my favourite wheres the nearest tavern yes cant wait for octopath generations with sir phillip ellen the apothecary sister lysa therese the pupil i downloaded the 3hour demo to try this game next day i just had to go to my local game shop to buy it because i used all the three hours of the demo in one go and i was totally hooked lucky for me that the savefile from the demo can be loaded in the full game so i didnt have to start again from the beginning how is possible to play a 6080 hours rpg and skip always the dialogs sure you love this game is the first time you enjoyed the story the end of primrose her story was soo bittersweet while the story as it progresses is really sad therion story was all about honor and thieves code i loved both of these i didnt make it far in the other stories but i will soon planning to get a switch in a couple of weeks already got botw lol then ive been hearing about this and this gave is exactly why i decided to get a switch instead of forcing things into to 3d with polygons and real time action to cater to a bigger base octopath uses sprites which i love and improves upon a well established formula that works square enix sure does know how to make a good rpg pc release on june 7th cant wait this sounds a lot like a saga game which is great best it is not not the best game not the best jrpg game for switch i love octopath traveler so much i cant stop shouting and destroying headphone users ears ign gave octopath traveler a 9 and fortnite a 96 is this game any good in a few weeks this will be the inferior version finally the tables are turning and doors are opening for once definitive version out on steam 672019 60fps load time improvements etc chrono trigger remake with this art style would be the bomb i am not sure what your doing while playing but the characters i have on my team are all 10 levels above where they are supposed to be and the boss i am fighting is difficult for some reason i wish they implemented the story into boss battles because if they did then this guy would be easy he was on death doors the night before people dont recover that quickly so why is he so hard alfyn chapter 3 edit also he is alone nobody protecting him from his weaknesses the answer to the title is yes no further evidence needed the fact that they dont interact with each other really ruins it for me the bp system is also from bravely default and they have a whole story revolving around them interacting with each other so this game feels dull in comparison individual stories are nice but if your gonna have a party system i wouldve wanted them to at least have a few more conversations with each other idk just my opinion i love a good story but the way its divided in this game is a weird feeling i cant get used to ive played about 3040mins of the demo and was absolutely into it until the recruiting part i dont know it felt so dull characters join you so casually it disappointed me so much that i stopped playing i dont know if ill pick it up again im currently sixteen and have just recently bought my switch lets go pikachu bundle but wanted another game but i never played a zelda game and im not heavily into mario im just a huge pokemon fanatic and was looking online at games on the switch that wasnt a port and came across this game and the art style absolutely mesmerized me i have been turned off by jrpgs since i played my sisters final fantasy game when i was five i thought the turn based combat was boring and too complex for my five year old mind and havent played a true jrpg since and when i seen octopath i was excited and hesitant because of the combat but thought to myself pokemon is turn based so i bit the bullet and bought octopath with just seeing the images and rating on gamestop and i have completely changed my mind on jrpgs i have also bought smash since my first smash bros and love the fire emblem characters so i will most likely get into fire emblem and buy awakening or echos for my 2ds once i bought the nswitch some weeks ago at present im hooked with zelda botw but loved octopath since they revealed the trailer played the demo some days ago and totally loved it just waiting for my birthday to get it xd hey wood you hyped the game so much i finally decided to purchase it since im a huge fan of rpgs of all sorts unfortunately so far the game has been underwhelming the story is quite dull i hope it picks up later its not a bad game but nothing out of the ordinary hopefully as i keep progressing i will get more invested and change my mind btw i just found out it is possible to remove the corner shadows that makes the game so much more enjoyable this video describes how to do it httpsyoutubekzk3tziogw i wish there was a way where you could connect two switches to increase ones power that playing the music to octo for adventure was smart i enjoyed it very much as well im so happy its coming to pc i am excited to play it for the first time and eagerly as it excited to see what the pc modding community come up with in the future im actually not a fan of this game so far just recently bought this game i have haanit and therion game just isnt living the hype with me crono trigger thats where we are talking 748 doesnt that make haanit a pokemon trainer thanks to this video i now have to replay it poor me im not much of a gamer but the switch has been my addiction and this game is no help i do appreciate you making these switch videos and helping me feed my switch addiction please keep it up a new fan brittnie octopath or botw i really love rpgs and everything about this sounds awesome except i really dont like the 16 bit style graphics i can see it adds a little modernness but over all it still looks 16 bit did yoko shimomora compose the ost i didnt played this game ive only seen a review and the title was literally screw your game and after watching the review i can say screw your game and im really glad that i was warned and the guy is a jrpg fan this game is horrible why everyone like this game im not a big fan of rpg games usually but i keep hearing so much good stuff about this game and that music at 100 makes me seriously think about getting it decided to download the demo to see if i like it heh i trust you wont be missing this you really havent skipped anything you encouraged me to buy it love your enthusiasm just jumped on the switch bandwagon yesterday after buying a 2ds xl a couple weeks ago heard so many amazing things about this game im a hardcore final fantasy fan and while i havent bought this game yet as im going to beat mario odyssey first this game will be my next purchase even over breath of the wild thanks for your exciting review love your energy this game is now around 45 so its an absolute must buy for the switch i bought super smash bros instead of octopath traveler best game everrr a must for all the rpg lovers very good critic its not my favorite switch game but i do love it 15 hours in and it is definitely a reason among many to own a switch along with zelda mario smash mobility best way to play indies and eventually metroid animal crossing luigis mansion fire emblem and astral chain haanit is a pokemon master for reals i stayed till 5am last night game is so addicting not saying the animation is bad but if this game had botw animation it would probably be the best switch game i have been playing this game for like 6 hours now not very long in the grand scheme of things i know and i didnt realize you could use more than one bp per attack im pretty sure it was that way in bravely default also and i didnt even think about it i wasnt sure about the game at firstim not really into rpgs so i tried the demo 30 minutes in i found myself audibly saying the words i need this game again ad again i just bought this today seems i made the right choice when i first saw hanit i first thought she was boring and very dull and i wouldnt keep her in my party but oh boy was i wrong i literally have a deadly petting zoo in my grasp hanit is one of my favourite characters now 6080 hours long you say ive been playing it more than 60 hours already and i still didnt get to any 2nd chapter with any character tbh i didnt collect all the characters yet i just travel and grind d no xenoblade 2 is better bro please give it 35 hours to learn the game and its spectacular i mean you never talk about thet game and its nuts im obsessed with this game right now ive watched this video too many times i cant wait to pickup the game only been able to play through the demo so far thanks wood good game boring story one of the best jrpg i have played so far the music is what brings it to life idc what anyone says good music makes the passion for it so much more apparent almost finishing the game and never realized that each character first name letter spelled octopath im the type of guy who has is switch and his copy of octopath traveler lying right next to him and still wont pick it up and play it cause im too lazy so id rather just watch wood and listen to the soundtrack cause jesus christ this game is fucking good it has great combat graphics and a somewhat interesting world but frankly i dont know how any old school rpg gamer could possibly consider the story for this game as exceptional it is a pathetically routine and cliche jrpg story with dragged out dialogues that ultimately do not offer much character progression or world building beyond the exposition chapters there is virtually no conversation between the party members so there is no real connection within their stories and the plot how can you play games like ff vi through x chrono trigger rogue galaxy undertale or the last of us and say this story is worth anything substantial i think many people are blinded by their nostalgia goggles and lowering their standards because its got the old school rpg vibe and just blindly love the story despite the fact that they pummel you with verbose predictable and contrite storytelling in my opinion its one of the worst switch games id give it a 4210 dude i know im late to the party i just got this game and i cant fuckin stop like wtf i tell myself im quitting after i get to this next save pointbut i keep going playing for days at a time pls help really wish i picked this up when i got the switch sadly i cant find it in stock for a decent price im both hyped to get this and trying to stop the bleeding from my ears hey beatemups im just starting my copy i nabbed the other day who would you suggest starting with wood hopefully you see this but a youtuber named family jules did a cover album of every single song in octopath and its literally perfect his cover of my forest home the song that plays in haanits home village might be my favorite song of all time now his album is on spotify but you can also find the whole album as a playlist on his youtube channel i really hope you see this because if you do you absolutely wont regret it this game looks like the typical old jrpg to me i want a golden sun remake in this style i wanna bang haanit and have her talk dirty to me in that weird way she says words fantastic review just got done with the first quest with oberin i dont mind an hour worth of review if its from beatemups no its boring i want my narrative to be given to me along the way not in hr long bursts another thing the characters should interact w each other it seems stupid i mean its square they brought us the cloud tifa aries barrette date in the 90s they know growing relationships between main characters is important rite nope grind read grind read grind read 8 separate stories that have nothing to do w each other boring af pretty nostalgic and challenging im not too too far into the game so i could be wrong but it didnt seem like a format that was gonna change thats why it lost my intrest played the demo when i first bought my switch and loved it been trying to convince myself to buy it for months and your video just gave me that hype so i bought it cant wait to dive in too bad im trying to run through ff9 at the same time for everyone saying story sucks chapter 2s were rough but at chapter 3 and especially chapter 4 every single character gets pulled together in the stories for a single grand cause and its ho estly really cool plus the combat is wild once you get strong items for your characters and good team builds with secondary jobs the 1010 was deserved i hate this game so freaking much octogrind travellevel not by any means another best switch game lolso many bests to choose from i would agree with you octopath traveler was a fun game i too believe its the best game on the switch same team created bravely default and bravely second on 3ds if you enjoyed octopath youd like those as well what is your accent it sounds like half american half australian half english yes i know that doesnt add up its my favourite video game nevermind my favourite switch game i wanna get the game but im too poor octomom path travler is a great game especially when the kids arent around why are you yelling i just wanna know if the game is good or not jesus ive never really enjoyed turn based games i dont know why just never have do you think that this may be a game that could change my mind and i would enjoy it they finally got it right on old skool rpg with modern inventive mechanics with loads of combinations second best game on system next to botw subbed your vids sold me on switch lol 1137 i am playing this game right now and had to stop video and comment saying im in that exact battle with the same party set up i got hooked on the demo and then ended up buying it since i bought it its been the main game ive been playing i love to story and the characters one of my favorite jrpgs ever definitely one of my favorite games on switch by looking at it i had no idea how fantastic it is yes yes it is finally got this game its unbelivable a must own imo your reviews are the best on youtube dude i feel the same way im so excited about this game love your channel greetings from mxico my bigist problem with the game is that there are 8 characters but half have the same feild abilility as the other half with small diffrences favorite turn based jrpg did you tried persona 5 i know that this game is worth 60 dollars but i would rather breath of the wild than this so im gonna wait for it to drop in price man i lost the 40 promo discount tt now i regret it tt not even close but its great its such a charming game with a great score love it great game i put 65 hours in this game and loved every second old school turn based combat with some new features that make it feel super innovative i gave the demo a go due to your raving played it its nothing special and i have a long list of complaints already after only two hours with it the interface and overall gameplay feelz so clunky for a game supposed to be a modernizing of old school jrpgs up to three battle points thank you for the review without major spoilers amazing info mate the look of this game is how i imagined a new final fantasy tactics amazing damm dude you hyped it up for me so much ughh i need it in my life now its bad im currently playing it level 36 first of all gathering all 8 characters is incredibly repetitive the first one is fun and its challenging but then you are stuck with 7 identical missions that simply become easier and easier then you have exploration theres a simple mostly linear path with small diversions here and there that will 999 of the time to a completely pointless chest no secrets or anything exciting like that you might get the rare dungeon which are not great as ive seen so far finally you have secondary missions which involve talking to someome and then talking with somebody else congratulations you completed the quest i dont know what elae to say the world is artistically beautiful but it lacks features and content the narrative is not that great what im enjoying right now is looking for secondary jobs at dungeons thats cool and feels rewarding im sure i missed the give away but i really want this game it looks amazing and thank you for the great videos my inner child is screaming buy a damn switch just for that gameand zelda i do own a ps4 and i am not into buying more than one system but damn it i never thought that games like teranigma lufia secret of evermore mana would have another era where they are even better than in the 90s this is so bittersweet is it the best no far from it i just bought this game and i love it to and its long and very fun to play and i love turned based rpgs i could not sleep either lol cringe i love how he starts with the perfect characters and story if you watch dunkeys videos its the shredding of the characters and story well this game is like 30 percent off i guess i know where my money is going this game looks boring i have this playlist with videos that in my opinion are the best videos on ytafter 2 seconds i paused it added it to my pl and continued theres now a 3hr gameplay demo avail and 40 off until 1401 ukeu anyway played prologue for 15 minsimmediately purchased full game the reason i bought it is because it resembles in a way star ocean the second story my fav game of all time enix ftw when i finally pick up a switch this will probably be the first game i pick up well im sold getting it tonight i agree 100 this game is shittiest game ever sounds a little hypedwhy couldnt they make the graphics more 3d i know graphics isnt anythingbut the 2d art in the enemies are a little eye sore is like downgrading from 2000 final fantasy x damn is that game ugly as sin i would play it though this game looks cool but combat is tedious and unrewarding after 4 hrs im all set back to botw and limbo this game needs to be at least 20 bucks as soon as he said before the beat drops i farted loud like really loud is it better than chrono trigger your enthusiasm made me buy the game right away its downloading now i like the enthusiasm but why are you yelling at me 9am in the morning xd can i simply ask have you ever played vandal hearts 2 i still play it today because there are different ways on the combat system its plot has different endingsthere is a wonderful atmosphere too thats why i was so surprised when ive seen your reaction for octopath traveler octopath is certainly a good game and ive got it also but i suggest you to try vandal hearts 2 if you look for excitement on what you just enjoyed i still dont find any game at all in the world with that combat system thats why i was not so excited when i started to play octopath you normally choose which attack and what kind of sorcery to spell but if you know vandal hearts 2 you will understand why all the other games could be boring on the combat system the character styles remind me so much of ragnarok and the colour grading reminds me of tree of savior look im gonna say it i enjoyed this enough to put it above all games on the switch right now having played the majority of the big names on switch this game takes the top spot ive played and loved xenoblade 2 smash ultimate botw mario odyssey etc but none of them have the same charm xenoblade 2 dlc is an extremely close second but the main game just didnt give me enough to throw it top spot too much fanservice for me smash ultimate is fun but burns out fast its good for short plays and the occasional wol marathon to me botw just felt like nintendo saw dark souls and just said copypaste the combat with some editing to separate it story is passable but wasnt anything special shield surfing was the best part of botw mario odyssey was nice it had its quirks and is a solid game but its just another mario game peach is kidnapped by bowser albeit higher stakes this time and mario has to save her none of these games have the soundtrack to come close for some reason i thought this game would be a shallow and short jrpg with 16bit graphics to trick nostalgic final fantasy fans into buying it no way square enix has the skill or soul to make a good jrpg with all the trash theyre churning out these days im so happy to have been wrong in all my preconceived notions probably the most fun ive had with a jrpg since ff9 i have always considered graphic quality to be one of the most important factors in a game well thats until i started playing this game definitely a masterpiece you are now my favourite you tuber keep doing what youre doing bro bro why you yelling im watching this video at 545 in the morning youre killing me lol nah no game deserves a perfect score just like no game deserves a 0 unless it wont even start but more games need to get below 5 dude i pitied that guy and thought id run away to make him look good cos he looked wimpy it ended with the same result but now i wandered if i shouldve actually tried to beat him xd so in a way this is like final fantasy 6 where we have a beautiful roster of character that plays differently and each of them have their own story that captures the players i think i see why i was looking forward to this game i love ff6 what is your favorite rpg of all time now that i have played it i can comfortably say that no way this game is bettter than zelda botw and xenoblade 2 i own them too the only good things about this game imo are the feeling of nostalgia and those beautiful oldschool graphics although i still cant handle the fact that enemies dont have combat animations the story gameplay characters skills etc bored me to death im stuck between this or the resident evils help me i payed the demo so long ago and i cant wait to play the full game this games art style reminded me of golden sun and is also what appealed to me most shoulda known square had you covered on the music man you made me wanna play this game since launch im still playing it not sure if its the best but its the one ive liked the most pretty barebones storywise but its customization factor and combat system are topnotch and i still gotta beat the super bosses i love octopath important question is there a new game and more importat is it a game for completionists like me started playing the game a week before finals terrible idea what about docked mode vs handheld nintendo switch reviewers should make this a fixed topic for each review they make im so grateful i found your page your taste and opinions match mine so well plus your energy is awesome its making me consider getting into point and clicks lol ive had my eye on octopath for awhile and its why i got a switch that and breath of the wild i love it it looks like we imagined it as children wood i just recently subscribed to your channel and i love it youre so enthusiastic and its clear you love gaming even though it may be borderline addiction the mix of gameplay footage during your reviews are awesome and it really gives people the chance to see what the game is about your presentation is never one to hate on a game you just break it down keep on reviewing and having fun getting my pkm console switch will pick up this game and donkey kong as well no no no primrose is a ho she persuades people to follow her and pity her only so she can convince them to protect her shes still best girl tho is there a sequel so this is like saga then its on sale right now came here to see if it was worth it and bought it within the first few minutes of the video i dont usually like turn based rpgs should i still give it a try the best switch game is xenoblade octopath traveler is bullshit sold it after 5 hours of playtime music suer mario galaxy art ff6bravely plot persona i got this same kinda hype playing this gamereally good ideas to expand upon for a sequel the game is not that good relax after buying and knowing this is the best game imo i wish i went back in time and got the collectors edition after finding how much fun and attached i end up i just bought the diablo switch the other day i cant wait to get a hold of this well im getting a switch bow i guess this game sucks i must be a normie zelda isnt that good this is however amazing this game is 1110 will it come to pc i know how it feels to be reeled into this game ive wasted nearly a hundred hours on this thing and damn have i enjoyed them love the game but id kill to have the same game but the combat was akin to a more indepth ys series style combat top down action rpg this would be a perfect game im really debating whether or not i should get this gamelots of comments say that its amazing and some say that its just painfully average so i dont know which to base m6 decision off its indeed a fantastic game but still behind zelda botw to me why you bitting the game box like that in the thumb nail your shirt is damn awesome this damn gamei thought id hate it but holy good crap its addicting i love it quik turn by pondo and after i can buy the collectors edition i ve playd for once 32hours of snowballbowling pondos hope hes getting broke and selling his wife to me dosent happend noticed that pondo is a snowithenigga i mean thats clearly an afro i love the art and music the combat is great and the storys are decent but the game gets very repetitive after a while and the storylines keep cutting off because you have to play the other characters storys to level up more so the storys arent as interesting anymore since you disliked xb2 does it mean this game is crap this game is trash its too damn simple and offers no challenge to the hardcore jrpg player i started playing this game very casually at around 5pmstopped at around 3 am after remembering as a human being i had to eventually shower and eat it hooked me violently in an almost zelda botw way almost not really a fan of this dlc era of gaming but i would love an expansion pack of this masterpiece tressas hunter hat is the best thing about this game its so frickin adorable pretty great game overall though i just ordered it i havent tried the demo yet i love ff6 hope ill like this game this 60 bucks is too much for a 2d game argument is really fucking idiotic dunkey disagrees bahaha i dont know whos opinion to follow playing a very mundane story eight different ways doesnt make mundane content good octopath is a great game but to truly know the ending for each character would mean you have to play the game 8 times and repeat some of the bosses again and again xenoblade against one enemy and it had an epic story australian accent with american as like mel gibson around his drunken rant period i guess he isnt slurring and pissed off just saying keep up the enthusiastic reviews still umming and arrring about octopath traveller should i get it hmmm the game is definitely a 1010 i have been stuck on it sadly but i bought my switch for octopath and zelda no would say xenoblade chronicles 2 xenoblade chronicles 2 torna is the best switch games but yeah octopath is awesome also the south park games are also very underrated so far i am headed to the third characters town after the thief dude game is pretty nice i like the fighting system i didnt like it the stories are way too simple and boring very pretty visuals though this game is so good ive been trying to find time to play my other games i love the art gameplay and the stories sixtopath traveler httpkoeiwikiacomwikiunchartedwatersnewhorizons im the same way im going to get the game it look good thanks for the review finally another good rpg therion for smash i like it but im still not sure if i care for the 8 different story lines that i run around between the combat system is interesting and fun the visuals and music are lovely the voice acting is sometimes amusing but the whole genre is a bit tongueincheek anyway so not really a big deal i just feel like the 8 separate story lines you can skip between at will is presented as an innovation when it really seems more like laziness or a timesaving measure on the devs part so they could spare themselves having to integrate everything cohesively or maybe not like i said i cant decide 7510 for me probably i think octopath i got it is probably one of the most enjoyable rpg on the switch for the moment jrpg style and turn based battle makes it really less dynamic than mario or botw and somehow bit repetitiv but thats whats we expect from se they create something interesting for any rpg lover but something bigger for any jrpg turned based fan game play is talking here thats all after those facts all your opinion are based on your taste concerning cara design or story i personnaly love this game but i agree with those who thought that it got a lack of interaction between the 8 caracters nope it was a miss for me it really is nice to see some one not crapping on this game i hate how everyone says none of the stories cross and its like they never got farther into the game where they have dialects between each other i love its combat and style but the 8 story gimmick really slows the pace of the game down and the narrative feels too fragmented the character interaction is also threadbare still love it though i love this game so much on another note i never even realized octopath literally stands for their names lol yeah its an amazing game really everyone should get a switch and pick this up and i guess that fucking zelda game too or whatever hey please give me a copy im broke and want this please i spent all my money on the switch itself with zelda and mario 68 for the name pronunciations stress was put on the wrong syllable in olberic and therion is not pronounced like youre trying to say theory its actually thehreeon and this is even spoken as such in the game octopath is fantastic im just getting my fourth character i started as primrose and im about to get cyrus this game is the most charming rpg an absolute love letter to fans of the classic jrpgs of the snes era i dont like rpg games but this game i dont know what it is the music the art the story but for the first time i enjoying an rpg game i just want to say thank you so much i know this is a late comment but i truly love this game and i only bought it because of your amazing review great job man and i owe you a lot of thanks for this i think they found a perfect art style for golden sun to return just got it last night i havent had much free time to play it yet but so far i love it why cant zelda look like this looks cool i should pick it up the story of this game was the worst thing by far after you start building your party the story repeatedly pretends like the rest of your party isnt there during plot scenes example you might work on ophelias ch 2 story after you have all the other characters even though seven other people are with her they all mysteriously vanish whenever shes talking to people in her story arc but reappear for walking around townsdungeonsfights the only camaraderie we get is the occasional tales ofesque scenes were randomly 2 party members will be shown saying 2 words to each other about stuff that doesnt effect the game games like final fantasy 410 were great because party members actually interacted with each other in meaningful important plot pointsif octopath does do this they wait way to long to start i have over 160 hours into this game and that is crazy i enjoyed all 8 stories and i still cant stop playing im currently in completionist mode completing every last side quest random comments if someone is standing in front of a doorway even if it is a nice old lady challenge them with olberic and lay the smack down if you are in the clifflands you will find yourself muttering molly percocet gotta represent damn because of the background music random encounters can become tedious but you can use a scholar alt skill to reduce the frequency best random character soundbyte what the hellzzz i agree with mr shampoo commercial hairsweet aussienz accentbadazz gauge earrings5hour energy for blood amazing game but i still rate botw higher the only one you butchered is olberic this is game is better than mario rpg octopath traveler has become one of my fav games for all the reason you said in this video the storytelling the awesome soundtrack that became my fav ost the graphics everythings is well done i dont want to imagine the next beast made by this beast of a team now in square enix se might reshine in the jrpg with this studio within their hq and even after almost one month beaten it even the true final boss the game just shine as it shined when i played it at release this game is not near a 10 in my opinion good rpg but had problems with the story structure xenoblade chr 2 is better than this game felt more grand in everyway zelda is ofc a better game too if nintendo goes all in on original rpgs on the switch they will make this a must have console for a lot of gamersloving this game and looking forward to what the future holds not my favorite switch game but i cannot deny how much ive enjoyed it the music gos with the game your review is so good my kids will have to eat ramen noodles tonight so i can buy this game ps sorry kids you can say something is a perfect game im not gonna say that rembrandt missed a little stroke and then claim it isnt a perfect painting a perfect game makes you feel that way that you just described happy excited and amazed thats the bar for a perfect game and anything higher i think is just unreasonable oh get real soy boy this is not the best switch game i got mine for 40 very soon after release im about 20 hours in and agree that 40 makes more sense try to play bravely default its made by silicon studio which has been made octopath traveler i really like the game but some stories specially ophilias and olberics are deadboring lol i just bought it yesterday sure is addicting haha i dont know if it is the best there are some big ones i havent played but it is definitely the one ive played the most of lost interest in zelda about 20 hours or so i am very much enjoying it very surprised at how much ive enjoyed olbericks story his seemed like it would be the most boring am i the only one that choose ophilia for my starting character been waiting for a game like this ever since classics like grandia 2 probably enough to make me buy a switch just for this and pokmon 2019 i hear a smudge of american accent creeping into you looks like a terrible terrible game wouldnt even play it if someone payed me to i havent been interested in an rpg in ages but i played the demo and i was hookedthis game is so beautiful love your passion ive been thinking to play rpg since i was young not a single rpg game sticks with me the many things to read talent and resource management not my cup of tea wasnt going to get it but now i am awesome review man i need to buy a switch for this game to experience a happiness close to yours the visuals look amazing would love to see ff1 iv and vi remakes with this mixed 2d3d style btw this guy has the reddest lips i think ive ever seen on a man omg dude your video omg omg omg im buying this game right now omg omg omg is this the kind of reaction im suppose to have now lol plus the story sucks it goes nowhere doesnt deserve even a 7 persona would kill this game rapely static boss fights come on this along with dragon quest builders are my favorite switch games of 2018 i am in real trouble and need your help bro octopath traveller diablo iii eternal collection super smash bros ultimate valkyria chronicles 4 i have money only for one of them which one i should buy i want them all what is your personal rankin among them abd yes i will not mention the legend of zelda and super mario odissey it is hard enough to choose among those 4 right now i only have botw and i love the game but i suck at it thinking to get this ive never been a fan of turn based rpg games but after honestly doing so bad at the demo of this game i love it sooo much more than i ever thought i would cant wait to buy it and hopefully find myself the wayfarers edition le fucken masterpiece bro i love this fucking game so fucking muchhhh yes it is the best switch game my main party is haanit protagonist therion ophilia and cyrus your excellency so i guess i have a similar to yours mhthis game could justify spending 300 for a switch question if you chose let say bergs story can you see what happends to the other characters stories how it develops i swear your better at reviewing then ign is no octopath is horrible animal crossing is better boi the story is bad and the diolauge sucks wood i love you you may have a problem though yes this game is hella dope and i will definitely hunt that limited edition down lol cancer i think its my favorite turn based rpg period earthbound was but this game is amazing on another level also its interface is so amazing you get so much information on the screen during battle but its labeled and placed perfectly so a newbie like my wife its perfect for me to explain how to play i started her on south park stick of truth then breath of the wild now i think i can step her up to this but she claims she hates then based kind of games i will make my wife love this game damn it and everyone should buy it and love it also haanit is your favourite with therion second damn good choice haanit is my main at level 85 and im preparing for the final boss 4th best 1 botw 2 xenoblade 2 3 mario odyssey 4 octopath hahaha the best game of the switch is xenoblade chronicles 2 and one of the best stories is up to the best stories told in a jrpg xenoblade is the best switch game and one of the best jrpg in history i do not understand how people have been so hard to control xenoblade 2 i am not one of those who complete 100 nor get all the blades only the important ones all the popy ones and little else what came out of me playing i did not look for legendary blades i did not have to grind never with what i struggled to swing was enough played in normal difficulty i never had to say im going to go up lvl a few hours because i need it to be able to continue 100h finish the game with about 8h of secondary as much but come on that octopath does not even reach the sole of the shoe like jrpg you remove the visual section in the old style and it is quickly forgotten sounds like the combat system in this game was easy enough for you unlike xbc2 so its probably too simple for anyone who has played many rpgs botw master mode is still the best especially the master sword challenges hey wood wanted to let you know im a newish subscriber and i bought this game based on your recommendation and love it you rock dude and ill be watching didnt mean to be creepy but lets roll with it teach me how to get into it the only other game ive played like this is pokemon id like to get into it but i need help dude thank you for these videos this viseo is what motivated me to spend my last 60 bucks onnot and it did not disappoint thanks wood only 3 hours in and i adore it anyone know the hentai in the thumbnail sooo this is kinda like an 8 character braverly default sold i want this game now you seam very excited if i never dived into a rpg would i enjoy this october is the 8th month not the 10th duh im serious wtf are you shouting about if haanit was real ill marry her its so endearing to see a youtuber speaking so honest about the game i can literally feel through the screen how much you love the game haha to me octopath is also a super nice game it actually gave me back the motivation to also go finish xenoblade which is really cool ew you like therion him and this game is like me and skyrim octopath traveler is walking simulator thats the only bad thing everything else is 1010 haanit is basically a pokemon trainer favorite turn based rpg of all time we are in a gen where kids spend more on eshop cards for micro to use on fortnight and complain about a 6000 tag u wanna real challenge or a real game buy this game and beat it and you might be considered a gamer at the end of the day i was disappointed by it i was so hyped as an rpg fan but its so boring outside from the gameplay ive always said old school turned based rpg is the way to go all this modern age hack and slash isnt fun no because breath of the wild already has that title hi from australia wood i was actually going to give this game a miss but your video review motivated me to go get it just started playing it enjoying it just for the music alone your name is wood you always get the collectors edition no substitute i think you can only boost 3 times not 4 all i want is to be able to sort the inventory aaah im getting a switch in about 2 months been saving up for a little while i absolutely love rpgs so should i get this as my first game i am going to buy botw super mario odyssey and mario kart 8 as well i just dont know exactly when yet the people who worked on the bravely games worked on octopath after watching this review its more obvious than before that the people that did bravely did this game when will we get a third bravely game i though i was the only one who couldnt stop being hyped and playing this game 247 im almost 30 hours in what a great game definitely one of my top 3 switch games works with final fantasy musics too especially soundtracks from nobuo uematsu nope i love your energy keep it up because i instantly subscribed the writing your excellency too bad its a switch exclusive it could have been great if it was released on other platforms the game looks kinda like ffxenoblade in the sense of battle no its not you fucking clickbait idiot just beat it took me 76hrs this guy is going to bed at 9am definitely does coke yo why is every switch game reviewer in the same room lol got the european version of compendium edition for the price of the regular but i just got mario rabbids so my gf wont let me play octopath until ive finnished mr kb feels bad im just shook that people are surprised that its full priced tldr yes im going to bed playing this game and waking up playing it and at work playing it and eating while playing it i love this game i havent loved a game this much in a looooooooong time definitely my favorite switch game by far my entire channel has turned into an homage to this game at this point helgenish to primrose put your mouth where it belongs helgenish is a beast i love the game yes its one of my favorites on the switch maybe even my fav the issue i find with this game is that every single chapter is basically the same thing over and over again a small issue happens in town we go around town finding clues then we go to a small dungeon mansion or forest we travel through it get to the end kill a boss and fix the issue im almost done with everyones chapter 2 and i dont see chapter 3 being any different i dont see it having any final huge boss and i think the finale is predictable other than that im enjoying the game i have 45 hours into it and having a lot of fun i want to buy a switch and that game only because of you d im not a big jrpg fan at all actually the closest i get to playing them types of games is pokemon ha ive bought octopath traveler on your recommendation alone so if i hate it can you reenburse me asking for a friend so are you supposed to play it eight times or am i thinking of it wrong i could not stand the demo why do people like this game i was bored out of my mind it was like a cliche of bad games from the 90s it will never get a price drop for physical copies also one of things that could have made it better was simple little things like healing certain characters killed if you had already picked up a healer looking at you yusafa the father could also have been healed but killed off when you left i would have thought ophillas adoptive father would have been assassinated or poisoned i feel just falling ill wasnt really enough and given out a bonus item if yusafa had been saved that you could stealbuy just watched your review gotta say i agree with you wholeheartedly i also think that octopath might have eclipsed suikoden 2 as my favorite jrpg of all time god i hope it gets a sequel i cant wait to see what the next 8 characters are going to be like 1 sub i can only say one thing its square enix 3 beatemups mas this side quest you mention about the guy who keeps trying marry and getting rejected i have done a diferent thing i find his mother and she scold the guy and he stops to anoy the girl mas even in completely misseble side quests this game is impressive this game just doesnt look very good wow nintendo has quality control couph couph steam cause of you i want to buy the game now hey wood watched this video and could not resist buying it very happy with purchase havent gotten off it since i bought it thanks im debating getting this or desgaea 5 can someone tell me if the story has the cheesiness of bravely default also is the bravedefault system in this game it looks like it does but maybe a bit different took me around 140 hours to finish all of the stories because i couldnt help reading as much as i could everything about this game is amazing and everyone should buy it octopath traveller and pokemon are the reason why i wanted a switch you praise the writing in this game a ton im curious how far are you in each chapter ive cleared all of chapter 3 and tress primroses 4 and i have to say the writing is very not good there are several instances of introducing a a major villain moments before you fight them introducing a good character that is obviously evil and trying to pull big emotional reveals without any buildup its not the worst in any game let alone any jrpg ive come across i would definitely recommend this game to any rpg fan game play music and graphics are all 9 or 10 but the writing is flawed at best i started the demo and didnt really get into ito beatemups would you consider reviewing hand of fate 2 and lone wolf saga id love to see your reactions i dont like xenoblade 2 octopath traveler is the best switch game are you a stupid idiot the bosses are actually really really easy just same strategy for 15mins not hard i was tired of octopath after i played the demo as a newbie to rpgs does it have an easy setting i wouldnt say octopath traveler is my favorite switch game because it compares only to zelda which is a completely different type of game made it through half the review and then bought the game on the eshop your enthusiasm alone hyped me up enough to buy it lmao i dont think its actually better than botw or mario odyssey its pretty damn good thoughin my opinion the best game square enix has put out since the snes era so better than 7 but not better than 6 or chrono trigger imo i couldnt stand the story of most of them but loved the combat i bought the switch just to play this game it reminds me of saga frontier 12 no regret its a fantastic game ive spent a ton of time on it im hoping they make more of these games not even close its good though this is how i feel about xenoblade 2 but damn octopath is amazing octopath is great but its no persona 5 so its still number 2 was just about to check the price on amazon because of what you said and its sold out god damn by the way therion best main thief class so broken i wont lie mario odyssey is an amazing game lives up to marios hype and breath of the wild change the way people look at zelda xenoblade chronicles 2 although i really love the first one the second one story is actually really really good the design choices im not too much of a fan on and certain characters i just really dont care about and as gameplaywise its okay its not a horrible game its good its just not my favorite but octopathtraveler i fucking love this game absolutely love it the first chapters of everyone story thats all you have to get through which i guess is a good chunk of the game but thats where most peoples dislikes come from once you get past that point i have nothing but love for every single character i love this game so much it might be my favourite game might what nonsense is this of course it is your favourite game this is truly an amazing game but my only complaint is the lack of character interaction with each other dunkey told me something different theres always something cool about completing ruining your sleep pattern for a game ive been thinking about picking this game up can any of you tell me some things that make it great what do you stream on i want a golden sun on switch like this what a fantastic emotive reviewyour passion is jumping off the screeni am about to buy a switch and this game will become essential to methank you the battle point system feels like just a more boring version of bds brave system hopefully shin megami tensei v is as good as octopath traveler i expect great games from atlus wow i really felt that energy boost when you put the music to adventure time that was nutty i bought the game again in a more expensive way omfg im dying wow a octopath pun and bravely second pun in less than a minute bravo its freaking great i have never given the jrpg genre a fair shake but after i played persona 5 this spring and had a blast i gave octopath a chance and the rest is history even the grind is fun trying out different tactics and job combinations for your partymembers is great 913 bravely default did it first and i know that octopath and default use them in different ways but octopath is not amazing because it included this feature and did not add much to it ps i still like the review wow i actually never realized the relation with the name of the game to the characters names number of them and more interesting xc2 is my favoriteswitch game but with every passing hour played octo is gaining on it in a hurry i never gave the demo a chance i was using primrose and the filthy pig bossing her around pissed me off but i ended up picking it up for 43 i had a 10 off and 10 credit for best buy so i think it was a good buy but dude really good review of this game you say octopath is your favourite switch games till you play another great switch game and claim that game is your faivourite switch game and then octopath is your second best switch game gosh yes the game looks boring pls dont hate me i dont really like octopath you know what i do like octolings p i dont even think you finish half the games you review you can use up to 3 bp not 4 but i liked the review and i share your love with the game hollow knight is my favorite game on the switch its so gooood the visual style to the gameplay level design story and the music the music in this game is astonishing please play it its insanely cheap for what you get please stop yelling all together from now on but turn based combat and 16bit style graphics anytime ive tried a game like this it just doesnt hold my interest maybe if someone gifted me a copy id play it but i cant risk buying it for 80cad my switch continues to collect dust i was really debating buying ot i had downloaded the demo and it was a lot of fun but didnt think it was worth the money oh how wrong i was it is amazing like you i usually skip through the story dialogue but this has me gripped and like you i absolutely adore the soundtrack jrpg and rpg is not my gaming type platformers are my type i honestly love this game so much but i cant buy it yet xd its so hard to stay away from the videos and streams too but i need to get the full experience when i do get it i started the demo with primrose and fell in love with the writing and her story this is probably going to be my favorite game of all time my opinion of octopath its genuinely a love letter to snes era jrpgs and it does that well however its a mediocre jrpg that clothes itself in a veil of nostalgia nostalgia sells and thats why this game is selling so well i like octopath because i like jrpgs but that doesnt make it the spellbinding masterpiece people make it out to be its still turnbased grindy and repetitive in places but its very pretty for what is essentially another 16bit style game omg you stop yelling at me for a second love u dude i was really hesitant on buying this game and i was really sketchy about octopath but after seeing your work and passion you had for this game i decided to try it out and man i gotta thank you for making this vid and sharing your passion for the game i am enjoying it so far and it kinda reminds me of golden sun graphics love your vids man i too have now bought this game twice so i now have it both digitally and in the 100 dollar format gotta say its also one of my favorite collectors editions of any game really well made the only drawback being that one of the scenes in my diorama came unglued as soon as i opened it up and i tore it slightly when gluing it back together aside from that i love the original design adds even more charm to one of the most charming titles ive come across in years still prefer xenoblade 2 as far as story and characters go lol bit as for gameplay graphics and originality i gotta hand it to square how much of the game is voice acted so i should buy it and when i beat octopath traveler dragon quest 11 hits the shelves its good to be rpg fan the struggle is real the fucking writing is a joke wtf i played this yes it is one of my favorites but tbh lozbotw just started getting into this game today and wanted to use a dpad and remembered i had purchased a wireless 8bitdo snes controller recently and decided to connect it to my switch and nothing feels better so i am a little conflicted about this game i have it on my switch but never got to play it up until now the reason is that i have other games to finish first and octopath will probably take a lot of time now im a completionist i wanna see every single aspect and enemy of the game reveal its weaknesses and strengths of course i also want to know everything about the characters now i started with therion cause i thought having a thief early on would be pretty valuable i was right 3 i got into the town cyrus is and could reqruite him since im play through therions story will i be able to play cyrus story with the same save file as well or do i need to choose cyrus as my main character does it work the same way for all the others if it was said in the video im sorry but i couldnt watch it till the end since i didnt have much time this is almost a console seller for me primrose is my favorite her story is dark and i felt bad for her then i was happy and then i havent finished her story yet so not sure great review wood nailed it amazing game i was intrigued when it was announced but it has surpassed my expectations at every turn another key feature for me that didnt make it into your video is the flexibility of learningswapping secondary classes are you trying to become a cloud rapper i started to play this game digitally but then felt down and out i went to amazon today just for some giggles to check the wayfarer edition they had it i bought it and now im stoked to play again i just needed this collectors edition more than any other game this game just looks so fucking awful just bought it havent played it yet this video made me buy it ha there is alternate solutions to some of those side quests also that one with tony for example i allured his mom and brought her over to talk to him instead which resulted in a different end to the quest why you screaming far from it it is still a good game though is there a strategy guide for octopath traveler and if so where can you buy it i dropped xenoblade 2 and ot is to blame after playing ot xb2 feels so empty so boring i know its great but i cant help myself feeling this way in fact i can also say that this is my favorite jrpg along with xenogears ff6 and chrono people are getting carried away the game is great but not that great bought a switch just for this game and havent looked back cough xenoblade chronicles 2 cough dont like turn based combat dude try speaking not shouting really bad watching with headphones your enthusiasm can cure cancer i sweaaaaaaar looking at title nopeit would be better if we didnt already have xenoblade 2 ys viii and south park the fractured but whole seriously a lot of rpgs came out before this wood your enthusiasm is intoxicating now go cut your regular edition in half with a hot knife im not the only one losing his life to this game xd im aprox 12h into the game its ok and generic i feel like im literally the only person in the world who thought mario odyssey was extremely overrated i was so disappointed with it letten your arrows flyen true such a great game i must say in my opinion this game is overhyped and not the same quality of games such as botw and mario odyssey not saying its a bad game but to me its not an amazing one just my opinion though and i respect the opinions of those who do love this game this dude deserves more subs than he has also i completely agree with this review most memorable moment in the game for me so far in primroses starting area tried to find the bouncer started a bar fight with a guy turns out he was a tough fight also turns out he wasnt the bouncer and had nothing to with the quest won 22000 off him found bouncer he was easy only got 15k from quest 1010 would start random bar fight again hey i did that i bought it digitally fell in love and then bought the collectors edition laterim not the only one with more disposable money than common sensegood to know i have never been a fan of turnbased combat so i didnt give this game a second glance i thought i wouldnt like it when this video popped up in my feed i clicked on it and after watching it i want this game no its not the best however it certainly is an extremely solid jrpg i think that the only thing i didnt like about this game is the map layout there was never anything too special and it wouldve been better if they added a bit more to it although i dont know what that thing is liking it but im on the 7th ch 1 right now and they are sooo generic combat tho is really good but i hope the chapter 2s pick up ue wrong yes yes it is wht about the fact that the characters stories nearly dont converge and that the other characters dont even show up on the cutscenes and they never interact with eachother whats the point of having a party then i dont get the battles arnt they just a waiting game with numbers whoever has the biggest hp number wins or is there strategy involved tbh the games not even that good i just bought a switch and octopath because of this review thanks wood i know youre gonna hate me for this but xenoblade chronicles 2 is the best switch game i just got my switch and after getting staples like zelda and mario cart i thought i would save some money and wait a little before getting this game then i played the 3 hour free demo from the estore the next day i went out and bought the collectors edition so much for saving money but money worth spent hehe i love it you totally just blew my freaking mind with the octopath acronym factoid i had absolutely no idea that every characters initial letter was part of the title octopath well done square enix well played i liked golden sun in the gb days i might get this octopath and give it a try no but its pretty close this game wasnt even on my radar until i saw this video after seeing how enthusiastic you were about it i did more research on it and now im going to get the wayfarers edition thanks for making content man love your channel my top 3 switch games rn 1botw 2octopath 3hollow knight i got this and hollow knight the same day and ive sunken about 30 something hours on hollow knight not finished yet im trying to 100 it and about 29 hours on octopath they are both so incredibly fun to me um shouldnt it be 88 thank you so much for not yelling i love it when videos are calmer dont get me wrong i love it when you are crazily excited too but it is nice to be calm sometimes the games not cliche or bland love the enthusiasm dude doode i bought this because of you and damn this game is deep i am owner or ff games 1 through 15 minus an expansion for the mmo and yes i own the og 1 and 2 along with the 2 for snes and this lovely i love this game but i have 2 problems with it 1 even if you switch your party out constantly and keep everyone at a decent level you are not going to be prepared for the final boss as soon as they are available as it is a 2 phase fight that each phase requires a seprate party to battle the boss so all 8 charicters need to be around 7075 if you want to stand a chance since up to that point there were no battles like it i trained up only my favorite 4 in the last chapters of each charicters story so now im going to have to spend hours grinding the other 4 up to a high enough level to handel the final boss 2 the purple treasure chests can only be opened by therion meaning if you want their goodies you need to have him your party at all times or back track to them later which is very anyoing to me dude i really enjoyed your video i might buy the game myself im really in to old rpgs so i might get it myself preschool teacher so affording patience is easier than affording the game i dont play turned based games but the art in this game is too attractive i want to give it a try but i dont have 60 to spend my main problem with octopath every chapter feels the same i cant play more than one chapter at once because it feels extremely repetitive the soundtrack is good but that one from xbc2 is still superior the combat and graphical style is great indeed so iv never played an rpg game before and im thinking of buying octopath as my first rpg game will it be fine because im kind of overwhelmed this game has murdered my sleep schedule when playing the game my focus becomes unparalleled despite the good ratings i feel reviewers were hard on the game the story kind of reminds me a bit of dragon quest 4 my team is therion my main cyrus ophelia and primrose and omg i feel like this is the best team ive tried so many combos but with the secondarys i have attached to them also i have a to break every enemy i come across i have so much heals and mana restores its amazing i unsubscribed because of the constant pandering for likes and subscriptions there are plenty of people who do youtube as a full time job and never annoy their audiences with begging in every video and it does get really annoying after a while 600 love this part im glad someone else likes the game as much as i do get the advanced jobs top 3 boss themes 3 the one they call the witch 2 those who govern reason 1 battle at journeys end arrowstorm is your favorite wait until you see winnehelds battle cry top ten characters and tales 8 haanit 7 olberic 6 ophelia 5 therion 4 tressa 3 cyrus 2 primrose 1 alfyn its overhyped youve spent long enough in the us that youre starting to say path with an american accent haha se just paying youtuber to hype their game i wont listen just played the demo and i think its an ok rpg 610 score i cried from a sidequest in this game youve convinced me to get it thank you wait just a minute is his name therion like tales of berseria therion i guess i have to buy the game now you need to play suikoden ii its such a good turnbased rpg and the story is so good ohhh my gosh thats why i kept failing that mission i have the forbidden sword but im suppose to lose i thought the story kind of dragged i dont get it the writing is soo cliche and bland animie it is insanely boring to me instantly turned me off the game in the demo combat was ok but i didnt see anything too special though looks good though still glad i didnt but it your excellency i think your wrong definitely not the best gamebutstill absolutely amazing it brought me back back to a time where jrpgs were just called rpgs and were considered to be the pinnacle of gamingtbh i think this type of game still is most games that came out after 0607ish doesnt hold a candleand even the ones that did i still cant seem to say this type of gaming has been surpassed yet only flaw of this game was the lack of character interaction wouldve loved to see them become best of friends big difference with your excitement on this compared to xeno glad you like it im enjoying it over on my channel it is a great game but not comparable to xenoblade chronicles 2 must buy it should i say is it worth it yes this trash gamenah zelda botw is the only good game on the switch 255 hours into the game 3 characters up to chapter 3 ive got a long way to go hey man i love your channel but you got a put a spoilers ahead warning because i walked right into that not thinking that this will have spoilers in it i agree it might not be for everyone but for those interested i definitely recommend pushing through the first chapters if you find them a grind when you start getting to the 2nd chapters it really ramps and opens up i liked it for the first 12 hours now ive been loving it for the next 20hours ive played im no where near the end its huge and engrossing just for anyone curious i never play jrpgs and love this octopath traveler from a visual standpoint seems to be this console generation 3d dot game hero both visually stunning games with a retro 2d mixed with 3d look i was thinking about buying this game before i watched your video you so successfully brought across your love for this game that i got goosebumps subbed liked hyped to get this game tonight thanks so much for your effort and passion im also waiting for a price drop but its not because i feel the game isnt worth 60 its because the switch has too many good games to be able to comfortably afford wholesale can nintendo make a new golden sun with this art style please primroses story is frickin intense honestly i feel hollow knight is probably the best game currently on the switch because of the low price and creativity put into it nothing competes against the effort and price put on that game i got the game for 1112 im sure many who have played the game understand what i mean no hate on octopath traveler but i just need to save to actually get games at full price its not bad but is a bit annoying hollow knight and its developers definitely deserve more than a handful of recognition im getting more into this kind of game as im getting old ive seen some say it has snes graphics id like to see what snes game looks as good there are three in my household taking turns playing octopath traveler it is breathtaking and well balanced just a beautiful game wish the text was bigger though only thing that could have been improved is the map but its boring 004 is dis a bmth reference lowkey love me that thumbnail your review is a perfect 1010 thank you i fcking love this game the musical score is hands down the best 100 on the same page its the best rpg i played in over 25 years that doesnt include zelda in its title also got the collectors edition after struggling to find a shop who still had the standard version on release day xd love the game also 3 this guy is talking nice things about a game i love i will watch the ads because he deserves nice things where did u get ur t shirt from i found the stories to be incredibly repetetive and the writing wasnt my cup of tea as it was too animelike which just doesnt fit for me for an rpg which for me should be epic instead of kind of cute also it was filled with plot that was just a typical anime plot which made it all the more repetetive for me will see if ill ever finish it although life has gotten in my way and ive only put 3 hours in im loving octopath traveler this seems to be one that i enjoy playing more undocked i will agree with the 1010 if you have a switch and you love rpgs then this is a must buy uh oh hope he doesnt see dunkeys video of this game im still bugged by how each story is presented with only one of the playable characters sure you have those small moments where they interact but those are few and far between i also dont like the protagonist aspect in that the first character you pick must always be in your party i wish i would have known that initially finally some of the stories are hit and miss so far im almost done with all of the chapter 3s still octopath traveler is a really great game i dont like haanit i cant stand the way she speaks love this game however i love hollowknight more ive literally been waiting fot this oooo im so excited the graphics thats what this is all about first time watcher loved your review and it made me fall in love with a game i dont even have yet however i was about to close out until you said you were gonna stop yelling but then you proceeded to yell again awesome video i just had to keep turning down the volume keep up the enthusiasm man i played the demo and instantly took me back in time i loved it automatically i loved the demo and beat the 3 hours i then got my keys and drove to a gamestop and bought the full game cant be that great can it where can i find his twitch channel fantastic game really is but the stories are weak and the writing is terrible so much awkward boring text and speech thank the makers you can skip the start of everyones story because after 3 boring intros you will need to dont let it put you off though the gameplay imagery music is just phenomenol out of all the videos i watched yours was the one that made me purchase the game lol i know im going to break your heart but i really wish the graphics were different maybe more like zelda or xenoblade 2 would of been perfect i know u are in love with the game but thats just my opinion also going to wait for a price drop its a 84 in metacritic btw haanit was trying to save her master not her friend just saying cuz one of the main story beats is her talking about how zaanta is like a father to her until monster hunter generations ultimate comes out this game is great but dq 11 is much better and if your reaction is like this with octopath i cannot wait to see your reaction when you play dq 11 it looks like every other dime a dozen rpg on mobile and switch short answer yes yes it is lol i got the guys mum on him to stop harrasing the women using primroses allure i just came here to gush about octopath traveler i was not disappointed my pay is not enough yet tho damn you make it sound like every switch game is awesome while in fact you can get about 5 awesome ganes only and the rest are garbage i thought you werent that big on jrpgs guess it was just xenoblade huh x best buy has the game even special edition with gamers club you get discount play bravely default is better ps im really enjoying olberic thats who i played with the demo for three hours i ended up spending most of my time grindingp im buying a copy this tuesday god damnit youre passion for this game i totally dont want to buy has made me buy it i will never have time ill play it hopefully life will happen i will have to stop for a few days forget wtf i was doing wonder around get lost have no clue wtf im doing again realize i have to start over and then never play it again thanks thanks a lot seriously though thanks for the effort you put into this video you did a great job and really did sell me on this nintendo owes you i called tonys mom lol also i stole every kids candy in game lol i already plunked 60 plus hours into the game and i am only in week 2 of owning it i love this game as much as you do but funny enough hannits story was my far and away least favorite i found nothing interesting about it i started skipping the scenes in ch2 and ch3 for her but i was glued to everyone elses story i love this game theiron is my favouirte its so cool to being able to steel others stuff i love this game too but i think xenoblade is the best game for switch olberic the goat i think the voice acting is a little off but changed it to japanese voice and its was way better imo and the art designgraphic are just so nice am i the only one whos not in love with this game like most people its a good game but nothing omg its freaking awesome type of game imo also i skip the dialogues bcuz a lot of them are too long and boring favourite turnbased rpg huh better than chrono trigger for you i wholeheartedly agree imo i believe it is way better than botw i love the story and dialogue combat is amazing and strategic and the characters are just amazing my favorite is primrose at first i thought i would never even think of buying this game but since this review you have changed my opinion and i want to thank you for that as now you have interested me in a whole new genre of games that i never thought i would enjoy until now i love seeing sprites like this reminds me of breath of fire 3 and the early final fantasys great to see square back in the public eye with this one really takes it back to their glory days and its completely well deserved might cough i think its the best game created since idk when game got released i finally managed to get a copy yesterday tt ive went through 12game shop to finally found 1 that actually have a copy of it games meh the story doesnt intertwine as it should hi wood hawker honestly you just made me decide to really buy a switch and octopath traveler today after watching this when i am just thinking few minutes ago about this keep it up 900 notice for the purposes of this video four means three octopath is my second favorite switch game xenoblade being 1 dis game awful videogamedunkey this game is just so good only 6 hours in i thought this might be my favorite too it is actually yes ive spent more time within this game grinding and just exploring the world than any other switch game so far cyrus is my favorite but therion and primrose are tied for second such a good game i hear you man i love it too im new to turn based rpg and am playing the demo i suck at it i cant even beat the 1st bosses 1138 he hasnt even finished the game and is giving it a review ive put 20 hours into this game and i love it i started as tressa and like you would im regretting not getting the collectors edition meh lack of character interaction seems directly counteractive for this kind of game the characters involvmemt with each other make little to no sence and they dont even try to explain why they travel together at all it all feels super lazy buetiful art and music and ok combat tho xenoblade 2 absolutely destroys this game can i please have my bravely series back those characters felt like a family by the end end of the second game almost made me cry i love turned based rpgs especially old school ones i played the demo and didnt like it much it didnt grab me at all probably because i recently played south park tfbw and battle chasers can i play with just one character sorry your comments if full of hate and toxic people i was bouta pass on this game but now ive been convinced otherwise love how excited you are towards to the game i just bought it and i feel as thought im playing some kind of old fashioned final fantasy title im loving it so far and id definitely give it a 1010 as well worth the 60 i paid for it this game is soooooo good it was worth the wait i know its absolutely a stupid comment but thank you so much for lowering your voice in this video it made your emotion regarding this game seem much more genuine once you get two jobs per character the game really opens up im ready are you the more i play the more im absolutely falling for this game the soundtrack is the best ive heard on switch hands down one of the best of all time it sounds like you would die for the game so is the game any good who was your first character i chose based on the summaries given and tressa resonated with me so i chose her visuals are phenomenal music is grandly fitting everything else is either mostly ok or generically good or just cheese crapi know this is insensitive seeing how much u love the game but this is true for some or many this game reminds me of chrono trigger one of my favourite game im looking forward to playing it btw great review i really didnt enjoy the demo am i still guna like the full game 54 hours into it now i think its a little bit overrated the art and music are unbeatable but the gameplay and story shows its weak side i still play it anyway love the art the experience it is a really amazing game im going through ophilias story first i think the intent of the graphics and art style is meant to look like a pop up theater book i love the style though and music hated that the voice acting wasnt 100 for all the cutscenes drove me nuts and eventually i turned off the va after the 15 hour mark lol i dont like pixel art and have read many reviews and its not something i need right now might pick it up black friday or when theres a sale this game is top three of all time in my list its absolutely beautiful i cannot put it downwow game of the year i personally think xenoblade chronicles 2 is better than octopath this game is so good i hope there will be a sequel for octopath because it seriously deserves it you did a good square enix some quests have two different ways to finish it i beat the love stuck guy still didnt know what to do i ran around the town talking to everyone and fount the dudes mom used primrose to lead her to her son to stop it sux i was gonna say next to zelda but quite honestly i think it might be tied with botw for my favorite switch game sorry odyssey i love you too though enjoying this game a lot but ill say this everywhere i can we need war of the lions on switch remake or no i just want fft its hard for me to play this game and not think of that amazing story due to the graphical similarities i think im just gonna to videogamedunkey for my game reviews lol no i think its meh is this a good substitute for the lack of rpg paper mario games idk why it makes me feel weird about that when you fight almost every other enemy in the game looks bigger and cooler and you look small and normal tbh it doesnt bother me but i see material to joke on exept the kaiokensuper saiyansuper saiyan blue still though i played the prologue demo and i immediately fell in love so i really want to buy the game soon when ill be able too i picked haanit too in the demostill have to get the game definitely will i have a feeling that you like this game idk why tho best switch third party game for me anyone elses sleeping schedule got fvcked up bc of this game this looks exactly like bravely default gotta hit that 10m mark every fing video why am i watching this video i could be playing it right now lol this is what the lufia 2 remake should have played like i still think persona 5 is my favorite jrpg this one is a close second its my favorite game so far for the switch already put over 80 hours into it cause i cant put it down but zelda was so good too not even close baby it doesnt take 13 minites to say no lzbw is therion nice i just came from videogamedonkey know i dont know what to do but its not that good too bad ophelia is outclassed so hard i liked her a lot haanit was my first and its my favorite primrose is my second favorite this game my favorite on the switch so far as well i really like it but it honestly falls pretty short compared to xenoblade 2 combat is great but in most other aspects it feels under developed im really glad that this game was as good as it was hyped up to be definitely one of the best i like this channel youre enthusiastic and have charisma more so than other boring gaming channels glad i subbed recently top 5 definitely 2nd best maybe you clearly havent played jurassic pinball if you think so this is going to be the first game im going to get on the switch this games so stupid phenomenal its stupid now imagine if square enix brought chrono trigger back and gave it propper sequal in this style how cool would that be good review played the the demo i just cant get over the poor graphics quality for a game in 2018 i agree it needs a price drop ended up skipping most of the dialogue in the demo cause it was just long and boring i like this game i like this channel so i like this video btw did u get slapped in the face by your wife 4 spending more time w the game over her your cheek is super red my girlfriend loves your hair so do i damn it we both want you that game now according to dunkey its trash what does he know hes black sooooo did he like the game or not the writing is really not that good y o u r e x e l l e n c e y i beat that guy the first time and i thought i had done something wrong and i havent been able to solve that mathilda side quest until watching this video when i first got to the snow area i found myself stopping for 5 minutes and just stood still amazing game took my breath away game of the year i am so in love with this game too also thank you so much for not spoiling meanwhile my thought of the game were the same as dunkeys lol i liked the demo so i might get it its not perfect because hannit therion and opillia are in the game and also its too easy they need a difficulty setting botw is the best switch game out maybe mario is second best this isnt even in my top 5 sorry good game for being an rpg top 8 characters haanit therion ophelia olberic primrose alfyn cyrus tressa i like it a lot quality music and combat are through the roof i just wish they wouldve spent a bit more work on the story i need a switch now who won the octo giveaway xenoblade chronicles 2 breath of the wild mario odyssey octopath just my opinion its the best game ive played in a long time and i play a lot of games this game i just nutted on my joycon lol well idk if youve thought of playing the bravely default series but i actually like it a lot it has the same battle mechanics and is just as fun the art isnt nearly as great but man it was so fun none the less easily the best rpg game ive played so far maybe at the same level as ffvi best ff ever everything is just perfect and scores a perfect 1010 greetings from mxico i always watch your videos keep doing a great job this is a 60 game and people should support quality games like this more i read a comment saying it should be 3040 and it also made me realized how people are taking video games like this for granted its a really good game and preordered the wayfarers edition by only playing the first demo for what it seemed like 10 min but was way more top 3 games on the switch without a doubt first of course being breath of the wild second is this and third and third probably an unpopular opinion but mario and rabbids not counting ports this game was one of my most anticipated releases for 2018 and ive been been waiting to see your review of it before buying i cant wait to get my hands on it now same here been losing sleep since i got this game send help i really like the game my only real complaint were a few times in different story lines i knew what was going to happen because it was cliche it only happened 12 times i really hate that in games and movies but it wasnt enough to pull me out of the other stories i cant take this seriously after just watching videogamedunkey review its just to fresh in my mind ill just come back tomorrow d yours is fast becoming my favourite youtube channel just in case anyone down here has the game and doesnt know u can run by holding b took me a few hours to figure that out lol i went out and bought it because of you only twenty minutes in and i felt it was necessary to mention im hooked clearly i chose the wrong path on demo hello i m trying to start a youtube channel can you help me ps i love your videos you inspired me i dont get it this game looks boring and stupid great video im currently 14 hours into octopath and im also loving it i have tried to like this game but could not on the other hand i fell in love with xenoblade chronicles 2 two totally different kind of jrpgs and definetelly turn based is not for me wow so you can do the side quests all sorts of different ways apparently when i did the side quest he talks about at 330 i resolved it by guiding tonys mother to him she slapped some sense into him and told him to leave that girl alone so my quest ended with tony meekly following his mom home and mathilda making fun of him for being a wimp i never thought i would do this wood but i turned your video off cause spoilers best switch game ever so im about 7 or 8 hours through the game and so far the story does absolutely nothing for me but the music combat and art are beautiful i never enjoyed grinding so much before i knew something was missing in dunkeys review ive been really questioning him after that spla2n ruckus oh my god wow you love that game but please watch dunkeys video for a extreme contrast lmao 335 i just used ophilia to bring his mother to him and it also worked but this time he got scolded from his mother sorry for my bad english skills splatoon 2 or octopath theyre called boost points not battle points lol i couldnt agree more the game is beautifully designed from the music to the stories some people felt as if the stories are repetitive and boring i find it exciting and cant to find out more about the characters and please set the game voice to japanese itll save your soul from corroding from the horrible unbearable corny english voice cover that shouldnt ever exist on planet earth just an opinion coming from an anime biased otaku so no offense buddies thumbnail when wood looks up at rgt when he blows him i was the same with xenoblade chronicles 2 i bought the standard game and i loved it so much i just had to buy the special edition nice video im loving the game tooi just get stress whenever i try to grind sometimes but then again im like level 30 and havent touched no second chapter im still missing 2 characters and im 25 hours inxd so yeah its funbtw small correction its 3 bp to make 4 attacksnoticed that small mistake haanit cyrus and tressa are cemented in stone in my party i switch the last character out between the other 5 characters i hope they make a new suikoden game in this same style i know suikoden is owned by konami or a new breath of fire owned by capcom you look like a fool in your thumbnailis that what you were going for is this almost as good as anime 100 was not into this game before i tried it got bored and tried the demo at the end of the 3 hours i went out and bought the full game try it it might surprise you like it did for me lol and back to yelling at 123 i share your same excitement for this great game holy crap i actually beat him and his mother intervenes she brings him back home while he is whining this aspect makes me love the game even more primrose can easily be a ace with her elemental damage best thing about octopath traveler the startletter of each partymember eight chars in the right order octopath honestly after 20 hours i returned it happy for everyone who loves it but it felt like a chore every time i booted it up just didnt do it for me everything but the story was great i just couldnt get invested at all i hope they continue the series or style of this game but with a more involved story the sales and reviews almost guarantee well get another game like this from this company the inspiration for this game definitely came from 3d dot game heros bookworm adventures is the best game ever my favorite switch game will be mhgu once they let me play it i have already boughtdownloaded it put down the cocaine eh its okay coming from breath of the wild and witcher 3 it lacks in all things versus those two games i dont want to entirely compare the game is good on its own but one cant ignore what has existed before as for the writing its one of its best strengths and music is nice i know man i love it so much this gamescreams out nostalgia in the best way possibleits my favorite game for switch it may be worth spending 100000 chilean pesos for tge collectors edition i love this game too this is real jrpg go pleasure yourself master i totally agree with you wood i love this game and i just cant get enough of it i even stopped myself from playing it a bunch the other day just so i can extend the time i have to beat the game haah your opinion is quite accurate dear sir octopath is fucking amazing lmao i feel the same way i cant stop playing it its amazing i really wish i wouldve got the wayfarer edition when i had the choose between this game or captain toad i went for captain toad why cause when i played the demo of this game i wasnt really in to it but when i played the demo of captain toad i thought eeeek i need this game but im happy that people like this game but my fav switch game so far is super mario odyssey or captain toadagain no hate to people that like this game happy that u like it i bought this game release date and i told myself i would fight the gamestop employees if they didnt have a copy im so happy i bought this game and played the prologue and demo version cuz 60 is incredibly worth it for this game this game is definitely my favorite switch game as of right now you are so right the game is overwhelming 3 octopath is a great and wonderful game to the storyline that zelda botw lacked a bit the music and characters i only have the demo now but i cant wait to play it fully my only problem with it is when im adventuring the 3d 2d world map sometimes i bump into stuff and can be confusing but the combat makes up for it this would be a cool edition to the nintendo family and could definitely be made to outdo even botw important as it is now however it isnt but definitely one of the best games on the switch ive been playing so much this game that i forget to sleep or to eat hahaha i love the game but i wouldnt say the collectors edition is worth it to buy a second time theres hardly anything in there it might be my new favorite rpg the 8 stories and characters are so great and the over arching story is presented in such a smart way i was in the middle of cyrus story and they were about to reveal an ancient city and i audibly spoke hornburg before they said it i had subconsciously been putting the clues together while playing other characters stories looking forward to trying to complete a story with only one character the freedom of how you progress is super cool red dead redemption 2 will crush this pathetic nintendo trash game where can i get that long sleeve snes shirt from kek i want it but i dont have moneys tho as far as is it perfect trying to give scores to the closest percent is silly if its closer to 10 than to 95 go ahead and round it to 10 sorry dood hannit is my least favorite to each their own i suppose to be honest this genre of game i find really hard to keep me engaged which is the main reason holding me back from buying it every time i see clips of this game however i just get the biggest urge to buy it the art style and the general feel just calls to me idk if ill enjo it but ill give the demo a go and if i like it ill probs cave and pick it up you sold me on this game i went from being mildly interested to getting eager to play me too man me too interesting how vastly different your review is to the kotaku review the combat in this game is extremly complex you can do 3 skills and do 4000 damage but when u use them in the correct order on the right character you hit for 99999 6 times 180 hours in and still figuring out new combinations so much fun yes hank damn great video 10 out of 10 27 hours in i am still totally loving octopath traveler i hesitate to call it my favorite switch game until i beat it because of how much i was burned by bravely default but if it sticks the landing it will definitely be the best switch game i have played his favorite game but hes only lvl 10 lol is it a great game absolutely is it the best switch game close but not really ill be reviewing it sometime soon on my new site nintendoplayroomcom send me your extra copy and ill let you know what i think i cant afford it why is your face always patchy red high blood pressure alcohol i started as alfyn and thought the game was kinda cringe botw and hollow knight octopath omg that quest with the guy who kept asking the girl to marry him i completed it in a whole different way went to talk to the guys mom and then she came and scolded him right in front of his crush i did tony and mathildas side quest when i was around level 55 and unfortunately i was too strong for tony to beat me thankfully his mother is lurking nearby so i figured out to allure her to talk to him and solved the side quest that way how cool that there are multiple solutions i love how this game feels like the older final fantasies where it has that same love and care put into it we used to feel in which we actually cared what happened to these characters whats better is that it brings back the turn based combat which i feel is why ff has been hurting so much lately theyve put more focus on combat less on story and exploration in the last few games i feel like i would enjoy octopath traveler more than xenoblade chronicles 2 damn it man now ill have to play it wood you shouldnt give spoilers like that one 335 without any warnings i just downloaded the demo version last night and it was really good sad to say it was good for 3hours play only today i was thinking to buy it at store i really like it should i get a gtx 1060 i have a 1050 ti and a windows mixed reality headset or get a nintendo switch i wanted to give my 1050 ti to my brother is the only issue eh breath of the wild is my least fav game on switch right now it just does not feel like a zelda game to me i find myself not caring if i find hidden stuff because it just is a orb or a seed the old zelda games i was all about finding new stuff upgrade power glove hearts stam finding stuff is more fun than doing shrines so this game is the best rpg on switch to be honest octopath instantly became my favourite switch game from just playing the demo i absolutely loved it you might want to fight dunkey on this one thanks dude now i have to spend more money geez my wallet hates the switch for its incredible game lineup seriously though great review took me from a meh it looks cool ill probably play the demo and then decide to instead now holy that looks awesome i need it now i am just sorry that there isnt a huge story plot that make all the stories come together ive played a 20ish hours up to know and it feels like 8 minigames really nice but right know zelda is still unreacheable and xeno is debatable wait til 40 yeah youre waiting for 2 years lol hannit is my favorite its so hard to watch your channel without owning a switch so i bought one woops now i just need to pay someone to take my wii u be nice if you didnt yell all the time love the content style and cuts but i was so happy when you didnt have to shout actually waited a day cause i just didnt want to have to hear you shout really love the channel otherwise well it might be the best game of 2018 but still botw is best switch game i spend more than 300 hours playing it i love it especially that i grew up with this type of games like final fantasy series would love to see ff3 in this format great funny love the review wow this is the first time youve stopped yelling you should stop yelling all the time the opt giveaway has ended how do i know if i won or lost so you like the game p very boring gamei returned it never like turn based type of games botw fake final fantasy cyrus best boi and best glass cannon cyrus best boi and best glass cannon i sold my copy of breath of the after 25 hours of gameplay i couldnt take it anymore not for me octopath traveler i buy the game 3 times over best game on switch its in the league of p5 10 out of 10 is not perfect its outstanding amazing something thats really special about this game and i havent seen anyone else talk about it is how you have complete freedom over how you follow each characters story including the freedom to not unlock a character if you dont want to ive seen people complain about how their stories dont intersect but this is precisely why they dont intersect for example from the moment i started playing this game i wanted to use a threeperson party and thats it this is just a preference i have with turnbased rpgs i like threeperson parties and this game lets you do that so i did it definitely makes the game tougher but im close to wrapping up their chapters now at around level 55 for every character my plan is to then switch these characters out with three others but give them the advanced job classes which i havent unlocked yet but im working on it and play through their stories so this is my point you can play through every characters story simulta short answer yes it is no its hollow knight im ten hours in and enjoying myself but the writing is far from perfect hi i really like it when you dont yell so much and take it easy even for a moment your talking voice is really pleasant please use it a bit more haanit is also my absolute favourite this is indeed a super awesome game ha i did the same with the collectors edition i bought it normal love it so much went and bought collectors and gave normal one to a friend therion is the best imo i dont know how it happened but i was innocently browsing the internet this morning and poof ordered the collectors edition but the demo was fantastic and i fully agree about the soundtrack having amazing music really lifts the emotion of games to a new level the best games i have played all have stunning music scores from snake eater the last of us the witcher spent hours just roaming around skellige listening to the ambient music horizon god of war zelda and now octopath ps love your reviews 8510 for me 40 hours in allready and enjoyed it a lot however i feel it still has lots of rooms to improve mah man me and my brother share these sentiments and quick shoutouts to you also pickin haanit as your starter main too i just cant do random encounters maybe if it was an action rpg it would have been a great game ive been waiting for this game since way back in the original switch reveal event last january and it still didnt let me down anyone who thinks the game is overpriced because of sprites should play it for 5 minutes and theyll immediately shut up this game is gorgeous the lighting and effects are better than most 3d games i stop constantly to just take in the visuals and screenshot just as much as a nice looking open world game plus they playtime is massive this isnt some indy retro game its a aaa title from a major publisher its not even from squares offshoot tokyo rpg factory no its a proper square rpg id pay 80 for this game im wishing i picked up the collectors edition octopath is epic i messed up and bought ys vii when it came out on the switch i thought id switch to octopath once it came out but whoops im having too much fun with ys vii trying to finish it up so i can focus on octopath oh but then no mans sky updated totally is maman t r e s s a m a s t e r r a c e i think its funny because on the mathilda quest i just ran over to that guys mum and she ended up teaching him a lesson so my story went absolutely different because she ended up saying things like this girl is just simply not interessted in you get over it you just blew my mind because i didnt realize you could decide different paths during the sidequests wtf i love this game i do wish once you finish your main plot you can trade out you character cause then you can play it twice with each half your giveaway ended already i wanted to enter for my friend as i love this game and i want him tio enjoy it also i will cut you down i shouldve not bought kirby god damn nintendo with their 60 price tags octopath traveler is simply the most boring and painfully average rpg i think ive ever played if you can push past the charming visuals its absolutely a chrono trigger wannabe i ended up returning it you have such a passion while talking about stuff you like its inspiring final fantasy4 for ds is better i love the game so far if jrpgs are like this then i missed something for some reason this game always reminds me of skyrim just letting you know wood you made me go spend 60 last night to get this game and i thank you very much your review is fantastic and the best on youtube thank you sir haanit reminds me of aloy is it just me or does this game remind you a lot of golden sun 12 for the gba cuz it looks a lot like it and thats why i want to get this game cyrus and haanit are my favorites we definitely look for different things in games i find the storylines in octopath to be frustratingly hollow feeling because of the way your 7 other characters are all just silent except for the odd bit of weirdly stiff banter i can understand wanting to let us be super freeform but at a certain point it starts to feels sort of lonely also while i love 2d sprites i would have preferred hd 2d sprites ala the last few disgaea games it still has that same charm but i can actually tell wtf is going on it took me way too long to figure out that cyrus victory animation was a book i thought it was a pipe until i saw tressa do the same animation and tell me it was a notebook its still a great game i just think persona 5 is better jesus christ xd i love you man never change what your doing haha beatemups the big question did you set the voices to english or japanese yeah i preordered the collectors edition when this game was announced it reminds me a lot of bravely default on 3ds i want to play this game too cant afford nintendo switch beat em ups the giveaway is almost here i fell in love with the demo to bad its only for 3hrs i have heard such mixed reviews on this game nobody hates it but some people think it is good while others think it is the very best on the switch im struggling to figure out if i should get it or not great video but i couldnt concentrate on you why is another wii game in the xenoblade display every video ive seen you do you say you love it so which ones do you really like we have the same main team it might be my favorite switch game spams like button you know it is stop lyin xd i wouldve loved the limited ed but europe doesnt have the soundtrack in there in a game with a soundtrack that beautiful its a shame give us the full hour d i wanna hear everything i am so mad that i did not no this game says session is full alright color me intrigued i may just get this when i finally get around to buying my switch i started with olberic about 35h into the game and i agree one of the best switch games to date d best switch game behave not worth 60 dollars so ill pass its just on number 10 in my top 10 i still think botw and odyssey are still much better i picked up the game on day one without a doubt octopath is not my type of game octopath traveler is way too overrated the graphics are bad and it is all a walking simulator will you give away a code for the game or a physical copy the best switch game is donkey kong quick answer no if give it a 10 put of 10 also but there is something i would fix the map is not a very good indicator of location at all and it really needs to be reworked im sure it wont be but i just feel like it could have been executed better you have been sooo loud in the latest videos wood keep it down a little you cheater what about zelda im in the same condition pal the game its just so good this for me is tied with botw as my favourite switch game octopath is one of those rare titles fully worth its asking price if you love classic jrpgs dont be cheap support this release if you are financially able to im sure i will play it eventually this and mario are my two exclusives i want for the switch once there are 4 or 5 must play exclusives i will spring for the system i bought this game for its visual art style and clever combat system however the stories are well made up and they actually have deeper meanings that hit you right in you dont see those in a lot of good games im still very early in the game by just having 3 companions so lets see where my journey takes me with this game it might not become one of the top favorites but definitely its a pleasure to play this nonetheless omg when are we going to hear the end of this game my brother game me a long lecture about spending so much money for a quote snes graphics game that hurt but its his loss i guess lol it must be great i cant wait to buy it i wasnt to sold on the game at first but after seeing your review of this game i have gone out and bought the collectors edition from a nearby game store and so far im loving it as much as you really great review on the game love your videos honestly would love to hear you talk more about octopath that game is absolutely breathtaking i wanna see time played i dont have patience for sidescrolling turnbased rpgs im sorry but i totally get what youre feeling man great video linde the snow leopard is a lady leopard i really wish i could make my mind about this game i want to try it out but i dont know if this is for me i felt the price was to high first as welln thought it was just another 16 bit cash inbut when i heard all the first day praise n how it was selling out i went to get it at eb games all locations were sold out i wanted it even more thanwent to walmart had 2 copys leftthe game is soamazing and so worth the price and the music is awesome for sure im 22 hrs in and loving it xenoblade 2 is the best imo good story interesting world to explore good characters and fun action rpg gameplay i dont think any switch game has all of those things in one package like xenoblade 2 i love this game and its right up there with final fantasy 6 and chrono trigger im excited for more jrpgs from square and i think this will all but guarantee that nintendo will finally do something with the mother series clearly the demand is there i reaaaaally need a switch now for this and so many other games this game looks amazing i see your points and i see dunkeys points as well im so damn torn on getting this game ive gotten 40 hours into it and ive forgotten i had other games lol i wish i couldve gotten the collectors edition but it was sold out i got the cards and sticker set anyways so that was cool 3 one thing i would absolutely change would be the cut scenes the writing is very good but the cut scenes are often too long and too static im not dating they should be animated or anything crazy but i would have preferred too see some more life and animation in the cut scenes instead of sprites standing still you said octopath is your favorite or second favorite turn based rpg so now i gotta ask what your favorite turn based rpg would be marmots have an attack called these nuts fun little tidbit about the game olberic cyrus tressa ophilia primrose alfyn therion hannit now what does the first letter of each of the main characters name spell out i wish i could get into turned based rpgs ive just never been able to these types of game are not something i usually like i tend to get bored but youve convinced me to give it a shot really enjoyed the video im very on the fence about this one but you may have sold me on it i dont think it will surpass hollow knight for me though which is quickly become my goty for 2018 on the switch im also really loving this game btw is someone else thinking that the game is pretty blurry in handheld mode nintendo pays very well woah 430 i beat that side quest in a different way i found like his parent or something and guided them to him then they told him to stop messing with that girl i didnt know there were different ways to complete quests imagine a breath of fire game like this for the switch its no knack 2 baby the visuals and gameplay are amazing i love jrpgs so i might be biased havent had this much fun since final fantasy tactics for gba ya its that good to answer the title god no this game while fun has some pretty big flaws im not hating but its not the best switch game by any meansthis comment was before the video this game makes me sad writing is so unbelievably generic every character is sappy predictable and a stereotype no character interaction makes the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy the game much too high characters dont use their unique skills to help each other or even talk to each other except in little sequences in which they say stuff that doesnt develop character or story haanits accent is really annoying to read combat is amazing and i was instantly in love with it 7 characters later and its still exactly the same but the game is now much easier ive gotten bored of the system already and i didnt enjoy bullying bosses like haanits which didnt have any small enemies to back it up after completing all the chapter 1s and exploring areas that were near my level my highest level character was 16 the lowest level requirement for a chapter 2 is 21 grinding was never a requirement in the old jrpgs that this game was based on like chrono trigg the story the story the story haanit is my main character and then i picked up ophelia their stories are just great so far i have roughly 6 hours in picked up the scholar andi can see easily 100 hours of pure enjoyment for me in store with octopath another terrific recommendation wood i have octopath too but the problem for me is i got shining resonance right before octopath so im taking my time with shining resonance refrain first but all that aside i played the first im calling it the beta cause i cant remember the name for it version where sqaure enix asks for your input for what could make the game better and mmmm my friend it was already a great game and then when the game released i played just a little bit cause im saving the rest of the game for when i got free time to enjoy every aspect of it the game was sooooo much better than the first version so im very glad to see that you enjoy it as much as me d how many paths are in this game eight it would be interesting if nintendo remade old snes games in a similar graphics style as octopath traveler although i dont know if it would work with games with a different camera angle bugs me to see an australian deliberately use american accents to say things you should of lured the guy trying to get married he was a beast unless hes only good if future wifey is looking i honestly dont like this game am i wierd i think this will be a huge deal ifwhen they release the game on other platforms team therion you should try and review megaman x collection d think we could see a tour of the room sometime beatemups can you remember when this channel was so awesome uploading retro gaming content lol he called boost points battle points and gamexplain called them bonus points wtf stop it with this review you make me want to really want a switch i cant even afford the game let alone the console did this guy just put this game above breath of the wild o i would actually prefer ff7 to be remade to look like this it would fit perfectly this is why 3rd party matters it gets me so angry when i hear fanboys say the real reason you get a nintendo console is for the first party and the third party is just a small bonus to fill the time between the release of the real games aka nintendo games nintendo almost ruined themselves with that crappy thinking if you have a console the goal is to play great games the developer doesnt matter at all yes a dev could have a good track record which increases the likelihood that youll like their games but that doesnt mean everything that dev make will be a 10 out of 10 and everything thats not made by them is a 9 out of 10 tops thats stupid thinking just enjoy the best games regardless of who made it man im so happy for you that you found one of your favourite games for the switch its also one of my favourite games dont listen to the haters that do not and will never understand how wonderful it is that we all have different opinions i could not agree more i have just played the demo loaded up my gf profile and played the demo because i maxed out the 3 hour demo limit twice and i cannot wait to buy this game im only waiting for payday i dont understand any of the story or writing criticism personally i find it extremely compelling and i can only guess that the disconnect is between a lack of love of the art style versus a top notch wellwritten story being not something we traditionally have seen i wasnt interested in it whatsoever so i played the 3 hours of the demo and knew by then that i had to get this game since then i cannot put this down i occasionally just go to an town and afk while on my phone having the towns bgm play lol you do shout talk a lot its quite a bit to take in tbh i played for a while and instantly i wished i hadnt spent my money i really want to return it to gamestop but the problem is a want to keep it just to have it i mean i guess its good people like it but dang im gonna try to make my school orchestra to play the main theme you looked great in the new aquaman trailer hey buddy great review i am so hyped to finally really dig into the game d i want it so bad i cant afford it yet but i love square enix kh and ff are 2 of my top favorite games this guy loves breath of the wild so ill take his word for it im getting it as soon as i could afford it if i liked earthbound would i like this game just dont want to waste 60 because i dont have much money right now the big thing that i really hate about this game is how you cant swap out your firstmain character spent 7 hours into the game as the huntress and i couldnt find a permanent spot for her in my party sadly planning to start over as a different character must buy now reads title me damn straight love this game everything about this game has me going this is perfectyes this is how the talent system should be designed yes this is how this should work dumb question are there summons in any way love how the description has you saying it may be your favorite switch game following by if its worth buying or not hahaha love you wood keep doing what you are doing why does everyone compare it to final fantasy it is more saga frontier like justice has been served i havent played octopath traveler yet but i do plan on it currently my favorite rpg is earthbound but the way you are hyping this game up i wonder if thatll change the 2 contestant for retarded thumbnail 2018wood and rgt 85 hahahaha i really love this game but i have a complaint about the bosses they are far too long and meticulous especially later in the game i spent about 40 minutes fighting orlick from therions path i then ended up dying because he summoned a guardian it made me really not want to fight him again but thats my only real complaint about this game i dont understand it being 60 though especially for a game like this i would probably rather buy ys vii honestly unless this is somehow better for full retail price you sent yourself a death threat you need to apologize before you die not from me im just warning you because zelda and mario fans are going to kill you wood thank you so much bc of this video i went on amazon and just picked up wayfarers edition they just so happen to have some in stock today so with my 25 dollar amazon gift card i got it for 8999 so wood i thank you so much my friend this is way these videos are great did the developers pay you more for this review than the developers who paid you for your last two videos no its a glorified iphone game its basically stardew valley with a tilt focus filter no it isnt character interaction is lacking hardcore and could have been handled much better lvl 1 monsters take a couple of minutes i love my speakers so freaking much that i just blew them out at the beginning of yet another beatemups videolol not really but im glad you acknowledged that tookeep up the switch videos i agree i got this game i was kinda looking forward to it for a while but yeah its pretty good i like the story plus i like the design of the visuals its pretty unique so yeah its a very good game id rather play adventure time game on my switch than this trash i love this games graphics but cant get into the story imagine a remastered pokemon crystal or red blue in these graphics octopath is trash excitement like this is probably the best reward a game dev can get i love that video games can inspire this sort of reaction in us awsome video i had to run away from that fight you were talking about because my guy was to powerfull at that time also awsome find on their first letter of their names i didnt even pick up on that till watching your video for me no doubt this is my game of the year so far youre so silly undertale is obviously the best game on the switch i literally have the same team as him just backwards i even use the music for firing me up when doing my experiment in the lab lol i have the game i got it on the day it came out here in the states and i still have yet to play the game only because zelda and captain toad have been the only games i have been wanting to play on my switch the most especially zelda i have been really addicted to game since getting it last year for my wii u and out of all the switch games i have so far zelda still remains my number 1 favorite switch game but hopefully tomorrow i will definitely start playing octopath since i really do love the game i did play the demo version of the game so i do definitely agree with woods love for the game octopath made me interested in jrpgs anyone have any recommendations that are as great as octopath i have all 3 current gen systems i am also one of those ppl that do not usually buy games for 60 its not that i believe that this game isnt worth 60 i just cant buy every game i want at launch to satisfy my own curiosity i finally decided to try out the demo i am now questioning my budget and my purchasing logic because of this game lol i am conflicted and i blame haanit primrose olberic and especially ophelia i was cheering for her when she made the decision and her motivations make perfect sense i cant wait to experience the other characters idk how long ill be able to wait for a price drop my mind says that this game actually deserves the 60 price tag but i have been fooled before its usually not a problem for me but i may end up cracking under the pressure while waiting this time if i wait long enough and the drop doesnt come i will kick myself for not boarding the hype train with everyone else i hate dilemmas is there a reason to wait for a price drop i just started the demo i didnt think that id enjoy it much coz im not a jrpg guy but holy crap this game is crazy good suuuure do hope i win that code so i can continue playing d best review ever brother i love this game pay full price and i feel like i got t for free its an amazing game you need to work on your thumb nails they are hella cringey and make me not wanna click on the videos when you said bring it all the way down my phone went into night mode and i thought for a second that you had some mystical power over my phone is this sponsored it has definitelly become my favourite switch game so far i fucking love it havent been inmersed in a game for decades until this gem apeared in my life this this is a gddamn masterpiece this is a game made passion and love kinda takes me back to my childhood omg stop with all the switch stuff talk about other stuff but switch im close to unsubscribing its not even a joke switch is great but there more then just switch i think xenoblade chrons 2 was better i want to play this game so badly it looks amazing i love your channel btw i subbed to your youtube and instagram the snow the sand the reflection off the water jeez someone introduce this guy to final fantasy im 6 hours in and started with the same main character do i dare say that this game rivals chrono trigger its awesome i wasnt really sure if i wanted to even get this game im still trying to power through xenoblade and ys i work two jobs have a toddler and working on my masters so my time is limited your passion for the games is the reason i decide to make the purchase i look forward to playing this one literally agree with every point you made this game is perfect its so much energy to say all the great qualitys of this game now i can just say i agree with wood thank you im in the same boat as you are woods i am thoroughly enjoying it definitely top two switch games i lie to myself that its good because i spent 60 on it i restart the game with different characters to entice myself again and i just cant at least i tried during the wimpy boy sidequest i brought his mom to him during his pestering the woman making him to be scolded and never to bother the woman again hahahah i never knew theres more than 1 way to solve quests yes it is theres no argument either that grandma in the town of therions chapter 2 was powerful 040 you mean octopath budum tss the answer is no its just a boring jrpg with boring generic characters and a stupid turn based battle system that is a bore to play not to mention the random encounters which make you battle when the battle system is a bore love the review and im in the same place with this game im 30 hours in and the experience has been one of the best ive had on the switch octopath traveler is perfect and i agree this is our opinion ive been playing it for 50 hours now i think its a good game nice grafic nice battle system for what concern the stories i found them very similar different characters involved but the mechanic of the stories are almost the same from the second chapters i already knew who was the boss at the end really good game though im enjoying it a lot but nothing compared with old final fantasy games the idea of 8 stories is great but maybe theres something missing however primrose storys the best i finished the demo and want to buy it but i dont want the digital version it looks amazing thinking about buying a switch just so i can play it good job wood you give such great reveiws ill answer the titleno gotta say this is the best octopath traveler review ive seen and ive seen many im loving the game too work of art i need to get to a gamestop alrdy it looks like deluxe editions are back in stock on amazon no sadly i am looking forward to more xenoblade though p cant say i dont like the game but from the demo thats been out i thought the game was way to slow i mean how the run feels like a walk and how the first basic enemy in the demo takes about 5 minutes to kill eat your heart out sony this game is perfect the music so much so that i cant play consistently without stopping for like 10 minutes every time i hit a new area love your videos but why are you always yelling lol im officially hyped no great game but not the best i absolutely love this game and i agree with all your points with that being said i really hope we could get a golden sun remake i agree with you octopath traveler is a truly great game thanks for the spoiler alert ya dildo i know im not gonna win but i had octopath pre ordered and then had to cancel it to meet my bills and even now i cant afford to get it i hope i win 3 how does this compare to final fantasy like if this was an ff game where would you rank it compared to the others i agree im so obsessed does this mean i should redownload the demo and try to get into it why not mention the bravely series from the nintendo 3ds basically why this game is so amazing if you havent played the bravely games i recommend you do i even read all i mean all the interogations and inquires lol 1010 wtf how can you not giving it an 88 its a 88 game my favorite switch game is hollow knight octopath traveler is beautiful game and i do enjoy the game play and music however breath of the wild is imho the best nintendo switch game presently available i didnt really care about it but after watching this i want it dhjddhdjhdjdh no though im also suffering from jrpg fatigue and octopath didnt catch me from the beginning octopath traveler isnt even the best nintendo switch rpg i loved octopath traveler just like cyrus octopath is best after playing 20 minutes of the demo i can firmly say the combat actually ruins it for me and i stopped playing even though i like primroses story and the storyline i need to finish zelda first before jumping into this i got a friend telling me constantly that i gotta get it i was watching your live on instagram before watching this this was your best review yet i think ima buy it when its around 20 or 30 bucks i really like its art style and its storytelling but actually i dont know whether it will catch me like it did with wood i totally agree with you i have been gushing about it since i got the wayfarers edition on release date can you release the full uncut hour of video as its own video id love to hear you ramble about it ah see thats cool how the quests can have different solutions with tony i defeated him first but nothing happened then i guided his mother to him and she scolded the heck outta him and there wasnt really a happy ending thanks for pointing out the characters correspondence to the letters in the title i had not noticed woodford stop i cant afford all these games you recommend the dialogue was way to cringy for me guess im gonna have to get it really wanna play this game but unfortunately cant afford to get it right now you wouldnt by change be giving away your other copy lol did you try syberia or another click point adventure i need a game like day of the tentacle its great that you love octopath traveler but i have to disagree me personally i dont like this game i like the artistic style i like the world theyve made what i dont like is the combat and the visuals inside the battles i get that this is the kind of style to go with for a turnbased rpg but when i played the demo i didnt find myself enjoying it maybe i dont like turnbased rpgs or maybe it was just something with the battlescreen that made it so unappealing for me but hey if there are people who like what they see theyre welcome to go get it i like the name i like the meaning behind it but its just not for me decided to post the comment just give my opinion on the game youre welcome to love the game just ignore my dislike about the game music is definitely top tier in this game not gonna lie though i totally miss the first battle theme in later areas it might be my favorite switch game if you like this give final fantasy 6 and chrono trigger a try i cant stand the visual style of this game i would play it otherwise but just looking at it gives me a headache freaking love your reviews you always make me buy games you should be working at nintendo as an advertiser looking at this game makes me want to spend a few hundred more hours playing ff6 again 40 seconds in and ive never heard so many voicecracks in a row before i agree tho so meny switch games yet to be playedhad to sell my switch for reasons plan on getting one in october cant wait ive been wanting to play this game but saving up for the right time to play it it looks like it will be a favorite of mine as well and this review solidifies it thanks no angles of death is the best switch game ever honestly i think the writing in this game is horrible then again i played cyrus overall its a solid 810 great review ive sunk so many hours into the game because the character stories just make me want to play more always love your energy you spoiled a little bit of story two of the characters beginning story for me but i still enjoyed the video my only complaint is that the game is a little easy maybe its because ive put 100s of hours into pokemon and persona so exploiting enemy weaknesses comes pretty naturally to me still its probably my 2nd favourite rpg on switch and its currently 1 in terms of the number of screenshots ive taken one thing thats amazing to me is that the dude who composed the music for this game this is his first composer credit oo i have the game but my switch broke down a day later its fantastic hollow knight and xenoblade chronicles 2 are my personal favourites on the switch the funny part is its not even that good your excellency help me im 55 hours in and i cant stop at least with the other games ive played have been on console so i cant take it anywhere but the switch is portable and its already closing in on my time on botw get me out of this rabbit whole ehhhhhhhh i thought turn based would bore mei cant put this game down i love octopath traveler i just completed the first chapter of every characternow to grind a bit for ch2 of tressas story alsoi would kill for a final fantasy 6 remake with hd 2d graphics like this my mind immediately went to that the first time i ever saw the art style do you have a full time job video game dunkey sums up how i feel about this game such an overhyped game dude omg i just realized that the quest you did where the guy defeats you and marries the girl i did it different and instead i brought tonys mother and she scolded him and demanded that he stops embarass himself and never ask her hand in marriage again and so mathilda lived in peace alone i know im evil i knew nothing of this game except as to what i know now after watching this video then i bought the game thank you for the great review i knew nothing of this game except as to what i know now after watching this video then i bought the game thank you for the great review my favorite character is primrose just kidding i dont even own the game haanit was my pick too i love her this game is awful im dying to buy this gamebut down where i live it costs 320000 pesos or a little less than 100 dollars so ill really have to wait for the price to go down i agree 30 hours in and i think i am saying this is second best switch game on the system after zelda and i beat mario twice this is the best square game in over a decade i loved ff xii but i think this beats this buy this game if you like old school jrpgs or not it doesnt matter this is just fantastic still loving this i agree the writing and voice acting in this game is fantastic im loving every minute of this game myself i loved this vid so much i dont wanna watch it cause its gonna end i still am tho no is not the best you mean 2nd favorite turn based rpg after pokemon lol its one of the best the hype of the moment youre forgetting xenoblade breath of the wild and super mario odyssey which all has its own accolades the same way metroid prime 4 will be all the hype in 2019 wood i love this game so much im getting a tattoo of primrose on my left forearm when a reviewer doesnt give octopath a 1010 me let us fight with honor link is crying i can feel it i saw it on the shelves but im waiting for a price drop not because i think the game is not worth 60 but because im poor so i downloaded the demo and started playing it and the prologue was so long and i just found my self bored and at first i didnt like the fighting or graphics and played the demo for like 40 mins and just didnt play it for weeks but i decided to continue playing it while watching your video and now its really growing on me like alot i really like therion also i played the first demo for this game and was so bored by the story that by the time i finished it i had my fill of the game forever when you 5 charter how do i put one in the part and take the othere on out i have my issues with square enix but when they do good they do great you legit made me want to buy this game but ill wait to see if i win it sooo i should buy this art style and gameplay will always trump visuals sure you might hook some casual people the first time around with a beautiful looking game but that sequel flop if the gameplay and arts style suck well dunkey says it bad so your wrong your excellency lmao can everyone help me get this message to wood i was at boy scout camp doing the game design merit badge we had a special guest an ea game tester i asked a few questions do you think it was okay to spend 2 minutes on an mobile game during your e3 press confrence answer the game is not even close to finished most of the footage is very well stitched together clips of anamation didnt even answer my question and i also asked the question we all needed are you making an fifa 19 battle royale answer umm makes the lips shut hand emote iluminati confirmed lets make wood get this man i realized how much i love your channel as you were speaking about octopatn traveler this is your favorite switch game you are my favorite youtube you find the music charming and exciting i find you charming and inspiring you put octopaths music on the adventure time game i put your videos when im working dude seriously youre amazing and you make me happy every time i cant tell another channel that i watch every single video thanks for making my day again it really helps when im depressed or a bit down edit latino typos botw is still the best switch game but octopath is great it gives me so many golden sun vibes but i do wish the individual stories were interconnected somehow its an okay game but it is ridiculous to prefer it over botw at least in my opinion oh and i still think that heroes of m m 3 has the best turn based combat music the developers said they were inspired by ff6 it sounds like hannit is a combination of edgar shadow gau i love rpgs and so i very much love octopath i was waiting for you to review this game i am excited to play more ok the matilda side quest i did it differently i realized how strong he was and intended to come back when i was stronger then found the guys mother guided the mother to the guy and well theres replay value if i dont tell you i wish i had a switch to play octopath update i finally bought it 250 bucks need to buy games tho i wasnt planning on buying this game but you definitely sold me on this game i probably wont have time to play this game until like january but im looking forward to picking this up now thanks for the detailed review therion is second classed as scholarop spells olberic merchant donate bp to therion because of his final skill it normally deals over 9999 alfyn clericdancer depends on if i need jp and exp or health cyrus is thief sp and hp thief so i dont die or tun out of sp thats my team what do you think wood agree i love this game very much the music the graphics the story yes the game is boring i feel the same way this is the perfect game for handheld mode hey at the end of your video why do you do the dance in fortnite just kidding ive been subscribed long enough to know better i would have this game if it was in stock octopath is amazing i have a lot of time and i am addicted to it i cant stop playing it therion is my favorite its easily my favorite theres no words for octopath its just perfect i want this game so fucking bad gonna pick it up next month hopefully ive been on the fence on buying this game the story seems alright and i love the art style its really been the turn based battles and the random encounters that turn me offi get enough of that with pokemon i did enjoy your review though hannit whit warrior ophelia whit boticary treesa whit dancer en cyrus i dont know hay what other job get xd its my 2 game as good as octopath is i still have to give 1 to zelda mariorabbids is a close 3 in no way i would take the merit to octopath its such an awsome game and i also love it but i loved the bravly saga for the 3ds too those are the begginigs to this master piece and no one is talking about it i would love to hear what you have to say about it and dont forget that this kind of battle the saving points to enpower the next attack battle system was implemented in the bravly default game an also they are the same developers so please man if you havent played bravly default im sure you have i highly recomend it keep up the excellent job i love your revews greeting from mxico sorry for the bad english do you believe that a nonjrpg gamer could enjoy this game the closest ive played has been xcom and played that for months funny that just a couple of months ago people said that switch doesnt have system seller after zelda and mario release and then boom came this bad boy out of nowhere its a good time to have a switch fellas boost pointstheyre called boost points i absolutely love this game please upload the rest of the hour for those of us with some attention span left i want to hear more this was a great review how you feel about galaxyz cause i really like that game normally i agree with you but come on this mediocre game isnt nearly on the same level as xenoblade chronicles 2 oh i understand the gravity yesss the beatumups review of octopath ive been waiting i love your pronunciation almost all wrong but somehow fantastic great vid i cant say its the best switch game since thats subjective but i will say that i had my switch since release day and octopath is the 1st game im actually playing all the way through on it i tampered with i am setsuna others but nothing hooked me like this for hours hours now this is also because my backlog is huge like years long but as of now octopath is my favorite switch game ive been putting off breath of the wild cause i hate breaking weapons i feel three out of the eight stories are good some are just down right dull and i skipped the cut scene completely i saw the price and i wasnt convinced i am now love rpgs but i thought full price was too much x and zero are gonna have to wait i love this game and i can tell that you do too i actually got my switch for christmas almost purely for this game knowing that it wasnt coming out for a while so i got mario and zelda beat both of those put down my switch and honestly kinda forgot i even had it then i happen to walk into gamestop the night before this came out and they asked me if i wanted to preorder it so i did and started playing it the next day and havnt looked back this is the game i forgot i needed in my life and now that im playing it i feel bad for forgetting about it defiantly my favorite switch game its only the 3rd switch game ive played but its also the best recent rpg ive played in a long time and probably in my top 5 rpgs ive ever played nailed it if its a good rpg it will sell i dont even like rpg usually and my friend who is obsessed with the game told me to try their demo before making any judgment right after i finish the demo i purchased the game lol and there i was reluctantly buying a switch because i have a lot in my vita queue and new 23dss then this pearl came up and gosh had to get me a switch to be able to play this now i have a switch and one only game for it the game sucks getting octopath in the mail tomorrow so stoked great review my top 5 1 xenoblade 2 2 mario odyssey 3 legend of zelda breath of the wild 4 octopath traveler 5splatoon 2 mario n rabbits 1 botw 2 la noire 3 octopath traveller 4 doom 5 oddysey or splatoon 2 wood thank you i was unsure if i really wanted this game but after watching your review im going to get octopath tomorrow thank you so much its not lol but is def top 5 i decided i wanted to start a gaming channel and this was my first game i picked up since making the decision i have to agree i freaking love it octopath traveler is an amazing game and i havent even beaten it yet i definitely messed up and didnt get the wayfarers editioni hope to get that in the future i broke up my characters into 2 groups of 4 so i can get a very different experience on my replay my favorite character right now is hannit as well i love the archer type players in most games followed by sneaky types so therion is going to be my main character in my next play through thanks for your vids wood as an old school gamer who grew up to these turn based games i love this game i do wish there was greater party dialogue and interaction like say baldurs gate or dragon age origins i bought this game without hesitation special edition one of my favourite games of alltime is bravely default for the 3ds and it gave me very similar vibes i started the game and holy balls was i not disappointed it is stunning anyone who thinks that the pixel art style is lazy needs to look at the detail and the way its crafted its a masterpiece the combat system is fluid works really well and is alot of fun im a massive sucker for turnbased rpgs so i was sold instantly but it feels so rewarding the characters i find so defined the storylines work really well for each character it fits them perfectly and really feels right their skills abilities weapons the way they fight its all planned out beautifully i couldnt recommend this game enough to anyone who likes turn based combat rpgs epic quests and rewarding stories the only thing i would change is personally i wish the whole party was changeable i picked my first character therion at random and hes i actually did the same thing as you with the wayfarers edition after being hooked on this game and loving it so much i had to get it this game is a masterpiece the combat alone is addictive the game itself is pure art i wish i could play too i cant find the game to buy around here nintendo whyyy tt that thumbnail likes haanit doesnt know linde is female me wtf edit linde is the snow leopard with a ribbon btw wood is cheating on botw everyone interesting how people either love or hate it there doesnt seem tobe anything in between i think personally my favorite turn based rpg is persona 5 and i wanna get this game so bad and ive heard so many good things about this game but like you said in the review someone said about the graphics i know im gonna get attack for this but it just looks so boring besides the beautiful art work and im a sucker for soundtracks but i dont know i wanna get it though is this game like dragon quest 9 its my favorite switch game besides zelda botw no it is not absolutely loving the game so far and you definitely did it justice fun fact i got xenoblade chron 2 and had a similar experience with that game like you did well i traded that game in and used the money towards octopath and i feel like i finally have the rpg game i wanted on switch please make more octopath vids dude what happens if you defeat tony wow nice review octopath is now must buy title for methis game visualy remind me of mixture betwen breath of fire and chrono triger will this fill the hole in my chest until i can play dragon quest xi usually i have the same opinion as you but on this game im more of on the side of dunkey review please make videos where you dont scream its practically asmr the music was so good it made me go to the square enix cafe and pick up a copy of the soundtrack the same day it released i think its my favorite game on switch i usually am not super into turn based rpgs but this is definitely special im 16 hrs in i think i will be playing this game over and over i played the demo and loved it ordered it yesterday hopefully it arrives before the weekend so fun deserved justice wasnt even into rpgs before octopath came along cant put it down id watch the full uncut review it would be an hour well spent so glad to see this review this is easily one of my top 3 games of all time and i really enjoyed you talking about it side note i finished the 430 quest by guiding his mother and she scolded him and made him give up i didnt know you could actually get them to fall in love by challenging him thats really cool no it absolutely isnt its a really good game but far from the best really can i have your old copy a game without music can never be called a good game i like your videos but please just speak normally linde is a snow leopard and its a she reeeeeee nice review its always good to hear someone enthusiastic about a game i didnt think much of the game when i saw the initial trailer but now after sinking a lot of hours into the game i might just be a little obsessed i tried the demo its not for me i appreciate it a lot but i rather play shovel knight than ot and ive never played shovel knight i wish both bloodstained and the mummy remastered had more to offer but im saving my money for super smash bros times are tough lol oh man you would love bravely default and bravely second i love this game so much the dialogue characters side stories music and battles always had me wanting more the way the game looks just got me so excited to keep going i love everything about this game i stray off the path in every rpg i play so this game is perfect for me cuz i dont have to stay on one path i just keep going i love the way the game looks i havent gotten bored of it at all youre review was amazing thank you for sharing your unbridled joy paired with clear examples and explanation has convinced me that this game is fully worth 60 more than anything else or anyone else thanks for the review i cant wait till i can afford this game haha i have to play it its art style alone is worth the money the storywriting is perfect your excellency i think not its a great game but i cant say that i love this aspect so i was looking for a game formy 3 week trip to italy but wasnt quite sure about this until now hopfully i am able to pick this up amywhere i hope this game get nominated for game of the year at least imo its the best so far but doubt it would beat god of war because of it being a jrpg its my worst game thumbnail of the year finally a good review who makes justice for the game i guess only this game is for some people and im glad you are one of them im 50 hours in and love every sec of it i love tressa and primrose both of their storys are great i would agree octopath traveler is one of the best games ive ever played you dont have to keep shouting its okay its okay ive been waiting for this ever since you teased seriously is the best switch game to date right now the only thing i would change is a bit of explanation of what which stat does some make sense but other for example speed i have no idea what speed does but thats a minor of a minor problem the game is fing great octopath is nintendos answer to persona 5 lets see what microsoft has in store i didnt know if i wanted this game but after this i am no doubt gonna buy it im conflicted from his review and dunkeys not worth the 60 it has 100 hrs of game play with just the store alone im in canada sooo i have to pay 80 and well thats another story ive been thinking about picking this one up but im concerned about whether ill be able to get into it as someone who has never played a jrpg is this one friendly to newcomers of the genre completely agree man i was iffy on buying this even though i enjoyed the demos got the last copy at my local target and havent left my switch yet wow after seeing this video i want this game just for the story but as a person whos not too into jrpgs i mean ive enjoyed stuff like the south park games lisa and west of loathing but those are all western would i enjoy this game ive gone through the game and its amazing the effort and work they put into this i didnt stop playing it for a few days wish i had a hard copy since i buy stuff digitalbut nice review on it been waiting for you to make this one is the story very difficult to understand i dont speak english that well so i want to know if its worth buying even if you dont get what each word means perfectly literally take your breath away you do the definition of literally rightbut yeah game is 1010 why are you yelling great game love it haha just completed it this morning took 82 hrs and thats only the main story i avoided the side stories intentionally so ill have something to do once completed as i always do i wouldnt say its my favourite game but its definitely in my top 4 switch games its not the best switch game because this game doesnt sell consoles for me a game can only be considered the best game on the console if its a reason why someone went out and bought a console this game wont ever do that like mario and zelda did great game not the best game on switch epic game i finish octopath traveler really worth it turn off shadowed edges i love octopath im about level 50 with all characters i picked therion to start and was so happy with my choice being able to add a second job to each character is such a cool concept as well that i legitimately like playing with every character it gets tediousboring but every time i set it down for awhile i cant wait to jump back in sad its almost over love your enthusiasm this game is currently everything to me as well love the art style the strategic gameplay and the stories 3 im glad your review really reflected everything great about this game omg yes please stop yelling i see this game blatantly ripped off the battle point system from bravely default i really like the gameplay but the stories are a bit weak to mei really thought that the 8 characters would experience one huge epic story and not eight lukewarm to pretty good ones i love your channel but video game dunkeys octopath video was better for people like me that dont really like jrpgs only thing i miss honestly are oldschool cgi cutscenes or atleast an intro movie in anime or so love the game alfyn is my fav characterstory great game indeedthey should make the graphic a liiiiiittle bit betterthough i understood they wanted to make it an old school jrpg being a jobless boi right now if i wont this game i would be so happy just got it started as primrose loving the game so far no i would believe that monster hunter generations ultimate is this title a total clickbait product provided by nintendo stop wetting yourself over an rpg with a fanfictionquality story i have yet to start mine but will get round to it eventually i cant believe you dont like xenoblade the way you describe everything you like about octopath is the same way i would go about describing what i like about xenoblade either way really great review im gonna have to pick this game up now i did the same thing where i bought the game realized i loved it then bought a collectors edition octopath is a 1010 game d it is may favorit switch game even beats zelda breath of the wild i some ways i agree with everything you mentioned from the stories to the grafic and the price tag is totaly worth it my only difference is my favorit char is primrose when it comes to the storie and cyrus has the best passiv in my oppinion will i love therion for his steal abillity because i like fee stuff in games xd 1010 easily theyre asking for 40 because its not a 60 game its not a morrowind online its not skyrim grand theft auto v destiny and horizon these games are at 1080p with stunning graphics and a good story look at some the games coming out later this year this game is old graphics with improved turn base system the story is only one part of what makes a good game retro games are fun but not worth 60 when you can pay for a game like morrowind online or battlefield 1 or any of the new games coming out this year for the same price but look at the different in detail graphics menus cant stop please help me the best tasting switch game it too is my favorite switch game i have decided to be honest zelda botw is a bad zelda game a good game but a pretty bad zelda game waiting for the next zelda game to come out something more traditional buying it for my birthday tomorrow i cant wait ive played the demo 4 times lmfao the art style seems really jarring to me is it messed up that thats the reason why im holding off on it 40 seconds in and i clicked like d wood i love your work i really do d octopath traveler was boring download the demo and see bought the same game twice more money than sense confirmed but how does it taste i wouldnt say the best wood but its definitely at least top 5 imo boost pointsnot battle points lol this is fucked up now that you mention it can you please talk normal in your videos no need to yell i subbed for your content but found your yelling kinda obnoxious from the start no xenoblade 2 is a better jrpg but you wouldnt know anything about it did u play fortniteyou are able to use ur dance now its in store now what kinda is a bummer is that the characters dont interact with each other because yeah it would be almost impossible to take every possible combination of interaction into consideration but that way this feels like some kind of meta journey instead of a genuine journey i just did ophilias story my heart the story is the lone weak point the bask stories are mostly generic and the fact the stories dont have anything at all to do with each other is a drawback what reason do all these heroes have to travel together with no common goal other than that phenomenal how many hours are u in in my opinion i think im the only person to say i didnt have that much fun with this game i like the story and the characters i just didnt like the combat but thats just my opinion this game is actually trash dont get jebaited into purchasing it this game is hands down my game of the year maybe my game of the century i cant put it down im happy you enjoyed it as much as i did great review my excelwhorelency 0000 exactly me octopath is a great game but xenoblade chronicles 2 is so much better and i dont understand how you dont like a superior game in every way dude so much yes this game rocks therion ftw i had to put it down for a few days because i played 50hrs in 5 days while still playing paladins more fortnite than any 35 year old should play sorrynotsorry but yeah you totally do octopath justice in this review your enthusiasm alone says so much thanks as always for the quality content damn i really want to play this i just played the demo for the moment and was quite scared by the complete lack of interaction between each of the 8 heroes during story moments reading reviews i got confirmation of that and i hate this since everything else in the game looks awesome but similar details were already present in the saga games from the past or ffvi the main inspiration for octopath according to the authors why did they stepped back to a more primordial storytelling form ive played so many jrpgs now that i dont really care for combat or else but story should be the main focus to me and while i agree about the writing of octopath being supercool thats a real pity the global picture is not as great as graphics or soundtrack which are awesome will get rid of some games from the backlog and then ill probably jump in correction you can only use up to 3 battle points unless im missing something 3 is the max bp you can use per turn you attack once without any bp and 1 additional per bp you use up to a max of 3 meaning you can attack 4 times with 3 uses of bp i so agree with this video but i personally want to talk to you about what could be done with a sequalbecause i am brimming with ideas this is my favorite switch game atm im trying to play much so i dont beat it so quick because i know thats what id do i can not put this game down either it is so good although therian is my favorite and who ibstarted out with but thats what makes thisbgame so great are the options you can do in this game finally a review that says it like it is 1010 octopath is pure gold you know i played this game for 20 hours in about 5 days then i got attack on titan 2 on switch and for some reason like it more its not a good game actually i tried it put around 20 hours into it but it definitely isnt for me im not a big fan a turnbased combat and i found a lot of it repetitive but i know a ton of people are into it and im happy for them still i think breath of the wild is the best switch game currently honestly you are always so happy i cant help but smile watching any of your videos honestly you are always so happy i cant help but smile watching any of your videos just bought this today cant wait to really jump in this game is my life using the music from the game just makes your video even better love this game after just completing tressas story this game makes a strong case for my favorite switch game previously xc2 held on to that spot with an iron grip but the overall battle system world design and general charming aesthetic makes this game a complete masterpiece the story might have been a little lacking unless theres some post game content that i havent gotten to but overall it didnt detract from the game at all wonderful game would recommend to anyone thanks man im definitely gonna check out the ost for some epic gamer moments octopath traveler is a nintendo ip same with bravely default second this is the game i bought my switch for ive put in 24 hours so far and have 7 of the 8 characters unlocked turn based rpgs have been my favorite genre since childhood and octopath traveler excels at taking every aspect of the genre and presenting it beautifully its a great game but lets not get crazy its nowhere near as good as breath of the wild graphics arent as good battles arent as good and exploring isnt even close the only thing octopath does better is the storytelling however its crazy that they dont have a way to have the 8 protagonists interact with each other more i keep waiting for their stories to all come together but it doesnt happen been waiting for this one i agree with your consensus im addicted that funny i did complete that side quest completly differently i did guide the mother of this guy and she beat some sense into him and to leave that girl alone you say 60 to 80 hours im on track for 120 hours yup best switch game at least for me d wait you did a stream for octopath traveler why cant you keep your streams up im missing great ones great rpg well i listen to videogamedunkey so no this is not this is the first game on the switch that makes me fall in love and ive played a lot of games on the system yes it is and its the best game ive played in a really long time i feel the same way you do about this game if you love it so much why dont you married it peewee herman any way wood happy hump day i agree 100 such a wonderful game 10 out 10 is this the type of game where if you dont play for a week then pick it up you wont know wtf you were doing and pretty much have to start over like the old pokemon games like is there an objective list and a waypoint also i just want to say that this is one of the most beautiful games ive ever seen where do you stream i guided the boys mother to him and he scolded him after he tried to force his way into the girl for marriage saying that she is clearly not interested and the mother pulled him by the ear away to their home and the girl walked away in disgust i never knew the side quests had multiple different outcomes to them youtubers are lowkey the best salesmans because its been plenty of times ive been on the fence about buying something and ill check out a review or check out a couple of videos from some of my favorite youtubers and guess what happens i go out and buy the game or whatever it is i was researching i think i might just buy this game now because at first i was thinking it wasnt my cup of tearandomthought for the love of mario i love your channel lol i have the same problem new room tour the map is the only weak point of the game where im concerned the minimap shows to little to be useful and the lack of zoom in on the world map is sometimes frustrating on the upside i like how you can teleport to previously visited towns btw been playing this in french and the translation is topnotch now go play bravely default second and get your mind blown because those games are superior to octopath traveler and makes octopath a solid 610 in comparison okay woodo my boy stop with the repetition of video ideas this is a good game im addicted omg this is my kind of game it scatchs all my itches i think wood likes this game even if you dont like rpgs and isnt a fan of story would you recommend it still it made me chuckle when i saw that you brought an elderly woman into battle and used her basically as a human shield ive been playing the demo prologue and its got a damn charm that gets you hooked i havent bought it yet but think i will the graphics are really funky too its my favorite switch game at the moment not better than zelda or mario though also not as good as xenoblade 2 but its pretty damn close i love you wood i literally always thought i hated video games but then i started watching your videos and you convinced me to get a switch and now it is all i do and i love it youre wonderful keep doing what youre doing i love you wood i literally always thought i hated video games but then i started watching your videos and you convinced me to get a switch and now it is all i do and i love it youre wonderful keep doing what youre doing people not talking about the story is stopping my purchase can you do a video on just 1st party titles please just bc i want to see your 1st party recommendations i have not played zelda im 20 hours in octo i really am inclined to believe your opinion would love a octo vs zelda video though keep up the good work you have been my favorite new channel since i got a switch 2 weeks ago just got my copy very excited to start playing awesome review dude love the game so far keep up the good work love your switch game reviews cant wait to get my hands on my own switch soon im not gonna watch this video because wood is terrible at not spoiling things love your videos wood so glad you really liked the game as well personally my only gripes are that the characters interactions feel a bit superficial since you only ever see the one character whose story youre progressing through in any of the cutscenes and they never interact outside of the travel banter exchanges and the combat got a bit easy when i started using the merchants ability to donate bp to whichever character i was using with the scholar job battles that previously took 34 minutes were being completed in one turn just because the magic damage in the game is so much higher than physical damage minor qualms i still love it as well glad to see it getting the attention it deserves we need more games like this it got kinda boring kinda fast the demo bored me convince me wood edit im so wrong this game is incredible oh man about that quest where you lost to that guy in tressas town i actually managed to beat him when i provoked him since i was overlevelled and nothing happened i had to clear the quest the alternate way which was to guideallure his mom to give him a good earful and stop his pursuits of the girl but to think that you could clear the quest by losing thats really cool xd kinda wish i got your ending to the quest awesome review wood i personally love this game too see you at game on expo in az here in a few weeks simple answer yes i also think haanit is the best one i love octopath but i started with tressa and later found out she is kinda useless in combat but she is now stuck in my party since i started with her love how positive he is towards games great review i am 10 hours in have never played a jrpg before i bought this game and immediately after buying i thought i should have gotten something else like xenoblade or tropical freeze im not an rpg or jrpg fan as of late got home reluctantly removed the seal and popped the game in the theme music ensnared me and i listen to its entirety before i realized that i had to start the game i picked cyrus as my starting character and went through chapter 1 after roughly 23 hours i decided that i love this game and that my purchase was more than worth it go buy it peeps i absolutely love this game the ost the voice acting and the characters are incredible i am in the middle of chapter 3 and i like the addition of little conversations between characters the battle mechanics are great and keep me entertained and because i never run away i had to do little to no grinding at all i also really like the stories they are not about saving the entire world but about personal journeys and finding your way in life i recommend it 1010 from the what ive played of the demo i would say it is a good game but i would have to see more gameplay to see if i would want to by it but i dont think its the best switch game because of an even better game known breath of the wild i love the writing y o u r e x c e l l e n c y the last rpg turn based was advance wars on gba i really fancy an action rpg though like xenoblade 2 or maybe this one im not sure i just want something to fill in the zelda void god dam it the review is not even finished and you convinced me on buying the game cant wait to finish the download not better than xenoblade 2 nor botw imo but a really nice rpg especially if you enjoy turn based rpgs im enjoying it so far 20 hours in no demo im really enjoying this game 50 hours in but its not perfect my biggest issues are the length of the chapters some characters and dungeons as well as the progression of the story in each chapter the story objectives are very go here talk to this person and the dungeons are just blines to the boss with random encounters and chests being the only challengereward i wish the game incorporated more puzzle solving maybe have a series of switches to activate to get to the boss maybe have the player search various rooms for a key maybe dont tell the player exactly which 3 townsfolk have the infoitems they need to advance the story ok i just ordered this game after watching 104 minutes of this video your enthusiasm felt all too real haha now im gonna watch the rest of this video so you better not burst my bubble lol you should keep up the live stream for the adventure time switch game i dont know why but i had a lot of fun watching that like one of those videos i watch repeatedly i was really waiting this review just for being sure to buy it its interesting i like it but it has a lot of flaws the combat system is one of my favorite things about this game the artstyle is preference i liked it a lot but others might not soundtrack is amazing the story felt extremely weak even as individual stories i think anyone a fan of older jrpgs or turn based should check it out but those who dont like jrpgs should avoid it the reviews out for the game really dont give this game justice for better or worse as most reviewers didnt even play past the first segment and if you ever plan to i hope you give this game an indepth analysis anybody else destroying this game with haanit lol shes awesomely op af i like this game but its kindarepetitive the music is amazing but the combat its something ive seen in bravely default i cannot agree in the 1010 ill say its an 7 or 8 i love primrose story so far and hannits this is the first game in years that ive played that i really enjoy so much im having dream about it lol the voice acting is my favorite thing it makes stories and games so much more immersive the only thing i might complain about is i wish there was more interactions between the characters but i can understand why there isnt that much hopefully we get some dlc cause i will definitely get it i just cannot get used to turn based combat thats unfortunate because i feel like im missing out every time these guys get so enthusiastic about these games have the game just have not got a chance to play cause i know imma be stuck did you get the additional 8 characters switch covers available on nintendocom while i liked i am setsuna octopath traveler is what tokyo rpg factory has been trying to make but coming up short with setsuna and completely missing with lost sphear i really hope they keep the team that worked on this game on making these old school turn based rpgs wow enthusiasm lots im very excited to buy this game thanks for fueling my excitement hollow knight is the best switch game imo for some reason i always get unsubbed from woods channel and that disappoints me cause woods channel is pretty kickass lol doesnt matter i will just keep resubbing love it i hope square makes a ff6 remake with this style oh if you want to talk about it more i am 100 certain a livestream dedicated to discussing your love of the game would have a ton of us watching when you said it was your favorite switch game my jaw dropped i think zelda is better this is definitely number 2 on my list i think they need to work on storytelling for the sequel if they could give us a story that rivals ff6 and 7 it be perfect people these days have no imagination who else is early im the 121st comment you are gushing over this game the same way me and my best mate do and we dont even have it yet we have been excited since the announcement day and everything we have seen since only pushes us to wanting it even more sadly we are incredibly broke right now p which disappointed my friend most of all because he was really wanting the collectors edition i already love this game just wanted to watch you nerd out over one of the greatest switch games to release ive only played 15 h work sucks and i already feel like i got my moneys worth it satisfied my wallet so fast i dont even need to beat the game to be satisfied about the purchase 719 i think its an ocelot that side quest about marriage i dealt with in a totally different way if you go down a bit you can talk to his mother and if you guide her to the son she will basically tell him off for pestering this woman and drag him off screen way different ending than what you got wood this is our favorite switch game til something new comes out thats top tier we just like new ideas and games period just because we love and adore this game doesnt mean we want 100 more similar games in the future exactly like this game i hope future devs create their own games from scratch dude your channel is so annoying now you are way too loud and why are you such a switch lover do you not play any other system you used to be so diverse with other systems people notice when you sell out its sad its not the best game on switch wait a minute wood are you trying to tell me that you got the hots for octopath traveler whoa this is heavy story is absolutely crap generic but everything else is perfect near story trash seriously i finished it twice just to see if anything develiping story wise but not stop over hype ir please i love octopath traveler i also play the hunter she my favorite so far in the game think you did a great job on video keep it up haters gonna hate comment no breath of the wild is the best maybe i just picked the wrong character in the prolog demo of the game but i started with the huntress and the whole dost thou style of speech i just found it super off putting i cleared my save data and intend to go back and try a different path and see if it manages to get me interested and final fantasy 6 is the greatest turn based rpg everever amazing game i think we are witnessing the start of a new final fantasydragon questlevel franchise i freakin love octopath ive played over 70 hours and im still in chapter 2 i cant get enough its far from perfect they should make 8characters relation you start with 1 and have dialogue for them second time u start with another character and npc react diffrent cuz u changed course of storylineand npc should react to characters u have in party it should be basic design thing about this game and in the end when u got all it should be story combine all of them this game feel unfinished or just medicore games form 80 sell by nostalgia yes yes it is i could not agree more with your review its probably the best game since zelda and i have been playing it non stop the game looks great but i getting other games that i been waiting for for a while but this will be my next switch game or second depends on how good spiderman ps4 really im hoping game of the year for it finally someone enjoys this game like it should be enjoyed and sees the true value of it thanks for rating it 1010 even if no game is perfect this one merits it awesome review about an awesome game made by an awesome guy the game has its nice moments soundtrack combat art style but the bad story no interaction between the characters and the huge grind after each chapter so you can have a fighting chance on the next chapter is killing it for me its a shame because the concept ideia is great just my opinion i love the game but i need to work its the best game on the switch and the best game this year thank you for reminding me how good this game is after dunkey booty rped it your goddam right octopath traveler is the best switch game spoiler lol i cried when primroses friend died haanit is my favorite too like shes so great god i want this game so much i will blow someone for the game wait until the addiction ends wood and breath of the wild and odyssey will be on top again i need this omfg the only thing this game or its sequel needs is some puzzles like golden sun i know its out of your scope since you play console games uhhhhhhh since you love story try elderscrolls online aaaaaaannnnnndddd try mentioning suikoden since this game kinda seems the same but 108 stars so 108 characters lol got wood the intro was basically me with xenoblade chronicles 2 i have plans to buy the wayfarer edition also after buying the game by itself at first this game is amazing this is me i feel this whole experience hard haha this is keeping me alive until fire emblem for the switch this game is fucking amazing 3 battle points for x4 attacks i strongly dislike this game i dont get why everyone likes it xd but im glad they do finally we have been waiting for a long time wood hopefully we get a ff xvi with that battle system do you think that it would mak3 a good last minute gift no hollow knight is yes screw botw still a good game btw oh no i cant watch the rest of this video starts flashback im going to buy a switch dont know i dont have any games let me get a demo oh this one looks fun downloads a 3 hour demo of octopath traveller then plays the game addictively nonstop oh my gosh so unhealthy for me im so glad i dont have the full game need to make sure i dont watch anything else about this game or i might end up buying it and took watching the rest of this video rushes down to gamestop and buy the full game man i wish i could play that but i had to sell my switch some months ago because i lost my job just bought the game yesterdaymy god the soundtrack funny how every youtuber loves this game except for dunkey your enthusiasm is an incredible difference from when you brought up your experience with xenoblade chronicles 2 to today with octopath traveler at last we get a good legit octopath traveler review so its been some time since ive watched your videos but i noticed that you talk louder and yell a whoooooole lot more lol what time to you do your streams and where do i watch them i wish it was on pc or xbox why do i never get notified when you live stream overated jrpg nostalgia cash in with decent art but still bland looking i dont know why this game gets so much paraise but okay then like what you like wen yisus crist find hes favorite game that he couldnt play because judas in that time sold it to the romes v so nostalgic the moment holy crap i dont know if i wouldve ever picked up on octopath being an acronym of the characters names ive got 20 hours in it and honestly after all the hype its a bit of a disappointment id say its okay the story sucks the voice acting sucks the ost is amazing itsits okay wish i had more time to play but im nearly done with all chapter ones im taking my time and soaking every minute in ive played for hours at a time and havent even did one battle going through all the towns and doing as much as i can before moving on you also hit everything i feel about this game sure its not for everybody but its the most relaxing game i can think of on the switch the environments are like watercolor paintings and need to be seen in motion to get the full effect loz botw is the best game on the switch question what is the best characterbest set of characters good god i love this game this is one of my top picks for goty so far im early i played 50 hours and i just couldnt keep going there wasnt enough driving force to me and i had gotten tired of grinding so i returned it but i can see why people love it its gorgeous i have been waiting for this i freaking love this game and i bought the collectors edition too the only complaint i have with this game is that the main characters dont interact with each other or at least so far in the game i havent seen it and omg never new that octopath had all the characters first letters i played the demo so many times its sooo good i got it over the weekend its really good honestly dont get the hate for it yes this game is epic i love it itll definitely sell some switches thank you for finally reviewing octppath traveler wood i love that excitement im early cough breath of the wild cough yes it is my answer is no no game is the best hey im early seriously i love you wood and have been waiting for your review of this game d first are the octopath travel the same or continuation on golden sun if lost odyssey looked bad it would be this that is some of the worst voice acting ive ever heard how come the characters have different outfits than usual suikoden is it ahhh my childhood nice gameplay just like riviera the promise land legend of heroes trails in the sky looks very amateurish some textures are higher pixel than others creates a distracting clash such a boring over slow gameplay lol its like your playing suikoden is this a ps1 game im just not into random battles anymore yeah i could play the older ff titles all over again but its hard for me to welcome another game with random battles can you turn that incessant music off sup with the retrograde game that music though 1990s called they want their game back this reminds me of golden sun soooo much wow my childhood games this is way overpriced pretty looking game but i wouldnt pay 60 for this at best id pay 3040 for this damn this looks great worth playing for the music alone seems like a mix of suikoden saga frontier and valkyrie profile 5999 for this its like from 2000y game with bad voice acting stupid dialogues this is one sort of greedy company dont get me wrong if you like it buy and play it yes this is the game my 2000 pc was built for wheres the aaa nah meme when you need it cant wait for the pc version i feel like i wanna buy this game because this remind me of my childhood rpg game backthen when gameboy advance is still the one to go to do i get the japanese audio if i buy the english game i much much prefer the japanese with eng subtitles comes out now for pc cant wait for this game to come out on pc wow flashbacks to super mario rpg i want legend of mana remastered just like this cool a final fantasychrono triggersuikoden skin with a crap ton of bloom and enough lens flare effects to make you go blind before finishing a playthrough 1010 looks like early nintendo graphics wow what terrible voice acting you have i need this game right nowwwwwwwww for those who grew up with suikoden 1 2 also ff early series this will be nostalgic the sprites are a little too crude for my tastes and is that random encounters this is going backwards a little from 3ds to the switch as the bravely default is so so pretty on the 3ds than u see the switch game of octopath no my wallet is crying just watching this its still beautiful and music is wonderful but the idea of 2d platform on an expensive device isnt worth it for me and please dont get me wrong i love all of the ff series and its new releases as they are all have juicy surprises in each new games just this one is a surprise and something to sit down and think hard if i really wanna get the switch and the game the voice acting is shit wait this is real game i thought it was a joke this looks like shite using group spells on single targets using elemental attacks on the wrong targets take a moment to look at what youre doing its a turnbased game sheesh wanted to get into it but didnt even finish the demo i wish thay add some enemy animation thay just like painting with no attacking movement nice game if its 20 years ago ive yet to get this game looks fun but scenery is kind of boring amazing gamei ve already played more than 25 hours anad i love it are there japanese voices too also can you disable the darkened edges around the center of the screen sounds like an anime dub is this game worth 60 i wish it was more like 30 people have the nerve to say this is so much better than xenoblade boi if yall dont get tf outta here gba golden sun remastered game lookin ass lol great game but whoever is playing in this video is not that good at the battle system wow the game so badass it has potential looking for another game to get on the switch besides botw but all the others seem crap even this wait a minute this game uses unreal engine 4 it looks like some customized sprites to me i didnt buy the switch to play this stupid game praying to god that games like this make a comeback we need more of this makes we want to get a switch just to play this game this looks like final fantasy grimoire of the rift im getting a serious saga frontier vibe from this game interesting looking game old school treated with new school graphical techniques lovely square enix is legendary there making a strong comeback final fantasy online as successful and now ff7 remake will revive them so its all magic no crazy physical bruce lee here not impressed at all look like a cross between zelda link to the past and final fantasy 7 anyone wanting to see a lets play of this game loving this that fighting stance and damage fonts instantly remember valkyrie profile butdoes it have behemut can you not see the enemys health ffx6 with heaping helping of hashbrowns and a shadowy underbush sorry this just wont swim to me why only on switch damn it i just found out about this game and it looks pretty good as a fan of the 2d style ff games i think i would like this but that means ill have to get a switch spending that much money always hurts the music sucks shitty japanese elevator music looks like a ff6 gamethis will look good on vita if only squares business divisions could make rpgs like this 207 hnnnggg that worldmap nice phone game on the switch the enemys attack animation is what deters me from buying not really keen on the voice acting but gameplay art and music are solid 10 reminds me of ragnarok hyped best 8 minutes of my life hate the stupid name octopath traveler everything else is solid gold the music is so good i hope the dubbing was done by gamespot hyped i want amiibos pls ty pixel art the art style is just ugly thanks for getting me excited for this game i watched another of you videos on it im waiting to get it on switch when it goes on saleor ill cave and get it on steam i also love this battle system theres a lot going on but its intuitive feeling for a real rube like me im really loving ff3 on snes too again thank you i havent submerged myself in a game in a long time it reminds me of when i played chrono trigger the first time i played for like 10 hours straight when i should have been sleeping on a school night i was just too pumped to sleep thank you i just bought the game last night and was so confused by the battle system thank you for this video super useful and interesting video thanks merchant runelord job class invincible not sure if someone else said it already or if you realised already considering this comment is almost an entire year after the posting of this video but you can change your main character once you finish their chapter 4 great video not so great voice great vid for me who is just starting the game thanks timtim great stuff love the game very helpful thanks ese good walkthrough and tips thanks great game as well hmm they trail each other just like dragons quest games ive never played a turnbased rpg before this combat has always been a turn off for me but i really want to play this game is this game a good place to start turnbased rpgs love the very very quiet jazz music in the background what are the herbs ie herb of valor herb of clamor for i cant even defeat the first boss why do i suck miss the old turnbased i love tim rogers videos and this one taught me a hell of a lot as well as making me laugh anyone else think of spyro year of the dragon when you hear this guy talk at certain points lol it would be easy to get that treasure if you had something to stand on sounds just like that guy from frozen alters tends to use an attack buff maneuver on his first turn 100 of the time um buddy thats not a tendency its a certainty i didnt get it please definitely explain it again when you find a new job equipped right away it makes better any build and can carry more weapons almost all enemies with the same sprite have the same debilities as example in here you can see 3 lizards but one dont said the same debilities as the other 2 so check that out the tactics that i have is break shield first and then hit it with the bp to make more damage if you use your bp when they have a shield the damage decrease a lot i use attacks all to break all shields and then use the single foe attacks those make more damage not necessary if the shield is higher it doesnt mean that it hits harder it just mean it has more heal point thanks its odd that every enemy in the game is called vulnerable guys the game is boring and there is no interaction between characters its all cluster fuckband main story is generic this games got nothing on knack 2 babeee ooooouuuh tim i know you read these comments please compare this games combat to cinco paus thank you i see your plan lets see how much you get on that d20 i cant wait for this games release tomorrow its going to keep me busy summer long very helpful i could watch a tim rogers video about any topic 820 you wouldve gained the second bp anyway if you had casted any unboosted spell instead of defending you wasted a good amount of damage here it didnt really matter in this specific case because as you said its a low level battle but if it werent one that damage could have mattered excellent break down of the battlesystem of octopath i like the guesswork of the weaknesses looks like a fun switch game still havent picked up a switch though the graphics annoy me why have pixel sprites without natural movement mixed with kind of realistic background and effects how this is a triple a game baffles me tim fuck yes as always tim i would ask if i should buy this but about the time you smoked baddie 1 i received an email from amazon saying it shipped this is where i would put a shrug emoji here if i knew how trials in the sky simplified edition stop letting this guy make videos for kotaku bring back mike fahey and snacktaku thanks tim i enjoyed what i played of both demos but was disappointed to see that all the character paths converged in this manner or at all really olberics demo from last year was very fun playing through solo especially considering how difficult it was compared to most other rpgs both western japanese it reminded me of the challenge of dragon quest 1 with added depth considering that you had to manage skill points to strike multiple enemies at once given the massive amount of damage they do while also conserving sp for future battles too bad the original demo had multiple save states throughout and it seems as though theyve kept it in the more recent demo primroses recruitment system felt as though you were improvising party builds based on what was immediately around you if they wouldve incorporated labryinth of touhous tp system it could have been something great the game still looks interesting and i hope the boss battles and the long game o just got my notification that the game is being sent from amazon i may have to call in sick on monday for a long weekend less than 4 more hours its like bravely default and child of light put together neat cant wait til friday kinda hoping amazon accidentally send it early this explanation is longer than an episode of captain tsubasa not gonna lie im digging your smokey voice oooh yeah baby im gonna show you some rpg mechanics tim rogers content is why i subscribe to kotaku dot com this isnt bookworm adventures deluxe but ill settle for it heck yeah fist message opportunity im taking it confirmed johnny went balls deep i just bought the game for my new switch after having neglected jrpgs for 20 years last one i played was chrono trigger in 2000 not that i dislike them but simply got drawn into competitive pc gaming etc for a while i already put 10 hours into it in 2 days and absolutely love it the story is definitely a bit cheesy in my opinion but it more than makes up for it with the beauty charm addicting gameplay and amazing original score got this game day 1 still my favourite title on the switch highly recommend it i would appreciate not having to fast forward 5 minutes into the video before you start talking about the game in the title just picked up a switch last week and ive had a resurgence of interest in playing jrpgs havent played any since the earlier final fantasy days and chrono trigger this and dragon age xi have definitely grabbed my interest octopath is my first rpg and i like it where did he get that shirt i want one they should remake insert well known 16 bit se jrpg here in the octopath style wow this is wishful thinking at its absolute extreme even if you do get a remake of chrono trigger in this style your inevitably gonna bitch about how it pales in comparison to the original just like you guys did with the ff6 remake weve gotten i bet theres some fanboy right now on changeorg making a petition to remake the first 6 final fantasy games unaware that petitions barely ever work knowing absolutely nothing about how game development works im all for a decent remake of the older ff games or even chrono trigger but i would rather those remakes be their own thing instead of them being a halfadded result of caving into crazy fans even the remakes of romancing saga 2 and 3 dont look the same as octopath traveler but they are still great remakes that surpass the original games and rs2 remake came out before octopath traveler its not acquires call on whether or not thes your tshirt is absolutely awesome the current generations just dont understand these type of rpgs these shits are legendary love every second of this i grew up in the 90s maybe that is why im babysitting my bosses houses in about a week taking 5 days off of work now i know what ill be playing the whole time thank you so much octopath traveller aka the true final fantasy7 square took you so long but finally i can play your stuff again lol man ive been stuck like almost at the start its the first cave and yeh just got killed like 5 times over n over dreamcastguy says in his vid do side quests so yeh i was thinking do i have to power up by leveling up thats whats ill do side quests and level up a bunch first thing i noticed is how personal it is seems like a really deep game and the looks awesome im playing brave story on my hacked vita atm too so yeh these games are beautiful i dunno how u cant love rpgs to people who dont so good ive been thinking about this game all day like damn im gonna play this all night dreamcast guy says go hard n fast in the battles n your saying take ya time lol ill mix it up so awesome this is getting a native pc release great video as always i saw that its out on pc tomorrow i still want it on the switch thanks for doing the review just like that no spoilers your excitment is also captivating and makes me even more eager to play it going to pick this game up right now for 4499 it seems like what the poster is getting at is that this game is compared to the final fantasy series in difficulty i fing love grinding battles and earning experience so i should be right at home with this okay i get what you are saying herebut can the turbo grafx 16 run it you can have a turboduo and an arcade card or even a super grafx why did they spell it like that im yanking your chain i am a huge follower of your channel i actually thought that you stopped making videos i am super happy to see you punching weight sega lord x and game sack doing your thing for a long time i was super envious of your awesome collection you see i had one about the same size as your fantastic collection and when i moved to a new house my exgirlfriend she was not an ex at the time left all of my super rare stuff behind and only grabbed her romance novels i was in the hospital medical condition that often requires surgery and i specifically asked her to grab them and she did not we had plenty of help i lost thousands of dollars in games adding insult to injury she stole my atari jaguar avp doom wolfenstein and cyber morph okay no loss with cyber morph as she knew they you were right about dying several times i love this game they should remake with this type of graphics games like chrono trigger xenogears or suikoden 2 disliked because the game doesnt force you to level up for 6 hours at a time to progress and you never clarify that i always like to keep my characters at the same level so the only grinding i did was from chapter 1 to 2 since the first characters you picked up will the stronger by know but i only did it by exploring dungeons after that i did it again to beat the final boss i must have that shirt im just disappointed how the generic characters barely interact with each other and how disjointed everything is great game nonetheless if ea made this they would include 1 traveler when you buy the game and would sell the rest as dlc in my personal experience you have about 1015lvl of a leeway when playing the game great review wonderful amazing fucking game if you have tbe money buy it pc is better i got smashed by the boss in the demo not well versed in rpg thanks for the tips nice review im going thru the game as far collecting characters but i dont get all those side quests how to track them what to rly do where to find things did you finish this game is it worth it there are forks in the road to help you navigate the map you dropped your scoring for the game because you didnt figure that out play bravely default i dont like usually like jrpgs but i played the 3 hour demo and im into this game is very fun and the combat is great i actually feel like this game is pretty good for jrpg newcomers there are lots of quality of life things in this game compared to the old school ones its like first final fantasy but with improved combat and actually good stories is it more difficult than the smt series wish ffxv was half as good as this game what is square doing this game is killer for classic jrpg fans this game is beautiful to look at the music is great the story is excellent so glad this style of game has not been abandoned pokemon game without pokemons im not really a big fan of rpgs that force you to grind but i can understand compromises has to be made for a game as nonlinear as this one a much bigger compromise is the lack of interactions between party members i understand why it has to be this way but its something i usually really enjoy in jrpgs of this style so i cant help but complain a little other than that im loving this game to death the soundtrack and especially the boss tunes are fantastic think im getting this for christmas asked for a switch because of this game want another zelda in this look honestly there is nothing to hate about this game its addictive and gorgeous af a rare 1010 for me i aint gonna lie octopath travelers one of the best switch games ive experienced theres nothing like playing this game while drinking an ice cold lagunitas ipa 75 of the game being combat i expect to have at least 8 battle themes a big mistake from squaresoft is having one battle tune for pretty much all the game not counting bosses of course thats annoying is the only fault i find in ff6 chronotrigger etc did you beat the true final boss that fight is insane this game is incredible i logged 75 hours and loved every minute of it love the ff6 tshirt i think i remember that fellas name is hydro or ultro or something like that uhmm are you sure the storys intertwine are we playing the same game lol thats weird i never grinded in this game the battles along the way were more than enough to make me strong enough i was even always overleveled with at least 3 levels great review johnny just got my nintendo switch in anticipation for smash bros ultimate and looking for some other interesting games to try out as well never been a huge jrpg guy but i have played a few before still not sure if i want to drop my money on this game though everyone seems to love it but seeing as im not a huge jrpg guy it might not be for me ophelia best gal you spend 6 hours grinding one area really i found i only had to grind a bit between chapters they level up nicely as you play through ive played through this game if you do everyones act 1 then act 2 then youre free to tackle the act 3s and 4s however you like i never needed to grind its great this game is amazing im 100 hours in and still have a lot to do i like all the side quest stuff the optional jobs are great as well as the bosses some of them are really hard too the optional dungeons are good too have some good equipment and i love to do every option for each townsperson and buysteal all their stuff and scrutinizeinquire for a hidden treasure as well thats why im 100 hours in and still havent beaten the game being a kid of the 16bit age i would say this is a good combinationextension of both ff6 and final fantasy tactics the look is definitely ff6 but the jobs and ability customization was totally fft and in terms of how complicated it is wellfft gave me great experience in complex positioning of spells abilities jobs etc that and ff8 i was hoping this game would have a calculator this game is more like a 95 its damn near perfect the review comments on this game are totally spot on the reference to the saga series makes me happy definitely subscribing my boy i dont like rpg games but i played the demo because i didnt have money to buy another game and omg its a beautiful game the art the music the story i really recommend it what did you do that you had to grind for the main story im at the very end and i just need to grind now for the end end boss what a game love the combat variety it keeps things interesting and doesnt make it too easy my switch game of the year at this point i played a lot of jrpgs when i was younger but went away from them as they are too much time consuming that said last week i decided to try the demo since i found the art style amazing and it reminded me of the old dragon warrior games i loved younger i went through the 3 hours demo in almost one session and i was hooked two days later i bought the game and been playing it since the art style and the music are really amazing i love each of the characters storyline and the combat system is very fun and the fact that its on switch and i can play anywhere helped at spending the 80 for it been on ps4 only i think i would have pass i have a feeling that switch is going to take my 3 all time console list very soon where did you get that shirt johnny nice video as always im still putting off getting back into this game after about 6 hrs im still overwhelmed lol awesome game but i just have to make time for it btw is that a konami capture eye behind you over your left shoulder i cant tell what it is but ive been looking for one of those if you have any leads well so long the games mechanics are really flowing to me its no that hard of a game thou there are some nasty enemies at the very begining of the game i think its mechanics will be friendly to even new players im currently with the fighter and the dancer heading to the 3rd party member amazing shirt would love to see a 2d fighting game with final fantasy bosses as enemies a level grind game glad i didnt pick it up i mean there are far better ways as shown in many other rpgs that can make gameplay such as this without implementing grinding as being mandatory this game is confusing yet i like what it has to offer so much that i have to play it this is a game you need if you have a switch ppl are saying the stories suck and that the characters dont interact im confused cuz johnny nvr lies you arent suppose to follow one character all the way through haha youre suppose to do all the chapter 1s then all the chapter 2s and so on and so fourth if you do that you wont have to level like that for 6 hours haha the levels will just come naturally but wow touch for a 6 hour level sesh lord have mercy sorry for the lateness but nice review need to play this game one day loll this was prolly the best review on dis game was gonna wait til black friday but i cant take it no more i personally think that the character interactions in this game are more than enough in older rpgs characters had little to no reason to come with you as well and their interactions with each other were very limited i mean take ff6 for example 12 characters and the only characters that had meaningful interactions were terra celes locke and shadow relm not mandatory and maybe even sabin edgar the rest was totally meaningless and i dont understand why ff6 is getting so much praise for its characters dont get me wrong i love ff6 as much as you do but i think its really unfair to say that octopaths character interactions are a reason to hate the game jesus its a classic jrpg like the ones on the snes the rpgs back then had worse or sometimes equal character interactions just picked this game up i really enjoyed the old nintendo and ps1 final fantasy games hope i enjoy this going in balls deep lol i havent had to grind much i just go to the next lowest story segment and maybe grind a few levels but thats it of course im doing every story segment i want octopath traveller it reminds me of final fantasy brave exvius never played these types of games before very tempted by this but i dont know the learning curve from what he is saying possibly putting me off advice anyone did he refrerence the saga frontier series or a different one no explorable world map weak af this game is a saving grace for me i started as primrose i love buffing the crap out of cyrus elematk with peacock strut going level 4 boost and blowing mobs away just got the game 90 here in canada ontario i decided to pick this up the other day and i think when you have time johnny you should give it another shot but try everyones pathways at once doing just one leads to hours of grinding which you found but if you visit every story you will naturally be at the correct levels im new to turn based rpgs but i caught on pretty quickly i didnt watch any videos not even trailers i just had a blast learning everything might go back play some ffs now any recommendations danger level system reminds me of knights of pen paper feature unfortunate in my pkaythrough i got every character first which in turn had me at the perfect levels to start each of the chars second chapters going through easy with no grinding dang yet another greatlooking rpg that ill have to check out when i buy a switch when i first saw this game i had 0 interest played the first demo for a bit because i only had one other game and didnt enjoy it heard good things about the second demo played it and looooved it finally got the full version yesterday and loving it where do i get that shirt one of the complaints ive seen floating around is that the story is pretty sub par and that the different characters arent tied together very well i have found it to be the exact opposite i loved how the motivations for each character to set out on their respective journey were so varied and how it made sense that they would each form a bond with the main character that was at first as simple as just needing a companion for an adventure yup ive been playing for a bit more than an hour now damn i get killed a lot thanks for the tip about places and levels though will probably help me a lot in the future still waiting for more stock to come into the stores not a fan of digital downloads for games i know im going to love and keep for a long time seems like you could really get several playthrough a in this if you wanted good stuff still need more games to justify buying a switch hopefully by the end of its lifecycle it will have atleast a dozen titles worth paying for ive got it fantastic graphics excellent sound track battles are engaging and dont get boring story is not convoluted my only criticisms are that the characters story dont intertwine not really a team feel also wish the main characters sprite models are more upscaled for the battles i wonder if johnny has any criticism love how this game looks before you get this game try the prologue demo i tried it and i found the combat tedious in the early game especially the long boss battles and constant wild encounters since theres no health bars you dont know how close you are to the end so i got really bored at the first boss with the thief the story though i loved the bit that i saw it was pretty interesting i hope the combat gets better maybe 10 hours in but right now would i buy this for the full 60 no not right now edit also a main reason i might not get this is because i was thinking about getting ys vii i dont know which is better there is no word in the english dictionary to describe how much im in love with this game grats on 10 years mate i am 10 hours into octopath and it is quickly turning into one of the best new classics of rpgs i didnt grind that much i just tackled each chapter and optional dungeon starting from the weakest to the strongest it was obvious that this games seemed a cashin to you from the trailer the 816 bit nostalgic feel was abused in the last 510 years exploited to make you think this game is gameplay heavy and awsome we do not focus on graphic this game will becan incredible experience like the old final fantasy dragon quest zelda chrono trigger all this was bullshit every time so now it seem dece to expect another false promise game when you see a kind of reminscent 16 bit inspired rpg thank you for such a great spoilerfree review keep up the awesome work between this game and dragon quest 11 i have to save up for a switch and a ps4 meanwhile my illchosen xbox one collects dust i agree with your review the most mate cheers i love your reviews man i love this game and yes i know olberic was my choice as well his story is a lot higher level than the others he can deal massive damage though i guess i need to spend a lot of time leveling up lol im on his chapter 2 i used to love classic style jrpgs chrono trigger is one of my favorite games however ive really been falling out of them and havent been able to keep interest in playing them as of late do you think this game is worth a shot from the way people are describing it seems to have loads of content and have a very good difficulty reminiscent of old school jrpgs i dont know man the art style character design and music just dont appeal to me still im happy to see old school jrpgs coming back yeah i get what you mean about the boss battles right now im finishing off my first chapter four quest its tressas btw because i picked her first and the recommended level was 45 guess how high a level most of my party were two of my members were level 41 while one was level 39 and ive been farming ever since im playing it now lot like dq4s chapter system and primroses chapter is a copy of meenas dancer chapter i will say that even though he said he did a great deal of grinding if you find yourself doing multiple characters storylines45 at least you likely wont find yourself needing to grind too excessively even then the combat is incredibly fun and musics great so even grinding isnt painfully mindless like other games may be the game has bean released ive never played any games of this genra but i like rpgs and this games graphics should i buy this was a great game made by the same developers who made the bravely series i hope they finally make a third title and make a second for octo i love you johnny out of all the reviews ive watched on octopath you are literally the only one who made the connection between this and the saga series i was starting to think i was the only one in the world who has actually played those games i knew you would get it cheers rough lesson to learn pick your starting character carefully haanit and cyrus are great choices because theyre two characters you would love to have stuck on your party case of haanit haanit comes with axe and bow skills with a free creature summon linde that does lance and sword damage dual classing later can deepen her versatility as an added bonus she makes a good partner for primrose spamming beguiling dance as beast summons can be done when youre silenced the goat creature near noblecourt is an aoe heal that clears debuffs case for cyrus cyrus has no real depth on weapon skills but covers the three basic elements water fire thunder and has a passive that identifies weaknesses dual classing him into a healer makes him basically the only caster youll ever need i put a silence immunity accessory on him and dualclassed him as an apocathery sodid you beat the game in 15 weeks im about 35 hours into it and im only halfway through the chapter 2s but the repetitive random combat encounters ruin it for me love the game from the demo but hated the random encounters every 10 steps left or right gets so frustrating and boring im already sick of the combat must be playing a different game this game is really cool bro i started it last night and i felt that final fantasy 3 filling from it on the super nintendo its really good man hey wered you get that shirt because i want one man happyconsolegamer thestraightupreviews i cant disagree with any of this good review johnny im only 10 hours in but having a great time so far surprised you said that you didnt notice the music thats the first thing i noticed in the demo and it made me want the game right away its so good sans thinks that undertale is better it sounds like a modern 7th saga nice chronograph on your wrist sir may i ask what brand it is this game is great for jrpg fans but take this review and others with a grain of salt i have to say though i do enjoy the game a lot it definitely has drawbacks i actually find the gameplay shallow for each character for each chapter i have played 23 chapters each so far there seems to be a repetitive structure a lot of narrative and when you do have access to your characters you typically just walk a few steps to trigger a new cutscene eventually you get to a dungeon which are brief and then at the end is a boss followed by more narrative the side quests usually rely on character abilities and are also shallow such as find an item or bring a person somewhere i just wish there were more diverse clever puzzle elements that said the stories themselves so far have been pretty good i liked alfyns chapter 2 the best so far personally i think some stories are more interesting than others but the voice acting is surprisingly good for all of them odette is a character i h ive checked out 3 story lines so far and its so fun the grinding on to level up is fun im not tired with it its been fun so far i went in blind and im living for it i love it so much its so much fun i enjoy playing it on the go i cant wait to pick it up but 1st i have to finish xeno chronicles 75hrs in and im still not done with the main story mode my dude your video game wall gives me a rager every time love your videos long live ff11 death to haanit i hope square level 5 bandai namco etc etc see how this game gets it ls rave reviews and decide to return to what jrpgs are supposed to be i hate the word classic turn based combat is as classic as fps gameplay and fps gameplay has only had minor improvements dont bring back turn based games just fckin make turn based games gad dmned it last i checked people still crave sprawling long fantasy stories with turn based gameplay and yet they dont release them because of lack of sales well i hope this changed everything damn corporations i went into a boss fight and basically 2 shoted it by that i mean i broke it set up guy to deal more damage than the boss can handle and just destroyed it i am also enjoying it a lot i am in love with the soundtrack dont forget to hold b to run fast it took me 15 hours to find this out thank you for doing a proper review of this game i watched like 7 reviews that half assed the game and were misinformed i have only been playing for 3 hours but i have been doing the opposite of grindning so far running from most fights so the boss wont be too easy i prefer to have to grind so this review has given me hope to keep going let me get this straight you can follow and complete each characters story from one save file and just swapping back and forth btwn characters or do you have to start 8 new save files to get each story i actually disagree that its a level up rpg and having to grind for hours in my experience with the game part of its brilliance is the sheer amount of ways you can come at encounters outside simply out leveling opponents so for example i went into a danger level 25 zone with my characters at levels 21 18 17 and 12 it was kind of tough but through clever play i got in beat the boss there and got out i guess asking for a proper enemy attack animation is too much in a 60 game seriously this looks like 15 game to me shit compared to legend of heroes trails in the sky welp boys i just bought it on the e shop wow i was already hype for this game and you hype me even more the miniature effect is cool i need a switch why cant they make a good jrpg that has awesome looking sprites with good graphics and turn based is that to much to ask dont say persona 5 the game sucks any romance this is the game that going to make me buy a switch thing thats holding me back is that it looks terrible like a snes game johnny millennium going balls deep one rpg at a time i hate comparing rpgs because each should be its own experience but i have to ask which rpg would you say this plays closest to is this the first review youve given an actual score or do i just normally not listen to scores i wish the game had a crt filterscan lines like the nes classic so that the sprites look less blocky discovered your channel about a month ago love your videos is there game changing items in it like gengi glove in final fantasy 6 stop smacking your lips please all i got to say is kill the purple and yellow cat that comes out at random it lv up my 20 to lv 23 and my other 3 from lv 13 to lv 17 i dont know what to buy first this or bayonneta my favorite johnnyism is expurrience hahaha i need to unbox my collectors edition xd been busy with work and life stuffi need buckle down and play me some turnbased jrpg well damn i guess im sold on this game ive been wanting to play a classic grind style rpg is it that hard to show gameplay for even ten seconds straight you definitely hyped me up enough to get the game picked up my switch on friday and love this game so far im about level 20 on my main group played a lot this weekend lol octopath traveller feels like the best snes game i never played i was really hyped for it and its exceeded my hype more than i thought possible best rpg ive played in a very very long time very lisphy wait where are my balls oh right they are pretty deep into octopath i will tell you a secret it will be as hard as the first character you choose tip if you choose the thief or the hunter its really more easier than to start with primrose or the knight i came across your vids only recently truly admire your honest opinion on each game review i know this is off topic johnny millennium but i would love to see what you think of the sega saturn i know you said you were burned by it but do you own one what were your thoughts could you make a video about it octopath has dark souls feeling after bosses there is no character interaction why are you lying for god i love this game i have been wanting a game like this for a long time great video i got the wayfarer edition completely worth it this is a great deep game rpg gold the combat is petty easy and simple once you get it down thats not to say there isnt hard enemies but once you have it down its really fun i havent had fun playing an turn base style since final fantasy 9 the boosting is what makes it fun and not boring normal battle systems where youre just picking options of moves to do its addicting in a way and along with the world its an amazing game overated gamelooks like mobile cheap crap where did he get that shirt i love how passionate you are about this game and how popular it seems to be i feel this game seems ok but some will overrated it for looks i love this channel how many people specifically put a positive spin on their content game is so fun i wanna play it but since ill be out camping for 5 days i cant play it till then i also bought hollow knight and im in love with that too cant wait to get back home cant wait to get trails of cold steel iv in september no rpg is hard when you play smt challenge in an rpg finally i really dont understand why the reviews of this game are so good the story is really lacking having it being split in 8 so roughly with no connection between characters the battle system is extremly repetitive past the initial discovery of it because of a serious lack of jobs and skills to choose from you basically have the same type of battles 3 hours in compared to 80 hours in which is a huge disappointment for a game with a job based battle system the visuals are interesting but areas have absolutely no personality whatsoever they are just very generic landscape theres snow sand grass and rocks but i never thought oh waw this region is interesting the world has absolution no cohesion in terms of landscape even though some lore attempts try to make it feel like a whole this is mostly due to the fact that the game has really atrocious level designs with essentially corridors upon corridors with here and there very poor dungeons that make no sense in terms of geometry i think you answered my question i have all the characters unlocked i havent fast traveled anywhere ive fought every random encounter and my main character is only 15 i need to be 24 to start chapter 2 i think thats where youre alluding to grinding for 6 hours why is no one talking about the story when reviewing a jrpg i agree this game is brilliant and addictive cheers johnny most fun in an rpg ive had since ff6 ive heard conflicting opinions now about the story and character interactions which some reviewers are claiming its weak ill try it out for myself though it looks fantastic hitting the subscribe button because this review you gave of this game was amazing and you are exactly right it is just likeplayimg a new saga frontier game bravo that is one massive collection picked it up on release damn im so glad i have the weekend off been playing it non stop the battle mechanics are so sweet and the characters are interesting i happily went through everyones intro story like a child reading a book probably my favorite square game of all time is vagrant story this isnt vagrant story but you can tell the makers of vagrant story made this game i really like it so far great review amazing i rated 92100 i picked it up and its worth the 60 great story and details this is the first jrpg ive ever owned and im really digging it so far i though this game was coming out on ps4 sadpepe yeah im struggling with this game lol mine is on the way to my housecant wait to try it this has saga frontier written all over it im in is there voice acting can anyone explain to me where the hell do i download prologue demo from its not in the eshop did nintendo pull it out i fucking love this game its too good half hour boss fights thats nothing after finishing persona 3 haha edit great review johnny looking forward to playing it one day balls deep into it xd but what if i dont have balls xd xd my only complaint about octopath traveler is the fact that the english voice acting isnt that great especially compared to the japanese voice acting but i dont have balls picked it up last night im about an hour in really digging the combat so far but im concerned that the narrative might be lacking depth buthard to tell with only an hour in great review i definitely agree about the grinding spots even if im well above the recommended level i try to grind until it starts to feel tedious you can never be too safe good to know about the logistics of leveling up other characters i was wondering about that when i watched the game trailer thanks for the upload enjoyed the video you just need to know how to level the easy way slight spoiler chapter 1 mob easter egg slight spoiler chapter1 there is a mob called caith in the game that is an ultra rare spawn in the beginning areas it only has 5 hp but has maxed out dodgearmor and will flee 80 of the time on the first round of its turn the trick is to kill the caith asap using the tressa hire merc ability stun or the scholar 22sp spells without killing the other adds keep the other enemies alive and spam bewildering dance from primrose til you get x5exp x5jp note there is a x100 exp buff also really rare if lucky enough you will get the x100 exp and get like 100k exp when you clear the remaining adds the original exp earned is 1k exp 150jp with this i went from level 15 to level 40 something instantly the encounter is quite rare so happy hunting it is also possible to randomly summon caith with bewildering dance played the demo ended up buying the game day 1 absolutely love this game alot of people saying this has a 16 bit graphics but i could nto disagree more take a good look at the dtail the backgrounds the sheer amouint of colors no 16 bit game ever looked anywhere near as good as this more acurate would be to emntion it has these 2d style sprites is all this loks a million times beter than 16 bit thank god this isnt a dumbed down classiclike rpg for newbs finally another good turn based rpg so its got a wild arms type deal where you can switch characters anytime and follow their story freakin sweet the look remains me of ff tactics love it getting my copy today loving the aggressive depth of field in this game it works very well with the pixel art the art style personally connects me to the ff tactics games i enjoyed those throughly ill throughly enjoy this cyrus tressa olberic ophilia are my favorite and i see that you feel the same awesome nice tshirt i dont think this games for me i had the same problem not being impressed and afraid it would be a cash grab but seeing this review i am excited for it i might pick it up soon talked about how great it is and offered basically no downsides so why didnt it get 1010 lovin your comment unlike other game reviewers you are going in depth from aspects to aspects instead of being abstract like the game is mind blowing really engaging etc would like your comment on the story because my problem with the storyline is that even though the characters are met theyve never really met all the dialogues cutscenes are as if hes all alone referring i instead of we referring her him instead of them they also are traveling for each different purpose goals and destinations theres no reason for them to travel together will their stories be merged in later part of the game thank you its trash so far octopath traveler is a masterpiece and it remains me from the snes games from the 90s and i know this game is the game i look for we have good news people broly will be canon thanks man great review dont think ill play it per se but this looks great this review legit sold me on the game originally i thought whatever character you chose youd be during their story thats it but saying you can do others story arc in the same playthrough is what convinced me this review i think changed my mind on the game ill be picking it up 043 literally what lost sphear i am setsuna is i loved the demo i will get it plus terrific tee shirt btw i want your shirt keep doing what you sirmany thumbs up for not spoiling the story its so worth it picked up my wayfarers edition cant wait for work to finish lol happy early birthday to me all i needed to hear was this is a leveling game i enjoyed the demo but i noticed that you had to be properly leveled before heading into combat if it requires you to level up for that long outside of the main story line this game is not for me how many hours did you get in total as of now some boss fights in this game last half an hour sold thanks john loved this review defiantly going to pick this up where is your shirt from i really love it and want it on me now 2 things 1 ill be picking up my preorder on my way home from work today 2that shirt i wanted to play solo is it possible or i need others to unlock end game does the combat get repetitive i had no hype for this game ive been playing it its a great game dragon quest need to come to the switch this game looks so amazing i think i need to buy a switch after all i want ff6 in this engine next pls square amazing game i have it 9510i love itits really good game love that kind of rpg nice its like that in chrono trigger for certain endings but happy gamer theirs no party interaction oh i am going balls deep in this game tonight i watched the unboxing and it made me want to stop watching and get back into the gamenow im watching this video and just a few minutes into it i wanted to stop and get back into the gameim not trying to say there is anything wrong with the video but just seeing the game being played and hearing the music makes me want to just go play the game some more im barely into chapter 2 i didnt play much of the demo i started to but then i thought i would just hold off until the game came outits a fantastic game i recommend anyone with a switch to buy this game terrible reviewer learn to speak properly i liked how you made an effort to avoid using the word grinding this is a game appealing to that generation that few with snesps1 jrpgs cant believe were so niche right now when every gamer played these games back then to me this not one of your better game reviews bc i came out of this not knowing any additional details about the games story just strategies to something i know nothing about but i think its bc youre very excited to talk about it im a big fan and still liked the video though just because its hard doesnt mean its bad game looks like it took your life away damn this game takes me back kind of like saga frontier difficulty especially with the character storylines maybe ill get a switch after all oh so theres bosses and a chapter two thanks for the spoilers odd that you said the stories intertwine so well but literally every other review on the web said the games only weakness is that they dont that there is no over arcing storyline that the game is a series of little short stories in a way did you discover a story others are missing he seems out of breath like he is so excited to talk about it that he cant help to search for his words xd pre purchased after the three hour demo looking forward to playing this today its sad that certain people flinch at the idea of challenging gameplay no wonder cod snorefests are more popular than instant classics like octopath will you tell your thoughts on shining resonance refrain if you played it also something interesting on end game japanese guide pretty much says so not to touch spoiler in here is it weird that the negatives he said makes me quite excited for the game xd i got one questioncan u see the enemies on screen or does it surprise u with battles as ur walking usung japanese voices automatic thumb up sorry but those are poop graphics 16bits i mean reallly played the demo 2 days ago you do get destroyed if underleveled or not paying attention xd one of the few reasons why i want a switchlooks gooddef tickles me in teh right places as a rpg fanbut this alone doesnt get me over the hump of purchasing a switch this game is a good sign thoa few more titles like this and throw in a solid shin megami tensei rpger and i might be sold this looks like itll be fun to play and it might get me interested in old jrpgs the more reviews i watch of this game the more i realize i shouldnt play this i have a bunch of other rpgs i would love to finish and i will never do that if i add this to the list as well i will start this when i finish zelda breath of the wild i love hard boss battles really makes it exciting when you win i accidentally ordered 2 wayfarer editions i feel bad cuz now someone else who wanted one wont get it i thought the character stories dont intertwine at all i am only getting this game to find all bravely defaultsecond references for example here is a art httpscdn3dualshockerscomwpcontentuploads201709projectoctopathjpg reminds you of someone and merchant character going httpsikymcdncomphotosimagesnewsfeed00074350827apng this reminds me of a saga game i still cant believe the character artwork wasnt done by akihiko yoshida it looks exactly like something he would draw but apparently its done by a guy named naoki ikushima who designed the monsters for the bravely series maybe hes just aping yoshidas style but hes damn good so is this legit good or is it like hotforaminute like bravely default good so this game isnt for snowflakes im sold im getting this game because ive always loved the turn based rpgs that used to be released all the time i miss this game style and miss the jrpgs that are heavily story driven sadly ff13 and 15 doesnt have that story driven feel we used to have which is sad so yeah going to play this game as much as possible if it was for 40 bucks ill buy it ill wait for a sale i have way too many switch games and not enough time to play them all no need to drop 60 on a game i wont play till probably 2 years later well back to trying to beating my first playthrough of fallout 4 three years after release i love companies that bring back 16bit style games with modern tools looks amazing thanks chief i cant wait to pick this up so much praise and good reviews epic adventure here i come square needs to remake ffvi in this 2dhd artstyle with new dungeons towns and side quests now i really reeaaallly want a switch i would have loved this game 30 years ago but who has time for this shit anymore i had the opposite issue i thought the game looked amazing when i first saw it but then i played the first demo and i struggled to enjoy the dialogue and gameplay throughout the entire demo i dunno what it is i loved bravely default and second and they have a similar mechanic but i wasnt appreciating having to dump 4 points into every attack after staggering enemies i still think its one of the most beautiful jrpgs recently though i love the art style of classic crunchy pixel art sprites with some 3d rendering with crunchy textures and then basking all of it in some really great lighting and post fx systems i love the look when u have ys 8 to finish and u also have yet to start shining resonance but u want to pick up this game definitely on my list to get i sure wish sega would bring back the phantasy star series as a single player rpg they really need to let us revisit the algol system segas gold mine rpg series and they let it set in the moth balls subscribed like the way you relate to the viewer also upbeat attitude saw you at the first time because of octopath instantly subbed but dude less coffee youre getting a heart attack super pumped for this game game of the year this guy has used psychedelics in the past that i am sure of and yet square wont do this with final fantasy ever again still picking this up though im new into jrpgs and really enjoying the genre does anyone have any good jrpgs i should try out sometime its cool when rpgs change up the battle music midway through the game ive played a small handful that does that future rpgs should do this more often can you imagine a final fantasy vi remake on this engine and art style i preordered the wayfarers edition of the game gonna get it tomorrow looks like my playthrough of axiom verge metaverse edition is going to be put on hold after all i also only played the first demo and cant wait for this game what a time to be alive too many games to get to i got the wayferers edition coming in the mail i was really hoping for a modern day saga game like the snesps1 games still cannot wait to crack that collectors edition tomorrow how long does it take to beat all 8 stries im a bit torn on this game from my experience with the demo the combat is pretty cool and the visual design is gorgeous but the writing and va was just terrible love the review but this game is definitely not my cup of tea dear boy im picking my preorder up tomorrow so excited what is it about these hardintothesweaty rpgs that is so appealing i love the game lol i feel like theres gonna be a backlash to this game because its been so hyped non jrpg fans are going to get destroyed and frustrated nice review i get this game tomorrow and i cant wait intertwine the stories and characters stories dont intertwine doe really nice review johnny ive watched this a few times now ha this game looks like an instant classic already if square enix uses this engine for a hopeful final fantasy v and vi remake it would be the greatest johnny is my spirit animal fucking love this dude favorite channel on youtube you have to go balls deep make sure you leave nothing but the nuts hanging out with this game how the effen is this not coming to the ps4 they finally make a game that look amazing and makes it exluso makes me sad this game feels more like a saga frontier or romancing saga game pretty cool good review how many hours does it take roughly to complete first time hearing about this definitely looks and sounds like a saga game i dont own a switch though so i dunno if ill get to play it damn i am fighting the temptation to bring my switch with me to work tomorrow so i can play this all day instead of actually working its so puuuuurty awesome review as always btw octo meaning eight from from ancient greek and latin octso octo eight path traveler your facial expressions in the thumbnails for your videos always have me worried until i watch the video lol this is the first game to make me want a switch im hoping itll be multiplatform after a year or so this would be the perfect game for my vita but i know it wont come there i just finish xenoblade chronicles 2 i know now whats my next rpg this channel is awesome discovered ys viii and love it thank you sir i also pre ordered this game how can anyone dislike this guys review genuine and a pleasant to listen to thanks for the review i honestly dont know how to approach this game i have the same thought as you in the beginning but now i know what to expect and sure will enjoy this game i have that shirt and ive been excited about this game for months ive been nursing my way through the demo but tomorrow is finally the day turn based rpg for the win how come you and jkb upload at the same time these days i went into a forest and got absolutely destroyed lol love the review keep it up and your shirt is fantastic when i first saw this game during the switch release i really thought it was final fantasy tactics 2 what square now needs to do is use this engine and remake all their old classic rpgs i would love that cant wait for mine to come in tomorrow i was lucky enough to get the wayfarers edition and i have been really excited for probably a month now if i wasnt already eagerly awaiting this games release tomorrow now john has me superhyped to pick this up and play the heck out of it nice review as always im so conflicted on if i should pick this up im good at rpgs like witcher dark souls bloodborne dragonage elder scrolls etc always been trash at turn based gave up on divinity original sin 2 and disgaea 5 i think the only turn based game ive seen through to the end is mario and rabbids kingdom battle cause luigi is friggen op great review and great video i am very excited to get my collectors edition copy tomorrow i started the prologue demo with haanit and fell in love with the game its like you said 100 throwback to old school games that are epic and still hold up today this is one of the many games that really makes me want to get a switchmortgage and diapers or the switch and games damn responsibles donations anyone jk sometimes i wish you could turn random encounters off in these games so you can explore and make sure you havent missed anything man i wasnt sure about this game but i dunno im kinda getting won over here good to know the combat is fun ive got nothing against grinding in rpgs in fact i love it look at these enemy sprites theyre awesome tributes to the 16bit ff games wow love that reviewers should take 110 point off for games without manuals i love the look of these games so muchits just a pity that im shit at playing them oh well back to shantae i loved your review im really looking forward to playing this now plan on playing it all weekend thank you for no spoilers does the game run well like drop off fps game crash you never tall about this picking it up tomorrow johnny your the first reviewer ive heard stating its a spiritual successor to the saga games you know your rpgs sir sounds kind of like trails then sky had some 50 minute boss battles and the world building and character development are bar none before you said it felt like a spiritual successor to the saga games i said to myself huh this kinda sounds like a saga game ive been playing saga frontier again and have played other games in the series and theyre so weird that i have this lovehate relationship with them but i still keep playing i dont have a switch yet but ill probably get this when i do thanks to your review after final fantasy turned into a barebones gameplay mess with multi season passes to try and tell a full story the bravely games really took over as my favourite jrpg series recently seeing some of the same team work on this really sold me on it im glad to see its as fun as the bravely games without the last act issues they had im gonna go get this game like right now great review i was super excited for this for an entire year and a half but ive heard some very extremely concerning negatives i keep hearing from multiple credible sources that the characters dont intertwine in any degree of justification apparently the writing is very low level cant wait for this preordered this six months agowish they still made rpgs like this are there any zelda a link to the past type rpgs on the switch i thought it was crap at first to and played the demo at first and didnt like it this second demo has impressed me so much so i preordered it and will be picking it up tomorrow great review johnny this is going to be my first true jrpg i cant find the game for pc is this switch only omg pls ps4 release eventually im checking this game out looks so good on the switch awesome reviewthanks man youre playing with japanese sound as well lol thats the only correct way to play the way this game looks to play octopath traveler would be an awfully big adventure the only thing i dont like that there is not much charackter interaction other than that i am quite happy too many games too little time the graphics and gameplay just turned me off plus the demo was boring as hell i love johnny millennium but i dont love this game anyhow will like this video cause i get to hear johnny talk not sure should a game get rated for what it is and what it was aiming for or should a game get rated by the audience who might buy the game i understand the approach and the thought that it may be too much for a rpg newcomer but would it be a better game if some mechanics would have been simpler would it also be better for rpg veterans if it were more friendly to newcomers this isnt meant as criticism it is just a thought and i really love your videos if i wasnt already sold to this game with your verdict now just take my money i feel like the only damn person who isnt excited for this game a lot of things about it rub me the wrong way i dont like the battle system boosting strategy filled turn based battles are annoying to me i dont care much for the art style characters or story either sadly its the same kind of uninteresting as bravely default to me i tried the demos i didnt like them if a game is uninteresting regardless of what the internet says about how good it is i wont be able to enjoy it the only turn based combat rpg ive ever played is persona 5 but i finished it im ready to take on a new challenge that is a step up 75 of this game is battles ugh i like the battles the least i pretty much just want to explore and experience the stories i liked bravely default where you could turn battles off so tired of this nostalgia bait artstyle why even hire an artist that talented to just make his designs 16bit well i guess without his art assets you wouldnt know what the characters look like staggering sounds like a shin megami tensei rip off to me so excited to go get this game tomorrow seems good enough and it seems to have enough content to keep me entertained until dragon quest xi gets here i only wish the title was better makes me think of octomom thought there was way too much talkie talkie in the demo but the combat was super fun i like what i am see but i still need to see more from nintendo tho good game i really need that tshirt inmediatly getting wayfarers editon so excited breath of the wild mario oddysey xenoblade chronicles 2 octopath traveller kirby star allies fire emblem captain toad treasure switch is in fire love the art style i got my compendium edition today and cant wait to play the whole day tomorrow the more challenging the better i look forward to getting balls deep in this game my copy arrived 2 hours ago and a day early i played the prologue demo a couple of weeks ago which u play the game from the very beginning but for a maximum of 3 hours onlybut your save data carries over to the full game so im now 5 hours in and loving ota brilliant rpg and must buy for all sw owners i think the lack of strategy and difficulty is part of what caused the decline of jrpgs if youre just pressing one button over and over youll get bored a few hours in i will be balls deep in this game come tomorrow this game looks amazing i cannot wait to play it is there a chance for a ps4 release of this i really like how this game has that old school sprite look but done in an hd environment the switch is already shaping up to be a pretty great rpg machine cant wait to play this tomorrow this game is how i imagined a new star ocean game in one of my dreams a long time ago a 2d game that uses 3d lighting and 3d effects to enhance the 2d excited for this game amazon already has it shipped on its way i have off tomorrow night and go on a 2 week vacation staring next week so i am deff going balls deep into this game this and toads treasure hunter my xbox and playstation is going to feel neglected really bad name for a game i cant believe square enix just suddenly released romancing saga 4 looks right up my alley will def grab this eventually when i have a switch hey um one question like i really really want to play this game but like i cant afford to buy a switch will it be a switch exclusive or will it come to pc grinding for 6 hours at a time isnt that not good isnt there another way to make a game challenging without having you repeat the same tasks for that long i dont mind a bit of grinding but that seems a bit extreme got the wayfarer edition on the way 141 wheres your arm i have a ps4 but this looks great only if the story is good late to the party with the prologue demo but it seems its one of those games you have to get deep into and im fine with that these type of games are tailored for us 30 crowd that grew up in the 90s lets gooooo friday you know i absolutely love your videos your energy and excitement is extremely addictive you exude the joy and happiness that comes out of playing video games keep up the amazing work you shouldnt review a game you havent completed all of the comments made in this video could have been ascertained from playing the demo oh man i cant wait picking up the special edition tomorrow super excited wow what a great review very indepth your enthusiasm is apparent and you make the game sound charming and engaging i was already committed to buying it but now im afraid i will have to purchase it twice good review john lets get together this summer and have a bbq jkb in b4 reviewers compare it to dark souls for being too hard the lack of character action is concerning but the game is otherwise fantastic from the 3 hours ive played a love letter to fans of jrpgs like a lot of the hcg fanbase im still mad the demo kicked me out thankfully its almost friday yay when we getting that collectors unboxing ive been blown away by everything about this game mechanics story character depth music im thinking goty for me wait what other reviews say that theres hardly any overall story arc and that theres nearly no party interactions i hope you are correct and they are not your first before hands on impression of the game is literally my exact feeling cashing in on a nostalgic aesthetic but now im kinda interested now after seeing your review team olberic the warriors path indeed i love the style of the game its a new take on old school graphics if that makse sense but i cant wait to play it once i get my switch matt so excited to get on with this game the second demo has set me up to dive right in cant wait for the release tomorrow good shit johnny save often i like that the game tells you in that way damn im in the middle of ys 8 right now and this shows up tomorrow must finish ys johnny your reviews are amazing man what did you think of the job system didnt mention that compare to the bravely default games from the same devs i really dont like the look of it but its nice to know it aint trash cant wait to see all of the videos for this review it looks like a 32 bit game its beautifull is there an overarching plot or is it 8 different stories with 8 different endings oof i really want this game but the more i hear about it the more it sounds like its just too big for me to properly tackle right now i want to be able to invest the time into it that it needs but i dont see that happening i need today and tomorrow to hurry up i need this kind of rpg in my life my body needs this after final fantasy lost its soul i agree with you 100 and also gave it a 85 75 of the game is combat sold johnny always praises a game like its incredible and gives it an 8 or and 85 i always expect him to say 9 or 95 by the way he goes on and on lol good review though been following this game since before the switch came out glad its good cant wait to play going to pick this up tomorrow been anticipating this for quite some time now should squareenix ever get round to remaking final fantasy vi they may as well remake it like this it doesnt need a full blown remake like ffvii imho whats with loot do you find something useful in dungeons or do enemies drop something good i am really not a fan of only buying upgrades in towns great review johnny ive had my switch for about a month now and im really loving it and ive been waiting for this game to come out it really looks like a solid experience close to what the original lunar games provided on the sega cd or any other older rpgs ive played in the past cant wait until i can get a copy 100 hours of gameplay tons of side quests see everyone in a month i am listening to all this review of grinding for 5 hours and getting destroyed if you arent careful or prepared and i am getting flash backs to some of my problems with bravely default the first game by this studio and my major problem with it being a terrible difficulty curve especially on hard mode once you get into chapters 6 and 7 where you have all the best equipment are max level and all jobs mastered and the game just suddenly doesnt know what to do so it just number pumps all the enemies and yet your characters are remaining flat does this game have a similar problem first if there is a hard mode and second does it have the bravely default problem where you get to a point in the game where you are fully leveled and geared and yet the game instead of being enjoyable is still just hard not due to actual tactical difficulty but because the game is just number pumping the enemies to be to difficult my balls are ready the second that i hear that this game is good im already sold on buying it good review the game looks pretty sweet this game looks amazing to me wish it was coming to other platforms as bad as i want to play it its not enough for me to buy a switch please come to ps4 eventually maybe an ultimate edition someday or something just wish they changed the name by now im actually quite happy to hear that it is a style of rpg that really wants you to invest time into it in order to progress through it i think too many people rush through games in order to play the next one when a game in itself should be savored and enjoyed to its fullest i actually like the sound of this games approach when it comes to transitional difficulty i think some games should force you to grind because its no fun if you can generally coast through a game right to the end im looking forward to giving this game a try when i eventually get a swtich johnny im growing a mustache i hated saga frontier but i loved playing the demo for this game finally a reviewer that doesnt spoil everything thanks dude i save first and go into those dungeons to get destroyed it was part of why i decided to stop the demo and just wait for the game those danger zones are blocked off in it ive been hearing that the characters barely interact with each other which is a little disappointing but not a deal breaker i love the battle system and game world from what i played really looking forward to getting this game though prob wont get into it straight away because im hammering away at rainbow skies on the ps4vita right now this has been my most eagerly anticipated switch game played the 1st demo for hours loved the battle system so much i overgrinded for some extra hours i find this battle system much better than bravely defaults ill be lost in this game for a bit and a bit more and a bit more time see everyone in a couple months yeah yeah good game but how pumped are you about shenmue 1 2 rerelease i cant bloody wait its been about 10 years maybe more since my last playthrough im glad its not geared towards people new to rpgs it means its not watered down mystic quest ring a bell cant wait for this game tomorrow and loved the demos it was weird how much bigger the human enemies are than the player characters lol graphics kinda remind me of final fantasy tactics but on a 16 bit type rpg btw how have you liked shining resonance so far i no you like the shining series just was wondering awesome video johnny is the special edition just avaiable for pre orders or is also avaiable at day 1 i really want to dig into this game it haves that old school vibe of classic snes rpgs the golden era cant wait to pick it up tomorrow what would my video be called on this one johnny really nice job with the editing on this johnny looks like it took some time glad to hear you love the game gonna have to pick it up thanks for this bro i cannot wait to sink my teeth into this gonna be tasty p i wish that they released this games for amdroid and ios too eventually final fantasy 6 remake in this style next squareenix please so its just another classic square grindfest man i miss golden sun so much lol shows how much i pay attention to this consoledidnt even know this game was outhell my switch hasent been turned on for like 6 months maybe even morefranklyi think im outgrowing video games in generalnothing can peak my intrest any more and all see to be old rehas of games pasthell the only game i play now and the only game i got installed on my 3000 pc is heroes of the storm many modern jrpgs look to much anime for my personal taste the art design represents the style i loved as a kid i wish mor games would look like that instead of that emo manga look that the characters final fantasy have for example no hate on that i just dont like it i cant wait until tomorrow im not much of an rpgjrpg fan at all really but i decided to try the 3 hour demo because why not and i must say now im hooked on this game i cant wait to pick up my copy tomorrow im sure this will be my next 100 hours switch game great review johnny ive been waiting weeks for these reviews i didnt want to buy a switch for just odyssey and botw this may be the game that finally gets me to cave not that this is a system seller but what finally makes me purchase the console goty what now sony fangays any chance on ps4 jynx needs to buy a switch ahhh i tried so hard to finish ys viii but im not quiet there yet dilemma do i pick up octopath traveler and keep it shrink wrapped until i finish ys or do i rip it open throw it in my switch and potentially risk not coming back to ys oh the first world problems ive been waiting for this to come out so i can pick up my reservation at gamestop lol a lot of people are comparing this to dragon warrior is it a very grind heavy game great review thank you cant wait for tomorrow really excited to explore the different multi job combos to come up with my dream party see this is why i was baffled as to your negative look on the game being someone that played the demo for hours i was confused because i knew youd like it im glad youre enjoying it now it really is a special game sillicon studios are really coming into their own cant wait for their future releases great review even more interested in this now combat sounds a bit like persona just gotta convince my girlfriend to let me use her switch now i have been looking forward to this game so much thanks for the great review im in canada aswell and it doesnt come out till tomorrow johnny i wish it was out now im so ready for this game tomorrow getting balls deep hahaha cant wait to get my copy of this it looks fantastic the graphics are somehow super satisfying looking the gameplay is great cant wait i always love that shirt youre sporting great review love your channel we needed more classic rpg games how old is this game i recently caught the remastered version for the switch and i love the artistic design to it im crying in first minute this game beautiful this was just announced as coming to the pc im stoked dogshit voice acting its so much better when its turned off i tried the 3hr demo with cyrus today but i couldnt beat the boss i need help uwu definitely getting this game anyone know what song that is in the haanitzaanta flashback damn u se why only switch argh jeez sooo much talkin and dialogue damn man oh my gosh until this video i didnt know that i am such partial to that archaic english conjunctions i am neither a linguistics nerd more of the nature science and technology kind studying applied computer science at ruhruniversitt bochum nor am i an english person by myself but it sounds so much more personable to my ears than regular modern english does that may just be because its similarity to my mother tong german is bigger in this version but its still terrific but i love modern english too though i am not the best at it its so much easier to me to understand english than speaking it fluently d i dont like these type of combat where the environment does not play any role seems a bit too repetitive and simple my enthusiasm for this has been decreased hopefully its just the crappy player but the last fight took too long gosh this will make me buy a switch dammit i wish this was on the ps4 the graphic is horrible whomstveevernt wrote this dialogueth this reminds me of suikoden too much ad disliked and unsubbed cool game i tested the demo d dont understand the hype for this and i love jrpgs this game looks like an absolute snoozefest anyone else find the voice acting horrible in this game ill still buy it but its really bad imo gotta love how she just summoned a mosswine from monster hunter for healing there ya go i want this game on ps4 dammmn glorious 2d rpg keep em coming nintendo the way they talk is annoying af when is this game coming out damn dude had no idea it was voice acted too this game looks insane may have to get a switch for this looks amazing i can see this game getting a 1010 wow the music alone is enough to make me want to buy this game i like how the creature doesnt even react when you hit it cant get much lazier than that ive seen better rpg maker games like school of lust imagine stardew valley with these graphics now i just need to wait for a switch sale i got an ad for octopath before the video like im not waiting for the minute it releases with cash in hand im so gosh darn jazzed for this game cant wait salt and sanctuary vibes where are the people saying that turn based rpg are dead i hate the fact that you dont actually hit the enemy ill pass on this game the demo was class my poor poor wallet already preordered those 3hrs demo had given me the chance to play ophilias prologue aswell as haanits and the scholars just looks like a standered rpg to me and it seems to be very overrated if only they made a star ocean like this i am bored of classic rpg styles time to ignore it active imagination required to play this game i hope they port this to other systems eventually reminds me of valkyrie chronicles preordered wayfarers edition the hype is real i got a fortnite ad for nintendo switch on this video dude the dialogue is basically two worlds 1 this screams nostalgia love the artistic direction gameplay more like reading 7810 too much pixels it seems cool but fighting the same enemy makes me wanna not play this damn game dat music dem graphics i didnt care about this game or found it interesting until i played the demo wow this looks gorgeous can you turn voices off serious i dont know what is it about the game but i honestly think it looks kind of dull i love 2d art and jrpgs but something feels off here also voice acting on 2 dimensional characters feels weird therions intro is cool and funny at the end but i like olberic story better its more warrior focus and his connection with the village boy paul really gave me the feels since olberic treated paul as a son my most anticipated game for nintendo switch period if youre a fan of rpgs or think pokemon lets go is too casual for your taste buy this game i really liked primrose from that 1st demo and i started with haanit in this 3 hour demo and she seems really cool how was the characters for everyone else finally a old school game play like rpg with amazing graphics they should make more like this love these games ill pick the thief therion horribly played you can almost perma stun him wirh rain of arrows since the start if u go with the thief the fight ia freaking hard i love those visuals i cant even get through chapter 2 of anyone but that aint gonna stop me you should narrate on audible on sale in the eshop right now friends not sure how i slept on this for so long but it looks amaazzzinngg i dont know who funded this 90s rpg rip off but next time please dont add any prostitutes and pimps this game has also some very poor written plot and character development most of it is trope garbage come on nintendo 60 georges for this love this game so much just bought it a week ago one of the best games ever made thank you square and nintendo 3 aboslutely underrated love this game in its entirety and its fun filled my love towards this game is u n p a r a l l e l why 1520 game sells for 60 on pc this is like indie game and no more 15 will be good price im having bravely default withdraws and this is all i want rn good memories of ps2 soul nomad the world eaters hype saga frontier types of game this will be good ive never had the dedication to go back and replay a game from the start this game was the first id played it before clocking in about 60 hours and i wasnt done yet i was training for the true final boss then one day i started a new save file and accidentally saved over that 60 hour file it was a crushing feeling it was my favorite game still is and id put more time into that game than any other game at the time even more than my old favorites like kirby and pokemon but i wasnt ready to come back to it i didnt want to come back to it i stopped for 2 months then i put the cartridge back in i saw that new save file where my old file was i didnt want to go back but at the same time i did it was and is my favorite video game hands down the stories the pixel art style the music everything it pulled me back in and now here i am with a fully restored save file from scratch and with the game 100 completed in 80 hours im so gl damn that opening theme immediately reminds me of suikoden i thought the new zelda game would be like breath of the wild but its completely different the graphics arent the same and y arent any puzzles you need to figure out its just seems they havent tried that hard to make a sequel to breath of the wild to me they need an rpg make engine with this format graphics fun fact the narrator for launch trailer of octopath traveler is the same movie trailer announcer that you hear during the sneak previews from disney home entertainment mark elliot game with 0 split history and only one path game on 1h xd this game i love rpgs i love having 2 classes i love story kinda i love everything about dis game broken just completely broken cant believe i paid 60 dollars for this sorry excuse for a game can i feel nostalgic for this already because i do secret of mana ff tactics square this game is great but can you make super mario rpg 2 230 i was right at that moment not interested anymore but 5 seconds later the 4th wall became interesting bravely default is b3tter i got the game as a christmas gift and i already played like 5 hours its awesome only can recommand it the star ocean second story fan in me is singingtoo bad ill never get this on xbox ever the characters looks like lego blocks walking aroundand this is 2018 game it looks like something a three year old would play o0 i need this in my life this looks pretty fun i need this game even the demo was so satisfying the voiceover on this is laughably bad did no one actually listen to this before they released it this is a great example of how horrible lighting can ruin good graphics i am a huge fan of square enix i have been playing their games from the beginning their business strategy is terrible if they are struggling for money you dont continue to do dlcs if it doesnt meet the growth margins simple supply and demand with some base understanding of economics will tell you that i dont know who is officially making these decisions but they have lost sight of what it is to be a company otherwise they would get their crap together and create some proper time lines and deliver on promises within budget anotherwords dont make promises you cant keep and do some simple marketing to find out what your audience actually wants and deliver very sad day because the last time they did this crap they almost lost everything im not sure they will survive this round without some internal restructuring is this just a ff reskin i hope the story is exceptional because gameplay does not look unique imagine ff6 remade like this oh i could die happy yo nintendo this looks good another game similar to this you should consider remaster final fantasy tactics advance the old gameboy advance game heck it wouldnt even need much maybe use the orchestra music and maybe up the resolution the rest of the game could stay the same is there a japanesevoice pack doesnt this game remind you of bravely default and bravely second to anyone dear nintendo please use this game engine for a zelda a link yo the past reboot oh my god this is some dissidia opera omnia in the battle system grandia would be so sweet on the switch right now soooooo whens legend of mana coming out really square enix truly did wonders making this game an authentic rpg experience thank you when i saw this game i saw the original soul of jrpg i could spend 200 hours in this kind of game easily want someone know where is the horse rider boss is this game short primrose too slutty for a nintendo platform they ripped off music from chronotrigger just watching this makes me reminisce of valkyrie profile this game is amazing thank you square enix i have played about 2 hours so far and im absolutely in love with this game what more can i say except for how beautiful the artwork and music are thanks to square enix and nintendo for such an amazing game i hope you can beat the game with any characters combinaison not only a meta combinaison like fighter healer mage i have another idea for kirbys update paint roller from kirby nightmare and make a plush of it but for the plush remember the picture of the black legs on paint roller in kirby nightmare put it on paint roller bravely default is this a vast rpg for the switch nintendo sues to shut down two big rom sites which offers nintendo games for free that are twenty years and older nintendo itself doesnt sell old games anymore so leave them alone can we get a tactics ogre game like this finally that would be a gold mine can they add princess zelda and link as a dlc characters on this game or maybe dlc outfit please nintendo with all the comments switch owners yelled at other games platform i guess its just fair if i also say it here please bring this to ps4 square im sorry but i was so bored its a pretty game but idk this type of game is for a very particular audience this game is gonna sell terribly because people dont like single players as much compare to before oh wait i really want this but i have to wait a month for my birthday feelsbadman i played this game with dictionary im playing it right now and the only thing im sad about is how none of the characters interact with the others during each characters story which i feel hurts the overall game as i see some of the characters speaking up to voice their opinion based on whats going on i would say for the sequel to add character interaction during main stories as well as possible romance between characters based on interactions and whose been with who would love to play it but the dolar price went really high on my country so no octo for me feelsbadman well damn after almost a decade squeenix has developed a original property that actually looks interesting do next waluigi story this looks amazing why u guys banned pokemon brick bronze if u dont have nintendo pokemon sun and moon pokemon brick bronze u can play for free so pls tell roblox to unbanned pokemon brick bronze 1 like if u agree x add shadow and waluigi in super smash looking for xenoblade chronicles 2 dlc i bet one of the characters from this game will be in smash why do you make it so hard to make a nintendo account why why would you do such a thing to bricks and bronz loving this game so far is this anything like the paper mario series i dont know if this is the right time to say it but what if you were to make a high quality racing game like a real good one that would be amazing if you made a game like that smash smosh this is real unbending hype you know what would be really cool of you guys to put on the nintendo switch the sims 4 we all would really love it octopath and bloodstained have some of the best new osts if its your cup of tea i did an octopath medley on my channel in a calm classical guitar style man i want a switch to play this game need a turnbased shining force game for 2020 please someone make a review of the connections with bd and bs its finally out i have

this httpsdiscordggkzauy3h i wish i could get this game but 60 dollars is a little too much for me considering pokemon and smash are coming out are u more hyped for this game or dragon quest 11 still wish it was on 3ds holy cow i may have to put ys8 on the back burner this is amazing ive been playing it but is no one concerned about the map size each region has like 2 areas and they list the name of the continent as if there is more than one but literally no one has shed light on this so the curiosity is killing me open to any discussions i will never forgive you for not add waluigi to smashcan you please make a game for waluigi i knew i wouldnt be disappointed when i look at the happy people who ordered it it just makes me feel sad because i dont have enough money for the switch and the game i hope all of you with the game have a great time playing it octopath traveler will sell a million copies pretty quickly even though this game is coming out i have yet to see any commercials for it on tv nintendo should advertise it more if they wanted it to sell really well it looks like a really decent game imo if this game can run 3d system on 3ds this game must look gorgeous so anyway this game is must buy on nin switch take my money damn this sucks i tried the demo which i really enjoy but im too broke for this lmao the routing for speedrunning this is prob gona be intense this game is so good i dont have a switch so many possibilities glad the 3 hr demo transferred over now the hard part which team to useso hard i love them all buy this game twice people excited to play this i need but i dont have money ahhhhhhhhhh i dont care for this game gimme the old final fantasy games on the eshop instead subtle how the first letter of the 8 protagonists names spell out octopath its a nice touch this game is getting more and more hype when i get back home next week ill be buying this is there already an estimate on how long the game will be mine arrives tomorrow but im still curious how many hours ill be spending on this gem when mh stories 2 or dx for switch of course i dont have any money when a game that i wait comes oh well maybe in a few weeks i cant believe they pulled this off tttt so amazing ermygerdddddddd never thought id say these world about anything but this game looks so perfectly quaint its actually that quaintness thats incredibly appealing lol thief cleric sond weird this game is amazing jim sterling is very happy right now to the people who picked therion first im ready are you meh not a fan because i dont need another switch game i hadnt really looked into this game this trailer sold me on octopath and i will be picking my wayfarer edition up from best buy today my wallet hates you nintendo does this game have a good story another good game i have to buy this monthwell rip wallet i preordered the game on amazon prime its soposed to arrive today but i dont think it will my only concern is how long is the game after you get everyones individual quests done is there an over arcing story that purposely unites them and keeps the plot going i can get like three of the characters in three hours thats doesnt bode well with the longevity of the game i dont want it to feel like im jumping from each characters story and the others are just on there for the ride and contribute nothing save in battle inb4 all 8 protagonists are smash bros ultimate as the second square enix representation and not sora just bought the game ill be getting it at a later date too many other games im playing right now and not enough time therion is best boy so i gotta get some money to buy the game i dont need it i dont need it i neeeeed iiiiiiiit i have it amazing game this game looks amazing ive never been so excited for a game to release ever is this game 60 i dont think this is not worth 60 imo it looks like a glorified snes game or indie title 30 at most imo the storys good it doesnt need a single objective for everyone and the characters do interact who came here from projared the best 8 bit game ever i was hesistant about getting a switch because all i knew was i wanted zelda this looks fantastic and i do want to get it thank you for this game se i love this game but i wish it wasnt so much the art style is horrible yuk my first ever video game i preordered and bought day 1 great game so far im quite a few hours in and its meeting my expectations carrying save data from the data to the game and being able to complete all stories in one go are something that i really appreciate about this game and is the tipping point that got me to buy it i just want to point out that on the map each character is directly across from the party member with the similar path action for example tressa is across from therion and alfyn is across from cyrus add bluetooth please because im trying to to use xbox 1 s controller because my left joycon is not working this game seems so amazing i loved the demo cant waint to get my hands on the full game who would you take on your journey pointer shows cyrus and ophilia cyrus best husbando ophilia best waifu cant wait to buy it bbut my mony i need mony for ssmash and mmonster hunter why nintendo the fact that i dont have to play the game 8 times for each story is great most jrpgs make you play a bunch of times to play different mcs nobody wants this game its on my wish list ive waited so long its finally here besides fire emblem i think this might be my reason for buying a switch still unsure on this game only want it because of the hype for it but the demo didnt get hooked but it reminds me of golden sun which i loved and hope we get a new switch golden sun at some point wow weve never seen a break system in a square enix game before that being said this still looks awesome there goes my weekend the demo is so awesome i just hope theres more interactions between them in the full game thatd make it perfect if i get the game im getting the scholar this rpg is amazing all those who love rpg should give it a try only complaint is the vignetting and excessive bloom fine with bloom but remove the vignette aside from that its gorgeous picking mine up this afternoon so excited it makes sense that this was made by square enix the new fire emblem looks great im kind of hoping square enix can do an ff6 remake with some assets from this gamepossibly made a switch exclusive i had it preloaded so i played for like 4 hours last night is the wayfarers edition worth it that just sounds like grinding an rpg 8 times in the same playtru russian please mine didnt come in the mail i want a switch pocket clamshell design to play this awesome game nintendo ty amazon i have my copy happy launch day and happy friday the 13th be sure to support nintendo and square enix when you purchase this switch exclusive super nesstyle unreal engine 4 powered jrpg masterpiece octopath traveler i dont need it i dont need it i defenitley dont need it i dont need it

get started spoilers spiderman dies in infinity war cant wait for this game rpgs are one of my favourites so i was curious to see how this one would play after playing the demo i was impressed i am definitely buying it i love this game for those not understanding the name octopath it is an acronym for all the main characters o ophilia c cyrus t tressa o olberic p primrose a alfyn ttherion h haanit its 3d and 2d gordon ramsay finally some good fcking food yeah i started playing at 12 am and i really cant stop my gamestop doesnt open for another 30 minutes plz nintendo make naruto shippuden ultimate ninja heroes 4 road to baruto available for switch i skipped the first demo just because i didnt think this game wasnt anything too special then the direct happened and i thought to myself what the heck this game looks gorgeous why didnt i pay much attention to it before nintendo then released the 3hour demo and i didnt want to stop playing after my time was up this game is amazing the battle system is so much fun and the characters are really cool not a dayone purchase for me because im short on money but believe me i will buy this game as soon as possible cant wait to see future dlcoh wait thats right this is a complete game i guess theres no need worry about it terrible review scores major disappointment who gotwill get the special edition i literally just got the pun octopath traveller 8 path of traveller like 8 different character well done so hype heres hoping for no shipping issues looks boring all around but thats just me are we not gonna talk about how the names of the characters spell out octopath ophillia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion haanit got mine today collectors at half nine best friday the 13th this game is bad turnbased nah im good hold up they said all the choices are yours to make i dont remember there being a play it safe option with therion or a screw my best friendsister my father is dying im not leaving him optipn for ophilia i mean i wish the option was there but of course the game wouldnt be any fun if you chose those paths so its fine this looks great but i dont have a switch waiting for me at home3 all of them freaking so hyped for this this is too much for me my body is ready but my eyes are not please make the text size adjustable unfortunately nintendo this isnt knack 3 cant wait to play in a few hours i can play this the wait is killing me ive heard that the characters they each have their owns story but have no a common story is this real really they dont make any relationship or making story with other characters unless fighting together my game is going to arrive tomorrow afternoon cant wait they should do a fan vote and whichever of the 8 characters get the most votes that one should be added to smash bros ultimate to represent octopath traveler this game looks amazing but my wallet is hurting too much i pre ordered 2 60 games planning to get at least one more game rip meh im pumped for this game im picking it up when i get off work excitement level is over 9000 just so everyone is clear there is almost no interaction between the eight characters no story reason for them to travel they dont interact during story cutscenes however the art style is phenomenal and unique and the battle system is fun this will be an instant classic cant wait to get my special edition today i really hope they add a way to turn off that depth of field it was killing me during the demo in an otherwise beautiful game really wanna buy the game but the lighting makes it impossible to see whats going on and hurts yer eyes wish there was a way to turn off the shaders i just love looking at the scenery im ready for you i wish i had a switch just bought it uwu you its funny that they said the name was just a placeholder and yet they kept it all this time i wonder what was the other choices if done right this would be an incredible anime just bought it today my insomnia is ready getting this game today cant wait d already preordered picking this up after work true story in my car outside my local gamestop i waited a long time for this i am not getting this just doesnt appeal to me got capt toad instead but i hope this sells like crazy so square does more for switch like kingdom hearts or even a traditional dynasty warriors unlike that awful open world dw 9 inticreate announcer is that you this is more important than that 2k wwboring19 broken lame game that isnt coming to switch it was painful waiting for this to unlock on my switch and i am loving it so far this is going to be one of the deepest and most vast rpgs of all time bought it today in australia and have just spent 6 hours playing it non stop this game is amazing its here hopefully the devs focus now making the 3rd bravely default this gives like a ragnarok vibe i hope they do lunch osu clicked because of the beautiful thumbnail art but disappointed that its more 16 bit 3ds bait only on nintendo switch mines

pop up book supposed to come in today but it aint here yet reeeeeeee once you get past the first 500 hours the game gets great again id did not seen this video i do not plan to watch it its not my kind of video but i heard great things about it by someone else so im going to give a 93 it makes you feel like octodad too bad videogamedunkey didnt play bravely default where you can disable random encounters such a boring game it would have flopped hard if it came out on the snes there are better examples of sprite rpgs out there some decades old this game is an old school rpg one of dunkeys most disliked genres to play so this is a fair review so if you also dont like old school rpgs dont play it if you do then do simple omg is there a school whiteboard this video is nitpicking and biased bye bye i win anime is so gay jesus christ miitopia is better because you have can have 10 main characters take a shot every time she says your excellency man i hate anime so fucking much good review as always dunk but damn you didnt have to go that hard and send two nukes to japan in 1945 we get it you hate jrpgs and japanese but you went a little to far on this one its like sakurai doesnt care anymore there is a game that my friends and i created in the first chapter of ophelia every time someone said excellence you drink one friend almost died ok now hes just lying you lied about a snail i like the newest octopath but ill get yelled at this video is nitpicking and biased bye bye i win so im certain that someone will stumble upon this comment section again in the future so i have a question how do we know the snail isnt level 1 is that little shield next to it not its level i just know theres some skub about that snails level and i am confused wow this is excellency im no knight just a man with a sword could be a great line depending on context i dont know why you included it the excellency one was unbearable though 7810 this game really makes you feel like your excellency waitthis is the review that got people upset ive in the middle of playing octopath and ive already sunk like40 hours in it and havent even got past the chapter 2 of each traveler there is just somuchgrinding required and like its required because youre going to get your ass beat by the bosses if you dont do the grinding and so far the dialogue isnt inspiring im enjoying the world theyre building so far but these stories need to start going somewhere interesting fast or im gonna never make it to the end i hate you video dunkjima how dare you criticize a game ive never played you are bitpicking and niased bye bye edit i win it has a little for everyone 9510 no mention of the best music in a video game lazy review 12 people filed 30 complaints each over how dunky spoke of that snail child again i have never played octopath traveler x10 animal jayson his videos are made just like steam reviews people read it and then take what you say as fact and then start saying how your opinion is misinformation uh oh dunkey you lied about a snail youre literally criticizing old fashioned jrpgs as a genre not octopath all of the points you made as negative are just characteristics of older or old fashioned jrpgs its actually 1 character x8 youre nitpicking and bias name of the game on 014 bad review he lied about a single enemy i have not played octopath traveler but ur still a big stinky was this a joke about jrpgs and storytelling genre well known for its vapid characters and endless filler that is there to dilute a story written by a 5year old its better be a joke i agree with everything you say except for random encounters it was created due to technical limitations to keep the game running smoothly or to reserve memory space not out of just being a dick why they keep it thats less forgiving i dont know if its for nostalgia or failure to innovate or if theyre worried about people avoiding battling the main focus of the game entirely ah i see where he went wrong he was being nitpicking and biased i win bye bye heres the problem u played the game 15 what the shit does excellency rven mean anymore okay i like rpgs but i love this video i just love people rip in to games in a funny way even if theyre games i like also person 5 is goat cant beat getting to chat with friends with awesome dialogue to boot and super interesting combat styles and visage in battle i remember when jrpgs had generic storylineseg lufia 2s self parodying because the novelty of the gameplay was what was important whats the novelty here you click 3 times to defeat the snail even radiant historia a ds game had more to offer in terms of combat gimmicks and nonlinear storytelling so the characters are generic and uninteresting and on top of that they dont have big boobsnintendo more like nincompooptendo game really makes you feel like octopath i love octopath traveller d whos with me this game really makes you feel like youre a your excellency still in my top 5 switch games a year and a half later dunkey its not very good 25 or 410 ign you can give scores below 9 news to me your excellency ophelia just remember guys you can still enjoy a game while admitting that it has some serious issues butyour excellencyi c youthats nitpicking and biased again i havent played octopath traveler i believe dunkey is right about this game you lied admit it this is one of the only videos i have to disagree with you on how to profit from peoples nostalgia make a game exactly like a 20 years ago one with the same outdated mechanics and graphics sell it at aaa price profit not going to lie xenoblade chronicles 2 is a mess but i actually kind of loved it the terrible voice acting the stale tropy characters and story the love quadrangle the continuous tutorials up until the last chapter of the game where new combat mechanics are introduced i loved it all 235 somebody can tell me what is this game thanks whats that miss my egg salads ready i came to comment again because i forgot about this video but after i found all the characters i was on my way through the hunter girls quest at the time i didnt know i could get the shrines of each characters class and then swap and hybridize my characters for more effectivefaster combat so i fought this boss in the forest that was like a giant treant moose that has these giant mushroomtree minions that it would straight up eat to regain like 5900 hp so i used the apothecary the priestess the knight and the huntress and fought this moosetree for like 2 hours straight i fought it for so long it could no longer summon minions and so it started to eat my characters to restore health but id managed to have an infinite battery on my mp somehow or close to it and so eventually i killed it the prospect of long fights like that actually excited me but then i learned that it would have gone far faster if id just leveled up one of the mage types learned s imagine paying full aaa price for a shit jrpg like this this game really makes you feel like your excellency youre nitpicking and biased i win bye bye your review is bland and bull shit i would like to debate you on this game if you have the ball to do so this game is awesome please dont listen dunkey what you fail to understand is y o u r e x c e l l e n c y but i do love random encounter look at dragon quest xi you can just run pass most of the monster reggie left cause of ask the times dunkey exposed him i love jrpgs and found this game incredibly boring so many amazing jrpgs these days that are so much better dunkey was wrong and again i havent watched this video this game really makes you feel like an octopus this game looks like trash i winbye bye i never liked rpg and this is an example why what are the games at 15 and 16 seconds into the video look really good nope you are nicpicked and biased i win bye but your excellency this game has good music dunkey why are you reviewing something you dont seem to enjoy playing this is why every game needs to be knack 213 i could never put into words why i disliked games like pokemon now i can but again i havent played octopath traveler and i dont plan on it i played this game so i could say youre wrong and dumb but nah this game was a snorefest i dont care about anything thats happening theres nothing noteworthy about the gameplay and i dont want to finish it omg you lyed about snail level you suck and are discrase to all critics fyi i have never played the game tgis video means dunkey is satin i hate round based random fights and this game dares to have round based random fights 15 u cant attack this argument cause i have others oohh if you love random encounter pls try persona 1 haha psycho mantis your excellency you know this concept has been done infinetly better within the saga series eight characters complete freedom in how they play and grow their stats you can go anywhere and do anything and eventually advance the story without any fucking boring grinding its fantastic the best comparison to octopath is the first romancing saga which is what lead me to this conclusion its funny the pioneer of complete jrpg freedom is barely recognised by even the most hardcore square enix fans while this mess was all the hype during release not to mention i can actually name the 8 characters because they arent just carbon copies of jrpg tropes i mean fuck you can have a healer as your protagonist a fucking healer but even then you have the option to make her into a sorcerer or even an axeman as the saga series leveling system specifically allows profeciency in specific weapons and magic types rather than slowly getting your favourite weapons good while also gaining shitty use 9710 ign its a path for each octopus i like octopath traveler your excellency nice quote while having sex meh i liked it alot none of these things ever bothered me abd the grinding really isnt that bad at all looks and sounds good thats about it yep i am nitpicking and biased you win bye bye i was worried i wouldnt like this game but i did the start is slow but eventually the characters kind of interact boss fights are fun and i actually like turned based games too bad you have to unlock the ability to turn down the encounter rate im making all of my subs call me your excellency from now on the music is amazing tho just bought the game dunkey im about to find out how nitpicky and biased you are i remember the tech demo when the switch came out you are nitpicking and biased nope you are just nitpicking and biased i win bye bye i love how the devs called the snail a giant slug when it clearly has a shell yeah im not listening to your review because youre racist to the japanese all the things you just said its why i like octopath traveler nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye they dont interact with each other dear god he never witnessed travel banter they do but only at key points in the plot the whole game is like a saga game at its core minus the random stat growth in fact it is like the romancing trilogy and saga frontier 1 main character does all of the talking as the plot centers around him as the lead but the others do talk at key plot points you can even skip character introductions if you want hell you can complete the game solo if you are so inclined the game offers many ways to play and once again i havent actually played octopath traveler soi dont like turn base rpgpretty much eh well it is not for everyone you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye all this video needed to say was i dont like turn based rpgs and it wouldve had the exact same amount of impact i really thought i would like this game but i didnt i gave it a chance about 25 hours of underwhelming characters and stories until i sold it i probably would have listened to you if you didnt actually play the game too bad the graphics looked pretty good excessive grinding now thats something earthbound doesnt haveif youre good i just feel the need to iterate that i have not played octopath traveller whats that game that donkey showed after undertale now ive never actually been japanese but i can say with 100 certainty that the dunkman is a racist for not like liking octopus traveling that game is a milestone for japanese culture you american swine i hate the grinding of this game even though my main is cyrus and i already keep the evasive maneuver at all cost its a fun game but the grinding can be a pain in the ass they dont interact with each other you must have clearly skipped all the travel banters damni was hoping this was going to be a sarcastic dunkey review and that the game was actually awesome the musics pretty good tho fairly criticizing a nintendoswitch game and a nonff rpg simultaneouslythis incurs a double whammy white knight package he lied about a snail is all im seeing look ive never played octopath but after watching the first few minutes i could already tell you are nitpicking and biased i win byebye but with all that said i still have to give your review a 90100 it just it has a little something for everyone nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye 027 shows ni no kuni i guess everyone has their own tastes i personally never thought of ni no kuni as cringe it just spoke to me like any other ghibli film but the game aint that bad ending is pretty shit but if you are a new rpg fan i can suggest it bruv its an rpg why do you bash the time it takes to kill but yeah character are a bit dumb 042 dc you have the worst characters remember when people liked this game enough to defend it without playing it you know i really wanted to like this game until the moment i noticed theres no interconnected stories i have never played octopus traveler but your opinion is wrong and i think you are are thus a bad critic and you you have lied about a slug in a shell thus i give this a video a 9510 it has a little something for everyone pokemon meets inception i like this description of p5 i respect your opinion dunko but this game is awesome boring content not fun terrible turn based combat 9510 it has something for everyone dunkey you should try legend of legaia good jrpg i guess better than octopath if the main characters actually interacted with each other then it would be pretty neat dunkey is the god of video games you are nitpicking and biest i win bye bye what you should take into account when watching his reviews and videos is that hes admitted things like long storyheavy turnbased jrpgs with random encounters are really not his thing if none of that bothers you then go nuts this is where a lack of understanding of game design hurts dunkey as a critic the most keep in mind i havent played octopath traveler but im right dunkey is my favourite black youtuber i think the fact that the storys of all 8 characters never seemed to join was a very big downside of the game i honestly enjoyed the gameplay for the most part but i think thats a matter of perspective tbh i feel if there was a more clear and unified story the game would have been so much better terrible review 9110 has a little something for everyone mind you ive never played octopath traveler and battle 1 too ooh love that gato song usage personally i really like the xenoblade series aw man i really like xenoblade 2 though debating on buying this game and i just have trouble going through with it or not your excellency ive never played this game its my favorite dunkey you are so wrong in this review of octopath traveler btw i havent play this game the only way you lied is by not showing how fing terrible the hunter girls dialogue is i liked her story best but my lord they fell flat on their face with that translation easily the cringiest part of the game yall are just hating cause dunkey is black you made the mistake of playing this without your game juice and without activating your mario mode domkey is a racist and lied but again i never played this game tbh your just nitpicking and biasd dunkey if you know you hate jrpgs why review one if you hate turn based games how could you possibly have an informed opinion on their gameplay yes this game is really trash its weird to see people trying to call dunkey out for not getting the snails level right when he was level 22 and it was level 11 my problem with this game is how ridiculously slow it is plenty of games are slow but this takes things to a new level on top of that its very grindy so you carry the 6 and not fun nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye 137 i can hear her inhaling and i hate it play three houses this is the most poorly made video i have ever seen from dunkey theres a reason why the dislikes are higheven though most of the blind fans liked it anyway you first begin the video sarcastically like you always do but then you start talking about it in a critical way and this is when the problem starts you cant do both at the same time if you want to do a funny video treat it like one and if you want look at it from a critical perspective then put dunkview in the title it is also a known fact that you dont like traditional turnbased rpgs and jrpgs in general which really doesnt help your case at all in this video you carefully picked clips of bad combat and dialogues for comedic effect but you did it in a critical way which confuses the audience into thinking this is a bad game which is definitely not true i am pretty sure you know how much influence a famous gaming youtuber like you have over the community the fact that you had to point out this video in speaking as someone who generally likes jrpgs and turnbased combat octopath traveler is extremely tedious lol i was looking for an honest to goddess review but reading the comments i see is just filled with trolls just to say the stories are good and its an entertaining game plus i dont know how you played it but the characters do interact with each other travel banter is chrono trigger any good played this game for around 30 hours i finished the thiefs story and really couldnt be bothered to do anyone elses story as a fan of jrpgs and this battle system i had fun trying to get all the jobs and the harder bosses but the stories are just garbage going back to hollow knight to get some satisfaction with minimal storytelling but a way more compelling one anyone else notice that at 104 the background is the same as wesley vs inigo montoya in the princess bride duel scene this game is for little kids obviously imagine coming to a jrpg video in dunkeys channel expecting him to make serious review imagine why did people get triggered over this octopath was just a very generic game sold at aaa price for no warranted reason other than misplaced hype 015 what game us that whatss the game 017 really sucks cuz i saw this game looked at the presentation and was like oh wow this looks like a quality game nope 209 i feel like the writers should study something called pronouns theyre pretty useful well now i want a paper mario dunkview dunkey dislikes something they like people wait thats illegal yeah i stopped listening after he said it really makes you feel like your excellency i stopped listening to this guy after he said the snail in octopath traveller was level 1 now again i have not played octopath traveller peoplei hate this review even though i never played this dunky fansyour nitpicking and biased i win bye bye 8 similar locations and paths 8 boring ass characters 8 cliche stories that dont grab your attention prolonged battles that give you didly shit in cash and exp overwhelming grind to achieve a step forward in progress limited skills that are trashooooh 12 jobs with 5 skills to learn how exciting i truley hope they take this games visual style and system and make something greater out of it i played it through and this video is pretty accurate actually turn based combat is pretty fucking terrible excluding tactical turn based like xcom and what notalways thought so its so brainless thx dunkle i will never understand the hate for this video a man you watch on youtube didnt like the game you like and supposedly didnt like it because he didnt understand it or isnt a good critic heaven forbid we dont all submit to a fucking hive mind of liking the exact same stuff different opinions be damned nope you are nicpicked and biased i win bye bye your excellentie its a shame this game is so shit i always thought it would be at least pretty fun based on the trailers when i got it i played it for a few hours and then just gave up because of how boring it all was my brother did the same a lot of the poor dialogue in jrpgs are a result of bad translations so many phrases in japanese just make absolutely no sense in english unless you have a cultural background i like dunkeys review i just wanted to bring that up he is racist and nitpicky i win bye bye you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye wow out of the 13000 dislikes one of those is a guy who has made 2 videos complaining about dunkeys review but also hasnt even played the game what a legend so in other words if youre impatient you wont like this game your meme comments that actually have little reference to the video and just spouting catchphrases is bad guys dont listen to him the guy doesnt like rpgs and yes i know its theres huge grind but that makes the boss that much better now lets see what you did wrong ah you said that octopath traveler wasnt good you know the people who made bubsy 3d i can make a better review than this in two words its boring bam already better review by the way have not played octopath traveler it has a little something for everyone i think that fallout new vegas is similar in its slow pace except its better in every way than this piece of shit game this was satisfying im gay and you cant tell me im wrong bye bye i played octopath and can say the review is true the game sucks well its kind of a fine game for mebut is your opinion on the game thank you for the video your excellency the game looks pretty but the damn random encounters are annoying af its like i want to enjoy walking around the world but every 5 steps its a damn fight octopath was good for first 5hr then it got old realll fast after that i like some jrpg but i dont wanna go through 7 mins of someone saying your excellency also from what i seen doesnt make me feel like batman so youre objectively wrong i win bye bye theres a difference between bad game and i dont like jrps when many people do i love you dunkey but if you dont like a game like that just dont play it dont give about a bad critique on your audience beacuse of that nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye an actual thing though i love this game like the characters think the stories arent too bad you cant exactly choose your own story without feeling disjointed thats kind of expected heard worse voice acting before and dont show ffx we all know thats on purpose and i actually like random encounters ff13 tried to do it without it but that caused more problems and think the music and visuals are the best gives off a pixel paper mario vibe 7510 octotrash traveler fans so mad this game really makes you feel like your excellency whats the name at 016 and 017 ooo those people are pissed they are out for blood they want dunkey for their lunch this game is such a ripoff of bookworm adventures i have never played octopath traviler and i dont care about turn based rpgs but your reviews suck and you should be kicked off the website for talking about something negativity you are right and i have never played octopath traveler its funny but i cant believe people actually unsubscribed from dunkey and went to that animal jayson guy actually the biggest fools people got upset about this holy shit their fandom must be touchy honestly youre right i myself tend to dislike rpgs and i just realized that the ones i like dont have random encounters most of them also have more to them as well not just go here fight enemies along the way then fight a boss you just straight up lied dunkey i mean i havent played the game but youre nitpicking and biased bye bye dunkey is a bad critic who doesnt like octopath traveler which means he sucks and octopath traveler is a masterpiece let me remind you that i have never played octopath traveler its pretty clever how dunkey does various callbacks to previous videos convincing many to go check them again without even telling them to no you are just nitpicking and biased i winnnnn bye byeeee its got something for everyone i agree with your review and made a bad steam review as well this game is over hyped and its that bullshit that made me pay so much money for the game i like how this man has an opinion and people cant accept it nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye see dunkey doesnt get video games cause hes never played them before i have never played octopath traveler but its the best game out there i have never personally played the game or even liked rpgs but i give it a 1010 one jrpg turn based combat game that i love because you can control your encounter rate is bravely default and bravely second dunkey please play these games i think you would really enjoy the soundtrack story and characters ps default is better than second in music the ophilia cutscenes were the worst frozen ripoff great video your excellency your excellency this video is nitpicking and biased bye bye i win octodad graveler is the best pokemon change my mind this game really makes you feel like an overused meme comment unoriginal reference to the dunkey game critics pt 2 video your lack of knowledge of this game is made clear cause you actually thought that reggie made this game i mean seriously it didnt even come out on the psp i still think octopath traveler is more of a love letter to people who like these kinds of games if you arent a fan of em you wont enjoy it this guy played halfway through the game and put his review up what the fuck ok i played this game for ten hours better put up my review but at the end of the day it has a little something for everyone this game had the slowest starti started with the knight too and then replaying another character intro made me delete it all together i honestly want to know what people saw in this game no sarcasm octopath traveler is a boring game but it has a little something for everyone 9410 you are nitpicking and biased your excellency dunkey this is the worst review of all time once you beat the game and turn on mario odyssey it becomes one of the best games out there did you even play da game dumbley this game was made by octopath travelers brother so it doesent count idiot this video is nitpicking and biased i win bye bye nope yeah i stopped listening to this guy after he said bubsy 3d was bad youre just mad that knack is shit dude i saw that other video about how you suck as a critic and now im all like naaaaaaaaaah donky y u no du all da thaaaaaaaaaangs like do u even have an octowaifu nitpicking and i win bye biased is this video bye why would you even review a game you dont like why not just review knack 2 again i agree that the characters n their stories are a bit generic but thats the aesthetic they were going for hence the 8bit art style as far as dialogue its not completely generic and the characters have their own unique personalities n flair to them but i can see how they dont seem all to compelling the random encounters is a complete nitpick n there is plenty of strategy to kill off enemies easily with debuffs armor breaks abilities n charged attacks plus u can run from a fight so dont lie dunko lastly i do feel that it would be more interesting to see these characters have more involvement in each others story to tie them in and allow for colorful character interactions but these are just a few of my critiques of your criticism of the game you stupid dingus i win gg pick mercy u gay remember he didnt play it you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye your excellency is nitpicking and biased bye bye i win dunkey lied about a snail he is nitpicking and biased i win byebye i have never played octopath traveler you and nitpicking and biased i win bye bye dunsby is a bad critic dunkey the only reason you dont like this game is because your racists unsucribed even paper mario had a badge that allowed you to instantly kill enemies significantly weaker than you bro this is a straight up rpg maker game how the fuck did this get so big nope your are nitpicked and biased i win bye bye people are this up in arms about you making a joking point about how turn based combat in many games is poorly balanced i cant even process caring that much i disagree and really like octopath traveler however i loved this review and it was super funny please make more my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined wow i finally found someone who agrees with me about jrpgs octopath traveler really makes you feel like an octopath traveler that one guy was really that upset by a 7 second joke wow anyone else rewatching this to find jaysons shitty comment see dunkey your mistake with this review was actually playing octopath traveler it has little something for everyone 910 our excellency has explained verbatim why i havent been able to enjoy a turnbased rpg outside of pokemon in the past 17 years those games can take their unoriginal stories and shitty random encounters back to hell 217 pit of spice you lied about the snail dunky admit it youre opinion is wrong tho i havent played octopatg traveler myself nope you are nicpicked and biasedi win bye bye does anyone know if dunkey really took a roundabout way to defeating the snail this really makes you feel like dunkey is a bad critic 9810 it has a little something for everyone well dunkey has said in the past he dislikes the typical rpg making him actually biased against this game that does not make his review unreasonable but he had a more difficult time liking the game more than a typical rpg fan pretty good review for a racist who came after watching dunkeys critics part 2 video i look foward to octopath 2 your excellency returns listen here now mr vidja jam donkey you are nit picky and biased i win bye bye a little something for everyone in defense of random encounters in games many old games did it to improve performance more enemies on screen more power required new games thowell even pokemon got rid of random encounters with the upcoming game let that sink in what is the game at 0014 im so curious guys this clearly isnt even a review it doesnt say dunkview in the title stop nitpicking and being biased i win bye bye dunkey i have never played this game but you are lying about the snail admit it you are just biased and nitpicking bye bye listen dunkey one of my favourite games happens to be octopath travaller but i guess im too nitpicky and biased haha you win even yahtzee mouths many points on this video so i dont get how dunk is wrong thanks to this video i made an important life choice this made me go buy octopath i really enjoyed it 45 out of 10 go get fire emblem three houses 9 outta 10 dunkey is clearly nitpicking and biased i win bye bye shut the channel off dunkey what you think of the first two shadow hearts games jrpg battles are designed to become much more compelling only after 45 hours thats because before that its all tutorials honest points all around but for someone thats used to pokmon being mash a to win for the first 5 hours i had a unique strategy already on my 3rd lvl 1 snail fight with the whole break and boost system guys i think dunkey and that biased nitpicking guy need to sit down and finish this game so biased nitpicking guy can finally play octopath traveler and dunkey can finish it making this a legitimate review well i see im not the only one who came back to check on what this snail controversy was but now im all finding is references to video game critics 2 i love this game but lets be honest the story writing and the dialogue are complete garbage you shouldve put a number rating at the end so i could just skip all the bullshit sorry the snail was actually level 11 so every single one of your other points that are unrelated to the snail are invalid im not joking i regret buying this game everyday i dont know why dunkey didnt like it i have never played octopath traveller but i can agree that it has a little something for everyone 9110 terrible review hated the part where you said you didnt like bubsy 3d didnt make me feel like batman 9310 theres a little something for everyone in this one dunkey is nitpicking and biased i win bye bye attention all butthurt people hahahahahaha also dunkey does lie in his videos not even close babyyyyy when it was super close 259 it totally doesnt say that hes level 21 22 nope hes totally not lying about it being a level 1 snail are you guys seriously gonna overlook the level 100 damage at level 1 as well what kind of jrpg starts you off doing 100 damage on level 1 in conclusion hahahahahahaha um that snail only takes 3 hits if you have four years in game time liar i repeat i did not play octopath traveller promise me you will love each other forever your excellency wow who else searched up the video just to watch what it was the secret to get past random encounters if they become predictable just turn off you brain and click the buttons during the fights or think about something else so that time flies switch it on when out of battle switch off when in battle tell yourself this will build your patience if you are farming then break it down into small numbers like 10 encounters and start counting it in your head but turn off you brain during fights when you are done with 10 do 10 more this was just an example nope you are nicpicked and biasedi win bye bye will you carry out my children all octopath traveler fans should be deported into the sun you suck your review is gay and so are you boom i win i found this review valuable because im someone who saw this games gorgeous presentation and found myself tempted to buy it but ive also never been a fan of classic jrpg mechanics seeing someone admit that they had the same taste as me and then proceed to pick out quite a few things that would make this game bore me helped me avoid a purchase i would probably regret making can anyone explain what was misrepresentation about the snail scene genuinely curious i remember first watching this and being a little upset but i just didnt care enough to actually take anything to heart but i dont remember it being this short and its not even a bad video nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye octopath is one of those games that seems like itd be fun to play on a long car ride for some grindy entertainment but other than that it looks like a mess but that snail wasnt level 1 donki lied not that i will ever play this just nickpicking the video liar the snail was not level 1 you garbage person now you see dunkey where you went wrong was actually playing octopath traveler if you hadnt played it maybe i wouldve listened to your review 15 incoming people commenting the same commentyou are bia you are biased and nitpicking i win bye bye ok so wheres the lie about the snail you are nitpicking and biased and clearly have never played this game this review has something for everyone 9510 he lied about a snail he hates the japanese not playing octopath traveler really makes you feel like animal jayson your excellency is the new the baby i swear i dont even played this game but no you are wrong domsy i win bye bye and thanks for chrono trigger music and robo d the final boss difficulty spike is bullshit but i never played this game but its a good game i swear im not lying dunkeys the lying fuck its biased i win bye bye nope you are nitpicking and biased i win you lose bye bye everyone who disliked this is dumb dumb i win nope u are bye bye i win nitpick and bias whos here after critics part 2 you are a black and a dumb mexican i dont even like this game i win bye bye this review is perfect in every single way ive never seen such an accurate review of anything and i take every single word to heart anyone who disagrees should be thrown into a pit of spice and shot with a bazooka best parody channel ever nope you are nicpicked and biasedi win bye bye you are nitpicking and biased i win byebye this is the video that made that kid make two 20 minute videos about how dunkey is scum huh that guy has too much time on his hands cant people fanboy over a game that doesnt look like it was made in 15 minutes with game maker whos here after todays video lmao and to think for years i used to treat reggie like he was my excellency youre just too racist to enjoy this amazing game nope you are nitpicking and biased bye bye i win no you are just nitpicked and biased i win bye bye you are wrong but i have never played octopath traveler here to give this video another view after his newest video nopethis video is nitpicking and biased i win bye bye what makes octopath stand out 8 characters thats literally it hahaha the one thing i hoped for was character interaction with a story that involved everyone like chrono trigger which had 7 characters including a frog robot and cavewoman time travel a long story where everything about each character is woven together and you get the chance to feel attached to them not only this but the world is so bleak and desaturated looking nothing about the environment is at all interesting the sparkly snow and water isnt enough to slap a 60 dollar price tag and gets boring after a while octopath just didnt do it for me and i get hate for calling it a waste of my money the only thing good about this game was the music youre biased i win bye bye i also had the misfortune of starting with ophilia aaaaaa but dunkey lied about the snail guys he lied about it it really does take almost 30 seconds to defeat a lvl 1 enemy but you only have to do it 20 times to fight the next boss hes a fraud and a liar cancel him but dunkey the guy hasnt even played octopath traveler nope you are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye this video is nitpicking and biased bye bye i win the gaming community 9 out of 10 it does something for everyone everyone who disliked is biased bye bye i win nope you are nicpicked and biasedi win bye bye anyone else here right after video game critics 2 this game really makes me feel like a stripper soundtracks dope tho you have to fight things to progress bad game you didnt even play it im already 7 hours in and this feels unoriginal repetitive and i cant wait to get to the actual game im really feelin the 60 i wasted on this right now pokemon literally gives you items to not find random encounters and im fucking glad random encoutners are trash i almost break my neck nodding in agreement bro but that music though they who govern reason slaps atleast the musics good thanks i hate it now the writing is the epitome of why people choose to watch subs over dubs in anime some things in japanese translated into english sound like absolute trash and extremely corny because it doesnt have the same impact i am disappointed that this game wasnt as good as i thought it would be you forgot to mention how amazing the game is though i think that the game has the best turn based combat out of anything ive played but the monotony of the random encounters the repetition of game structure for each characters chapters and the mediocre stories make it really hard to want to finish the game thumbs up for ya blew it reggie theres something to be said about too much grinding in this game especially when you want to level every single character i myself love the hell out of this game and the only reason i can say that is i decided to play through the game with the first four travelers i liked and then used a ce to speed level the remaining 4 i didnt feel this took anything out of the game other than missing out on some travel banter octopath traveller just raises the bloom to 1000000 and expects it to look good that excellency scene is some of the worst dialogue voice acting ive ever heard fucking thank you agreed just because you dont like turn based combatthats all this is a nice satire video man im glad turnbased battles and random encounters are still in some rpgs also that moment when he fights a level 1 snail with one level 21 person is funny obviously not a level 1 snail the danger level of areas scales to match your progression and such octopath traveler is a great time though yes the story and character interaction is kinda weak still square enix shows that they still have it in them to make great classic games that dont take 13 years to make because a person needs a tread on their sneakers lol my thoughts almost exactly travel banter is a thing the only decent review of this game i swear everyone who thinks its good is on something what is the game at 0014 i like turn base games but this game was trash the stories are crap and the grind is insane dunkeys a great critic for everything except turn based rpgs because he is so pre disposed to disliking them think of this more as an option video rather then a fair review i can understand his other arguements but there was one point in the video when he was just criticizing the game for being turn based he literally compared how slow a turn based game is to a platformer to make a point not only is that not fair since they are two completely different genres but a platformer like mario is of course going to be way more fast paced than a turned based game he could have at least compared the combat to another rpg miitopia was x10 better than this game dunks i love you but i love octopath more its funny i did not have to grind i just danced my way through the game also i dont recommend doing that because it kinda ruined the game for me it sucks when your at level 100 before you get your 5 character still a awesome game the thing i like about this game is that you can beat up villagers i mean come on how often do you get to beat up villagers in other jrpgs damn thats a lotta downvotes i think this video made reggy retire say what you want about how mind numbingly generic the writing and characters are in this game but the music is frigging fantastic yasunori nishiki knocked it out of the park since random encounters and turn based combat are two of dunkeys favourite things i should think he would love darkest dungeon tbh the your excellency cringe is a symptom of translation havent played up to there but i know in weebtalk its going to be osama which is a lot less annoying to hear than english your excellency in short you gotta deal with that shit when you dont just want to hear the writing in its native language japaneseenglish heres a little tip gamers you can still like the game even if dunker doesnt that snail was in an area where you would have multiple party members before arriving at dunkey dumped off all of his party members besides one to make the fight longer and notice the dagger underneath the snail that means its weak to daggers in octopath traveller you discover weaknesses this means that dunkey has discovered that the snail is weak to daggers but is deliberately choosing not to exploit its weakness just to drag on the fight and make it seem worse than it is dunkey you cant compare the fighting style and random encounters of jrpgs to fpss fpss are supposed to have quick encounters while jrpgs requires strategy your point doesnt make sense i just finished this a couple of hours ago i loved it actually one of my favourite new games 208 truth of dunkey strong theres a reason they put japanese voice acting in will dunkey provide sufficient insight into the quality of a game which can take hundreds of hours to see the works of its developers in full enough time spent to fairly criticize and evaluate its value as a piece of media all in three and a half minutes of course not i think this video sucks as the years go by more and more do i realize dunkeys witty and crass style of humor have the potential to be harmful to the consumption and subsequent discourse on games which frankly deserve recognition on the premise that they are and should be treated as valid works of interactive art not to say the man cant have opinions and go about them humorously but often times people misconstrue half true haphazard opinions as a result of analytical scrutiny when instead they can simply be caused by bias and preference what we have here irks me especially because dunkey has a considerable viewership of people likely to put stock in what are nothing more but his base level thoughts on a gam wheres my bookworm adventures deluxe jrpg hack and slash games are all the same they all play the same and are boring you killed one thing then do it the same way with minor power ups for a full game ugh i always assumed this game was good now i know its kinda sad to see so much hate here misery really does love company horrible video cant stand the personal bias and cussing was horrible can someone please tell me which game he shows at 014 the one with the character walking through the desert i really enjoyed limbo and inside so this might be for me edit i found it took some lucky googling game desert character with red cape its called journey not yet released for pc for anyone else being curious the story makes more sense if you skip all the cutscenes disagree with the vidya description is gold tho i respect your opinion but i hope you finish the game it really is a gem dunkey wouldnt like dnd i think lol i was doubting but this game is actually pretty fun the kings guard backstory olberic sounds exactly like the epilouge of red dead redemption 2 its a shame it is such a nice looking game thank you octodunk ill admit the game looks and sounds great but as an author i have to agree the story could be better earthbound solved the annoying lowlevel random encounters decades ago yet it seems to be the only game that has done it have at you everytime she says your excellency take a shot dunkey just go back to fortnite youre not ready for games like this you seriously complaining about a challenge yeah fortnite is just for you even sounds like those annoying kids screaming in their mic on that game your review was not really valid complaining about super easy battles and some of the best storywriting incorporated into a video game shows you havent played this game much at all barely even skimmed the surface you and ninja should just blow each other at least the art is interesting honestly i love this game maybe turn based just aint ur thing and dont call it brainless theirs a lot more stategy than shooters your exellency is elizabeth saying sir meliodas great now the word excellency sounds like a prescription drug a knight is no more than a sword with a horse dunkey would love fallout 2 yep realy generic crap i love this game but its okay i respect the individuals opinion your excellency tbh the thing i have against rpgs sometimes is when the character progresses way too slowly like playing and hour gets you to lvl 10 but then you need to be lvl 30 or something to actually be able to continue the story and we talking turn based rpgs where you cant get away with skill sometimes you can let it slide and just keep grinding and sometimes its boring and really tedious wow 12000 dislikes this is dunkeys most disliked video the revenge of the jrpg players is severing they can interactive in travel banters this bitch lmao i love xenoblade 2 i think this is true at some points but it is mostly biased i thought he might have liked the prosti i mean dancer dunkey doesnt like turn based jrpgs and everyones talking like that invalidates his review but you liking a game does not make that game good for example lets say i like the final destination series that doesnt make all the bullshit in that series no longer bullshit it just means i enjoy it its still a bad series youre free to enjoy it but from a reviewers standpoint its not good and there are better movies of the same genre to be watched it has some really fantastic fucking music though just ask 8 bit music theory you should try out bravely default people keep saying that his predisposition of him not liking turn based rpgs is what makes the game not fun for him but rpgs are my main genre and i did not have fun with this game also ill probably never understand why pixel graphics made a comeback and why they are so popular nowadays then he lied the english voice acting sucks the japanese voices are way better they give the characters a little more personality the characters technically do interact with each other through the travel banters but the dialogue is just so random vague and shouldve been voice acted why dont u make ur own game since u can make it better mr who i am a fanny cant stand ur voice once you finish the game you get to the good part this game oozes excellency careful dunkey its 2019 you cant have an opinion your excellency psycho mantis youre that hind d what game is at 09 glad to see there was at least one reviewer who wasnt blowing this game like its the best damn rpg thats ever come out xd i think this review is actually good octopath is shit i think the bravely default games this team made before were much better and you could turn off those random encounters or increase them for exp this game is just phantasy star with octopaths and travelers lol ophilia was who i picked this calls for imediate dislike this review prompted me to skip this game when it came out watched a few other reviews and after a while felt like giving the game a chance so i downloaded the demo i almost always agree with the dunk but not this time game is amazing i have to say that i respect donkeys opinion on video games more than some of my friends and i respect what hes saying but this game is probably the farthest from his cup of tea possible for me the moment i picked it up and the moment i put it down where some of the most memorable video game moments ive ever had well dunk now we have to find someone else to blame nintendos video game screwups cause reggie gone this video is excellency octodunk traveler i gave this game a chance its been months since this review and despite giving it a chance it was too much to put up with the characters feel like cardboard cut outs with typical stories tacked on to them be them revenge plots seeking out someone who wronged them or the good ol work for me and earn your freedom plot nothing about this game was unique other than its beautiful music and artistic style i cant take away from that at all but a game should have more than that going for it combat is boring from the first moment you start encountering enemies the stories are predictable and even when you are caught off guard you just dont care enough about the characters because none of the characters even care about one another why should i be sad for a character when literally two feet away his party who has been with him through his whole journey is just standing there picking their noses waiting for their turn in the spotlight plug and play consoles came with 1000s this game was pretty garbage 028 whats that what game is that in 015 your ex shut up pokemon meets inception persona came out before both of them lol random encounters yeah the basis of all rpgs what the whole point of the game was to play as 8 seperate rpg characters and not miss out on the others story and hes complaining about that is he stupid i agree that the characters not talking to each other at all is stupid that is 100 valid criticism also he didnt even get past the first chapter of their stories he says the combat is press attack you literally cant do that once you leave the beginning areas he does this in the beginning when you have one character cause the whole game is based around having a party not having one character therefore its easy this was the first rpg ive played that you actually have to try for every random encounter it feels like he didnt even give the game a chance and just hated it from the beginning and while the dialogue is bad especially the your excellency character and the hunter girl the rest of bro if you have to grind to beat a modern rpg u might need to see a doctor this was my favorite game on switch after botw played it just over 100 hours and enjoyed every minute this game aint for codfortnitehalo players aka prepubescent teens i love this video and i love octopath traveler pokmon meets inception i almost got cancer from that comment im actually almost done with the game and have been loving it so far thanks for the vidya your excellency congratulation to tho for the french subtitles because i cant speak english well ps sorry for my english lmao but dunkey what if i told you you can find a child molester in the middle of the woods and steal his candy 1010 game of the decade at least you played the damn game you might hate it but this game got me back into jrpgs 000 i didnt know that the super nintendo was actualy a period of time thank you don rickles to all the people dismissing his opinion simply bc he generally doesnt like turnbased rpg remember he stated that he liked persona 5 despite it being turnbased i respect his opinion i may love jrpgs but everyone doesnt have to have the same opinion i looking at you mass media not as bothersome as yahtzee but really if youre not fond of a genre dont sweat it not everything meshes with everyone ranting about it knowing its not your cup of tea is kinda silly thatd be like me reviewing undertale or pikmin 3 theres already a negative stigma its hardly fair 12k disliked thinking they were disliking the game and not the video obviously yep the stories are painfully bad lol the break system is the games saving grace hey lets make a game with 8 characters and make all of them boring shit i thought it was fun am i alone in thinking this game looks awful 203 oh ophelia can somebody please tell me what game is on 027 please well i say why you said you have to do hours of grinding its because you chose to fight your battles brainlessly yeah if you whack on an enemy with a weapon they arent weak to abd only one character in your party the battles are going to feel monotonous but when you have a full party you get a character interaction every 5 minutes with party chats between story missions learning how the characters interact with each other and if you know what youre doing and good party set up you dont really need to grind until the final boss maybe abd if you hate random encounters so much there are plenty of skills and items to reduce them and beating the game will get you a free pass from encounters this review may be old as dirt but my dislike for your lack of a discerning eye hasnt dulled i can only chock up how you feel to be your personal taste and it seems you dont veer towards classic rpgs because those who gravitate towards them love this game i would say therion has the best story i choose him above the rest random encounters have place in old games like phantasy star where it was stressful to survive to the end and can still be good if they are interesting saga frontier was the last time i enjoyed random encounters and maybe grandia or star ocean remember when this garbage was all they talked about in nintendo directs this game talk so much before you can really start playing it sucks you press more b to skip the talk than you actually play the game this game really makes you feel like octopath traveler the story is horrible but the gameplay music and presentation is incredible and the fact that his clip showing how bad the gameplay is is a clip of him not even trying to break the enemy is either disingenuous or just means he didnt even understand the most basic mechanics clip from 028 there are a lot of mature anime such as ghost in the shell texhnolyze monster paranoia agent etc but never a mature traditional jrpg just the same old fairy tale drag this notdunkview really makes you feel like youre watching a dunkview thrown into a pit of spice and shot with a bazooka random encounters are objectively shit at first i hated this game i started off as the dancer and got repeatedly pissed off at how much damage the enemies did to me and how long they took to kill the first boss was a battle of attrition amd was only won because ive played many jrpgs from the snes to modern consoles and i know to always stock up on healing items it looked like a game i would enjoy from the getgo due to the strong emotional story but i quickly realized that this game wasnt for me until i unlocked the second character things became exponentially more balanced after that moment i was able to fight effectively and appreciate why simple battles take so long to fight the combat system keeps these fights from ever getting bland and how much fun it is when you get to break your enemies and boost the hell out of your attacks the way you have to combine your character classes to achieve victory really rewards a strategic player dont trust this review ive played this game and i can tell you 105 xd me with any jrpg really i felt the same way the dialogue was just so cringe i started with the swordsman too sooooo boring and i love turn based combat games ive just got this game cause it was on sale in the eshop and i was debating it for so long but 60 felt like too much for a game that i knew would be like so many games i had played before when the price dropped though i thought about those other games and regardless of how generic they were i had fun playing them and sometimes mindless battles can be a nice way to enjoy to me so i picked it up the last jrpg i played were the 2 ninokuni games though and they are soooo good that going into this i didnt have super high expectations so whilst ive been playing it ive been pleasantly surprised that im enjoying it at least the music is good admits he has a bias brings up valid points all jrpg fans your entire opinion isnt valid its just odd that no one gets in a fit about any of his other game reviews but as soon as it gets personal its a nogo hes even said himself its just his opinion yet you guys are treating like hes imposing law wait so he doent like rpgs and he reviews one i dont know if reviewing a genre you dont care about is a good thing but i digress so its a saga game but worse in the narrative department good riddance side note from octopath being a bland jrpg throwback should those who dont like games with turn based combat waste their time to play them let alone review them with a clear biased opinion i usually give up on your videos when you talk about turn based combat being bad i love this game but dunkey dont huh thats wild people can have opinions i do agree that battles take a bit to long tho he said combat was mindless but other than the visuals its the one thing they objectively did right the combat wasnt mindless mashing x to kill randoms lots of jrpgs because attack is the first option will not work in this game every characters turn feels important because it is 127 they do interact with eachother with the travel banter i enjoy the game but i also understand and agree with this review the story and character stuff isnt really a highlight for me this is a jrpg game for people who already like the genre and the appeal is really the battleupgrade system and options to optimize your party if youre not into it dunkey is known not to be its not going to come off well even then its not really anything special its a good solid game but its a particular taste for a particular fan imagine watching a movie for 3 minutes and then saying that the entire movie is bad anyone knows what the 028 game name is i was about to make an angry comment but then i remembered his video about video game reviewers he just doesnt like jrpgs best game on the switch good lord he would hate etrian odyssey with a fiery passion this game makes you feel like mario the story was awful but i genuinely loved the battle mechanics if they can take all the criticism they got for this game and use it to make changes to the next octopath traveler i would be pretty happy loved the art style too music was a pretty standard affair for jrpgs the first honest review not like the others story is fucking boring but its old school turn base game it has to be boring 1010 the most boring game in this genre i hate pokemon ff dwm golden sun etc but i like this game theres a lot of depth to the combat the games problem areas imo are the map design the narrative and the dialogue i am about halfway through the game and at this point i skip all dialogue nothing feels important or engaging the story is beyond predictable and the dialogue is horrendous did they consult someone who actually studies old english to write it because it seems like a teenage weeb wrote it beyond that the map design is really bad the map is totally useless and exploration outside of paths to quests doesnt ever yield anything worth the frustration of trying to figure out which little inclines and obstacles are real and which are traversable the combat is good if you have any tolerance for tbc whatsoever but its wasted on this game i just dont understand how nintendo can go from botw probably the most satisfying rewarding and engaging rpg i have ever played simultaneously perfec i just bought this today i like jrpgs too but i dont like octopath in the slightest shin megami tensei iv was the perfect example of a jrpg done right i dunno i like the game i mean yea the the anime cringe is there but im used to that type of cringe you guys can get mad at him all you want but one thing that this game lacks is being unique its a generic game and theres a reason why theres no community around it you play it beat it once and go on to the next because its just a jrpg cliche nothing special even if you did enjoy it its really you didnt hate it because you played the same game already your excellency youre that ninja i seriously think heavy rpgs are just too complex for him oof i got this for my cousin for his birthday i hope he like it if you want a solid video about this game check kingk so really your point is you dont appreciate the genre that is what i deduced from watching this does anyone not realize what an opinion is great review not buying this crap for my kid lol this game really makes you feel like your excellency yyour excellency stayed in tokyo last summer and i saw ads for this all over the train heading to akihabara was wondering what kind of game it was turns out i didnt need to fights a literal snail ah the thrill of the fight i thought i was the only one who felt this way why is this in the serious videos playlist why did dunkey name fast forward to today and then name a bunch of types of games that existed back in the retrojrpg era the only new ones are games with motion capturevoice acting your excellency 2 please cmon reggie i really dislike the lack of interaction between the characters the game isnt really unique and their main selling point was that you have 8 characters dunkey has a point the only game i ever enjoyed playing that has both turn based combat and random encounters was the pokemon games the random encounters can be minimized by taking paths with less grass using repels or just simply running away from the fight any game that forces you to complete wave after wave of random encounters is garbage imo i never even saw reason to grind on wild pokemon because just simply battling every trainer on your journey is usually sufficient enough exp to level your pokemon to a point where you can take on the elite four without getting dominated see this isnt even inaccurate hell i like turnbased combat and rpg elements but the games pretty bland and i dont understand all the praise it gets this game was such a disappointment considering the potential it had 8 different characters all potentially having great unique stories and personalities that play off of each other as your party grows it couldve been the avengers jrpg with each solo story being their respective solo film in a sense and when all in a group its packed full of cross character dialogue thats funny and fits how the differing personalities would play off of each other instead we got weak writing unambitious and lacking cross character interaction and just overall a shadow of what this game couldve been this was supposed to make people want to play 2d jrpgs again for a little while and remind people how games like chrono trigger really showed higher quality of story and gameplay than was expected of the medium but no it got a bunch of buzz over the generous demo time and then fell off the face of the earth shortly after release ive played mobile free 2d jrpgs with better writing what a jo this is a fair review and i still very much like this game but the writing logic and map design could be far better this game sucks but dunkey has terrible taste in rpgs anyway the music is great though i liked the japanese dub more than the english one tbh i must be one of five people on earth that doesnt mind turn based combat you chose the literal worst character first tho weebs cant write shit except sometimes cries in weeb i find myself agreeing with a lot of his points here it feels void of what made older rpgs so great especially when it came down to the quests themselves game was a bit of a disappointment i was expecting more from square enix although i honestly think the combat was the best part of it very streamlined for modern turnbased combat and i loved the burst system although at higher levels you can absolutely abuse the defense break system making it a lot easier later on i just barely saw this video and im glad that i wasnt the only one that disliked this game fire emblem fates was more interesting than ocopath and fates was actual steaming garbage best review for this game and jrpgs in general reggie always gets the blame so unfair octopath isnt a perfect game and it promised a lot more than it offered that being said i have played over 70 hours of it so far i enjoy it but it isnt a great game it feels half baked my hope is that the sequel truly delivers something more dynamic and promising and please there needs to be better writing its like a fantasy story written by a middle schooler review chrono trigger whoever made random encounters should be kicked into a pit of spikes and shot with a bazooka dunk 2018 dunkey what do you think about the darkest dungeon i absolutely loved octopath both main story and post game content but i can totally see where dunkeys coming from as well as anyone who agrees with him the characters were quite tropey and i found myself wishing over and over and over again that the characters would interact more outside of the travel banter segments to each their own though and if they do an octopath 2 theres definitely a lot of room to refine the recipe a bit you dont like turnbased battles but you reviewed a jrpg not only just a jrpg but a square enix jrpg why the fuck did this game have voice acting for pixelated characters i fucking hate it when games have voice acting for characters when its just text boxes of their face on screen i only find my self dissagreeing with dunky on occasion but this is one of them i have been enjoying the game a lot since getting it ill say that this game looks real nice with the depth and the tilt shift thats interesting but i havent played it also random encounter combat makes sense in pokemon while only sometimes being a hassle its necessary because its how you discover new pokemon to catch and how you grind to get your fighters stronger sometimes it can be too much of a grind but i think the rest of the game is worth it buuuuut also bear in mind that i havent played a pokemon game since diamond i dont get why this video is his most controversial if he doesnt like the game after the first 10 hours he shouldnt have to play 50 hours of the game i love jrpgs but the characters and dialogue were so bland that once i finished off a couple of characters arcs i put the game down and sank another 150 hours into stardew valley insteadwhich is a game about farming bubsy 3d creators did this anime shit what kind of sick bastard plays a jrpg with the english voice over from now on all my rpg reviews are from here rofl whats the game at 015 cant find it with google image search 1 olberics story was never a revenge plot thats prims storyline olberics isnt even about avenging his king its about redeeming himself and coming to his own answer about what happened killing werner and dueling erhardt is just something that happens along the way 2 yes they do interact just not directly in the story if you press in taverns at certain points you get a travel banter session 3 pointing out repetition doesnt really mean all that much but yes it was pretty annoying 4 agreed on random encounters 5 thats just deceptive youre going solo with olberic with no other teammates not using the break system and not using abilities youre leaving out a large portion of the game that you can access less than an hour in take a shot every time your excellency is said dont think youll ever see this dunkey but if you want a good turn based rpg check out bravely default its a few years old but it remedies some of the problems you have with these games like manipulating the random encounter rate as an example not only that its job system is so much fun just to mess around with and see what you can come up with completely fits with how you want to play the game it also has actions called a brave and default which can speed up combat whenever you want and the story and soundtrack are amazing as well this audio sucksor is that just his voice while dunkey does bring up some good points mainly about the boice acting and chapter 1s of every character i have to overall disagree with what he thinks of the game the characters may be not entirely original but theyre incredibly entertaining and charming cyrus and tressa are the best 3 and the turn based combat system this game uses is probably the best system ive ever experienced in any rpg for once ive actually been using support skills and think about the next turn the game still provides a good challenge as well with almost every chapter 2 bosses it took me at least 2 attempts to win and honestly the random encounters arent that bad when you consider how infrequent they are and how fun the battle system is so yeah dunkey does have some valid arguements but i do think he was destined to hate this game from the start with his burning love for turn based rpgs kingdom hearts ii and dark souls iii are still my favorite jrpgs of all time this nigga is crazy this game was great the only thing i thought when i saw this game was oh look eight new super smash bros characters lol 12k weebs prove anime is a cancer that rots the brain making them incapable of seeing why most jrpgs are absolute crap that have not learned how to be better games but the music is just fantastic i dont even have the game but i listen to the ost regularly i might pick it up eventually majestic marmot used these nuts i completely disagree with you i think octopath traveler is the best game ever created its like you played only 5 hours of the game hm this video is excellency when i first watched this video i agreed with dunkey now that i played it myself i love it im honestly shocked even myself because i was not that intrested in the game at the first place try it out for yourselves people before you judge the game nice now makes a game alike harvest moonback to nature honestly theres only one thing that bothered me in the game enough to make me stop playing and that was the disjointed stories and lack of actual interaction if each story found a way to play off each other or if the characters at least made actual appearances in the other stories i could have forgiven a bit of monotony i hate throwaway fights in rpgs that you just autopilot through shut up your exellency is here to biased if you hate the genre then dont do a review about it what a shit review just full of hate maybe you become biased because you hate the genre and the art i love the genre and the art though i like the game omg why havent i discovered this guy on youtube in the past his voice mixed with his perfect commentary is supreme simple minds need instant gratification play ffbe for a decent turn based game hello before commenting about how this review sucks please refer to the dunkey video game critics thank you 017 what game is this he puts thing into perspective even though i like rpgs to a certain degree i just do not understand why this game was so popular there is nothing about this game that stands out besides its graphics i am open to conversation but isnt there better games out there i couldnt even get by self to play the demo for more than 15 minutes before getting bored and scratching my head if you want a good rpg for the switch i recommend brave story it decent and its cheap different strokes for different folks i suppose anyways jrpg for japanese repetitive process of grinding is still fun so imma pick this up 150 metal gear psycho mantis beautiful game tho whats the last song when you said that you dont despise turn based combat i got curious are there any turnbased rpgs besides persona 5 that you likewould recommend in all honesty the english dub is garbage switching the dub to japanese is pretty much essential for the stories of the characters to have any weight doesnt make the mandatory character introductions any less monotonous though shits bad mang i like the game and i still agree with dunkey nooooooooooooo delete this video noooooow al nintendo games are goooooooooooood regardless of what everyone says i enjoyed this game you should play child of light dunkey the game is really fun and the soundtrack is heavenly the game is a turn based rpg but it isnt your typical grindy battle with combat just being a brainless selection screen if its something that doesnt catch your eye i would at least give its music a listen the boss themes are fucking awesome man do you know how you can tell that uncharted is better than xenoblade in every way fans of xenoblade tell you play a 100 hours to truly unlock the games potential the rest of the world just tells you to play uncharted i really liked this game your excelency im not gonna go ahead and say that the your excelency isnt a bit annoying but you seem to have overlooked how it builds ophilias character it shows what kind of relationship she has with her adoptive father especially when you hear liannas dialogue in the same conversations where she seems to be more casual and at ease with her father i think octopath has done very well building the characters themselves considering the stories arent super original so in a nutshell ew anime well from the perspective of a western gamer with hate against anime and jrpg i can see why you think like that but in my opinion this game may have soso generic jrpg story but the visuals and battle system are quite amazing i dunno about you guys who all actioney and jrpghatey but im down for this game except for the random encounters and poor game balance i agree personally on this i respect dunkeys opinion by the way have been a loyal subscriber since 2016 so dont raise your pitchforks against me hes predisposed he literally says he has no problem with turn based combat also yikes way too many offended ot fans that had jokes go way over their heads i actually agree with dunkey a lot this game is ok i think it has people blinded by its simplistic charm which makes them feel good to play after coming home from a stressful or complicated day even when i loved jrpgs i would always do a level up cheat to save time the writing is absolutely shit but the voice acting is some of the best ive heard recently me after 30 hours of spamming bewildering grace and getting the exp x100 boost now i can finally play the game i respectfully disagree with this review im doing research can you direct me to your most homophobic sexist racist video i ask because i just read an article cray dogn you and kiiiiinda have a kid that loves yer shit and just want to see where its all at with regard to truly offensive ive reviewed several game vids and havent been able to find anything really offensive even ya dumb bitch seemed playful and funny anywho as a parent any help would be great thanks ps we are a critical thinking communication family so i wont be all fuck this dudes shit just incase yer like duh fuk all these people saying oh i cant trust dunkey bc hes not big on turnbased jrpgs yet nobody saying anything good about the game that makes it fun or unique damn wasnt expecting this i think it was great why you salty dunky hahaha octopussy transylvania is a really gud game because of the graphics port this to the atari your point about how long it takes to kill grunts is why i love earthbound so much in that respect if youre a high enough level when you get an encounter the enemy will just automatically die this game really makes you feel like an excellency this game honestly felt too grindy for me great graphics great music great combat but lackluster story and characters the gameplay is also very repetitive and grindy i had my fun with it but i would not recommend this game to anyone else except for rpg enthusiasts utterly destroying the game without a single nudge to its positive regards is unfair first off the combat is nothing like how you described fighting a level 1 goon mob you absolutely can destroy low level enemies with no effort and move on the game has combat mechanics in place specifically for speeding up the battles you just chose to ignore that for posterity the break system secondly the game is quite literally told from the perspective of a story book hell the collectors edition actually comes as a popup book games of this ilk were designed with that concept in mind and are meant to nurture some level of imagination instead of acknowledging this characteristic you chose to compare it to games that actually hold your hand through the experience some people want to fill in the gaps dragon quest is a fine example of this type of story play for a game of this genre to be one of the best selling titles for square and nintendo this year the numbers speak dunkey you might and thats a big might like turn based combat in this game called divinity original sin theres also a sequel i dont like turn based combat either but i cant imagine that game with any other type of combat i enjoy it and i would love to see what you think of it never seen this guy or this game i dont even like rpg games butmeh too much salt i will just leave though i have not played much of it i like octopath traveller a lot the battles the art style and the music yet at the same time i completely agree with everything dunkey says in this video the game isnt perfect but i can still get enjoyment out of it i think the combat is amazing in this game was the king yugioh the general beats ive seen in people responding to this game seem to depend on two things if you enjoy traditional jrpgs you will fall deeply in love with this game if youre more on dunkeys end youll think its an outdated style of gameplay late to this but i wish some people referred back to his game critics video you dont have to agree with his views just understand his consistency hes allowed to try games he doesnt typically like because you never know you might actually enjoy this one case and point for dunk hates anime and turn based rpgs but he thought persona 5 a combo of those exact 2 things was fun octopath didnt do it for him so be it will admit though i wish he at least gave it some credit for the visuals and music because damn thats some good shit not many could deny that i disagree completely with this video bana is such a fleshed out character and makes xenoblade 2 better than knack 2 there was a time where i enjoyed games that were long now i feel them as padding i feel like the divide between long and padding comes to ones life circumstances when i was in primary school with nothing to do a game where i could grind was fun now that i have 1000 things to do i want a concise game games can still be long but it is much more important that the fat is cut move from high point to high point also for an rpg of any sort with or without the j i need to have a world and story that is enjoyable without that padding it has been shown that you dont need to sink 20 10 5 or even 2 hours into a world to make it engaging whats an rpg without good writing or good voice acting for me just another grind those are dime a dozen to make a short story long while this video greatly exaggerates to the point of satire the core message lets me know this isnt for me this game must be excellency clearly turn based games arent for you would you care for another random encounter your excellency love that the internet lets people share ideas about games its their opinion not set in stone but an opinion cringeworthy anime writing as you show final fantasy x literally one of the absolute best story games ever lol the only jrpg ive enjoyed in the past decade has been persona 5 and i only got 40 hours in the knight is the most boring character to be fair also the characters do interact come the second chapter with travel banter for a second i thought that the your excellency woman was voiced by erica mendez she isnt cause she kinda sounds like arle on depressants excellency doesnt sound like a word anymore your xlnc turn based combat games make more sense on mobile phone and other portables than on pc hm probably shouldnt review a game that you clearly didnt progress very far in especially when youre already predisposed to dislike most games of that genre just sayin hearing your excellency so many times makes me wish for bookworm adventures deluxe even more why are you reviewing a game in a genre you dont like that dosent make much sense why does this game have voice acting whats the name of the song played 009 to 017 watches your game critics video great video putting up a review before finishing the game is definitely a dumb idea you do just that here maybe you should watch your game critics video again enjoying based jrpgs is the same as enjoying eating shit i love you boy but please stop playing jrpgs they arent for you jrpgs used to be the video game story telling titans back in the ps2era back when standards for stories in video games were lower until western game devs began to make use of better hardware to tell better written stories most jrpgs like xenoblade 2 feel like their stuck in the ps2era in the story writing department random encounters were a product of hardware limitations at the time why anyone would put them in a modern game is confusing a person who doesnt like turn based rpgs talking about a turn based rpg and doesnt like it shocker guys he doesnt like repetitive gameplay what a hack ejdjhdhdhdhdhchhdhc hold me back he didnt make it to chapter 2 they do interact i was gonna dislike this video but you hit the key point of the dialogue being a sack of crap love you dunkey this game kinda started to suck for me when i found out that there is no bestiary this decides if something is a good or a bad game i never cringed so hard hearing the voice acting in my life until i played this game its abomination and im fully agreed with jason credit music at least hit me with an interesting concept odin sphere tales of berseria nier automata and valkyria chronicles just sayin areaworld roaming and rpg yes pixelated graphics and multiple backstory characters yes random encounters and turnedbased combat what d a m n i t this is the only game on the switch since mario that i can rub in ps4 owners faces so it cant have a negative review or else i might start regretting the fact that i bought an overpriced underpowered system with 3 good games do you like this game dunkey your excellency this game is fucking lit imo nice review tho as he said in his game critics video find what a critic likes and dislikes like he said he doesnt like turn based combat rpgs and anime but he liked persona 5 so if he had the same opinion about this game if your like games of that genre then you will very likely like this and if your not a big fan of games of this genre like dunkey and he liked you may also like it this video is much excellency whats the game at 028 im been looking for that game for many a year 232 what game is that pls damn 11k dislikes i mean i disagree with the video but holy shit why does everyone hate this video random encounters arent always terrible think of the ttrpg dungeons and dragons if youre walking down a long road to get to a town you either have to wait a long time or skip time which really just ruins the sense of realism in these games with random encounters you can get a sense that youre actually doing something which keeps you from being bored as you wait and also keeps you from skipping time all in all random encounters arent always bad i just got octopath 2 days ago and have been playing it nonstop so while i cant really argue because i didnt beat it yet i want to say that if you know what you are doing well enough and decide the right time to do actions going through the game feels smooth sometimes at least to me i didnt need to grind in one place if i dont run from every fight then i can beat the bosses just fine random encounters are the worst here though if you want to run then it has a chance to take a long time because you only get 1 attempt per turn rpg is actually my favorite genre but at times it really feels slow the graphics and soundtrack are amazing though s c a t h i n g this game is just ripping off shrek 2 for gamecube you should play that instead dragon quest xxx is looking pretty good finally someone who didnt like this shitty game as well good job dunkey i see peoples sarcasmsensors are still working at the usual level dunkey just explained exactly why i hate jrpgs octopath was amazing are you kidding you didnt mention the amazing soundtrack and you cant say a game is bad for not enjoying the genre pokemon might be bad to others as its filled with turn based combat but you also need to express its simply ur opinion there are so many other games with turn based combat why would you single this one out this is pokemon but better sure olberic and a couple others plots are a bit clich but even if its clich it doesnt make it a bad game because they executed it well game at 015 i disagree with this whole thing solely because youve stated before how jrpgs are now your favorite and just because it isnt your cup of tea doesnt mean you should tell other people not to play it what is a pit of spice and why would getting kicked into one be a bad thing your excellency octofuck hentaidumpster 1994 that your excellency voice acting sounds cringing and corny at an alltime high how about my excellency fun game but fails in its intertexuality good review why do people like to take dunkeys satire in a factual light and either get butthurt cause their favorite youtuber doesnt like the game in question or completely agree with him regardless of playing the game he has stated before that he doesnt like most jrpgs and that is perfectly fine this isnt even a real review this is just more satire i came from a time when people played games forthemselves and formed their own opinion instead of relying on other people to do that for them you know the fight cuold of ended sooner is you used a dagger or skill at least your honest hi can someone tell me what is the 3rd game shown on 0003 ngli love dunkey in general and his content but damn why review a jrpg when youve clearly stated in the past that you hate jrpgs its like saying i hate first person shooters then buying bf or a cod game just to shit on it when youre already aware how you feel about the genre lol fail of a logic tbh oo anyway ill probably get hate just for even saying this but whateves a little bit of a tangent but i agree that grinding does kill the flow of some roleplaying games it can get to the point where the grind is so time consuming that the payout isnt even worth it in the end im speaking on the behalf of the first xenoblade game where its fun at first up until the game feels like its slowing down and thats a problem for people like me who want to immerse themselves in the story there could be the argument made that doing side quests when they become available is the best possible way to play the game but it feels like most of the side quests just detract from whats currently going on in the story and even when you do get a quest you hope to god that you dont have to return to the guy you got the quest from because then its another chore to go out and look for them as well i like to play through the story in one straight shot without too much sightseeing up until ng but when the game crawls due to enemies not giving enough exper your dunksellency annnnd unleash the angry weebs yeah this game looks garbage glad i skipped it to be fair i skip most indie games though after so long im still not sure if i should get this game or not on the one hand i love how it looks it feeds my nostalgia but on the other hand the voice acting sucks the story seems extremely uninteresting and instead of improving upon the good concept of turn based battles they upped the grind so they can say this is a 200 hour game i had not seen you made this video it just reaffirmed that i should either wait till i can pirate it or is on sale for 5 bucks fucking waste of a gorgeous engine god damn i agree with you this jrpg just reminds me of xeno and persona along with jrpgs ex the blond swords man the cloud looking guy the half naked person dont wanna be sexist that red cloth covered girl from xeno the old man with brades we all know this one and etc sure i get it they are action pact and what not but i feel no appeal towards any game like that of what sort because of lack of original concepts i am ignoring style which happens to be something that jrpg fans care about but the games in general dont hate me thanks for saving me some money bravely default did better at story telling and random encounters as you had the ability to turn them off altogether and avoid it completely albeit the story is somewhat generic and theres clearly a formula to it it serves to be what a modern jrpg should be like octopath kinda seems like it took bravely defaults combat slowed it down and slapped a disjointed and scattered story to incentivize the player persona 5 has the same issues imo excluding the random encounters its a polished turd with rng combat and difficulty that only increases the rng to it only people who will love the monotony and the shallow story to put up with the monotony for will like these types of games square enix keeps proving that they cant evolve past their archaic style of gameplay and dont realize when they do something well jrpg companies have a core audience who will eat up any and everything that has the same exact gameplay as any other game theyve played the game is beaut someone didnt play the game past the first chapter yeah i stopped watching this guy after he said octopath was bad i really wish someone would make jrpgs aimed at audiences that dont usually play them final fantasy xv and persona 5 felt kinda like that but otherwise it can get hard to get into the genre either you have to play games from almost twenty years ago now like chrono trigger or you have to slog through complicated mechanics or high difficulty aimed at hardcore fans of the genre like xenoblade or most smt games im not saying they shouldnt make jrpgs for that hardcore demographic just that that can take away from their mainstream appeal everyone here that dont agree with him are just saying no you are wrong because i liked this smt came way before pokemon and does the whole battling with monstersdemons thing way way better why even playif u dont like hey dunkey i understand why you think the game is trash and it probably isi wasnt able to play it for myself but i was looking at trailers for the switch and octopath traveler is one of the major games there advertising so are people just stupid or are they sellouts whats going on i see people saying that his reveiw is negative just because he doesnt like rpgs but really the only bias against rpgs is near the end when he talks about the long battles which do suck because in my opinion the progression in this game sucks the issues he has with the storys i completely agree with and have nothing to do with rpg bias finally somebodys talking about all the bad things in the game all ive heard online is people talking about how amazing the game is when its pretty averagebelow average yall ever notice how many comments there are on anything octopath related talking about people who agree with dunkey but there are no people in the comments who actually agree jrpgs in a nutshell how did this get 11 thousand dislikes looks like shit that just banks on being all flash no substance with the artstyle traditional turn based jrpgs have always been a trash genre that substitutes time invested for skill you really need to have one stand out to be worth playing people are so salty over this its funny you cant really shit on a jrpg for being in its genre but i see where youre coming from fuck yes finally a popular manofthepeople type that a actually shares my opinion on jrpgs why oh why do they have to be so fucking tedious and regurgitate every trope possible guess i just dont get it exactly the type of game that i hate the most dunkey try bravely default damn that shade on xenoblade was fucked up i dont know how to feel about this prequel to octodad what game is at 015 seconds pls 11 thousand triggered fanboys cant handle one mans criticism 028 nier automata final fantasy xv tales of berseria bloodborne and odin sphere you should play undertale its a mastapeace he didnt call this a review and he didnt have to like the game calm tf down people are allowed to have preferences personally i wish he mentioned some of the positives like the music and visuals cause this video still sounded like a closeminded review but i still respecc all the people who think his review shouldent matter because he dosent like jrpgs i have something to say games like persona 5 and other games managed to make a jrpg fun for dunkey where as octopath traveler didnt yup dont try to play an old school jrpg if you have adhd hey dude you know you should complete a game in order to give an accurate review right like i understand even a stellar second half wouldnt exactly make up for the slow start but if there is one its your job to tell us here come the triggered anime virgins its good if you can make your own story but i guess you dont have enough jp for that skill if dunkey doesnt despise turn based combat then i wonder what he thinks of the xcom series the gameplay is very straight forward and literal however the game does have a few random encounters littered throughout the game idk i think it would make for a interesting video i was about to pull out my special your excellency joke but i can see that everyone here already beat the pump out of that joke i highly disagree youve probably played it already but id love a legend of dragoon review for ps1 lmao spoken as a true nonjrpg player combat doesnt look that bad dont like the english dialogue change it to japanese you might learn something the story and noninteraction of party members is definitely something notably lacking but to complain about a standard of the genre silly person oh my god lisa is next to the big boys you just play the game because you dont fucking care about the industry running out of ideas and just play the game for fun not all games need to be all fun gamers like us play games to waste our time and money octagon tangerine is a good franchise most games show alot of excellency all one of them im just going to say itknack suckswhat are you going to do about it if i hear your excellency one more fuuuucking time at least this game doesnt gr ind as much as xc2 im 50 hours into the game none of what you said was true you chose bits and parts and edited it to make it look really bad i dont know you but youre a really bad reviewer youre screwing viewers so that you get some scandalous reaction and for what the views youre really a bad morally evil person you might be entertaining but youre deceiving personally i cant get enough of this game its to me one of the best experiences ive played and even while playing it i know for a fact at least 60 percent or more of people probably wouldnt dig this type of game when i got it it just kinda felt like one of those things that you like and nobody else around you likes or knows about i dont mind random encounters in this game mostly because you gain a lot from completing them at least from my experience every time i do em at least one of my guys levels up and you get a good amount of money also the stories were kinda cool maybe im just jamming to the music too hard to see if its too basic or not but i personally found the game very entertaining i chose therion btw i thought olberics story was kinda boring but hes cool from a battle perspective i enjoy it i know others wont and thats fine if everyone liked the same thing then its not as special and loses some of its charm ophilia is the worst boring uninspired piece of shit that i ever had the displeasure of playing through why is this game so popular it is generic jrpg with a unique visual style thats it it doesnt look like a bad game but seriously fire emblem or octopath traveler a new video your excellency youre excellency her when the king has alzheimers tactic ogre and suikoden tactics are my top gud old rpg i agree with your statements about slowness but imo the artwork is very appealing metal gear your excellency what was the dialogue free game he mentioned at the beginning looked interesting what is 029 from i dont really find what everyone likes in this game 100 of the reason i hate turnbased combat its not fun too tedious too boring and too long octopath is very different from many rpgs the battle system has never been used ever before you have to break the shield to hit good damage against the enemy pokemon has random encounters never heard anyone complain about that if octopath stories connected together then it wont be 8 stories in one game it will be 8 characters in one story thats what it does differiently this video is very misleading because you dunkey have not beaten the game and to make it even worse havent set foot onto the chapter 2s the stories of the characters are not generic like you make them look like if you take the time to understand and finish the stories then you would love the characters but its ok call of duty gamers like yourself are never interested in games that have good stories 1000 1001 1002 1003 oh dont mind me just counting the number of fanboys agreeing with dunkey because hes holding their parents hostage that or theyre just very impressionable and have no opinions of their own 1004 1005 1006 1007 1008 i mean i havent played the game yet i just got off a literal mountain but this game seems like an rpg for rpg fans and not so much fordunkeys first time i agree with dunkey honest game trailer gave the same review lmao why is there so many dislikes wheneth thou playeth thou mario battle royale did dunkey only make this video because sky sky went insane over octopath psychomantisand i havent even played metal gear these eight characters are clearly better than the characters of kotor ya blew it dunkey im happy following the small stories of 8 characters i have played the our team is the only thing standing between our world and an over arching threat of destruction enough something fresh is nice way to completely shit on the combat system lol you had a lvl 22 olberic alone for some reason and couldnt even manage the break system i dont know if that was a joke or a troll people who hate jrpg wont love this one since its exactly what jrpg lovers wanted for years those who claim they like rpgs nowadays are the ones who think action games with rpg elements such as is ffxv are what defines this genre think again classic jrpg are like preffx games not kingdom hearts or final fantasy xv aka ff boys band edition with no story but with effing good graphics good thing that they sold over a million copies worldwide in less than a month it only proves that the ranting were seeing most notably from those who manipulated squareenix enough to change their best ips into some graphic porn fest are just a bunch of whiners who actually hates rpgs but still wants to play them for their wonderful stories but cant bare the fact that these type of games are not meant for them go back to your easy games where they take your hands throughout the game and letus enjoy are more complicated games played this game and i didnt like it so i sold my switch and went back to ni no kuni traveler banter starts the moment you hit your first chapter 2 but why do you have a level 21 character fighting by himself finally someone with the balls to call the game out i love take turn combat and jrpgs but this game is on a huge hype fest as if 90 of the people who are playing it have never touched a jrpg before its really not that great of a game but its not a bad game either just average so when does it get the octomom dlc boss where we have to fight her 8 kids before fighting the fabled octomom herself game wouldve been on my radar but alas missed opportunity nintendo the game has character interaction you can initiate them at the start of chapter 2 and you dont have to grind at all if you just play the story missions the kind of how the story is told is unique to the game and i like that ophilia may say excellency a bit much but that title also exists for bishops and i am not even sure if that is criticism its kinda like the ardenian soldiers quotes meme from xenoblade 2 where it felt empty after they were removed you may describe your points more accurately so someone can actually get them in my eyes you just dislike jrpgs and cant be taken seriously fun fact you can disagree with someone and not hate them i agree i was all on board with this game when the demo first came out but i played the second demo and despite making improvements since the first demo version the story was still disappointing dialogue was tedious depending on who you were playing as and the characters lacked charmbesides tressa who unfortunately lacked any meaningful motivation the combat system was relatively uninspired and frustrating at times admittedly these two arguments could be invalidated by later points in the game but i doubt square enix would do anything innovative maybe ive just been spoiled by xenoblade chronicles1 not 2 and now i cant look at a rpgjrpg without subconsciously comparing it to that master piece but ive played a number of se games and have never been able to finish them because of how boring they all are i have no complains about your critics about the story and the dialogue mainly because i dont have the game already but if you dont like turn based games and random encounters wich its ok why would you start reviewing a game that its heavely implied that its turn based and with random encounters like almost all the retro rpgs and jrpgs in existance i really dont know if this is a review or a opinion or even a first impresion but in either case i have to tell you two things if this video counts as a review dont let your taste get in the middle because you could confuse people who really like those kind of things if in the other hand this is a opinionfirst impresion video you should made a sidenote like in the thumbnail in the beginning or the end of the video that explicitly said that it is your opinion only and even if so bad publicity is still publicity angry fans are commenting nothing about the visuals they arent complex but they manage to impress anyway with the weirdly refreshing fog it adds to me at least woked well creating astonishing visuals haha love this i feel the same way this game is so damn overrated this is a your excellency i love how much the weaboos turned on dunkey for shitting on jrpg cliches i have 3 criticisms about your what you said firstly the character you started with has one of the weaker stories in the game secondly since there is no one starting character or one overarching story making meaningful interactions and development between all combinations of characters would be difficult which is why while playing through their stories theres no real interaction between party members it would be impossible to know which character you start with and build a story around your path you can go through the whole game with no characters aside from your starter and the devs would have no clue in hell my final point is that you were attacking that snail with the wrong weapon it required a dagger to break its block hence why it took you so long seeing your opinion on the game was interesting and im glad that you could share it regardless of how unpopular it is the game receiving a lot of praise and whatnot i respect that angry birds jrpgs you should play angry birds instead uuuum nier automata story was out of this world when ever i hear donkeys voice all i can see in my mind is a black screen even if i could see his face the only thing that would come to mind is a black screen yeah as a whole the chapter ones are the weak point of the game when you get to chapter two you have party banter which really helps and with all the characters you can pick the best ones for a boss fight and speed up random encounters or avoid them with a couple passive skills in my opinion olberic probably has the worst chapter one of them all too although i did like his chapter two story certainly some missed opportunities in the game as a whole but i liked i do like turn based rpg games though this is why western rpgs are betters than jrpgs 11k people wanted bookworm adventures dunkey you were obviously playing it wrong and youreree dumb youreee not a weeb like us so you dont undersand how quality this game is i play it everyday and havent played any other game ever but this is easily the best game ever made and if you dont understand that then its just too unique and smart for you please delete this im too insecure to take criticisms of this game what game is at 015 and 018 it really feels like they tried to recapture saga frontier with this game and just failed knack 3 is going to be turn based another upload another masterpiece nothing unique about this game dunkey is supreme gas the weebs i wanted this game to be good so badly sigh you are brilliant but the fbombs keep me from being able to watch this with family this game is another prime example of crappy game design sitting on top of beautiful graphics and music there are good games based on turn based battle like stick of truth or many of the fire emblem games the problem is that a lot of elements just dont make sense in this game for example the weakness of the enemies you can find snakes that fear darkness in a dark cave and flogs that fear light in a plain land i dont even understand how the logic work its almost like the designer just used a random function to decide what weaknesses each enemy has and that completely eliminate strategies from all the battles the only thing you need to do is just knocking the enemy out and use boost attack rinse and repeat the other thing dunkey didnt mentioned in the video is how weird the side quest progressions are every time you finish a main quest you unlock some side quests and a lot of them require character special abilities to progress and if you think the game would does anyone know the game thats before inside please help tldr dunkey hates jrpgs so stop trying to prove him wrong with what he says as hes not gonna care the music in this game is amazing bravely default and bravely second are amazing this isnt bookworm adventures deluxe you should play bookworm adventures good bye ff franchise welcome octopath franchise finally something i can agree with about this game you see i cannot survive unless i know the big internet man shares opinions with me and if he doesnt i get the angry galaxy is under sms tho this game wouldve been goodfor 30 this game reminds me of star ocean the second story keep in mind that dunkey despises traditional jrpgs so dunkey is very much not the target audience here never thought i would disagree more with a dunkey video gotta love all the people missing the point on the snail part the whole turn based combat issue is that it adamantly wastes your fucking time animation intro wait time between turns and selecting attacks for party members animation outro of characters saying one liners or doing cool shit like flips or sword twirls battle results animation outro like fade to black or whatever if this game wanted to be different it would actively try to reduce the pointless elements in random encounters to let you get straight to the action get it over with and move on to the next one the same enemies being fought over and over again with all that extra fluff adds up save the intros the outros the one liners the sword twirls of victory etc for the bosses and major encounters only plays for the first act then says the story is bad ophelias vocabulary consists of two words yours and excellency specifically in that order ophelia is a pretty good talker though when shes not near an archbishop only this game bruh every turn based game are like this you played alot of games dunkey comeon loving this game streets of rage two baybeeee well this game is selling like hot cakes right now but guys remember in dunkey critics review he said himself he does not like rpgs and especially turn based rpgs this game is wonderful you can tell by the sales its only dunkeys opinion but he is biased to rpgs though if your interested in this game looks up reviews youll enjoy it ofc it isnt perfect and he brings up some good points but this game is still really good is the voice of the kings guard the same as dio dunkey is not pleased your excellency bahaha great stuff i share the same opinion on this game not so much that its a bad experience but i hate a lot of the same shit thats shown here so the game wouldve been great if it had better writing better design and if it came out 20 years ago gameplay criticism aside he makes a good point in that back in the 2d era of video games jrpgs were basically the only option for storytelling in videogames i loved golden sun growing up in middle school but i bet id find the story super boring now i want a game like this so fucking much but im not buying another switch just for this shit not one of nintendos best games i recommend you try greg hastings paintball 2 it redefined my sexuality i thought this game looked like trash from a distance and looks like i was right i dont understand the hype for such a middle of the road game wow this video sure was super you know what else is super greg hastings paintball 2 for the nintendo wii excellentcy doesnt sound like a word anymore while i understand your frustration with the story telling a lot of the other things you mentioned just sound like gripes from someone who isnt a fan of the genre to begin with random encounters can be decreased over time btw you failed to mention the path actions oh and for a turn based game it has one of the best combat systems out there you just dont like turn based rpgs which is okay but that doesnt mean the game is bad far from it honestly i played the game for the first 3 hours on the demo version good thing i didnt buy it i tried paying attention to the story in hopes of something interesting might happen but the game was a residentsleeper pokemon meets inception yep a lot of comments on here have just missed the point of the video and im not sure how the most disliked dunkey video ever you should play ys series the last jrpg i ever play is ys celceta and its a good game why have only one dude in your part at level 25 and you dont even use the battle system right purse owner 5 video i grew up loving jrpgs from a distance and really wanted this to be the one but the excessive grinding is killing it for meusing primrose to xp boost is way more frustrating than funlooks like me and jrpgs or anything final fantasypersona are never going to be on good terms its just like papa franku said weeaboos are relentless and the disease is spreading dunkey youve got some serious guts talking shit about octopath in front of squenix fanboys everyone who gives a negative review gets dislike bombed but you did it anyway mad respect for that this game makes really makes you feel like youre playing ragnarok online man first dunkey video i disagree with whoever made random encounters should be kicked into a fucking pitt of spice and shot with a bazooka truth i get that its your opinion and that i respect you dont have to like it but why purposefully make the game look like ass some points were actually genuine and i got the funny parts but this makes the game look like hot garbage in comparison to other gameplay you say you hate random encounters but have you played mario and luigi bowsers inside story i count that as a random incounter you will see what i mean they dont even interact with eachother looks like someone hasnt even gotten to chapter 2 to people who disliked how dunkey made this video i think he was bashing it because of how hyped it was yet did not deliver also he might of done it because of how everyone says this is the best thing ever but is not this is what happens when weebs do voice overs do a review on hyrule warriors please dunkey well dunk0 i think you fucked up with this one assasins creed is one of the most beloved videogame franchise ever made and microsoft did an awesome job with it i think the games amazing it has a really nostalgic feel about it but i agree with you that it could have been a lot better i hope the sequel is as good as bookworm adventure deluxe i kinda had the sensation that youre not really into classic jrpgs your excellency what was the game referenced with no storytellingtalking psycho mantis excellencey i finish the game and was im at post game and that suddenly ties all stories together in a way but honestly it kinda fucked me a bit when i heard the name and that it was from nintendo i thought it was gonna be a prequel to splatoon dunkeys opinion of jrpgs is my opinion of any moba ever with that said this game looks great dont do heroin kidsyou might accidently make a new octopath traveler seems pretty spot on to me it has promise but the cons out way the pros and shut any enjoyment of the game down almost instantly charles wallace haanits dialogue though what the actual fk i like the game and most of the dialogue and i dont mind ye olde english but holy shit is it just unpleasant to read something that different tis thee thy thou ye those are all fine but damn finishedst thankenee at least dont put like 5 of them within a single sentence space them out some more played the demo when it came out and deleted it faster than my web history when the fbi came to my house asking questions lol seriously though this game is waaay to generic and cliche to enjoy in 2018 who do i believe dunkey or ign of course the snail wont die this game isnt just easy basic hit and win its strategic you need to break their shield by finding the vulnerability they have and then you do max damage i normally dont comment on these kind of videos but personally feel the review was exaggerated and misleading local vegan eats meat is mad its meat persona 5 shits all over this game and its not even funny if youre defending this game and havent played persona 345 then just lmao sit down good video next make a video on super dunkey ball so you hate pokemon too then ign 93 dunkey is the only reviewer i trust the game seems to be fun donkeys commentary was fun tho more like gaypath gayer and despite that i still like the art style valid criticisms throughout but the fact you left out that the art is fucking gorgeous disappointed me random encounters are irredeemable your excellency good menes honestly surprised you even bothered reviewing this game youve established yourself as being the antithesis of a jrpg lover so why did you decide to review a game that is deliberately trying to replicate or at the very least evoke feelings of the og final fantasy games im not knocking you giving another game a shot but i just dont think you should have reviewed this game given your track record im quite the opposite the big reason why i am drawn to jrpgs is for the turn based and random encounters i love extremely grindy games one of my main games i am playing right now is warframe and it is sooooo fucking grindy i am in love with it lol good vid dunk i demoed with olberic and cyrus your excellency dunkey should play the tales games no random encounters or fine based combat despite the slew of negative comments i have yet to find one that actually effectively rebukes the points dunkey made in this video what an awful review its not a donkey kong game made 20 years ago so dunkey dont like it what a surprise so i havent seen any reviews for this game but is it as bad as hes making it out to be or is he just joking because i cant tell sometimes i love random encounters its what made me fall in love with fallout 1 2 i love turn based combat too the writing looks like garbage though normally i would agree with your assessment but you are wrong in this case opinion or not you apparently didnt grow up with any of the rpg classics on the nes or computer no text based games as a child no wondering why you found a key in the middle of nowhere no nonexistent internet to give your childish mind the answers shakes head im ashamed of you dunkeyyou have no soul when it comes to true gameplay for you it has to be now now now die die die with little thinking or patience i take it dungeons and dragons is too slow with little to no visuals thus will receive a bad review from you open your mind you millennial piece of shit sit back and enjoy the adventure and learn the reasons said characters are together in the first place the characters are not friends they are not acquaintances they are just travelers going the same direction because they are just traveling together there is no need to converse with one another each character is focused on their the knight is just basch from ffxii now wheres a video that talks about why i should buy a switch just for the game cuz i need more jrpgs in my life you should try battlechasers nightwar that and persona 5 which it looks like youve played are both great modern jrpgs dunkey your excellency how the fuck did i missed this video that fat king is hot i love the game massively but i cant dispute your gripes each to their own and all that i like the game its just the formula sucks blaming reggie for your ignorance and inexperience on the genre look in a mirror who are all the stinky neck beards that disliked this lmao dude you just lied about this game wow how dare you have opinions other than 1010 about lord nintendo not everyone will like every great game good grunt must be dead especially fuel rod grunt wait octopath traveller is a jrpg with random encounters turnbased combat terrible dialogue and horrible level grinding what more do you want from a jrpg youre probably just really shit at this game but your excellency the games quality is not my problem something is wrong with you if you dont like octopath traveler you can pick japanese instead of english if you pick cyrus as your first character his very first support skill reduces the rate of random encounters your welcome please play divinity original sin 2 its a game i think youd dare give a 4 dunkey has said before that you dont need to agree with everything a reviewer says tbh i can understand why he doesnt like it its a game for people who loved the classic rpg games that square would make in the 16 bit era which is why i love it its cool he doesnt like it because its made for me baby its a way better game than he makes it out to be if he doesnt like it thats fine but i feel like most of what he says is just too biassed octopath traveler really just wasnt that unique something really unique is saving 15 or more on car insurance with geico personally i disagree 100 with this video he has a right to say anything he wants however and i will respect that funny how different opinions can be you thought the game wasnt all that great when i just saw another review claiming it to be one of the best games of the decade now if it were a golden sun game whoever invented random encounters needs to be bathed in my tears and fucking torn to shreds by a ratata i love jrpgs and was really excited for this game but tbh everything dunkey said i completely agree with and have been saying since the demo whoever invented random encounters should be kicked into a pit of spice and shot with a bazooka absolutely lost my shit the game has beautiful art but the story is just awful and the random encounters he likes persona 5 though which makes me a happy man dunkey was predisposed to dislike the game even though hes liked others of the same genre so im going to ignore every single argument he throws in the video dunkey i dont like turnbased jrpgs also dunkey i will now play a turnbased jrpg i will say that art design is stunning though the only upside for this game is the art style this video is a bit disingenuous because dunkey left out the part where you can go wherever you want and can get the other party members whenever you want the pace of the story is dictated entirely on how you want to proceed i saw a lot of people getting really excited for this game but i was never really a fan it isnt really that special beyond the graphics but if you want a pretty game you can just play mario oddysey or almost any game available on the switch see dunk i know you typically dont like turn based combat and i can tell you dont like the random encounter bit because youre minding your business them bam a shame you cant get past those to really appreciate the nice 2d sprite work and the kick ass music my friend but hating on whats possibly the most anticipated switch title not counting the usuals and that is why youll never get into ikon clan random encounters serve pokmon because of the collecting element youre meant to catch different pokmon in all the areas where there are encounters so it adds some excitement when youve been hunting around for one you dont see very often and it finally pops up you also dont have to go out of your way to grind in these places too often there are plenty of nonrandom trainer battles ay dunk scale of 110 do you like any fire emblem games i completely fucking agreejust watching the anime dialogue in this i had to bite my fingers to keep from being bored to death maybe your excellency is said one time too many but then again the writing is also too close to the japanese where titles especially in front of royalty is utmost importance i know who cares but a thought in defence theres a lot of mad donkeys here that music is pretty solid though i like the internet because it has turnbased conversations and random encounters with all sorts of creatures careful traveler nothing but memes and angry jrpg fans in these comments the game seems like a decent rpg but it looks like someone put vaseline everywhere if u have bias against turn based rpgs dont fucking play it i 100 agree with you on random encounters that shit has gotta go why developers still think its fine to put those in baffles me we should at least be able to run into the enemies on the field if we need to grind or whatever there are a lot of jrpgs epecially that ive played like ni no kuni for example that did this and i enjoyed the combat far more than the ones that didnt like ff games 110 i like how all the octopath fans legit think hes making fun of the game when they have probably never watched his content and realized this is what he does as a joke but magikarpusedly made me so hyped dunkey you make content way too fast jrpgs come down to one and only one thing you like them or you dont thats literally it done a game can be literally a masterpiece a literal god send but if its a jrpg its just all about whether you like the genre or you dont i have nothing against turnbased games but i despise jrpgs and i literally have no idea why the game looks fucking stunning just gotta say that dunkeys microreview formula is like a continuation of xplay this is a guy who definitely watched old school techtv cant wait donkey to review dragon quest 11 i still cant believe games like this can be successful sonic boom rise of lyric made me desire a sandwich your opinion doesnt matter if your pfp is that of an anime character its just science octopath is a good franchise yep looks like shitcan jrpgs just lie down and die now already theyve been outclassed for a while nowthe genre is as dead as rts octodad was better before they got signed to a new publisher dunkey who doesnt like old school turn based jrpgs doesnt like an old school turn based jrpg who could have seen this coming your excellency first video i watched from this guy and i already dislike him ffs this is one of the best games i ever played if u dont like something dont destroy it for other people i agree with everything in this videoexcept the dig at xenoblade chronicles 2 that game is a masterpiece good sht your dunkullency this game plays alot like star oceansecond story damn youre the first person i heard to dislike it awesome thanks darksouls oohhhis bad because she says your excellencywait what insert meme quote to get thousands of likes has dunkey played divinity original sin or made a video about it the complaints in this made me think its the opposite of everything great about div should definitely try it if he didnt but it is not a short game sequel was officially released earlier this year iirc i like octopath traveler but aye to each his own dont just say a game is bad because you didnt like it and with only about 20 to 40 hours its obvious you havent played all the stories and youre supposed to grow with the jrpg not just turn it on and expect yourself to instantly love it xc2 story seemed utter garbage to me before chapter 3 then someone died and then stuff just happened that made me love the game just give a game a good chance and maybe itll be your next favorite game your excellency but yeah bookworm adventures deluxe such a fine piece of work youre a cool and smart guy and i take your reviews seriously i bought gow 4 after watching yours and i was not disappointed keep those babies coming those 10k dislikes sure do say alot dont they i loved chrono trigger that was an epic game on a tablet was it on something else glad to see someone who shares my deep seated hatred of jrpgs i do have to commend the visuals of this game this game is so boring i cant even finish this video psycho mantis a lot of people are mad about how dunkey reviewed this game but i must be missing something where does it say this is a review excellency intensifies whats the point of reviewing an jrpg if you hate the turn based cobats makes no sense yeah this is a crap game you should play actual good rpgs like homie rollerz it looks cool people from above stay away from the comment sectionbunch of salty weebs your welcome octopath is actually a great game you just dont get how intelligent the subtones of it are paper mario 1 and 2 actually fixed that problem with turned based random encounters once you reach a certain level you can equip a badge that insta kills weak enemies so we have a princess gasai yuno that is neither interesting nor a yandere and instead of a problem with saying yuki its your excellency 1010 ign would go to a parallel universe to your excellency again this game looks like a boatload of fun honestly its not exactly surprising he has a low opinion of this game dunkey has gone on record saying that he normally doesnt like jrpgs and turn based combat song at the end wait so will you play the game your excellency i have to pee kinda wanna see his opinion on persona 5 a review or something they should have done this exact same thing except make it golden sun and have a good storyline people would have eaten that up the graphics are really good but for gods sake the dialogue and lack of interaction between characters is bullshit of the highest degree i like random encounters the name is wrong though its not really random why i dont like traditional jrpgs i thought this was a sequel to octodad yeah nothing really stood out about this game to be honest its amazing how a little game called earthbound from an early era of rpgs still mostly holds up to this day but octopath ends up suffering from a lot of the tediousness of old rpgs octopath is more for people who love a good grind i dont know why i love this game p i think its just the kind of story and sounds i need in these months can i say this game is ugly looks like an hd mod for a flash game 81 likes to dislikes thats atrocious for a dunkey video im not surprised given that you played a game you knew you werent going to like and then said you didnt like it this video honestly made me want to unsubscribe at the very least he couldve said hey if youre like me and not a huge fan of jrpgs this probably isnt gonna change your mind but instead he proceeded to shit on the genre rather than the game itself with the exception of a few things and basically gave negative press to a game that is not only pretty damn good but also has a really cool studio behind it that unlike almost every studio open these days decided to release the full game with no plans to charge people extra with dlc and a season pass this review was honestly boneheaded and dunkey should probably just stick to his normal content or at least play the whole game before he decides to review it nnnnnnnnnnngh that savage criticism dunkey i love it jprg is a game for pedophiles who love japan was funny as hell watching eza try to hype up the grindy ass combat this game has whyyy i understand dunkeys opinion on this but it kinda sucks that this happens to be the most viewed video on this game every friend i talk to thinks this game sucks while i think this game is amazing i cant express my love for this game without getting a isnt that the trash game dunkey made a video on whenever i talk about it i try my best to convince them to give it a chance after all they are rpg fans it just kinda sucks that the only info they have on this game is from this video giving a vastly negative view on it also this is one of the first third party switch exclusive games besides mario and rabbids and having the most popular video on youtube about this game talking bad about it has a bad influence on future third party switch exclusives a lot of my friends were turned off from the game by this video and im sure a lot of other people were as well but this game in my opinion deserves praise along with the negatives not all negativity r so many butt hurt jrpg fans your excellency is now immoral to say disgusting i actually am really enjoying octopath i think that the story definitely could have been better but it does get much more interesting after the first chapters also the random encounters and combat system are part of where the game really shines i love that most random encountersat your level especially take time to beat i get incredibly bored and tired with a game if the random encounters are easy like in pokemon also the art work and music is incredibly beautiful i honestly just really dig jrpgs and turn based combat jrpgs so i really enjoy the game dunkey play smt nocturne its a really good turn based jrpg that stands out from other happy go lucky jrpgs of its time it has a mature point of view in terms of story plus your standard attack is punching the shit out of everything apparently youve never played so the last hope god those were some crap characters is octopath terribler a good game solo character introductions that reset w each character sounds like wild arms keep in mind that dunkey absolutely hates turnbased combat rpgs in general so watch a review by someone who does if you are interested in this game and yes dunkey opinions are still valid most turn based games are trash sorry fam i really like you dunkey i stopped listening when he said bubsy 3doctopath traveler was bad man plays videogames on youtube makes video on game he did not like some viewers complain that he willingly misrepresented the game make comments on video they did not like lol triggered weebs its just his opinion shut up with your opinions about it best review haters are dumb dumb bubledumbs dragonquest 11 looks dope though this video reminds me of filthy franks weeaboo video where he talks about in the video everyone is pushing him to make fun of disease war abuse and all that but the second he makes fun of anime woah woah frank youve gone too far first of all yeah everything is hilarious when things get made fun of but when someone makes fun of the thing you like then oh shit time to retaliate on your keyboard and talk about how everyones opinions on the things you like are invalid unless they line up with yours there are people who dont like turn based rpgs and jrpgs get over it somebody not liking the thing you like shouldnt effect you i really love arcade games from the early 80s my favorite being donkey kong becuase of how fun and difficult it is if i read some article of somebody talking shit on the game talking about was it really that good to begin with i wouldnt get triggered becuase that article doesnt stop me from liking that thing its just an article get over it and seems to me that you just dont like rpgs everyone complaining that this video is a review heres a tip dunkview is the indicator for his reviews this is just shitposting your excellency intensifies i think rpgs just arent your thing ophilias chapters are the most insufferable fucking things ill stick to dragon quest and shin megami tensei thanks play divinity 2 is this a memes um dude did you even play the game dunky i love you man but i really did not like this review great job on that snail fight which you fought overleveled and left only one enemy behind so you could video it out of context they should have just made a remastered of final fantasy 36 and not spent their materials on a waste of ff16 art style you should play luigis mansion fast paced turn based combat done right into the breach one of the few times ill flat out disagree with you a japanese voices are a must b you started knight not thief thief doesnt suck c you can skip each characters solo introduction to keep your chosen protagonists story moving along at a good clip d knack 2 baby im just glad some people actually like this game as i do i understand some games arent for everyone and im glad that there are people like dunkey that state their opinions despite possible backlash but i agree they overdid it on the your excellency damn compact concise and really informative this is how you make a review whats the game in 015 sec says he doesnt mind turn based combat but i the review video he says he hates it now this really makes you feel like batman dunkey just doesnt like turn based combat because hes black are you going to post a video on the r6 tournament do a video on moonlighter what about bluedragon bookworm adventures deluxe please i dont even like turn based combat that much and i love this game agree to be disagree i guess woah woah woah dunky i think your forgetting your actually not allowed to have a different opinion to everyone else on the internet what you really need to say is octopath traveller makes you feel like the characters bookworm adventures where what videogameunky is actually mrmeatman can you play crysis br islands of nyne i cant argue with any of the criticism here but as a dad who doesnt get remotely as much time for gaming and doesnt chew through my catalog like dunkey might i am enjoying the game immensely i dont mind the grind because once you do get a rhythm you can blast through those encounters quickly and the payoff for doing them increases the break and boost system gives you a huge amount of agency in how you approach fights and that also lets you annihilate weaker enemies in literally a few seconds added to this is that getting into and out of fights takes almost no time so those random encounters dont punctuate gameplay remotely as much as they do in most jrpgs also like the bravely series the depth on the game doesnt come from egregious breadth you dont have all these trifling little side mechanics that seem to be there only to prove how clever the des are that just overwhelm the player with responsibilities there are only a few real mechanical components to g i heard people love this game so many time but i for some reason im inclined to believe dunkboi over critically acclaimed review channels when are you going to post bookworm adventures really looking forward to that stick to spaghetti and meatballs fucking at least play the thing if youre gonna review it dunkey is the joe pesci of youtube people definitely need to speak out more and more against games that force you to grind its just lazy game design there are rpgs out there that have meaningful combatbattles not this repetitive shit were getting old ok i love rpgs my favorite games of all time are rpgs but this game is so bare one of the best things in any rpg is how your party members interact with each other how they can connect how they see there views of the world our the people were fighting but this game doesnt do that like at all you go to a town to find someone you chat you hear there story through flashback now there one your team and when you go and finish there quest the cutscense shows it as your not even there how cool would it of been if lets say cyrus talks to ophilla about the flame as thats something hes never seen so while helping her he gets to see something hes probably never seen and only heard about in book our the knight because i cant remember his name and how he can not trust the theive because of the mark the theive has but through the story you can see them get a closer bond i cant believe im saying this but i kinda wish square enix expanded on the story for once game play is fun th man i thought this was outback steakhouse man i thought this was the mcdonalds drive thru why the fuck did i not get a notification damn i was definitely interested in this game since i am a sucker for jrpgs especially ones that are stylistically influenced by the old ffs like ffvi but everything youve pointed out are really big red flags i still kinda want to play the game for myself just to see if i could still find enjoyment out of it but with a 60 price tag i think i might wait and see if i could get it used or borrow it from a friend bbbut donkey how could you not worship the ground this game walks on back to playing dragon quest 5 dunkey says something bad about a popular game people noooooooo noooooooooo noooooooo its wrong got turned off this game before i even made it to the first random encounter in the demo the story was uninspired and longwinded you summed up my thoughts on jrpgs more eloquently than anyone ever has thank you you know knacks not all that good i know you hate these game man but i feel you might be missing some stuff like for example sure combat against 1 enemy is monotonous if you just mash attack and boost with 1 weapon instead of trying with others to see if you can break with them but the combat is way better when theres multiple enemy types because it forces you to think about what your best move is ie break a boss whos preparing a major attack or attacking his cronies and while yes the stories and characters are cliches cyrus is literally sherlock holmes theyre still funny to watch and personally work best when taken notso seriously not to mention some of the travel banter is pretty amusing shame its less frequent though also these nuts is the best attack name ever this isnt a dunk view hmmmm every game from japan that gets an english voiceover always has terrible dialoguealways yo dunkey every few videos i see a glimpse of hollow knight yet a video hasnt been made yet whens that hollow knight dunkview vid coming out bro pokemon meets inception bbut jojo wow actually super glad i watched this when i did been thinking about picking this game up but the lord dunkey has spoken thanks for the insight your excellency can you play roblox again there is a bookworm game in it your excellency i couldnt refuse to give you a like i love the old 8bit rpgs and i dig this game dunk this is my favourite review honest i like that no bullshit bookworm adventures deluxe actually has a good story y o u r e x c e l l e n c y can you do a review of mort the chicken for ps1 guys i think we should burn dunkys house down so that he dies that is the most fitting punishment for this treason ps give bubsy a second chance it is the best video game ever im 3 by the way i thought about getting this game but you just saved me some money dunkey hates rpgs new here does he always talk like joe pesci from casino i love dunkey have been watching this idiot for years but what the hell dude dont make videos just to whine about a genre it comes off as lazy and tasteless youve made it clear in the past that you dont like jrpgs why beat a dead horse its been while since dunk has made a review video that felt like him but its always worth the wait ill always be a fan no matter what kind of experimenting with content he does but its always nice to get a classic once in a while or should i say a mastapiece but dunkey a lot of people like turn based rpg and random encounters it is pretty much a genre at this point i liked final fantasy series much better when they were classic rpg for an instance woudnt you be upset if your favorite game like mario for an example was turned into something you dont really enjoy its how i personally feel with ff franchise what a rip off of bookworm adventures deluxe spaghetti and meatballs still waiting for jampack vol3 with an exclusive peak to dankeys new for honor character cant trust a guy who was actually waiting for a banjo kazooie sequel the frog king approves a gaggle of jrpg spergs approached jrpg spergs cast dislike dunkey took 10000 points of damage dunkeys fans liked the video smaaaash 70000 points of mortal damage to jrpg spergs dunkey as a porto rican decent how do you feel about papa john saying the filthy word now you cant make fun of papa johns any momentum the story could have had is thrown directly into the garbage can so we can introduce a new guy the game just kind of resets when you find a new character so you can play out their solo introductory chapter its a really disjointed way of storytelling and even once they join your party they dont actually interact with each other their stories just play out in complete solitude with your team just happening to be there i liked this retro review of dragon quest iv but when are you going to talk about octopath traveler dunkey all i know is octopath got nothing on knack 2 videogamedunkey play beat saber its the best game on the marked right now with good mechanics and some killer custom songs i would give knack 2 a 1110 hahha but 2d pixel games is good though i gotta say though the art direction of this game looks pretty sick the only turnbased rpg i like is pokemon the others are just boring you are dead on about the story the writing sucks and is full of annoying anime tropes that said the combat is great and i love the look of the game if it takes you that long to take out a level one enemy the problem is you figuring out the most efficient way to take out enemies is super fun and if you are having a hard time doing that then you are using the wrong characters hate to say that you do make some points go back to league damn i wanted to show you the game im developping but you dont like turnbased system so its a shame octopath traveller really makes you feel like your excellency this game is gay obleric is dio 1010 for those who are salty about the review if you arent capable of developing your own opinion or unable to view others with open mind you shouldnt be looking for feedback at all i completely agree not playing many rpgs for the same reasons but some people actually like the monotony of games like this the salt from both sides i like this game personally it just has a slow beginning but it does get better as it progresses lol ur bugging xenoblade is a masterpiece despite the extremely terrible voice acting full disclosure i havent played this game dont own a switch so i have no intention of getting it but i am a big jrpg fan basically just trying to say i have stake in this conversation but im not a butthurt fanboy dunkey shouldnt be making videos about game genres that he doesnt really like inherently i felt both this and his xenoblade 2 videos were in bad faith still entertaining but i cant take him too seriously he doesnt like this genre inherently so why would i use him as a gauge of the quality of individual games dunkey if this is meant to be a serious review then its not very professional youre allowed to not like it but you should at least approach it from the perspective of okay what is this game trying to do does it do it well would people who enjoy this sort of thing like what its doing its like going into the comments section of a videogamedunkey video and getting upset that people are talking about bookworm adventures deluxe like what were you expecting thats just part of the experience puts on fedora thats just your opinion dude but dont misrepresent the game by using that weak ass dagger to show how slow the games combat is tips fedora and when you said that persona was pokemon meets inception scoffs i could hardly contain my fury pokemon is a watered down version of persona 1 at best fallout does random encounters very welll sadly i cant trust his opinions on jrpgs since hes predisposed to dislike aspects of them that fans of the genre actually enjoy oh and xenoblade chronicles 2 has a better story than the likes of uncharted can even dream of so let it be said dunkey is just one opinion out there still love his humor tho weaboos unsheath their internet swords in defense of this mediocre rpg with horrendous dialogue you cant turn off im curious why did dunkey decide to play this game knowing full well he wouldnt like it i thought the game looked very bland and uninteresting especially after i saw this video but i personally really enjoyed it when i tried the demo even though i didnt think i would yo saw a lot of hate for this one wanted to tell you man you echo mah voice dont let them suckers get ya but your excellencyeight characters shot with a bazooka why would you put this in any game because they gave you a reason to mention it mic drop i really love how triggered jrpg fans can get lmao you should play bookworm adventures deluxe its a mastapeace youre on my hit list dunko re unsubscribed until you post more bookworm your excellency is really spoiling us with these ferrero rocher why so many dislikes but what is the rating how do i know if i should buy it you blew it dunk i gotta say i expected an indepth review and only only got a mere toedip out of this this game is a successor to old school final fantasy games much like how bravely default was but dunkey 5 we need a rating or the video doesnt count whats with the dislikes wow pretty disappointed of this game i thought it was gonna be a masterpiece turns out its a boring but beautiful piece of art you should really try playing bookworm adventures deluxes it is much better so when are you gonna play bookworm adventures deluxe the fact that dunkey is a beta that hates jrpgs is what makes his critique all the more valid hes not blind to all the downsides of this genre aggressive waste of time play hollow knight 4 switch yikes this video really brought all the mindless dunkey white knights in spades i enjoyed the video but the review itself was pretty weak ever since the new update for the infamous no mans sky would you do a rereview of the game and talk about what has changed idiot dont interact with each other you mean like the travel banters man the diehard jrpg fans are pissed dub always ruins everything can anyone tell me whats the third pixel game in the beginin hows going mrmeat this game its nothing compared to bookworm adventures deluxe dunkey you have absolutely destroyed v great job ooo triggered people everywhere what a lovely day so disappointed you didnt start the video by saying octopath traveler is a sequel to octodad it was planned to keep you busy during the nintendo drought you dont know the struggle until your running in a cave in pokemon trying to go back to a pokemon center whilst praying you dont running into a random encounter i think this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the video game landscape at the minute people love this game because its as cliche as you claim not inspite of it traditional turn based jrpgs as a genre have by and large been sidelined by the industry in favour of more lucrative genres that appeal to a more casual userbase octopath traveller is not only a good game but a love letter to fans of jrpgs whove essentially been neglected for years not to mention the fact it still manages to innovate the story progression is nontraditional the combat while still turn based is pretty unique and engaging and the soundtrack is the best ive seen in years hence why this game has sold far beyond expectations with squareenix even apologizing because their second restock has sold out your excellency bowser and his minions have taken over the mushroom kingdom you should try rainbow moon or rainbow skies random encounters are when you want them chef excellency did u by chance record the siege championship u played if so can u make it a vid maybe thank you for being honest people inflate too much this thing all these octoshills in the comments alright dunkey this is a quality video but wheres the video for the super mario brothers live action movie i somehow feel that he didnt finish the game what a biased lying sack of shit i want him to play the secret of dunkey island before bookworm arkham city excellency doesnt even sound like a real word after hearing it so many times pretty bad taste seek a different hobby can we get a review of hyper light drifter fucking amazeballs game damn it looks so good tho please play bookworm adventures deluxe walking around and having to fight something at random was the best part of pokemon too bad there was no dunkview score at the end i mean you like persona 5 and undertale which have alot of the same elements you criticized this game for the encounters in undertale are just a slog after youve been through them the first time and the vast majority of mobs require at least 2 turns to spare or kill depending on the run in persona 5 you gotta wait until the end date for the heist to continue the story which you would normally use to grind or enhance social links but then you have social links that are hidden behind certain walls that you wouldnt know about if you never played the game there are times you can hang out with someone 3 days in a row and they wont get past level 4 as for octopath the main problem i see with the game is the fact you have to grind to get every member of the party at a certain level in order to progress the story this is because they need to take up a space in order to progress the story and you cant switch your main character in order to build a better shell for them as a g i honestly love his videos because they are funny except for the reviews i find myself disagreeing at most of them including this one it could be because dunkey has different views than i do but like dunkey said in his critics video you dont need to go eye to eye with a reviewer im real glad you made this i saw so many people losing their minds making it out like its more than just a turn based rpg so i played the demoprologue and i didnt understand the interest at all this has perfectly summed up all my thoughts on this game and im so glad it wasnt just me dunk made a post on reddit today seems a lot of people are upset with my octopath traveler video and while its a pretty grumpy assessment ill admit it is my honest opinion from what i played which was about 10 hours and having beat chapter 1 for each character im sorry if you felt mislead by the video but like nearly all of my videos some things are exaggerated or taken out of context to make the video more entertaining but overall i think i very faithfully represented the game how it actually is from my perspective like i said in the video there are positive elements in the game the soundtrack and visual style are very good the combat system has promise and shines more so during boss fights but a lot of my time playing octopath felt like a waste with the game forcing me to the fight the same trash mobs over and over again most jrpgs are guilty of this but i dont see why its not a point worth criticizing when some in the genre are attempting to over what show is that at 30 second in hey dunkey this is not bookworm adventures delux you should try that instead in a surprise twist instead of suggesting bookworm adventures deluxe you should instead check out the game deep rock galactic super fun and i have no doubts it would make an entertaining video topic turn base combat is the worse thing ever happened to gaming me and the raid boss both agrees to take turns to damage each other and also stand still to take the full damage stupid dunkeygo play your hd 4k games instead oof glad i watched this edit this comment was meant to be sarcastic hoping that would come across by my quoting the iconic death soundeffect from the roblox online game oof i have now added italics to suggest this tone and aid in understanding even though i disagree with everything he said about the game it would make since if he doesnt like jrpgs but if thats not the case then i dont understand glad i didnt let the hype get to me lots of people recommended me this and i said i dont like turnbased combat or jrpgs and they said it was so good id like it anyway just like when a lot of the same people said to play nier automata despite me saying i dont like bullethell mechanics or jrpgs and i ended up buying it anyway that games writing and voice acting was atrocious dont even me with that you just arent smart enough to get it that shit was written so teenage weebs could understand it it just sucked i am no man im a sword game ends dunkster my boyo the legend hear me out my friend downloaded and played ecco the dolphin defender of the future and i just really think its something you should try i think you would just love it you should play divinity original sin 2 its a mastapeace hey dunkzilla id like to know your honest opinion on team fortress 2 because i feel like you hate it whats the song playing at the very end all i see here are people falling over themselves to defend their favorite youtuber but not that many people actually criticizing the video i need to know this end credit wind waker remix track im glad i wasnt the only one who thought this was a very generic rpg with nothing remotely special like didnt nintendo have better projects to do turn based combat is soooooooo dull lmao usually just end up repeating the same shit over and over when you figure out which combos work best i could understand it if it looked really cool but the games graphics are dog shit and no i dont mean dog shit in that its not triple a hd graphics lol because i love games like shovel knight undertale and enter the gungeon but this game just looks dull and flavourless in its vfx and sprites that and the fact that it seems like the game takes a lot of grinding with random encounters im not sure why anyone would get this game im captain bosch but your excellency wheres my halo 5 recap okay but did you like the game unironically this video was garbage he obviously played very little of the game because half of his points werent even fucking true typically i laugh and go along even if i dont agree because his points make sense from someone elses view but this is literally just lies and inexperience we get it you dont like jrpgs dont trash on a good one because you dont like the genre this is a great game however i didnt see any bookworm adventure deluuxe not satisfied this is such a rip off of that game dunkey i fuckin love your videos dude i just get baked and geek for hours at them sometimes always a welcomed laughter i absolutely love octopath but damn the characters are very flat and not the cool 2d sprite flat either but i will say had this game not had any voice overs i would love it more the voices are stupid generic i havent even bothered to check to see if i can even turn them off but i will say i do like oberic a lot as a character his story to me makes sense but i wish it was 8 characters with 1012 hour stories each because then the characters would actually be decent and then give them unique people they can add to the party turn based is great never have been a fan of random encounters chrono cross spoiled me with seeing enemies on the screen for the first time in my gaming life anyways homie hope you find some more enjoyment in it the battles get me hyped when its a boss leppy in short wah ah ok so its a jrpg then right ill just avoid it this game sucks hey dunkey you should check out the last story on the wii if you can find a copy no turned based combat dunkey is my favorite black excellency rpgs have really fallen out of style well traditional ones have but i blame the makers for it so many games seem identical now and only a few have aged well what about the original octopath traveller otherwise know as live a live you should try escape from tarkov love that chronotrigger jam dad if you see this please come home dunko needs to try out final fantasy tactics at least to get a better turn based jrp experience your awake your excellency you have a question your excellency can you be on my show your excellency only if you call me your excellency your excellency ok now youre allowed to be on my show peasant its especially ironic because the likes of you are the ones who asked for this game also it doesnt stop being a jrpg if you do like it dark soul and yakuza are jrpgs and they do have your garbage motion capture movie whatever the dark souls of jrpgs i disagree with your last point although at some points it can get pretty repetitive the further you get into the game and when you have finally completed everyones introductions fights get more in depth and a lot more planning a strategizing is needed to win fights if all you do is attack and heal there is a good chance you gonna lose at least for bosses so is a dunkview just a normal video but with a score at the end this is the best anime ever in dunkeys defense half of the review was criticizing the story which promised to be different than other jrpg stories basically a big takeaway from the video while taking into account what he said about game critics is that if you dont already enjoy jrpgs you probably wont like this one even though its unique from other ones the concept of multiple playable characters with interacting stories throughout the campaign shouldnt be abandoned in the future but it will have to be done better be a more interesting game for me to give it a shot so its a shit remake of saga frontier play bloons td battles i absolutely love your videos stealth your excellency this was a funny satire xd for the emperor man who says he tends to dislikes jrpgs says that he dislikes a jrpg if not for the voice acting i would assume its some indie rpg maker game yall ever played any dragon quest reggie surely everyone will love octopath traveler me how about bookworm adventures deluxe review unforgiven if only dunkey threw in the you blew it from billy madison wouldve been perfect so what youre saying is youre going to buy lets go pikachu because they got rid of random encounters you niggas forget the escape button exists another great addition to the dunkly hates jrpgs saga they do have little side conversations in second chapters thats what ive found so far i feel like people are missing the point with the snail he said that random encounters suck so hes showing how its basically a long ass barrier stopping you from the rest of the game even if youre lvl 23 and fighting a lvl 1 snail you still have to wait for the thing to die i personally dont mind random encounters but they have to actually give me something like xp or an item something so thats its actually worth my time dammit raggy come on you can do better than this why would you play a game that is based on a genre you dont like and then get disappointed views whenever i want to buy a game i just wait for a dunkey review there goes the slither of hope i was giving this game so i can play it ya know persona 5 completely innovated turn based combat for a reason yet no recent rpg has followed suit if you can easily make turn based combat more responsive intense and fun why not do it literally the only thing in this game that even looked remotely interesting to me was the cool background style art with the pixel art thats it its another overly generic fantasy jrpg with repetitive combat and from what i cant tell in the video shite voice acting nintendo still in the back of the court i see its nice to see all the salty comments for a change i enjoy it when dunkey rustles some jimmies hahaha i was just saying this the other day i played this game called saga frontier on the ps1 and its about the same lol game is awful in english my dude i share his dislike for random encounters and turn based combat the difference is i really want to like them i just dont really with ya on ophelia even bad in japanese just the worst primrose wasnt toooo generic though also love therion before you completely disregard this game at least try the 3 hour demo dang i thought it looked pretty good too i shouldve known your dunkalency jason make a realm royale video yes child yes i like you attitude lets show them a thing or three this review is like a vegans review of outback steakhouse just remember guys dunkey doesnt usually like turnstyle rpgs i think that dunkey is actually armond white fuck these haters great vid dunkey dont let the weebs wear you down dunk do the advanced gungeons and draguns dlc update remember this game is a combination of everything dunkey hates anime turned based combat and random encounters dont get your panties in a twist people note that there are exceptions to what i said persona 5 undertale paper mario at this time 96k butthurt jrpg fans dunkey so many people seem upset by this video that i think you should make a 100 serious totally not sarcastic from the bottom of your heart apology video no appreciation for the positives go read a book if you want good story sad i played an dd game with random encounters and it was boring annoying and lazy 90 of the campaigns fights where random encounters and im sick of it but i will make an exception for pokemon and undertale to sum up the video for you game is just generic as generic can be but the story stinks and the voice acting is kinda cringey and battles are monotonous god dunkey you have horrible taste so how did this boring dude get yt big what was that game he showed at the beginning where youre a walking cloth surrounded by rocks in a desert dunkey i used to love your videos but honestly the lack of bookworm adventures deluxe is unforgivable i love the game maybe its nostalgia but you literally just shat on it instead of reviewing it pokmon meets inception is one of the best descriptions of persona 5 ive ever heard where is the octopus you excellency hmmm your excellency was this a lie your excellency so i straight up just dont get you in subscription feed at all octodunk finally someone who doesnt just gush over every aspect of this game like its the spiritual successor to ff6 the individual stories are so bland that i just skip all the dialogue and mute the shit voice acting the fact that the game tells you where the next chapter for each character is just throws everything that made older final fantasies great out the window mystery adventure discovery you know that there are only 8 playable characters you know where each of those characters are you know they all have a simple introduction in order to recruit them whats the damn point the only thing i disagree with is that the combat is actually really good imo but ive always loved turnbased combat while you can end up fighting the same thing over and over i still find it enjoyable enough to figure out the optimal way to defeat them or kill them all without taking damage and finding out all of their weaknesses whether its enough for me to finally finish the game il you shouldnt review turn base games lol you always hate them its sad that i love this game to death and theres no actual way to defend this video this game was meant to modernize what people used to love those old final fantasy games improving the graphics so its more visually appealing and expanding the gameplay from final fantasy 6 im a sucker for these kinds of games however dunkey before has clearly stated he is not a fan whatsoever when stating his listings on what rpgs he likes its generally paper mario and undertale games that are quirky and dont try to take themselves too seriously and also are innovative i personally wish octopath traveler wouldnt have been the example of why jrpgs are garbage in the modern area and more something like i am setsuna or the modern fire emblem games everyone has one to their own though your excellency this dude is my spirit animal finally found someone who hates random encounters and turn based combat just as much as i do the games selling point is that you recruit and travel with 8 people fucking breath of fire did that in the 90s and the stories in bof were much more interesting and actually held plot continuity talk about regression note i am not saying it was the first game to include 8 playable characters in a jrpg but it was a prominent example when a video is uploaded youre excellency alright dunkey i have abandoned tv for a while now due too its overly dramatic bs but i have finally seen that come over into youtube despite being relatively ignorant and i just want to say thank you man for real i realize the temptation but you rise above never stop like the best class armor smith make a vid of kingdom come tones of funny charge bugs xd octomom your excellency looks really nice though thats it i gotta say it bumbler interactive is overhyped dammit dunkey what kinda shirt costs 27 dollars still gonna buy it tho cause its a masta piece i think a new meme is born your excellency i only had to play the demo to know this game sucked the characters were fine i know they fell into classic role playing categories but their stories just sucked and the fights were monotonous im with ya on this dunkney it sucked i knew this game was gonna suck from the day the trailer came out called it the bit with the snail is a little misleading as long as you hit the bad guys weakness most low level encounters are done by turn 3 at the worse most often at turn 1 though everything else he said is valid ive not gotten past all the intro chapters yet but im disappointment your party outside the current main character is not actually acknowledged thus far i was also let down that you cant turn off or greatly reduce random encounters like in bravely default which is odd becasue the game borrows a lot from bd and improves on it while at the same time taking a step back you can only stack a single action instead of say attack summon heal all in one go still despite its flaws i personally like the game but i can see how dunkey and other people could get sick of it quick i keep thinking this game is about an octopus when i hear of the name but then i see this and think it looks so generic and boring that i forget about it entirely then i hear about it some time later and think that its about an octopus and that sounds neat then i see the game and i forget about it then i hear about a game that sounds like its about an octopus i think the rpg genres worst enemy is the rpg community they are all seeking to satisfy their own nostalgia while completely overlooking the serious flaws with the game mechanics rpgs definitely have their place but we need more ambition like we see in undertale its def no bubsy 3d thats for sure beautiful 480p hd and mono sound the female characters voices sound dumb and lame i fuckin love turn based games bruh play the game with japanese voice youre destroying this game with english voice beyond everything why would you spend 60 on this game when you could play bookworm adventure deluxe for free edit only days later haha thats a huge shame i always trust your judgment with games you havent lead me wrong yet and i was looking forward to the saga frontierlegend of mana meets bravely default style i havent been impressed with a jrpg in a long time and it doesnt look like ill start again with this one c i mean you have stated that you dont like turn based games so i didnt expect you to like this either hey videogamedunkey have you played bravely default 3ds jrpg bud get thisyou can turn random encounters off its got a pretty good story looks great graphically and has an amazing soundtrack it may be worth a shot since you can remove your biggest gripe with jrpgs not as funny as some of your other videos you could say it was meh meh meh meh meh according to everyone else who seems pretty good this is a square enix game nintendo is only the publisher im sorry donkey butte im going to have to agree with your opinion this game is amezin probably up there wif merio paint so jrpg in a nutshell knack 3 wouldve been a better jrpg your excellency my thoughts on the matter dunkey has played persona and liked it which is a jrpg already i do find it weird hes playing jrpgs but nevertheless he doesnt completely hate them dunkey sole profession is gaming he has load of time to try out different games i dont know im somewhat in the same boat as dunkey i dont like jrpgs but occasionally for some odd reason i do check them out same reason as any gamer maybe i think this game will be different we all know that ea games and cod games are cash cows but even if we dislike them some of us do check it out regardless or pre order dont we i think whats making everyone unhappy is that dunkey videos are stylized as comedy and in short timing with honest opinions its not going to make any fans of the game featured in the video happy i dont like platforms as much as dunkey and im assuming the majority of gamers are not into indie 2d platformers as dunkey still he makes those videos and praises them a lo come on dunkey do some research before you make the jokes persona 5 isnt like pokemon pokemon is like persona 5 that smt series is been out longer youre right about this game but you know what game is really good bookworm deluxe meh i loved this game i suppose its down to your preferences jrpg fans have loved this dunky as we know does not like jrpgs hell pat i fucking hate everything boivin gushed over it im done with league of legends i love this game i dont know i kinda liked it you tried way to hard to find a reason to hate this game all ur credibility is gone this is fucking bubsy 3d all over again shes not referring to him when she says excellency shes clearly a pokemon every exellency in this comment is butthurt about this guy having an opinion exellent persona is the only turn based game worth playing its a shame how bad game that is considering how beautiful it looks oi dunkey i think you should look at no mans sky after this long time theyve changed many things change to videogamehorse prepare for backlash dunkdong youre a brave soul not praising this game still not gonna play it because im poor as fuck and i still dont have a switch so its bad shiet it looked promising so glad i found this review lol look at how many tears formed in words you got there dunk dunk still some of them are too edgy though so be careful seiken dendestu 3 did this concept so much fucking better if you want id really check it out dunk its little generic but still interesting psycho mantas psycho mantas your excellency til rpg are bs this isnt bookworm adventures deluxe dunko ya better do something soon before i even watch this video i already know nintendo fanboy is going to praise the hell out of this game eeeeh let me be honest with you dunkey you arent really good at reviewing games in my opinion i mean if you dont like jrpg games then why the hell would you play them wtf what song from the octopath traveler soundtrack is playing during the end credits of this video i must know i thought the exposition for the characters was pretty original but everthing else about them is boring to annoying yikes this backfired lmao ive enjoyed it good music interesting visuals and what not to each their own eh whats the pokemon meets inception game oh shit i didnt know they put that redheaded broken record from bleach in this game he doesnt have to like this game many bravely defaultbravely second with four characters and their whole 30 whatever job system was killer for me i cant imagine playing with 8 we have compact rpgs with sharp humor proceeds to show undertale thats some false advertisement if ive ever seen it im gonna go to the store you guys want anything welp i guess dragon quest is there to look forward to thumps down for reggae i dont want him getting royalties random encounter fuck it fire emblem is da wey excellency your that ninja what an excellent game you should play bookworm adventures deluxe its a mastapeace the enemies are cool looking 1010 i agree with this video octopath plays and feels like square had a few small rpg scripts lying around and decided to just throw them all into a single package with minimal interaction between them you could do the same with rpg maker and graphics aside end up with the same results y a b l e w i t to give the game something the art style looks really good yo mr dunk love your work you are the man i was wondering if youve ever tried the game valkyria chronicles i know youre not a huge fan or the anime stuff but i think its a killer game with the most unique game play ive ever experienced the story is fun but not super tropey like a lot of jrpgs are i think its worth a look if youre looking for something unique i agree i actually despise turn based games also olberics voice acting was perdyy terrible hahaha so bland and without passion your excellency your excellency psycho mantis i hope you know mr dunkyfunkexcellencyfunkmasta flex your sexcellency is beyond any current currency keep your currency iinvested in excellency my friend tbh this video felt kinda like a hitpiece i can understand that you might not like jrpgs or you might not enjoy turnbased combat and despise random encounters so why drop 60 on a game that advertises as being all of that this game is a typical jrpg storydriven with turn based combat but this game does that stuff and does it really well on top of having gorgeous visuals especially for a 16bit game and one of the best music scores ive ever heard in a game particularly loved the victory music and the title music the stories can be really good too huntress dancer and thief for example and while some are kinda tedious at times merchant and scholar for example they all start to pick up later on it kinda feels like dunky played through the first chapter of a few stories decided it was bad then made this video and while i can absolutely respect that dunky has a right to his opinion on jrpgs as a whole it baffles me that he would go on to then constantly drop 60 buck i dont expect this to be read but i did want to express a disappointment with this video and hopefully it can be taken as constructive criticism if it is this unfortunately is probably one of your weaker videos it was inconsistent tonally and also a bit poorly structured the video never went anywhere it didnt reach any grand conclusion it basically amounted to a top ten reasons why i dont like octopath traveler and jrpgs in general with only 3 reasons it was a low effort low reward mass produced type of video as such it failed to really convey any meaningful message if it should have been taken as a serious point of view but on the flip side of it the jokes were either rehashed or low effort i have watched many of your videos where i can disagree but you at least kept me entertained as a viewer in this video you didnt offer anything to the people who disagreed in this video none of the jokes were anything more than just at the expense of people who enjoy t youre basically skill up but without the feelswhy did i just realize this well you see the thing about rpgs is that you dont have to do all that much grinding sure it makes the boss fight easier maybe if you never use potions or think that youll never find another ether or elixer despite having 20 already and youre not even halfway through the game or maybe just play it smart but no people dont do that theyd rather grind out the next hour so theyre completely overleveled for the next two bosses even though its still the first couple chapters into the game and then complain that its boring yeah of course its boring you goofball you decided to start grinding when there was nothing else to do maybe try grinding when theres a bunch of side quests or maybe just keep playing until you lose a boss fight then grind or find a new strategy its not like theres any real consequence for a game over anyways unless you never save you and jakey are the only reason i still use youtube i want my bookworm adventures deluxe not gonna lie dunksta you nailed it this time had me rolling the whole video psychomantis youre that excellency will not tolerate this xbc2 shade fight me a lot of people in the comments need to watch dunkeys game critics video again great video dunk what is the pokemon meets time travel game he mentioned called big edit this isnt even a dunkview you spergs you know that gaming journalism has really hit the shitter when people begin taking dunkeys videos as a valid form of criticism his top ten game for the past few years has been super mario bros 2 calm down you sperging little shits seriously save your precious 30 or so minutes taken to write a scathing rebuttal to a literal memelord and use it to grind some more on this dumb jrpg you weebs dunkey do the review on chrono or pokemon or some of this old school jrpg please lol dunkeys gonna be singing a different tune if he gets to later chapters also protips for new players annoyed by the grind 1 put in low level characters with much higher level characters to do some ridiculous power leveling had a dude gain 20 levels in 8 or so fights its absurd 2 turn on cyruss random encounter evasion skill it literally drops the random encounter percentage 3 fast travel to cities always 4a use breaks debuffs like sleep confusion etc to speed through fights 4b give everyone a second class so you have all weapons types and elements in your party 5 collect steal everything you even so much as walk down a hallway you should be rich cant blame him about the voice acting though i opted into the foreign language audio because they use shorter sentences and if they repeat themselves i dont notice shame i really enjoy how it looks i thought that there would be bookworm adventure deluxe but no you disappointed again i actually like the turn based games t gonna have to disagree with you on this one dunk better luck next time this was my first time playing a jrpg game i enjoyed the visuals and sounds the most and didnt mind the combat style or the cringe dialogue once you set them on japanese language it becomes bearable btw but the frequency of the random encounters was too much it threw me off this game wait waityou write about a majestic marmot in your description yet you do not show such a fine fine creature admit that youre just being a tease compensate dem mechanics with dem post effects your excellency ifen you picketh the hunter theren will beith a mosten strange language spoketh you should do an updated review on the no mans sky next update the game has changed for the better since its awful launch its obvious dunk man doesnt like turn based rpgs if nothing rlse coz his said it a few times but as someone who does enjoy them i was looking at this game going is this meant to be an ad or a criticism coz dam im almost sold so if you hate jrpgs why are you reviewing it doesnt make much sense now does it go back to reviewing your dude bro shooters and 4 hour long platformers fyi ive never heard of you people where bashing you on gamefaqs thought id see and man they are right you sound bitter hey coward when you gonna play superstar saga buddy boy for what its worth the dialogue and voice acting are a million times better if you pick japanese i dunno why they got the worst voice actors of all time for the english version of the game but i think it makes a huge difference in the level of enjoyment you can get out of the game when your character doesnt sound like a complete bozo doofus i guess dunkey just doesnt have a knack for jrpgs i am so sorry for this he is biased against games like this and has admitted it most critics and players love the game i mean it looks cool i really want to meet video game donkey its my life goal to play a game and actually have donkey rate my play rpgs are at their worst when dragged to the barebones with no refinement as a side note graphics dont matter much in that regard as a whole i dont enjoy them much to start with something like a fighting or a puzzle game reduced to simple form would still be relatively funner because you have to actively think about what youre doing and therefore get involved as it should be in any game as an example unworthy is a dark souls style game bear with me and the meme connotations here its 2d metroidvania sidescroller and no colors but shades of white gray and black but its still pretty damn fun to play because i actively have to dodge and swing a sword to hear that sweet gnashing of flesh by steel but rpgs to me are just tap a select one of these 4 to 14 options tap a again wait 3 to 8 seconds for the animation to play out let the enemy do their thing too get the names of the smoking hot female characters so you can look up hentai of them b was that music from the last 4 seconds actually octoparh music cuz that was kinda hot i love this review i sooo agree that the characters are bland af but ppl love jumping on the hype i love grinding no homo ooh that likedislike bar you know the video is good if someone got really fucking upset about it trash opinions from a trashorican try to not lie blatantly next time fucko your excellency intensifies your exellency would you like the spaghetti and meatballs dunkeys gotta dunk thats like rule no 2 in life so glad i picked up hollow knight this week instead your excellency please play bookworm adventure god this comment section is a joke lmao i totally agree with you dunkey im hoping knack 3 will make up for this bookworm deluxe is better no doubt about it octopath traveler officially worst game of the year octopath is a really ironic game oldschool jrpgs had to supplement poor padded gameplay due to technical limitations with incredible stories octopath seems to do the opposite with more indepth strategic turnbased combat and a story so bland that if it were any plant itd be grass you should do a review on warframe nice cherry picking but you gotta admit that design is just amazing dunkey doesnt like jrpgs no problem with that i like jrpgs but i can respect his candor instead of acting like he loves it just for the sake of pleasing everybody i follow dunkey for his honest takes if i just wanted validation on games i buy there are other videos out there d he is so honest most game review are that honest with us that why i love this channel if you listen closely you can hear the frantic mashing of the keyboard warriors their battlecry permeating and populating the airwaves they all screech unison waaaaaahhhhhh wahhh wahh wahhhhhhhh thanks for this someone needed to say it whatever floats your dunkboat you may have opened up a can of annoyance your excellency ya know ima keep real with you chief i can stand turn based combat w random encounters i dont mind it i think for the actual game itself its not all that terrible the graphics on this pixilated game are amazing however i do agree that this game is superbly stretched out an extra 36 hours just based off crappy rng spawns and the dialogue is very very sloppy there isnt anything that really grabs you into the story id have to agree with you the gameplay isnt all that great coming from someone who can stand turn combat with an anime based story line prozd is that you thanks for the opinions dunk you and i differ on jrpgs so ill probably like this game keep up the good work i like this video so much your excellency its funny how everyone loved it but since you dont like rpg stuff that much you dont like it like that video about reviews you made its full circle youre listing out everything i love lol i aint seen a dunk video this divisive since he shat all over the last of us and batman simulator you know dunko hates it when he doesnt even joke about the game while shitting on it man who doesnt like turnbased combat plays game with nothing but turnbased combat man dislikes game man blames game worst troll review ive seen in awhile now do that 50 more times i kinda wish youd show undertale instead of pokmon when mentioning random encounters to kind of acknowledge that psycho mantis your excellency this game is a love letter to classical jrpgs and dunkey doesnt like those so why is anyone surprised i dont agree with him at all that this game is a disappointment hell its all ive been playing since it came out but its ok to have differing opinions from your fans and i honestly respect the fuck out of not buckling to the popular opinion if thats not how you feel gj dunkey the real video is always found in the comments i feel the same way about random encounters i knew this game was overrated thnks dunkey the game just bored me to death to be honest the lack of character interaction didnt help and turn based combat to me is pretty boring except in pokemon the games combat was bright and you were always engaged i give this game 65 tails pinned on 10 dunkeys because from a technical stand point its good whats the song at the end hey but at least the artwork looks nice almost every jrpg is a generic cringe anime bullshit game with ps2 graphics the only few jrpgs that matter are square enix games and one or two games from namco looks good though mediocre game over hyped solely because switch like 95 of the games on it still a 2 game system botw odyssey i love you dunkey but this has to be your worst video brilliant octopath traveler is a good franchise you never even made it past the first circuit for the last 3 days i have been rewatching all your vids they never get bored and they are always fun to watch and to laugh at you are an amazing creator and you are doing good work i havent gotten to play the full game yet but i really enjoyed the demo i get that jrpgs arent for everyone since the pacing can be rather slow and youre a guy that likes quick action and reward so i get that you wouldnt enjoy this game i think ill like it though its about that griiiiiinnnd idk about you but bookworm adventures deluxe is much better than what your playing you should try it out dunkey go play wonder boy the dragons trap for switch do it do it now im the kind of person that really likes the combat style of pokmon and doesnt quite mind the style of traditional rpgs but has to be in a certain mood to play them i loved earthbound but goshdang it took a while for me to beat it huh i thought this game was a sequel to octodad you have youtubers like projared who are absolutely in love with turnbased jrpgs and then theres dunkey you mean they dont let you fast forward time or control encounter rates thats dumb especially considering theyve made games that let you do that im really sad i was really looking forward to this game because of its art style but now that i know the story is bland im extremely conflicted octodad was better i am a jrpg fan and i found the writing in this game to be unbearably generic please someone convince me otherwise because i am about to sell it if youre wondering whats so special about the majestic marmot they have a certain attack hey dunkey you should play super mario crossover 3 i remember final fantasy 9 having characters get lines of dialogue for specific cutscenes they may not be in the party for that game was on the ps1 this video kind of reminds me of when dunkey beat sky in smash i would love turn based rpgs much more if enemy levels scaled with your own and there were no random encounters love how you use an old jrpgs battle theme when talking about how good modern nonjapanese rpgs are i agree that most turn based games are pretty boring and games with random encounters take the piss ophilia the orphan i wish theyd make more games like secret of mana chrono trigger and final fantasy 6 its like developers forgot their roots idk dunker i thought it was pretty fun going in this comment section was a mistake the art style of this game is b e a u t i f u l to say the least dunby i really think you did a good number on this one guy keep it up guy proud of you i propose a challenge if yall know what i mean wink wink love how you comment on characters solo stories not interacting with eachother and show chrono trigger who had that at the end game just so characters can have it finished optionally but its done so much more right i feel like dunkey can make any game look terrible octopath seems like a good game from what ive seen didnt buy it saving up for bigger games 91k people got rwhooshd dont agree with a lot of your points but the video is still hilarious so the graphics look like this game was meant to be played on the phone sprites with cheesy adobe flash looking effects looks like shit wow i love jontron god tier content provider short but not that sweet either this comment section can sit next to the one in adam ruins everythings clip on women in video games on rgatekeeping thats a shame the art looks like it is so well done is it true the thing about character interaction that the thing i love the most in other jrpg that character interact with each other plenty of times promising review your excellency i think i may give it a shot thanks to your positive review my excellency thanks for the great content his excellency i shall take my leave kinky kelly i love this game but dunkey has some valid criticisms i am a weirdo and love the randomness of encounters i also love grinding this shit is hilarious but i dont think you went far enough into the game to give a complete review though this is a stark contrast to the fact supply cant keep up with demand in japan i gotta be honest i know dunkey was trashing this game the whole video but it honestly looks really fun and i kind of want this game after this video wait a minute your that excellency its for autistic people like me who love repetitive tasks doesnt look like a game for me i think review might be a bit unfair since yoju said yourself tyou dont like these games i like jrpgs but i often just find myself playing something else i vastly prefer games like final fantasy tactics or disgaea to this type though your dunkellency amen i highly agree with you i mean i love jrpgs but i will only play it if the storyline is interesting but like you just said octopath characters and interactions are so basic and readable thank you for the honest review like dunkey said you have to know the critic to properly take in information given by them what we know about dunk dislikes turnbase combat and dislikes rpgs for the most part so you cant 100 assume what he says will be true when you play the game does this make him lose all credibility no he was okay with persona 5 a turnbased rpg so its not like he throws away a game completely as soon as these factors are added in just keep in mind your critic and know that each review has some sort of truthsubstance except ign ign is a shitshow and you should never listen to them under any circumstance ever the combat with the snail isnt as it seems he seems to be at least 10 or so levels ahead of the enemy if it was on the same level he actually would have to strategize and use his brain which dunky is obviously not particularly good at doing i thought dunkey is back playing league of legends because of the picture of this video for those who are ready to dunk on dunkey for hating on this game lemme just remind you folks that dunkey doesnt like rpgs in general paper mario and persona 5 being noteworthy exceptions as biased as this review may be dont take it seriously folks the games good so enjoy it and now i await for this message to be ignored and people hate on dunkey anyway uvu nerves this comment section in the nutshell silly harmless jokes fine gonna spam the most obvious phrase from the video in comment section like a 14 yo actual content nah gonna unleash all my wrath since my japanese octopus will stop caressing my butt if i dont worship any shit anime infested obviously cheap money grab atempt thrown at me great review dunkey keep up the good work but wheres bookworm adventures deluxe review at dunkey you hate rng and random encounters hmm can you review darkest dungeon im a big fan but its full of rng and random encounters i mean you could have broke the snail if you switched weaponssomething you can do in battle with the push of one button and it would have been over almost instantly great vid always funny can you finally let jontron out of your basement i miss that guy this game looks sick i suppose a pc port is out of the question looked at the like to dislike ratio before watching the video and expected dunkey to be doing something horrible turns out its just a bunch of salty weebs dunkey ima jason too what are the odds damnits so pretty looking though hard agree on random encounters jrpgs are one of the worst genres and its entirely for that not bookworm adventures deluxe very disappointed about that lmao you have no idea what youre talking about how can you do a whole video about the problems with video game reviews and do the same shit to be fair ophilia was raised that way your disdain towards random encounters and turn based combat is bs but this game is complete garbage from day one ive wondered why people were so hype about the game its nothing special i guess switch owners are just desperate for anything to get excited for that isnt smash i like octopath enough to play it since i like these types of games but it feels very safe nearly to the point of bland like they tried to make the best generic jprg they could and compensated for the generic characters and plots by splitting it into eight independent short stories theyre still generic and simple but the titular eightstoriesatatime thing does a decent job at making the world feel more organic and less linear plus theres some serious tone mismatch beneath the surface primroses story is riduculously dark compared to say ophelia or tressas and nobody says anything or acts like its unusual even in the tiny handful of travel banter cutscenes you get plus characters act like the other stories are completely disconnected from them even when theres serious implications that they should be reacting to everyone saying he doesnt like these types of games yet shows a variety of games he likes at the beginning of the video what annoys me most about turn based combat in rpgs is that earthbound solved the lowlevel monotony years ago its not random as enemies are visible in the overworlsd low level enemies avoid you and ones you do encounter that youll definitely beat just end instantly and you get the xp i dont understand why or how this obvious improvement was ignored its a good game you know whats not a bad rpg bookworm adventures after hearing all this hype and finally seeing the game all i can say is that this game looks like mud why is everything brown love your critiques durnkey however i was very eager to hear a more indepth dunkview of octodad traveler and i can say the same regarding most games you cover i wish i could enjoy more longform content from you but at the same time i appreciate the frequency at which you release your videos i love you sincerely random commenter i completely disagree on your view on rpgs but i respect your opinion so far im loving octopath traveler and ive put a hundred hours into xenoblade 2 i dont get it ff6 make dialogue short punchy and relevant after that happened jrps decided to get as far away from that model as possible remeber when people had opinions i wanted a sense of kinsmenship between the heros not press to hear travel banter art is good music is good combat gets good later but in a game that advertises its story as its main selling point it shouldnt be so predictable why not make one good story instead of 8 bad ones that has clearly been copied and pasted go to location use path action go to small dungeon beat boss repeat for the 7 other characters reminds me of hexyz force i bought a mouse pad hopefully it gets here soon c lmao at the part of the video where dunkey reviews a turnbased jrpg what he said in his critic video actually just applied to me i enjoyed octopath a lot but when he said he hates it i just kinda went yeah that makes sense its not his thing instead of hating him for bubsy 3d darn thought this was gonna be the next bravely default interesting pretty much the same thing kotaku said about the stories being disjointed and awkward with the characters not interacting dunky please make a game recommendation video you have such a spectacular taste in games and im looking to play some good old games thumps up guyslet dunky see this plox ill take his honest opinion anyway over a bandwagon review you should play rust again its completely different yet still the same welp its pretty easy to tell how you feel about this game whatever i dont regret buying octopath traveler and i am enjoying every moment of it i dont see the point in making a video about a game of a genre you clearly despise look if you dont like the game sure just be fucking honest about it dont do shit likeoh i dunno deliberately messing up a battle just to say that the battle mechanics are bad also random encounters and grinding are here to stay just so long as rpgs continue to be made if you dont like that then rpgs arent for you my friend lmao this guy is straight up deleting comments that disagree with him pathetic so dunkey isnt a fan of turnbased combat and wasnt a fan of a game with turnbased combat impossible hey dunkey i know its old but could you do a review of knights of the old republic you have triggered a lot of people dunk you know when dunkey spergs about turnbased combat and the writing its probably a decent jrpg sees a jrpg video on dunkeys channel oh no i still dont know why everyone shits on ffx for voice acting that laughing scene is retarded with no context but if you actually played the game youd understand i dont mind random encounters and turnbased combat if theyre done properly if a game has random encounters that you can see coming and prepare for it then its not as much of a pain see every nonboss in earthbound and patches of tall grass in pokemon earthbound has a neat mechanic to which enemys in a particular area wont encounter you if you defeat that areas boss overworld random encounters however are honestly pretty bad in turnbased rpgs as most of the time they barely can be prepared for and should be suited more towards the rtsrpgs such as xenoblade chronicles turnbased combat done right can be seen in again earthbound and final fantasy vii as each action is put on a timer based on player execution and speed and rewards the player more for proper inputs by going first earthbound has another neat mechanic found in a couple other later games such as persona 5 where you can sneak up on enemies to get the first hit in mediocre turnbased combat can games like this are the reason why you should start playing book worm advantures delux first few seconds you can tell he didnt even play the game has no fucking clue what olberics plot is also nitpicked a random characters speech when theres 8 to choose from and the option to skip their cutscenes for years ive asked myself that question everyone love dunk til he shits on your favorite thing salty asses god damn it reggie wrong again youve really let things go to shit since knack 2 the game is so bad theres nothing to it its just a shitty looking cookie cutter rpg too bad the 2d characters on 3d foreground is an interesting concept well its pretty at least this is a good video your excellency the graphics tho you blew it reggie not even a score5 take this review with a grain of salt this is pretty much the kind of game dunkey would likely not enjoy even from a mechanics standpoint hes not a fan regardless of the quality of the writing art etc so hes going to be fairly harsh on it so is everyone gonna mail dunkey their favorite jrpgs to his po box now the guy does hate rpgs so dont blame him jesus christ this is awful i already hated jrpgs before but i dont think ill ever go anywhere near one after this shit historically western rpgs were better written than jrpgs dunkey also witcher 3 wasnt the first game where your choices mattered and to be quite honest the game didnt even implement that well witcher 3 was superbly written and it had a fantastic world but its definitely not a choice driven game in the same vein as baldurs gate or fallout soooo halo 5 recap regurgitation or what you should play detroit become human i still want to play it true rpgs are not meant to have player characters voiced the only thing this video did was make me want to make out with cristina vee while she says stops to take a breath every few seconds and calls me your excellency octopath is good but bookworm adventures deluxe has way better story and the combat system is better agree to disagree this game is really good yeah random encounters are awful i dont mind turn based combat though persona does it well hahaha holy shit the jrpg fans are still alive it seems i thought they went extinct in 2015 octo is awesome and xenoblade 2 is amazing great video your excellencyi mean dunkey suikoden tierkreis was a great jrpg on ds i miss playing it i dont get why he would play a turn based jrpg with random encounters if he doesnt like both of those things to begin with id rather play a jrpg with gameplay that i enjoy even if it has some awkward dialog than a lot of the other games dunky showcased like uncharted style movie games that minimize gameplay for guided storytelling or western rpgs with basic hack and slash mechanics witcher 3 has good storytelling the combat though xenoblade chronicles 2 has great and extremely deep combat mechanics for instance and though the voice acting and some other anime tropes may not be the best the overarching story is quite good i understand that dunky isnt a fan of jrpgs though i was asking myself if i wanted to click on the video since i knew it was going to be dunkey shitting on a game i like still watched it pretty funny video jrpgs and strategic turnbased combat isnt for everyone ive been having a blast with the game personally i enjoy that the story isnt one grand telling but a cast of characters traveling together the freedom in starting and pausing story chapters class changing the break system and side stories is something that hits it good with me but that said its something i personally enjoy and i dont expect others to like it because of it and of course i know jrpgs are far out of dunkeys likes to make things short what im trying to say is try out bookworm deluxe ive herd its a hidden gem i feel like dunkey is biased but when he talks about a game that i hated that cost 60 dollars yes ill watch him i cant wait to jump off my majestic steed and meet some of you in the battlefield in octopath traveler wow and i was about to buy this game thanks for saving my money dunkey paper mario the thousand year door is the greatest rpg the day dunkey reviews bookworm deluxe will be the day when half life 3 gets announced song at the end xenoblade 2 at the bottom thats why i take your opinions lightly dude still like your content a lot of nostalgic and desperate fanboys didnt like this lul i know it seems nitpicky but if the characters are the main focus of the game why arent there more detailed sprites of them for the combat sections saved me so much time and money thanks are all turn based rpg considered jrpg i bet if it would be called octoknack traveller then there wouldnt be a single complaint about this game would there dont mean to sound like a narc but theres a lot of points here that can be addressed dont like lots of random encounters just equip the skill that severely reduces them with it on youll fight 3 maybe 4 times in a standard dungeon before a boss dont like the isolated storytelling play beyond the first chapter to unlock a bunch of great dialogue between the party members inbetween each cutscene im still reeling over primrose giving dancing lessons to cyrus i totally agree with the criticism of the beginning though after completing your first chapter 1 segment itd be nice if the game treated things a little bit quicker so that you arent getting the same types of tutorials thrown in your face 7 extra times that said i think the biggest fault the game has is how repetitive the exploration dungeons become each place is essentially just a reskin of the same design a clear main path with a couple hidden branching deadends with chests at the end of them most chapt its not the developers fault this game sucks theyre all using usb steering wheels to program this that commnet story was litte funny you have my like because this is funny specially the excellency part lol buuuuuut i love the game although i know if you dont like turn based jrpgs dont even look at it videogamedunkey who if you had to choosenames only plz who was your favorite charaterstory you know what is a good game bookworm adventures i couldnt get past the demo yet another review i agree with ps thanks for introducing me to fury i usually agree with dunkey on most of his criticisms and reviews on games whether they be good or bad reviews however i dont really agree with dunkey in this video it was more criticism of classic rpg elements than a criticism of octopath traveler itself but with a heavy insinuation that those classic rpg elements is what makes octopath a bad game its dishonest in the least look i get that dunkey doesnt like turnbased combat or random encounters but you cant just use those to criticize one particular game and deem the game shit because of that disappointed in you dunkey but i still like you it looks like mobile game thats trying to copy an ps1 era 2d jrpg game haaaa i think that enemy got the point that thumbnail is dope af tho some jrpg fan should do a video to prove or demostrate that turn based combat is just a excuse used by people who just dont like this way of gaming and if it cant be demostrated the entire genre should be reformulated there are so many people that actually acomplish about it maybe they are right i think me and over 8k people were honestly dissapointed this showed so much potential like i wait weeks for another dunkey video and yet we still have no bookworm adventures reggie please shame because the art is really beautiful your voice is annoying does this game involve octopi i heard amazing thing about this game well not the game itself just the soundtrack the writing in final fantasy x was fantastic bro i dig this game lol let me preface this by saying i love anime turn based combat and jrpgs in general dunkey seems to have struck a nerve by criticizing something that obviously appeals to his core demographic people who like video games it wouldnt be too far fetched to say that people who like video games also have a tendency to like anime and jrpgs which really do feel like a playable anime that being said if you watch a video on dunkey expecting him to laud a turn based jrpg which he has explicitly mentioned that he hates youre going to be sorely disappointed if you watch his game critics opinion youll see that he says a critics power lies in the consistency of his opinion and every review should feel like an extension of the last one if you dont think he 100 sticks to that philosophy rewatch that video and rewatch this one if youre going to suddenly dislike dunkey because he criticized a game you like its the equivalent of being the butt end of the joke that dunk i respectfully disagree with the random encounter thing well atleast in some games the game looks very pretty but the positives stop there detroit or ill have to call my mom yeah but i still like it though you should look at it like 8 separate mini stories and not some grand telling youre not even required to obtain every character heck you can just get one and beat the game so they just wanted to keep it nice and compact their each characters own purpose i give this video an ea out of knack 2 this video was honestly bullshit for one you reviewed the game as a guy with personal bias against rpgs and with the story you actually took the scene that reveals olberic being a knight out of context besides you didnt even play much and one bit of footage shows you clearly sucking at this game rather than it being a chore you know youre a hack right octopath traveler while has its problems is a great game we get it you dont like rpgs youre a adhd battle royale multiplayer playing idiot edit after further research oh so youre one of those people now it is all making sense youre much worse than i thought lol people disliking the video because dunkey didnt shower the game with praise yikes damn its like dunkey shit in a bunch of nintendroids cheerios its beautiful though why so short hm i got shining resonance refrain instead due to it being a bit cheaper i was planning to buy octopath due it 8 stories and how it reminded me of a classic famicon game call livealive that game is very special to me but from what dunkey said i kinda had a feeling the game may not have its shining moment i maybe wait when the price lower down to take a real attempt one day thrown into a pit of spice and shot with a bazooka octorock travellers excellency edition so dunkey dislikes this game but does he even knows the makers of this game did poored their heart and soul into it its ok to have an rpg with some flaws nobody is perfect like dunkey is what do think of srpgs your exceplease stop this dialogue is excellent gaia online finally made a game i dont understand why you havent done a video on the new donkey get ready for hundreds of angry comments came out on my birthdaywhat a shitty gift the fanboy tears in the comments are saltier than the red sea divinity original sin 2 its weird how i pretty much agree with everything in the video yet still really enjoy playing it maybe its cuz i played until the game picked up but idk for sure this is discount final fantasy 6 final fantasy 55 another fool who played xenoblade chronicles 2 in english when will they learnim looking at you your excellency yep better play battle chasers nightwar instead i have a hard time agreeing with this review i understand judging a game on its gameplay giving you instant gratification in the vein of how mario or an fps gives you for destroying an enemy but this style isnt for everybody metroid prime and zelda are examples of games where the puzzles and combat can seem monotonous at first glance but ask almost anybody who has beaten them and theyll tell you its not a major issue they dont give instant fun but shooting at an outofbounds tower and opening a new route towards a goal by implementing aspects of both a monotonous combat and puzzle system that also incorporates backtracking is an amazing feeling that cannot be compared to mario jumping on a goomba and you feeling good about it it really is apples and oranges dunkey as cliche as that is to say some peoplelike melove games for being instantly fun because thats how we find value in them and some people prefer a slower pace with an emphasis on strategy as an ex lol he should try playing bravely default hed probably just kill himself so you like the game this games great screw you get heartburn the problem is this isnt bookworm deluxe i played the demo and thought this is supposed to be good and ign gave it a 9310 wow in octopath you play as octodad if i ever become a galactic emperor i want to be referred to as his excellency okay guys chill its dunkey its his impression of the game thats how he feel when he played the game people need to chill god damn this game would have been way better if the title didnt just bait people into thinking they get to play as an octopus 010 all valid criticism especially the moans your excellency part still live this game because im a nostalgia whore the level of butthurt weebs who are crying in the comments as if dunkey shat on their favorite anime came here for the seething weebs seems to me you dislike a lot of aspects about the jrpg genre in general the game is really good but it comes down to wether you enjoy jrpgs or not persona 5 combat mechanics are a lot worse than the ones in this game so you cant say you like that but dislike this xd well the video only told me you never experienced trails in the sky which completely outshadows modern jrpgs dunky spoilers are great why tf is this not bookworm deluxe i wish i was that excellent the graphics are interesting but it does look dry as hell its weird i really liked the small amount of the game ive played and i still plan on playing it but i kind of agree with alot of his criticisms of the genre i tend to think there is something subtle to be gained from the jrpg formula but i cant really put it into words the story of these things is rarely all that good im not saying dunkey didnt gloss over things but those were obviously things that just didnt do anything for him i dunno i get it if anything i just wonder why i like it because i tend to not like alot of things about this type of game its weird shrug as funny as this is do feel like you picked it up just to moan about it like we all know you dislike jrpgs and turn based combat so you bought the definition of it lmaoo hey guys can you give me the names of the games in the intro i know witcher 3 undertale xenoblade chronicles 2 what are the others lmao id like to see this grumpus review gladius on ps2 idk why people are acting like dunkey cant have an opinion i dont think the game is half as bad as he makes it out to be but just because his opinion doesnt agree with yours doesnt mean he is invalid and neither does it invalidate yours boohoo he doesnt like a game you like and chances are you probably dont like a game he likes also and if you guys didnt notice this video isnt a dunkview its pure opinion how can anyone like this game i mean it looks cool but other than that it sucks dinkle how dare you stating your own opinion in not a dunk review witcher 3 good octopath traveler bad and fuck ea praise geraldo why would you even review a game that isnt bookworm deluxe i bought this game yesterday on the eshop rip i think you just dont like traditional turn based games because you made this game seem worse than it actually is here we go again dunky pretending to be reviewer throwing out subjective terms accompanied with 0 objective points so he hates turn based combat and random encounters thats okay but then why the hell are you playing a game with a mian focus on turn based combat and random encounters i agree with some of your criticism but not all of it it is very odd whenever something happens to whoevers main story is being run and none of the other characters intervene it doesnt seem very plausible but grinding isnt necessary at all until chapter 3 stuff i equiped cyruss skill that lowers encounter rates and never took it off and have finished all the characters up to chapter 2 without any difficulty now chapter 3 is a different story as everyone is only in the earlier 30s and your recommended to be 45 but its still an rpg and some grinding is not unheard of to make it sound like you have to for every boss is a huge exaggeration or just a lack of skill brute forcing them rather than using strategy ill give this game 2 excellencies out of 10 what you rate it your excellency if dunkey doesnt like the game then he doesnt like it he highlighted the negatives so that we would see why he didnt like the game if this was a review then i would understand the hate because this video is one sided but its not a review so he can just show us whatever he wants he also cherry picked the dialogue to support his points but most of all because its funny so you guys who are mad that he criticized this game really need to play knack 2 the mastapiece babyy dunkypath traveler why does he sound like jayden from heavy rain lmao i dont think dunk is very far in this game also there is no grinding at least i could just go from a place to another but yeah its not perfect by any means babies first saga game if you dont like jrpgs dont review one and shittalk it thats idiocy im not surprised by your opinion of the game you are known for not liking turn based games or jrpgs however you are doing an amazing job of highlighting things you dont like for example you mention the level 1 snail and how long it takes to beat it the game explains that finding enemy weaknesses is the point of combat the snail is shown to have a weakness to daggers which means you have used a dagger on that snail and know the weakness warrior guy doesnt have a dagger so you would have had to change your party makeup to only have olberic using weapons that dont exploit any weakness and therefore is not rewarding to a player for exploring enemies long story short you intentionally showcased things you dont like even if it meant manipulating a party to get a shallow point across i feel bad for people who look at this video and think that this is what the game is this video is just i dont like jrpgs the dunkey video also i dont like jrpgs either m i get why people wouldnt like this game jrpgs arent for everyone i never played the demo and honestly never thought i would ever get the game but i was gifted a download code from a very close friend and have been playing ever since and absolutely love it for the music and style also sure you have to grind a lot but thats how these kinds of games work im getting dehydrated from all this salt in the comments parasite eve 12 solved quite a few of those issues to be fair grinding is probably the most uninteresting boring and unenjoyable part of any video game no one likes having to do the exact same thing over and over and over and over just to get one result one reason i had trouble getting into rpgs was the grinding it bores the hell out of me my ability to beat a really tough opponent should not be solely dependent on how many ratatas i beat the shit out of even in dark souls iii where grinding can improve your chances of winning the most important factor in the fight is the players competence i suck at dark souls not because i havent beat up a million hollows but because im genuinely bad at the game thats a totally fair way for me to lose but when i make all the right moves in a game and lose simply because my character is level 69 and not 70 is that really good gameplay thank you octo souls guys be fair i happen to like jrpgs myself as well as octopath traveler but some of what dunkey said is actually pretty true although i disagree on some points like i happen to enjoy turn based combat the story is kind of disjointed in the beginning with the lack of contact between the 8 travelers on the journey with you plus every time ophilia said your excellency i wanted to shoot myself that should be turned into a drinking game k but why would i take an opinion on some one who hates most rpgs this game is much better once you set the dialogue to japanese if only because the voices in the dub are annoying as shit this game really makes you f e e l like your excellency theres an audience for turn base rpgs but its definitely not my cup of tea i prefer action rpgs such as dragons dogma and such how much out of 5 how much out of five just play divinity original sin 2 hundreds of times better i really dont like this 25d but also terraria looking retro but with high res textures aswell art style its a fucking mess we gotta say tho it looks totally awesome this game seems so generic honestly its like a less interesting final fantasy 6 it is unique with the graphics style thats about it they couldnt even think of a better name than octopath traveler i thought that was just the project name but i guess they couldnt come up with anything better we get it that you dont like jrpgs but going as far as benching all the characters but one and enter in a battle as a level 21 pretending to be fighting a level 1 monster the area he is in has a level recommendation of 11 and use normal attacks to defeat the enemy also without breaking its defense which is a core mechanic that speeds up battles significantly just to show that this game is bad from your point of view is pretty dumb i mean you literally have the first weakness of the monster unlocked in front of you which is daggers and youre fighting him with a sword so this is a 93 right cannot tell whether he is ripping on the game for comedy or to fit in with whats newor for comedy also random encounters dunkey that was the only way to level up in rpgs at the time dunkey your view on the pokemon games just cuz this aint a dunkview doesnt mean its not effectively a review its a good game by jrpg standards and dunkeys said time and time again he hates the genre so why would he bother playing this if not to stir the pot i love dunkey dont get me wrong about that i just think he should stick to shit he knows about whats in your pants your excellency name of game at 14 thank god its not better then bookworm adventure but but your excellency its knack 2 babyyy i like dunkey but his recent videos have lost something huge jrpg fan here and yeah the game is very mediocre well said dunk dont let anyone tell you youre unqualified to judge the genre this is so sad can i get a your excellency in the chat whats the music at the end arts really cool but yah i hate random encounters too this looks like an incredibly boring game that probably takes 200 hours to complete it looks nice at least just go back to your mario games then i played the demo i thought the battle theme was good and the graphics interesting wouldnt buy it though seemed boring i agree with almost everything you said in this video but i disagree with what you said about random encounters i believe theres a time and a place for them to be used to actually enhance game play and make it more fun and memorable i do however agree that when its poorly executed it makes a potentially interesting game terrible i think the same can be said for tons of other mechanics if you guys want to try a quirky turnbased game with a challenge and interested dialogue try out dead in vinland d 3 so basically bad english dubs you dont like jrpg seems not very related to this game specifically lol played the demo last year and knew it was some bullshit this video pretty much sums why i love dunky never afraid to express his own opinions well said this game is shit but shittendo fanboys eat that shit up jesus i didnt know salt was flammable but this comment section proves otherwise everyone whos getting mad about circlejerks or dunk not giving this game a fair chance should relax the jrpg genre is becoming a niche so dunk hating on it isnt going to affect who plays the game in any way the people who love it will buy it and play it the people who dont will not its not as if dunkeys review is the be all end all decider on whether the game is worth playing or not or as if someone was on the verge of buying it but dunkey convinced them not to so calm down it warms the cockles of my heart to see such hatred visited upon such a shitfest of a worthless garbage game well perhaps thats a bit over the topbut sweet merciful crap this game makes me angry if i could get some kind of pure unadulterated super saiyan style blender throw every character in the game all eight of them and blend them into some kind of seriously fragmented 8personality individualthen i would and itd save me about5 fucking hours of my time both in gameplay and in pure regret eat my dick octopath traveler and then give it back cause im wayyy above your level to even bother with giving you the pleasure of sucking my majestic footlong hoohooohooo heavens that felt good all the most hideously annoying weeaboos i know literally have been sucking this games microdick for weeks dunko bro you just nuked the weebs good on ya also you are using your taste to talk shit about turnbased games dude i can tell you octopaths combat is deeper than most of the shitty games nowadays this video is a mess tbh i dont agree with most of what dunkey said but thats the beauty of the dunk hes consistent it doesnt feel like hes forcing himself to like this game i like the thief the most because you can just walk up to someone and steal their shit and walk away like nothing happened is reggie to blame for every bad nintendo game xd you know i cant put my finger on it but i dont think dunkey likes jrpgs only one excellency supa mario brothas octopath traveler remastered dream drop distance deluxe knuckles including funky kong edition and with dante from the devil may cry series really makes you feel like youre batman could we get a video on to the moon personaly i like turn based combat however yes it has to be balanced most of the time you can in some shape or form scan your enemies to find out what they are weak to and use that against them however in some games you have to just keep beating them until they finaly die what im trying to say is that if you have turn based combat there has to be room for strategizing having to just click attack over and over again in every fight is just boring but if you can for example use magic and find out that for example a fire spell will instakill specific enemies you can strategize like ok so 2 of the enemies can be killed by a normal attack while the 2 other enemies can be killed with fire so i have my fighters beat up the 2 first enemies and my mages beat the two others its very simple but if you have that as a core you can build on that as the characters get stronger and unlock different skills your excellency thats why you must stop playing with english dubshit game name at 16 17 seconds where is bookworm adventures deluxe this is what i subbed for did you know that gamespot is subscribed to dunky did dunkey actually play persona 5 i always seem how praise the game but how come he didnt do a video for it glad i skipped this game not my cup of tea at all yo dunkey if youd like to play a great rpg then divinity original sin 2 is my recommendation i like this video his critiques are very valid i hate jrpgs but still try out ones people say are good because some are really good final fantasy vi earthbound persona etc etc i hate the combat in their games but characters and stories are why i still play them people said this game was an exception turned out it wasnt its not his fault hes not contracted to only posting videos on things he likes or post opinions that line up with everyone elses thatd make reviews and the industry as a whole boring nailed it i had all these same issues with it but couldnt quite put it into words your excellency metal gear foxdie lol i was going to waste money on this thanks dunk clicked on this thinking it was bookworm adventures deluxe i love jrpgs but the random encounter part is so damn true guess you have to play garfield kart now my blade is unbending this video basically sums up how i feel about modern jrpgs in general theyve been pretty much the same shit for the last almost 30 years i could see enjoying this if youre a teenager who hasnt played much of the genre but i had my fill of repetitive turnbased bullshit way back on the snes and ps1 that exellency spaming for some reason i wanna experience it myself maybe next time actually tell the truth about the games you review 1 you know that snail is not lvl 1 thats its armor 2 you dont explain that you can break its armor to kill it alot faster main mecanic of the combat system just play saga frontier instead i knew hed hate it i disagree with you but i appreciate your opinion dunkey i personally found the game very fun and the stories interesting but im a big fan of jrpgs why do you act like turn based and random encounters are a bad things entirely there are people who actually enjoy this in games yes people actually enjoy playing rpgs not just for the story i also think octopath is generic as hell but saying turn based is only good when the story is good just tells me that you personally dont like turn based gameplay and use the storystylecharacters to make up for it which doesnt sounds good at all to me if you dont like the genre why even play the games you were still in an early level and i never grind i just fight all the enemies on my way to the destination it gets better as you go if its not fun why bother if its not fun why bother what is the game clipped before inside anyone who was even remotely interested in this game should check out other reviews as well as the demo this video is misleading at best and inaccurate at worst several game mechanics were completely ignored as always its best to form your own opinion than to blindly listen to a game critic on the internet you might miss out on a real gem if you like these kinds of games your excellency is a good franchise its really all about the graphics yeah i played the demo and the two characters i could play felt very bland this game is the new undertale the toxic community that has been armed around is huge they first announced it as an adventure entirely your own which i took as complete character creation and massive branching paths sort of like a tabletop roleplaying game jrpgs seem to have an intense fear of custom characters its like octopath traveler decided to forsake all the advances and innovations jrpgs took in the last 10 years in favor of the antiquated design and story telling elements that made oldschool jrpgs annoying i gotta disagree dunkey im not even 10 hours in and im in love with the game its a nice breath of fresh air in this battle royal driven society we find ourselves in so in other words its a jrpg this video makes me feel like your excellency you know dunkey doesnt like a game when the title of the video is the games actual name not a game for everyone for sure lol at people latching onto the your excellency joke because it was the only funny part of the video youre so funny dunkeyplease dont become a game reviewer ive never played this game and wouldnt want too honestly im not just an angry fanboy can square just make a good ff game again and make jrpgs awesome like they used to please play the game in japanese use enemy weaknesses to knock shields down then go all out combat is very strategic i love it good thing the dunkey defence squad is out in full force today wouldnt want any apposing opinions in this comment section psycho mantis your excellency dunkey has been uploading more often than usual did he sign a year long lease for an expensive apartment again i can binge watch dunkey for 75 weeks wow a lot of dislikes i think i played this game back when it was called dragon warrior 4 am i the only one who heard pit of spice honestly spikes will kill you pretty fast but an overwhelming amount of exotic scents will torture me much longer random encounters can be made more bearable in a ton of ways which most developers seem to ignore earthbound a game from 1994 had a system where if you out leveled an enemy enough you would instantly win a battle against them is that like a majoritys opinion on turn based games i absolutly love them and have been hating newer games because you practically never see turn based combat in games anymore and as far as story goes since no one is doing cliche stories anymore everyone seems to be doing the exact same story with all the new games now im dissapionted that the characters dont interact story the whole reason people play jrpgs boring visuals lame i like the anime cover art though music i dont know gameplay boring turnbased combat i can understand where hes coming from and he makes a few sound points but i think part of the joy of playing this kind of game and story is being able to enjoy that old fashioned aesthetic my main concern is the depth of strategy in a turn based combat game if it can keep me coming back with an interesting combat system id be easily addicted didnt know it was random battles that tilted me not gonna play so tired of those if chrono trigger could do mostly battles that your character can see on the map why cant any other im seeing some people claim that dunkey is deleting comments can anyone find proof of this i dont get it bookworm adventures deluxe was great why does everyone hate it 86kg of salt is bad for you this gonna be gud grabs popcorn nintenbabies on suicide watch because someone doesnt like one of their weeb exclusives this game is more fun then odyssey yet you go to that review he says its a masterpiece you kidding that one of the most medicore games ive seen this guy has a huge bias and you should take this review with a grain of salt but dunkey popular and funny so people will take this video as a legitimate review of this game for what he played seems like a whole 2 minutes coming in with a huge bias poorly made no originality very dry sense of humor and unethical i rate this video 98 out of 10 this game is like when a restaurant opens in 2018 in the hip part of town and it has edison lightbulbs reclaimed wood man bun waiters 12 cocktails and 32 pork belly plates that are like 6 oz of food its all well polished objectively speaking but its all so overdone and fucking boring and not worth the cost of entry ah the thrill of the fight i tried the demo and neglected to buy the game because of random encounters and the turnbased battle system i despise those two things the only things i like about this game are the graphics and the music not really a fair review the graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing i do agree with the voice acting being garbage turn on the japanese voices and play on octopath octodad wow dunkey doesnt like an rpg what a surprise whats the name of the music at the end for ages donkey fans argued whether a review without dunkview in the title is ironic or not was the arkham city review sarcastic does your excellency really hate octopath traveler alas we may never know but he probably does your excellency youre that ninja metal gear psycho mantis whats funny is that this game is 60 and it aint even fully voiced like divinity original sin 2 and that game wasnt even 60 at launch ummm videogamedunkey i didnt dunkview in parentheses so i dont believe that this is the true videogamedunkey i have a feeling dunkey hates fire emblem please your excellencyuncleeeeeeeee im loving this game right now but this video is pretty spot on p shit review said things that are blatantly untrue lied about the combat over exaggerated and only bashed the genre while saying nothing of any importance about the game also deleting comments that call you out on this classy yeah not going to trust anything dunky says about jrpgs from now on not the biggest fan of turnbased combat either like ive been playing 200 hours of divinity original sin 2 since summer sale and in some encounter you can make your move with 1 character and then basically go and make food while the 10 enemies do their stuff until you can attack with the rest of your party one particular encounter had the enemies taunt and charm all my units and it was straight up just me watching everyone doing random stuff for 5 minutes without me getting to do anything myself so you dont like it fine the game is still amazing for the most of us its not our mistake if you have a shitty taste bro you wouldnt know a good rpg battle system if it hit you in the face bro i find youre review an embarrasment to anyone who knows there rpgs this game is set off the gameplay of the saga frontier from ps1 erea days this review is shit and i am going to dislike it not because you attack rpgs in the manner that you do but just that this is youre opinion and shit opinion at that if you dont like rpgs then go review some dumb call of duty game instead of blathering on about turnbased combat and grinding if you cant handle these types of games then dont comment on them in youre own words dude you blew it videogamedunkey the demo was fun and i was gonna buy the game but after ur input ill put more thought into wether i should buy it or not reviewing a game within a genre that you dont like oof here come the sheeple from both sides jrpg fans and dunkeys fanbase will you play the upgraded no mans sky do a review on prison neopets seems like you have to be big fans of the typical jrpg style to enjoy this game which is a shame because this game interested me but im not a fan of those typical jrpgs anymore what is the game he talks about when he says pokmon meets inception isnt this just a dunkview why not slap a score on there boom done take a shot everytime your excellency is said my brothers skin us blue haha not for those with goldfish level attention spans understanding imo that turnbased combat resulted from the limitations of the system it was inevitable that wed move beyond them as a mechanism for simulating groups battling one another i like this game but god damn do the fights take forever even when you use their weaknesses like egoraptor says waiting isnt hard it creates the illusion of difficulty because it take up your time i agree with everything he said but i still like it p still gonna play it bc im a sucker for jrpgs and turn based combat i rushed through almost the entire demo in 2 hours minus the side quests so you wrong about that grind thing looks like a terrible localization more than anything else it did well in japan i think i dont think he likes it weak ass video if you wanna shit on jrpg mechanics at least make it believable not taking your party not using any skill not using bp simply attacking an enemy with no boosting i expected better from you willful misrepresentation is not entertaining gorgeous visuals tho dunk if you dont like anime rpgs why did you review this game this was great video to point out how enconters are placed and offer great variety in very enjoiable combat in paper mario64 and tyd in my opinion an overwatch player trying to give his opinion on a videogame inhales hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaah oh no no no no no no hahsuadhauhahahahaha my opinion octopath uncharted 4 play a real game like earthworm jim deluxe archbishop josef youre that excellency back in the good old days when you had to farm liquid metal slimes for 3 hours straight in dragon quest 8 to fight dhoulmagus no one complained now all everyone wants is to finish the game as quickly as they can if you dont want to farm then dont play jrpgs but if thats your opinion i respect it i know this isnt dunkview but its a bit unfair to judge jrpg elements when you dont like turn based rpgs this is probably the only video i will dislike from you just in case all you dunkey dickriders still dont understand why people are upset with this video just read all the comments from people whos actually been convinced to pass on this game due to his misinformation yeah hes actually doing damage thanks to his popularity and having a huge following hopefully hell go back to make actually funny videos again after this pathetic clickbaitcash in still better than the edgy trailer of titans imma side with dunkey random encs and turnbased combat grinding are not fun welcome to the current year where even well stablished comedic reviewers are taken 100 seriously and how dare you not like everything i like thats it friendship ended with dunkey now sky is my new best friend great video keep it up proud of you this video is the equivalent of a vegetarian reviewing the new meat lovers pizza from papa johns you dont like jrpgs dunkey and thats perfectly fine everyone has a genre they dont like but squares intention for this game was to harp back to 90s nostalgia it was intetionally designed in the vein of classic jrpgs dont make out like theyre not keeping up with the times when square have been very open about this finally an honest review on octopath keep it up dunkey no sarcasm i swear to goodness the ammount of peope thinking is this a serious and honest review of the game is amazing dont you know dunkey i mean i shouldnt have expected much from the guy who hates banjo tooie for being too slow paced to be fair there is actually plenty of character interaction if you bother to beat the first chapter to be fair to the excellency girl in the time period the game takes place not addressing them as your excellency every time you spoke would probably get you burned at the stake i like the books after hearing pit of spice and bazooka i had to sub is it just me or are some comments being deleted i noticed some i saw yesterday are no longer here i was hoping dunkey would read some of haanits dialogue too because i find her to be much worse than ophilia adding e to the end of random fuckin words like neede and finde can someone explain where all these bookworm deluxe memes come from a turnbased jrpg without an autofight button in the current year is unacceptable your excellency a hind d psyho mantis youre that ninja an outdated masterpiece we can say noel staap when you say your excellency over and over it becomes sexual your excellencys excellence excellently intensifies oh you roasted the shit out of octopath lololololololol still though i dont think this game is for me good to see dunkman tuning into an honest game reviewer the real problem is that its not knack 2 babbbyyyy this video was excellency people are going to be butthurt im never getting over the fact that they didnt bother to animate enemy attacks dunkey play bookworm adventures deluxe next its a game youd actually like damn i almost wasted my money holds b button to skip cutscene people are getting so mad over someones opinion and this wasnt a review either like many people otherwise think even though i really dont like mario games and most nintendo games for that matter except for pokemon i can still enjoy his content this game looks pretty cool stylistically but he made a mistake playing it with eng dub in the first place the very fact that he even bothered playing it at all even though he has such a shit taste in good games is still something dunkey is not some god hes still just a person a nintendo fanboy at that so dont be surprised if rpgs scare him away sometimes he said it himself that he really doesnt like that genre of games he doesnt like jrpgs even more and he also doesnt like turn based games this game is all of that of course he cant enjoy it alright first off this isnt a dunkview so hes not taking this shit seriously second you dont have to always agree with the person that is reviewing so dont get triggered when someone doesnt three go back to the critics video hed made and he will explicitly say he hates turnbased combat though some games like persona 5 is one of many exceptions so if he is actually serious you can expect what he will say for the most part fucking idiots to all who are disliking this video go watch the youtube comments video dunkey made whats the credits music from by far the most disliked video dunkeys ever gotten they do all interact with each other have you not seen the travel banter prompt in the top right im not a picky gamer but i do see your point im never enthralled by the game but amused enough to keep moving on if the party interacted with each other that would make this game so much better and possibly add character development to otherwise average characters completely agree with the dunk i personally tried ff 7 and crisis core and while the story and the graphics were appealing the combat was infuriating i had zero patience to go through every random mob that popped out of nowhere diablo 2 and fallout 2 were the games with random mobs that i liked because these games gave players the variety of ways to deal with them whereas in ff series it almost felt like a chore i love every seco d of thia game its always better to play on the japanese dub for classic jrpgs cuz the english dubs are gonna be 10x cringier this game really makes you feel like your excellency oh no look at how many people are upset that internet funny man didnt agree with their personal opinion regarding a game its almost like his entire channel revolves around him trying games out and reviewing them how dare he do the same with a highly anticipated and relevant switch exclusive thank you faith in videogamedunkey strengthened to those saying why he even bothered to play it if he already had an opinion about the genre maybe he played it to see if it was somrthing different and if it would change his mind he played persona 5 an anime turnbased jrpg and he actually liked it this game is just overrated i like you dunkey but this is a fight you will not win honestly i wish people wouldnt get so upset when someone gives a bad review to a game they dont like i think dunkey made some valid criticisms of this game thats not going to stop me from playing and enjoying it and i appreciate him giving me the perspective he has on it there have been other times where what he has said has driven me away from a game but its never been the only factor and it shouldnt be for anyone not everyone has to like all the same things you do i understand your points but there are some remarkable things about this game like the stylized graphics are refreshing and i found myself thinking how unique they were and how i wished more games looked like this and the soundtrack is beautiful i sat at the title screen for the entire duration of opening theme because i liked it so much but the voice acting is awful and i wish the stories intertwined i know people are trying to defend this game but ill be honest it looks like trash cool vid dunkey but you know what it needs a bookworm adventure joke haha come on guys its funny wow im playing the game with japanese audio and i have to say the voice acting is a lot better gosh its pretty though dunkey i cannot accept your criticism because judging by this video you have obviously never read the manga has my two favorite things i had a jeopardy moment and was like random encounter battles and turn based combat before dunky could finish his sentence can you please review puppeteer on ps3 it pains me that this isnt on ps4 as a lunch title and we had knack baby instead this game is not up to the excellency of knack 2 and super mario bros 2 i swear if these characters get into smash over waluigi he played this game because persona showed him that perhaps theres a game even in the genres you hate that you can enjoy this is why he gave this a shot and since he did he may as well whip up a video man yall are big mad about this review huh tbh radiant historia is a better game well this is exactly what i was afraid of glad i didnt buy the worst part about this game is that its not bookworm adventures deluxe i see a lot of comments about these criticisms of his are misrepresented but im not really understanding that the characters and dialogue dont seem all that good and as far as turn based combat goes it does seem like an average thing with nothing new thrown in so it doesnt look very engaging now i dont dislike turn based combat as much as dunkey and im sure that the game is enjoyable but even so it seems like people are hating on dunk just because he doesnt like a game you like damn i was so hyped about this game still gonna give it a try and hope my experience isnt so bad sooo i take it you dont like the game lol i actually love this game still love your commentary though i like the game i like this video life is good persona 5 is like pokemon meets inception hoo boy dunkey shin megami tensei was first so do you waste your time for us or for yourself an entertainer i watch didnt share my exact opinion about a game and now i dont know how to reconcile my enjoyment of different media reeeeeeeeeeeeeee random encounters why dont they use the chrono trigger mechanic where you could see the enemies on the darn drokking screen meh what a disappointment well it came to no shock that dunkey didnt like this because he mentioned before he hated turnbase games its comical to me that the people in the comments are this upset by one mans opinion if you enjoyed the game good now go play it instead of crying about dunkey not liking the same game as you nerds the sheer amount of autistic rage over one guy not liking a game is amusing its mf jrpg m8 you supposed to do all that shit n grinding like a mad and the game supposes to look like dat your excellencythis is an alright videobut it would be better if you played bookworm adventures deluxe lol more vaguely racist japanbashing from dunkkkey no surprises there its time people realize stupidly stretched out with random encounters and filler meh story with turn based combat is not standard jrpg but just shit i like old school jrpgs but this nostalgia wave is bringing us nothing but uninspired clones im glad you confirmed my expectations of this game also i really dont understand whats so special about the graphics its just 16 bit with ugly cheesy lighting and the world looks incredibly uninteresting i hate jrpgs with a burning passion anyone who plays them are probably social outcasts and dont know what good video games are ahem heres an example not this gooteeeeemmmm why did they hype this game so much on the switch market i liked this video because he states in it that yes there are interesting things but to get to that you have to play through boring grind festswhich some people my enjoy but for him and me personally i couldnt care less for why would i do that when i could just open up another game and just jump straight into the action without having to play through a million boring fights so if your a jrpg fan then instead of getting pissedwhich you will do anyway respect the fact that this video serves as a window to a opposite opinion of yours and see that the reasons you may like a game can be the opposite to another yes he didnt really say anything positive about the game except for like 1 thing and i think he did this because of how highly rated this game was so in dunkys mind he thought mmmm maybe this jrpg wont be generic boring time wasting shit like the other ones and he was mistaken because this game was made to be reminiscent of old jrpgs that dunky hates i think the only reason this game has any appeal is beause it merges ugly 2d sprites with beautiful 25 scenery if dunkey was a steven universe character his name would be black diamond i dont think this game would appeal to people who have actually played good old school rpgs not even a score oh no this rpg specifically designed to be like old school rpgs has random encounters oh nooooo tbh i would probably have to say the same thing about this game as he did hey donkeys you know i respect you man ever since the war youve been my wing man but how do you defend yourself agenst the sterling son when he the audacity of liking this game it cant possibly be a matter of taste in mechanics story and art style everyone needs to like and dislike all of the same things i think you two should have a coop video mostly because it would be cool what a twist pillars of eternity 2 is bettterrrrrrrrr careful shitting on squeenix your excellency looks like good game or has better story than jeff the killer creppypasta ive seen you talk about persona 5 a few times but what do you think of the game all around if you have played it as much as i understand dunkberts plight whit turn based combat and understand why some people dont agree i remember how often i use the turbo button on old emulated jrpgs that use turn based combat and i cant realy fault him for it ether make random fights fast or make every single one have some challenge but make them less frequent is it me or did dunkey get rid of the other party members in here not just jrpg the japanese fantasy as whole is a shitfest they cant write shit without having at least one of tsundere loli and fanservice character each the reason why jrpgs hold up so well is because theres barely any gameplay streets of rage yeah baby one simple question are the characters and the story interesting its nice to see the title is as it is you forgot the rating wild encounters are fine dude life is a wild encounter generator you venture off to do some shit and usually some asshole appears to make it harder but you get the experience out of it and become better i totally get it being frustrating tho the visual presentation looks interesting but underneath that it appears to be the same problems that plague generic jrpgs sounds kinda sad thnx for the vid dunk well the music is good at least to be fair it makes complete sense why you wouldnt like this game like bravely default and second before it it revels in its retro style and nostalgia trip the twist on the turn based combat even though its kinda rippedoff from default brings enough strategy to the table and thrill to the boss fights but only if you enjoy those turn based battles in the first place while the story is somewhat cliched it really depends on the character olberics story is bad but on the other end you have primroses story which deals with murders revenge and even prostitution and corruption its a shame you experienced the worst story first i dont think he didnt like xenoblade 2 he appears to have played it for a prolonged period of time the writing was just absolutely horrendous at times and it translated to boss battles as well where you lose fights you won it is a niche game there are specific people who will love it and the rest will hate it as a jrpg fan i still agree with most of his points its the ultra typical jrpg story with the super most common jrpg elements i love it xd edit that excellency part was hilarious haha good jrpgs without random encounters and turn based combat pretty much all of the tales of main series i saw someone with a game of the year 2 tshirt at tomorrowland this weekend of all the places straight up misinformation in this video having an opinion fine misrepresenting facts wack im am no game critic just a man who gave bubsy 3d a 55 for me personally the game met its expectations perfectly which was boring and unoriginal the art style of the game looked cool and i like some rpgs but this one is too similar to everything else for me to enjoy it its not necessarily bad and i can see why people like it but nothing about the game makes me want to keep playing it honestly i appreciate the consistency of your reviews im a jrpg fan so i love octopath but you made some fair points it looks like a good game your excellency well dumkey u just an octopus hater unsub the only thing i like about this game is the visuals id have a hard time making an entertaining video of a genre i dont like he did show the viewers a thing or three to everyone saying that this is a terriblemisrepresented video can you explain to me why the games writing is actually good im a fan of jrpgs but lately ive gotten jaded enough that if an rpg doesnt have an interesting story or character interaction then this shit better be called etrian odyssey otherwise no amount of revolutionary gameplay is going to make me stay engaged for long i dont give a shit about spoilers if telling me about the spoilers will ruin the story for me then the writing relies entirely on twists and has no substance outside of that this game like many jrpgs out there is a cringe fest however i did enjoy p5s gameplay mechs and i have no problem with random encounters in pokemon but jrpgs all around have terribly cringy story telling i bet reggy rides home on the short battle bus zing i agree on the grinding especially since in the characters specific chapters you need to bring along that character regardless of if they dont fit your party comp or are 10 levels below the recommended level im lucky thats only happened to me with 2 characters and that was still almost 4 hours i had to waste grinding just to get them to a reasonable enough level i didnt have to handhold them through the next dungeon i think the stories do get better once they go along but the ridiculous slog of the grind certainly doesnt do them any favors why would you review this game what are you a human being with rights gtfoutta heeaa ooh wow dunkey hates anotha jrpg whoda thunk it the graphics tho the graphics tho play tony hawks underground 2 and finish story mode on easy mode to unlock the best character in the game somehow the more you complained the more i wanted to play this what sorcery is this never go full game journalist i mightve liked this game if it wasnt for the horrendous voice acting and writing because the artstyle and gameplay is actually good the game isnt as good as xenoblade 2 because they didnt have a level 80 guy in the baby starting town oh no dunkey has a different opinion on a game than i do quick what are my options assimilate and ride the dunk train denounce all of dunkeys videos despite this one not being representative of dunkey as a whole acknowledge people can have different opinions and move on with life why did you even bother wasting your time on a game you knew youd hate so many people defending his misrepresentation of the game lol its fine if yall dont like jrpgsi dont usually either but dont try to justify obvious exaggerations and false representations of cherry picked and manipulated situations as if theyre fact lol its just his comedy style he does it all the time no need to jump on the hate train just cuz people are rightfully annoyed at the false representation of the game there are better more civil ways to deal with salt lol why would you play a turnbased rpg with random encounters if thats a style of game you dont like nice job not hitting the snails weakness just to drag out the battle reminds me of the time you purposely uninstalled a patch for assassins creed to make it look worse than it actually was yes your excellency a dream your excellency psycho mantis your excellency generic game with generic people with snesps1 graphic 60 please squaresoft is laughing to the bank just ger romancing saga 2 its the same thing for 13 a price maybe the game as a whole is pretty bad but you got to admit it looks nice the weebs are mad i kinda enjoyed my 3 hours with the demo but the price for a game like this is too damn high i hope it tanks for that very reason is that the beginning of the end from requiem for a dream during the random encountersturn based combat title card i like octopath traveler jesus christ i havent seen so much criticism on a dunkey video theyre literally thinking that this is an actual review of the game your dunkeyllency your dunkeyllency your dunkeyllency im going to start calling dunky your dunkcellency from now on i thought i was the only one that hates random encounters omg dunkey random encounters with basic and low level enemies is the number one reason i hate turn based combat games as well the only remedy ive found was with earthbound where a random encounter would end immediately end if you outleveled your opponent enough what do you think of this fix i found that all was that was left were fair and overpowered enemies so all of my fights were exciting although the frustration level of the game was much higher as a result my favorite part of this review is how people who are complaining about it are trying to defend xenoblade chronicles 2 like its not a complete piece of shit i was quite excited by this title though now i may have to give it a miss or catch it in a sale octopath dad 2 baybereeeee i do not agree with you i love the game in every way but please keep up with your honest reviews didnt realise that i was on playback speed 05 thought dunky had a gimmick of speaking slow to portray the blandness of the game i felt like trapping yourself into a hole then saying bad things about the hole doesnt do you good at all same exact reason why i like pokemon mystery dungeon so much same enjoyment of battles and collecting items and shit but you know exactly when and what youre about to fight and the story is actually engaging your excellency wait this isnt bookworm deluxe i agree with some of his points but disagree with others i didnt get this game because its so jarring for an rpg to have characters that dont interact i think grinding has inherent value in it self but its not for everybody looks like all the switch kids are getting mad because dunkey dunked on the two exclusive jrpgs the switch has only good part of the review is the octodunk savage hit em where it hurts dunkey releases in this day and age should put in the extra detail that makes a game legendary for decades to come it wouldve been so epic if your squad made remarks or triggered unique events in a certain circumstance based on the other members of the team the game would truly come to life even if they do silly stuff like for example a teammate decides to stay as an npc in a village to woo the blacksmiths daughter after being in a full male group for 7 ingame days because his loyalty or cause level wasnt brought high enough thanks so 3 out of 5 xd i feel as though you would like these jrpg games if you didnt have the english dubs the voice acting for the english version tends to be fucking horrible it sounds like at all times the voice director for them was like that was a good delivery but can you make it more cartoony and then make it sound like you are screaming also get louder as the sentence goes on is it worth buying this i have never played an jrpg i played the demo and enjoyed it but i was about 87 sure dinkus wouldnt like it i keep getting ads for this game the ads are bad too im mildly disappointed that this game isnt about octopi random encounters are bullshit and just hurt games like undertale and pokemon really you just need to make the enemies spawn randomly and let players avoid them in the game world with movement skill or something and those games would be perfect why even buy the game if u dont enjoy traditional jrpg pee in my butt your excellency very much agreed about the dialogue that is awful but i love random encounters and turn based combat always have always will i kind of feel the same playing ni no kuni 2 no matter how good or nostalgicit looks the gameplay matters more good review you made the weebs on twitter furious using the words dunkey and review in the same sentence is where youre all flawed he doesnt take his videos seriously why are you its all for a laugh watched your vid and the game looked excellent youve convinced me to buy it also your editing is way too fast youre making points but not lingering on them long enough on screen very messy thank you dark souls dang im really enjoying it even with all of the voice acting id be so mad if i were a youtuber because if we look at it dunk can make a 2 minute video and well love it instant 1 mil views sad you didnt like it im really enjoying the game myself maybe next time youll have a good opinion dunkey capa i love rpg and hate jrpg as they usually destroy everything an rpg stands for turn based reviews pretty much always boil down to does this person like turn based combat and this review is no exception oh boy this comment section gonna be good grabs popcon i was on the fence about getting this game but this video just confirmed its everything i didnt want in a video game thanks for saving me some dunk i would probably love this game if they did more with the story besides giving you characters is it that bad i thought about getting it b3ecause of its retro grandia1 ff styled thing everyone getting butthurt at a comedy review of course he wouldnt like this gameits not knackbabbbby choke me your excellency in 2018 u got no reason to play a snooze fest like this this actually looks like a game i might enjoy too bad i dont own a switch and its exclusive to it dunked is my excellency only 3min oh well i will rewatch it 3 times oh some of the dialogue is clunky ill grant you that unfortunately thats just jrpgs in general honestly while the random encounters can be kind of annoying i think the battle system makes up for it im a sucker for the type of battle system where if you know what youre doing you can absolutely obliterate your enemies but if you dont then your enemies can and will do the same to you persona 5 and mario rabbids kingdom battle are some good examples of that i havent played most of the way through octopath traveler but so far im enjoying it but jrpgs definitely arent for everyone it takes a certain tolerance of tedium for the lesser enjoyable parts but ive noticed that in a grand majority of the ones ive played if youre willing to get through some of the boring parts theres usually a great story interesting characters and a fantastic world to explore dunno if any of that is true of octopath traveler but i hope so dunkey plays a genre he clearly he doesnt like his fanbase puts his opinions as facts even tho his footage showed how his tactics were all wrong haha you are just a weeb dude jrpgs suck have we reached pewdiepies fanbase level obnoxious we already knew dunkey hates jrpgs so why is anyone upset i love this game but i knew what was coming still love u dunk dunkey critisizes game for bad writing and tedious grinding shut up dunkey youve already said you dont like what jrpgs stand for random encounters your execellency i counter with yakuza series your move imagine this spoken with an overthetop voice in japanese d im literally trying to find the typo in your title for like 2 minute i absolutely love this game this video was hilarious a video on octopath your dunkellency everything you said was fair critism but in a review you also have to point out the goods as well as the bads regardless of how good or bad you personally think the game is this is just a glorified rant about the game more than anything chat hating game they havent touched dunkey never liked random encounter games why would he randomly like this one mehaps he was being too critical i can understand how tedious rpgs can get but even though he claimed the knights story to be boring it was actually pretty interesting waaa oook ook turn based bad me have to think grog no like turn based and there it is the first dunkey video i do not agree with the most interesting part of this game was the omniscience the player is given right from the start regardless of who i choose to start as the map shows me that there are 7 other people waiting to meet me how and why would i know this and even exactly where they are located it reminded me of that show i think its called sense 8 where multiple different characters are aware of each others existence across vast distances to me a lot of the fun of this game is using your imagination to role play in what is a role playing fucking game to fill in the narrative gaps yourself to me it seems like these 8 people are bound and drawn to each other by fate this isnt bookworm adventures deluxe i know youre white but i cant help but picture a black dude behind that voice i really wanted to like this game but the demos never won me over i think it does come down to the bland characters i wish they made a 3rd bravely default instead please do a legend of dragoon review please dunkey like this comment everyone to support legend of dragoon review request tressa was the best part about this game i like this game your excellency this video is pointless is it too much to ask for some developer any developer to make a jrpg on par with golden sun 12 its all ive wanted for the longest time but nobody seems capable of delivering that experience again when it comes to rpgs just like with books good characters can carry a weak story but weak characters cant carry a good story sonic mania ad on here boi this isnt bookworm adventures musics pretty good though wheres the bookworm deluxe guys comment i didnt know what i expected have you ever been outplayed before read more finally someone with the guts to bring out the truth its fair to say that dunkey said a few videos ago that he doesnt like turnbasedrpgs this review was meh meh meh i love jrpg games being a great fan of seiken densetsu 3 secret of mana chrono trigger but i was thrown off by octopath traveler when i downloaded the demo by the exact things mentioned in this video many meaningless random encounters ending in just grinding and bland story and i thought im the only one thinking so looking at the reviews glad i was wrong nice video thanks dunkey ill try it out i miss these kind of games wow all the amount of angry comments on this one is interesting the guy can have an honest opinion that doesnt match everyone elses id rather him do honest videos than just copy whatever game review sites are doing im glad im not the only one who thought the game didnt look that great i havent played it myself so i cant say much but from what gameplay i have seen from the demo the dialogue looks really generic and doesnt look very appealing compared to what turnbased rpgs are already out there if the dialogue has no life in a game that runs at a very slow pace not everyone is going to want to keep going with it play bookworm adventures instead take a drink everytime she says your excellency in the game did you like this video your excellency because i did your excellency hahahaha if this person is a youtuber im batman awful editing of course the combat was slow you werent even trying to expose the weakness of that snail smh dunkirk smh i mean in all seriousness you had one of the weaknesses exposed but you didnt use it and proceeded to showcase the combat as just hit each other until it dies which granted its still that way regardless but its also not as mindless as its being made out to be doesnt bother me he doesnt like it thats fine i think he has valid points video just felt like a quick churn out though not one of the better videos that didnt really try to understand it imo and i think that bugs me more than him not liking it how will nintendrones ever come back from this wtf why arent you praising my favourite ever game to ever be created omg i fuckign hgate you im unsucbsribing i saw octo and anime bitches and i thought this video was going to go in a totally different direction tldr dunky doesnt get jrpgs but octopath still looks average man that excellency shit was grating i always have to watch your videos multiple times because you cram so much content into them while i dont agree with you in that the game is bad i do see the problems you see i think this games lets the story unfold in your imagination a little bit which is how it always was for me in older rpgs its a nostalgia trip more than it is its own game but it doesnt feel stale here come the anime warriors hur dur so its like dark souls but turn based cool ill remember to ask your opinion on games when you get over your bloated ego dunkey videogamedunkey is my favorite game reviewer metal gear excellency has lost all meaning to me now the visuals look fucking amazing though oh good now that i know you dont like this its confirmed that this game is a masterpiece because you have no taste i downloaded the free trial and went to give it a try and was greeted with a 10 minute segment of diaglogue that wasnt skippable and just gave up this must be one of dunkeys most hated videos damn lets be honest dunkey wouldve hated this game even if it was the second coming of jesus psycho mantis youre that ninja nah octopath is fucking awesome so many dislikes it seems they began to recognize that you are not black hey did you guys know about his excellency the part about dull lameass story and characters was what instantly turned me off playing the octopath traveller demo just horrible not a 2018 material the fact that this title is received with current level of enthusiasm and adulation tells you how poor switch library is right now its a shame they wasted such beautiful graphics on this game yo whens the scooby doo night of 100 frights review dropping psycho mantis your excellency you said the game had two of your favorite things and then you turned around and gave it a bad review ya blew it dunk hah turnbased jrpg cmon dunk you can do better i knew you wouldnt like this game cuz i know youre not into jrpgs but still brainless combat waht also after collecting 4 characters i still havent needed to grind so still enjoy the video people in here acting like dunko just clowned on their favorite anime oh my fucking god you know what this sounds like hunt down the freeman when you lowkey like the funny man and connect on many points about rpgs in general but the horde is just passing your window but what about the g r w a p i c s sure it looks beautiful but the characters look and sound flat and there seems to be no strong plot to the story either id rather play ff13 and at least get some kind of emotion out of it stop with this shit start being funny so your not going to show any actual story progression you cant say the entire casts staires are crap when you only seemed to do the first chapter of each character is there anything funny about this game your dunkellency lol people are praising this game they just love the art style it looks like those old tactics and pretty backgrounds but anything else its plain and boring they didnt even bother to give the character models a decent sprite animations ive seen nes games that have better quality in both story and practical animations when are you playing plants vs zombie the game of the century why does dunkey keep playing jrpgs if he hates them so much man hit the nail on the head with turn based combat it can be brilliant but more often than not is mindless and grindy the best combat ive ever seen in any jrpg was in lost odyssey on the 360 completely menubased and turnbased but ridiculously complex and forcing you to think half a dozen turns ahead in order to not get killed by a basic enemy whats the pokemon meets inception games name i did not like this one i think its fun i love dunkey and still always will and i will obviously continue to watch him cause hes one of the funniest youtubers out there and im surprised to say this is the first time i strongly disagree with him which is what i was expecting because of his last video when he said he hates random encounters and turn based combat i respected it at first because jrpgs are just not his style but i got annoyed after he didnt compliment not a single thing about the game and only misinformed people of how the combat works and almost trying to make it look bad or maybe just reminding people he hates jrpgs i dont know but either way im not gonna be that guy who stops watching dunkey just because he said one game was bad still this review did annoy me enough to dislike your excellency dunkey if ever by a million chance of hell that you got audience with the queen of england try not to address her as her majesty unless she told you not to see to it why repeating the title when addressing a vvvip is important this is the worst final fantasy ive ever seen song at the end your excellency i found this game to be exactly what i was looking for but i agree it definitely missed the opportunity to make it more than it was i wouldve loved to see advanced classes better coherence for an overall story etc i actually want dunkey to play an action rpg like tales of series or tales of knack try into the breach thats some hot turn based gameplay the game looks good and nice the art if great and voice acting is acceptable but its made for type of people thats interested enough to set down and play it dunkey simply not into it and have good reasons why take it with a grain of salt he didnt trash it all together enjoy your game people maybe dunk is the armand white of rpg games so is this sarcastic or is this genuinely an awful game thats why you avoid the english voice acting like the plague and play it with japanese audio only way to play a jrpg i literally played the 3 hour demo as the thief and all i remember doing was stealing from people and sitting through forced exposition dialogue why did you stop playing league i can feel the cringe and as a weeb the story sounds and looks boring edit and yeah im not appealed to the concept of turnbased combat game does anyone know what the outro song is o thank christ dunkey didnt bad mouth chrono trigger in this video everytime you bring up chrono trigger i love you just a bit more keep it up with the vids uncle dunkle they interact all the triggered jrpg fans disliking this video half agree half disagree but you know i dont even watch dunkey bcus he black but honestly octopath traveler is just a rip off of a really good game bookworm adventures i really think you should play that dunkey listen go back to reviewing mario and other casual platformers and leave the more complex games to better critics with a wide variety of taste you really expect certain things from every game and if it doesnt hit that expectation then its bad go review gothic 3 a game made by piranha bytes and tell me what you think 010 used the word excellency wish you did a review on detroit become human it looks decent so far well thats a shame but i was specting you would also talk about the secondary classes break system and how you interact with the npcs steal inquire guide i guess if you didnt like what you mentioned on the video thats enough to make you not play it yo dunkey review an srpg next those are even slower i thought i was the only one who doesnt like this shitty ass game i like turn based combat when its down right like wasteland 2 divinity 2 xcom 2 or fire emblem this nope you reiterated that you dislike jrpgs with a short video got it moving on tbh random encounter really pissing me off you make a surprisingly good point still buying it tho i hate turnbased combat like this too ive been seeing this game on instagram and was going to check it out but this video convinced me not to thanks dunkey everyone knows english dubs are terrible and it just sounds like you dont like jrpgs but still tried a jrpg then criticised it for being a jrpg no rating im kind off shocked we also have games where you can write words to defeat enemies you missed out the best kind of game dunkey im dissapointed tbh it looks like a minecraft with a good resource pack yeet man i was looking forward to this game but these issues might ruin it for me well dunkey is the kind of guy that hated the yakuza 0 side stories no wonder he cant stand jrpg because he hates reading thanks for taking a dump on this game a dunk people can like what they like but the jrpg as a genre is so stale marketing this game as the next big switch hit is just bullshit and yet the switch soyboys are eating it up cmon kids your game doesnt have to have boring gameplay to tell a good story stop pretending to like weakass games just because theyre in a certain genre why the high amount of dislikes maybe if they remade it octopath traveller battle royale adhd edition it might better suit your tastes id like to think that jrpgs arent even made for gameplay at this point xenoblade 2 is like half cutscene half game not that its a bad thing or anything like that tho so this game doesnt have anything to do with octopuses 010 wont buy regardless those are beautiful old school graphics but bookworm adventures deluxe eww this video left such a bad taste in my mouth gotta play more octopath to clean it up i have to agree with dunkey to 100 here on this great potential was horribly wasted dislike for this video not being a review about bookworm deluxe about 77k folks agree with me i too like to intentionally play games that have things in them i dont like and shit on them to make people buttangry thanks dornkney damn they hatin on dunk a lot im siding with ya dunkey wait what your excellency its a bad game your excellency shame your excellency it looked really cool your excellency and to be frank with you your excellency im a humongous sucker for turnbased rpgs your excellency so its a huge shame your excellency that it turned out to not be all that good your excellency dunk it had to be said by someone leah needs to lean over while her and dunkey are in bed and whisper your excellency into his ear dunkey you should try darkest dungeon its turn based but actually well made and interesting well if you hate story youre free to skip the intro you know im not really a turnbase player either but i think they can be fun if they spice up new things in the formula if you want to see an excellent example of turnbased combat id recommend a little gem on steam called helens mysterious castle take turnbased combat now give every technique a timer smaller weapons can fire quickly while dealing little damage big weapons offer more damage better protection but gives your opponent time to counter magic takes a long time leaves you wide open but has a massive payoff this turns every enemy into a minipuzzle where you have to learn their movements to deal with them as efficiently as possible its a small change but it manages to completely flip turnbased mechanics on its head theres a nice flow to combat that feels a lot more natural weighted than most rpgs theres only 3 simple numbers you ever have to focus on that are immediately understandable random elements are almost nonexistent you are allowed to feel like you have control over the pace of the battle as an added bonus no random encounters its im buying this game i havent played my switch since odyssey came out yeah but when are ya gonna play bookworm adventures deluxe this isnt dunk reviews if it was then his opinion truly matters whose excellency is it again your excellency psycho mantis i swear the majority of the commenters always happen to be newcomers this aint a review like people think perhaps its tolerable to play once you turn off the voices your excellency lol he didnt even break the snail what song was that in the beginning i love the game for pretty much half of the reasons dunkey hates it cant please everyone i also pretty much dislike half the games dunkey enjoys octopath traveler is a good franchise hey dunkey lose weight sexually yours octopussytravelerultimatefanboi6969 i dont get why people are disliking the video just bc they dont share the same opinion as you the video still was great good qualitiy and good points it was more serious than other normal videos but not as much in depth as a dunkview i would have liked a dunkview to octopath traveler but this is totally fine and now to the content in this video you started the video with telling to everyone that jrpgs were very popular in the past and then listed the values and interesting design choises of the modern games then mentioned for example persona 5 and said that this as an jrpg had an interesting concept so what makes octopath traveler stand out that is the point of the video the next almost 3 minutes you will talk about the main feature and some other aspects of octopath traveler eight characters everyone with their own story usually a week story after you finished one story and start the next they then join your crew but dont interact with the other charac 2 of 5 your excellency psycho mantis the xenoblade 2 episode is misleading but at least fun this time more deliberate misleadings and no fun i detect the sound of patrick seitzs voice in this game nice octopaths main problem is its not a refined rpg like bookworm deluxe that ff7 to pokemon battle fucked my mind damn i was super pumped for this gamenow im not so sure as is it seems you really hate jrpgs but what do you think about the mario luigi series id like to see a video in which you talk about those games you shouldve played the dancer she straight up gets called a whore lmao i think he just heard good things about it hoped its a game good enough to transcend its genre and it obviously isnt that as most jrpgs it gets repetitive and cheesy dialogue weird stories and a bit of grinding are expected although ot does it well for its genre this stuff is still in there not sure why people say he cherrypicked for the video this is pretty much what the first chapter feels like its no wonder someone that doesnt like these elements would drop the game right there thank you for this video your excellency bookworm adventures has a deep compelling story well its a turn based combat jrpg with random encounters if you hate those you wont like this game perfectly understandable yeeep pretty disappointed with this game its insanely slow especialy the super boring dialogsand all them random encounters zzzzz i dont think dislike for a genre is enough of a reason to throw out someones opinion of a game from that genre i dont like metroidvania games and i didnt think hollow knight was as great as everyone says it is but i loved playing dead cells i dont have patience for real time strategy games but the fun heroes and endless skill ceiling keeps me playing dota 2 for thousands of hours yeah i stopped listening to this guy after he said octopus traversal was bad the first thing you should do is set the spoken language to japanese its waaay to cringey in english why would you go out of your way to playmake a video about rpgs when you clearly dislike the genre i think hes just trying to troll people that love jrpgs now just hope it doesnt stop anyone from trying the game since its actually decent how do you have 1 mil views in 12hours so i havent played this game and i cant tell if its good or bad dunkey says turn based is bad im not sure about that he also says grinding is bad sure i can agree but some ppl in the comments say its good how i like turn based combat if its handled well but i dont get why grinding is fun plz explain also i like the aesthetic of this game but not decided if ill get it yet this vid made me think it was bad but i read comments so it seems like some ppl like it i cant tell if this is a great game that dunkey isnt a fan of or if its an actual bad game with just a few good fans you reviews are always on point radiant historia is much better than octo could ever be ah another one of those octodad games huh people actually take dunk reviews as a legit review its just his opinion i mean come on this dude hate any rpg you throw at him stands and makes slashing motions until snail melts ah the thrill of the fight so what i got from this is that the game is very pretty but the gameplay is shitty xenoblade chronicles 2 witcher 3 just sayin good thing i didnt buy it it was boring from the demo overrated shit story decent combat tho i did wonder what all the fuss was about this game and now i knownothing you should try to play some of the smt titles please notice me your dunkcellency i mean dunkey is a sperg with his own particular taste in games sometimes good sometimes cringe he has an opinion i have an opinion you have an opinion the dude hates jrpgs and we get a love letter to classic jrpgs he also hated xenoblade 2 which was a damn masterpiece in its own right i hated tora too though nothing to get mad over half the time he has an opinion its cause itll make a good video the graphics look interesting i am still gonna get this gameand i am big on jrpgs so i hope ill enjoy it more than you did and ill keep your criticisms in mind thanks for the review dunkey always good to get different opinions thank you for helping me not waste 40 dollars this looks like an allnighter at richard simmons house everyone out here pretending like there has been more than about 5 fun turn based combat games i hate jrpgs as well dunk glad im not alone i was never planning on buying this game uh hello the rating what is the rating i just had an existenial crisis just from hearing that word over and over again what is the music at the end i think the problem is you just dont like turnbased combat couldnt agree more nailed it dunkey dunkey talked pretty fast in this video what is this zero dunctuation ya sorry that was pretty bad this is the type of game that mindless apes that enjoy this type of jrpg will eat up even though it is complete garbage like every single jrpg of this type of which there are more than anyone would believe you can like persona 5 a game with an hour long tutorial before you can do stuff by yourself and long lines of text that constantly break up gameplay yet shit on xenoblade 2 so hard because why i dont understand you dunkey come on dunkey we all know that knack 2s fast paced exciting combat makes other games feel dull by comparison but you have to understand that this type of game is for patient players who enjoy the tactics and options provided by these rpg mechanics oh he made some valid criticisms so lets just chalk it up to him despising jrpgs lol unexpected but understandable the problem with you is that the game attracts people who like turn based combat the art still looks really cool actually tho pewdiepie should learn how to make funny videos from you if you dont like this i can almost guarantee youll love bookworm adventures at least in pokemon unless youre in a cave you can usually skip most of the encounters even then you can just stock up on repels and only fight the trainers for exp and usually youll still be good for the whole game hey video james dunkens when we gonna see knack and bubsy crossover game wheres the bookworm deluxe guy really turn based combat sucks because of waiting how more of a diluted fing sped up gaming experience do you want dunkey press god fcking x to pay respects is the culmination of this god fing attitude piss off with this casual sht that has to ruin every each game that has just 1 mm more depth than your average teaspoon brave move now nintendo fans turn theres some objectively wrong info in this video but otherwise i found myself agreeing with some of the points why are you playing a turnbased rpg game with random encounters if you hate turnbased rpg games with random encounters whats a good game holy shit my gf wants this game and if i actually have to hear that dialogue ill return her the switch i bought her jontron copied your bubsy video probably because hes black and they steal huh this is your worst video i loved octopath traveler and i agree with this review persona 5 is pokemon meets inception ugh i scrolled through a lot of the comments just so i could satisfy that arggh feeling after watching this video because i love love the game but im too poor to pay 60 for iti wish i could have it now but this review keeps me crying inside what a distasteful world and its people i dont know how to describe this feeling love you dunkey ok shoulda seen that cominghow about you review wizard of legend for switch that im sure youll love well at least it looks pretty first you forgot to put dunkview i actually want this game though it looks interesting xd disdain for plebs i think octopath traveler is a fantastic game i think you just dont like jrpgs thats ok but doesnt make the game bad whats with the downvotes this isnt bookword adventures i enjoyed the free trial and the art style really appeals to me but after buying the full game im not too much of a fan anymore am i your excellency or is excellency my yoursi can you please make longer videos or maybe some some for reviews a lot of people love turn based combat and grinding the game doesnt have to be something for everyone but its still exellency in its own field v is going nuts over this right now i like turn based rpgs if theyre good moans your excellency the best jrpg is bookworm adventures deluxe but the real question is did anyone really care about the game in the first place its a good idea to anger sky before the release of the new smash top strategy right there keep it up can you do something different soon you could grow exponentially if you change from this stale formula you have been following for years dunkey dude dont play the dubbed versions of these games japanese voice cast makes it a lot less cringey im loving octopath traveler but what did yall expect its dunkey imagine liking random encounters and turn based combat lol you have to be braindead to like either of those 2 concepts as a main reason for you buying a game completely monotonous and lazy game designs to make a game seem like it has more action then it actually does over hyped boring game have at you a sea of monotonous grinding my dude the only grinding ive done in this game has been to let me pat myself on the back for being too powerful every boss ive encountered every area ive visited ive been appropriately leveled for even new party members level up quickly and have rarely if ever been a burden because of their weakness if you dont like jrpgs you do you but legit as a fan of the genre the combat music art and your partys interaction abilities are all fresh and excellent lazy review not all of us grew up with halo if anything compare it to other jrpgs a new dunky video thank you your excellency i love random encounters this is literally exactly how i felt about this naff game my character was the mage guy and then i found the hunter woman i wanted to kill myself listening and reading the dialogue in her village oh my god it is so much worse than your excellency i like this game a lot dunkey i got it for my birthday im sorry you did not like it liked and subscribed i knew dunkey wouldnt like this game dunkey knew he wouldnt like this game not sure why he even bothered with it honestly whats the game that tells stories without any reliance on dialogue whatsoever mentioned at the beginning god dam it reggy you gone done it again like i dont understand why this game is popular everything ive seen about it is so completely generic and dull is it just the fact that its a jrpg that people love it but the graphics is this dunkeys first 05 i noticed he didnt give a score whoever made random encounters should be kicked into a pit of spikes and shot with a bazooka i want this on a shirt why is there so many dislikes can someone explain jrpgs arent for everyonemyself included ok but foreal though its a mastapiece yea dunkey has ligma if you hate the genre dont even review it you are the best octodunk that seems fine and all but im still disappointed that this isnt bookworm adventures here i am waiting for dunkey to play borderlands i understand the whole not liking jrpgs thing youre entitled to your opinion and if you dont like that specific genre thats totally fine but several things in this video seem super cherrypicked especially that snail fight you deliberately used only one extremely high level character wearing low level gear you didnt properly use the boost mechanic at all and you used arguably the least interesting character olberic is a warrior who has weapons that he uses to hit things compared to magic users that can electrocute every single enemy at once and rogues who can hire mercenaries midcombat to fight basically that fight was borderline malicious in how awful of an example it was again dunkey can have his own opinion and all that but when you deliberately try to make a game look bad just because you dont like the genre its in theres a problem i think the most technological turn based combat in the history of games is in book worm adventures deluxe sequel anyone to all the outraged people just because someone doesnt like the game doesnt mean you cant enjoy it not everyone has to agree with you or like the things you like its dunkeys opinion backed up by the video showing those parts he describes what he doesnt like and shows evidence for it thats a completely valid and good way of expressing ones opinion i personally can understand why someone wouldnt like this game but personally i really enjoy it i am so satisfied with this review i kept telling all my friends this game will be garbage lmao its not a dunkview dont get your bookwarm adventures in a twist yall despite the negative review i think ill have to peep this one out should have went for the stripper slut her stories hilarious didnt thought i could see a review where i saw nothing about the game and just some guy saying he doesnt like rpgs seriously dunkey i like your stuff but this is by far you weakest video in a while love jrpgs love this video still i was hesitant to buy this game because of the disjointed storytelling and a good story and characters even bland characters with an interesting backdrop is necessary for me dunkey kind of solidified my choice for me it looks like literally ever shitty indie rpg game to come out in the past decade your excellency youre that ninja i love this game but i love dunkey commentary you blew it regi lotsa salt down here turn back ye i was on the fence about buying this cause what i saw didnt look that interesting and just thought maybe the skilltrees make things better later on but this pretty much solidifies all my doubts i had when i heard about octopath the first thought that popped into my mind was a turnbased rpg with more enjoyable combat mechanics than the standard cookie cutter attack and occasionally use skills if you have mpsppp whatever the hell as well as featuring 8 different classes that allows a player to experience the full game differently depending on who they choose instead it appears that cookie cutter turnbased combat still exists for the most part and the only difference with the arcs is the order you do them in as the new characters dont have unique dialogue depending on who is there and who isnt example noble knight is there when you do the thief arc knight regularly tries to convince the thief not to steal stuff or actively hinders his progress and causes differen ive never played a jpeg dunkey i love you man but if you dont like turnbased fights then why are you reviewing jrpgs what he doesnt like this game that the majority of people are enjoying he has a a a different opinion wtffffff1111f1f1f1f1f11 somebody is bad at jrpgs the art and storyline looked promising but then it felt too clichey in the end dunkey can you tweet my comment i dont really get the octodad series i actually really like this game but you had some really good point dunkley thanks dunk still trying to beat enter the gungeon btw chrono trigger is the best rpg of all time oh dear god what should i do i liked the game but i liked the video too i played the demo yes the characters are generic and dont even t a l k t o e a c h o t h e r but i still found the game looking amazing and the combat wasnt that bad either i just feel as if they wanted to reinvent jrpgs then proceeded to focus on the graphics alone its like they wrote 8 generic arcs then put some flex tape on it upside down overall the boss and level design caught me off guard but i just dont think it should be 60 dollars 15 10 is all i would pay for it 410 the visuals was the only cool thing about it but dunky what scoreouttafive did it earn or did you feel it was so lackluster that it didnt even deserve the 15 rating been playing this for the past few days really fucking good glad i opted for captain toad over this your excellency dunk you know its bad when dunkey doesnt even give a rating thanks dunks you saved me some cheddar i was already hesitant but your gripes are ones id have with it too the anime ass voice acting literally makes me flinch and i do mean literally i was gonna say something like oh no an unpopular opinion but then i realized there were more people saying that then there were people genuinely upset about it thats octoglover pretty much all of the footage here can be gotten from the demo maybe barring having your first character at lv 22 without a party considering that a cursory internet search reveals that the characters start interacting with each other in chapter 2 which can be almost impossible to get to in the demo combined with the general rantcentric nature of it im not even sure you actually played the game to any sort of completion i know this isnt a review but this video wasnt all that great as far as quality is concerned what im trying to say is that my final score for this video is 97510 disappointing and underwhelming just an opinion not a review chill guys damn mr meatman this had absolutely nothing to do with my ex is this fortnite 2 review it got so much attention and praise because switch owners were desperate for a new game because there are like 3 max available is psycho mantis her excellency only nintenpig will like this dumb fck game if this game is on the ps4 or xbox im sure it wont get that high scores dddddddddd talk about poor taste in video games honestly if he dont like the way this game was made well welcome to every jrpg ever because thats what youre going to get in this kind of game i just love it when people like dunkey are so uncultured that they make videos like this because people of his caliber in video games make me sick like i get i couldve skipped his video because i dont like it but how could i when this video is everywhere on the internet also i feel as though he has no taste in hearing a good backstory to a character because they get better as the story goes on i just really hate disgusting uncultured duckweeds like him who really doesnt get what a challenge in a video game is should of had more knack c delet this it hurts me everytime dunky mentions he hates xeno 2 still love him tho just change the language to japanese and the game gets way better why 72k dislikes dunkey is the lord himself you see my royal dunkeyness there is a little known rpg titled as earthbound which had a revolutionary idea where if you encounter an enemy the game calculates if you can one shot him and skips the battle and gives you exp without leaving the map the game itself is good but suffers so fucking much later on due to the story the story is so fucking boring and predictable especially alfym and tressa if you like jrpgs i recommend the trails series ironically the last line of the review is what i thought of enter the gungeon not worth the grinding and slow pace of combat to bother with but id prolly be more down for this kind so to each their own game sounds pretty interesting from what im hearin i like the art style i love rpgs no matter what so i enjoy the game however i do agree that turn based random encounter just needs to remain dead style and interactivity is what carries turn based rpgs nowadays even games with textheavy minimalistic battle screens are more engaging then the original style also a lot of games just make it so you insta kill most things that you outlevel this showed up as early as earthbound so theres no excuse criticizing a jrpg for being turnedbased is a valid opinion but its a boring point to make still thought the video was very entertaining i dont find jrpgs appealing dunk okay everyone who likes jrpgs conversation kinda ends there those visuals look great tho what was that outro song yep i was right hes definitely copying bookworm adventures the word excellency sounds weird now lowkey just buying the game for visuals haha why does dukey sounds like a 30 yearld old white man who has smoked way to many cigarrs your excellency while i respect your opinion and usually find your videos to be funny and informative this one was factually misrepresenting the game pretty badly the combat system first off is one of the best systems i have ever seen in a jrpg using a boost system to bank turns creating risk reward management and the break system requiring you to experiment with foes weaknesses and think a little bit in the video you showed one character using only basic attacks on an enemy using no skills so early on in the game that you have no other party members and this would be like if i showed dark souls combat using only the broken sword standing ramrod stiff doing basic attacks on a boss on the topic of random encounters the scholar class gets a skill really early on into the game that lowers the encounter rate massively and the excellent scaling used in this game allows you to use that the whole way through if you choose i have never had to stop and grind enemies at any point in how is this not trending dunkeys totally entitled to his opinion but how is he gonna use the clip of olberic attacking with his sword over and over again to justify the repetitiveness of combat when you have a lot of combat options and could have probably finished the fight in 2 turns by breaking the enemy and boosting aight for what reason would you dislike a video with quality jokes truth and excellency i enjoyed both xenoblade chronicles 2 and octopath traveler alot p turn based combat is the devil it was ok on nes and but after that it was unacceptable to me the game looks mad boring but i got to give it to them the style of graphics is insanely intriguing thank you for beginning with great rpg examples so people dont think you hate oh nvm hey dunkey if you have time you should try trails of cold steel too its one of the great jrpg in this generation its not short its c o m p a c t persona has better writing than ut by a long shot original sin divinity 2 i dont understand the choice of starting up again with each characters origins in final fantasy 6 for example characters get into the party as you go along naturally and their backgroundstory gets told as the story progress due to how their stories are related to the main plot only one origin story should exist in a 40 jrpg they are already repetitive enough by nature are you reviewing this just because it was getting 910 on review sites even though its probably lower its obvious you dont like it that much was obvious before you played it but it feels like you bought a copy and are reviewing it to just being a contrarian rather than reviewing a game because you wanted to see if it was as good as the hype more power to yall that like this game but i was on the fence and not really seeing the what people like so much about it and this video pushed my off the fence on and onto money saved im not really digging slower paced turn based combat and if ya cant set the voices to weebonese im out your excellency your excellency dunkey your excellency we have lost a potential game again your excellency you had it with english voices you fool shoulda been octopath your excellency next time danky thrill of the fight a fucking snail what can i say just aint your style of game thank you dunkey for the best free content this world has to offer love every bit of it any chance you could do a fortnite save the world dunkview when its fully released later this year love ya dunkey ps pls keep making videos till i have children 3 i generally enjoy random encounters but it is particularly annoying in octopath because unlike other jrpgs it seems fairly difficult to flee from weak enemies in octopath it might even be based on how many enemies are active the worst part is that your whole party loses their turn if you fail to flee so you have to wait for 4 enemy animations plus your 4 party member tripped on themselves text this takes up so much time that its probably just better to kill them and not risk wasting all that time your knackcellency maybe dunkey isnt the biggest jrpg fan your excellency as much as i love dunkey i never really agreed on his opinion on jrpgs random encounters and turnbased combat even though he makes good points ill still give the game a go ps still waiting for the next spaghetti and meatballs nice one i like octopath but i also like your review i respect dunkeys opinion and i get that he doesnt like jrpgs but i feel that the video was very misleading and not representative of the overall game i noticed this as well during his video of metroid 2 samus returns he took things way out of context in that video ahh i see youre a man of culture saying you dont like fish because of how it tastes is one thing but saying you dont like fish because it doesnt taste like pork is another thing entirely turnbased combat is outdated newer styles of gameplay offer just as much strategy but with more complicated and fluid realtime mechanics that add a dimension of depth we have come to expect from games final fantasy xv implemented this in an excellent way with proper camera management and resourceful use of space between navigating battlefields and utilizing the warpstrike mechanic the game became even more complex than quite a few of its predecessors this with a simple arsenal and one playable character rpg devs claim originality by packing their ips full of useless side content that adds nothing to the immersion of the game looking at you ni no kuni you convoluted wreck how many truly unique rpgs are being released relative to the cookie cutter clones and dysfunctional hybrids flooding the genre the balance is disproportionate in favor of mediocrity well at least random encounters are becoming less pervasive whens the bookworm adventures deluxe 2 video coming out is reggi saying no huhh i completely get and understand dunkeys criticism and i think theyre a problem for the game too i still like the game though good review did he even play the game ahhhh yess random encounters turn based combat are my favorite thing ever this game is worse than fucking bubsy 3d but seriously ocotopath traveler is a snooze fest not that it matters and i get where youre coming from but ihonestly really enjoyed and am currently enjoying this game thats a real shame i was honestly looking forward to this i mean i dont mind turn based combat or random encounters but to hear that the story isnt too good and that the characters dont really interact with one another is a terrible to hear i get your criticisms and they are valid to a point except the one about the writing to me it varies from no no to good but its subjective but more often than not its the genre not so much this specific game that said personally i love the game and i think its not exactly fair to criticize without saying something about the artstyle and music which are very good and without at least acknowledging that the game tries to do something a bit deeper tactically speaking with its combat ofc u are more than allowed to not like it but honestly the video seems unfair to me for comedy purposes exagerated i get it but u were far more fair with xenoblade 2 another game i liked but far more flawed than this one than this game also except the ophilia part not so funny for that matter honestly btw didnt downvote this cause i still consider this video a valid point for discussion sweet im subscribed have the gay ass bell tapped i dont get a notification it doesnt show up in my sub feed either what a joke wow dunkey made a review about a jrpg and he doesnt like it so what i love the video though made me laugh and i mean you arent wrong it has its flaws but games like these require patience and time but dont expect dunkey to have either really looks really underwhelming coming from the team that made bravely default your excellency was half expecting ophelia to say psycho mantis some of the info is just wrong here dunkey first your characters do interact its just not required its up to you if you want to have them speak with each other duringafter the quests or not characters will throw in their 002 regarding other characters choices second your excellency is what you call royalty or your highness whatever you wouldnt call them by name finally the part you show on fighting is you being purposefully ignorant for the sake of the video as the game explains to you what weaknesses are and you chose to hit the enemy withnot its weakness when your character quite literally has a weapon for its weakness i dont know what you were doing when you reviewed this one but it wasnt playing the game thats for sure why are game journo bugs jerking this game off guess ill never understand ill just stick to guild wars 2 lmao people cant take an opinion its not a review if it was a review then it would say dunkview this channel is a comedic video game channel not some highly expertise review channel i was thinking the same thing during ophilias intro like holy smokes does she say that shit alot im surprised there was not hannat quotes becauseth she talketh liketh thoust never play that game before but i agree what dunkey says if its not fun why bother dunkey you should play shin megami tensei 3 id love to see you reviewing it also play it on hard mode normals for weenies i think this is the only negative review i have seen for octopath traveler and i trust it i hate turnbased combat it puts me to sleep 71k dislike yall reaching this shit hilarious play rpgs often dunkey whats the outro song you da best tho i feel bad with myself this is the first video of dunkey i dislike theres some worthwhile criticism here but some of it is cherry picked and much of it is genrehate taking a bad example of the voice over and editing it to be more annoyingly repetitive than it is in game is playing dirty and i dont appreciate that this can give players on the fence a false impression of the overall quality as for the turn based combat and random battles its not something everyone will love but is admittedly a staple of the genre i for one find that the boostbreak system is what makes octopath play so nicely compared to other jrpgs which i am in general not a fan of criticizing an entire genre is one thing but it doesnt give a wellbalanced impression of octopath as an experience that others can gauge i didnt come to dunky for a profound review though its just a shame that the video couldnt be funny in lieu of a reasonable critique maybe its just because of how i approached the game but i actually enjoyed the start to a few characters journeys though some being a lot better than others a lot of how the party interacted in small skits and conversations made it feel like i was playing a dd campaign of sorts but i cant lie the random encounters grow increasingly frustrating towards the later parts of the game even after defeating bosses and almost wiping to a trash mob every jrpg from now on should just do what bravely default does and let you turn off encounters or at least have fast forwardauto battle i wonder if dunkey loves or hates games like fire emblem or valkyria chronicles amazing world of gumballs rpg game looked better play it in japanese audiodubs suck it might enhance what little is there play beast quest some valid points others are kind of conflated the random battles can be turned down significantly very early on if they really bother you so much and that low lvl fight again kind of misses the point you had awful gear on and didnt break them so of course it took awhile graphics are fantastic music is great valid points going to the couple bland characters like the knight and cleric and the game feeling like you go through a tutorial 8 times just so you can see their intro story definitely not a complete skip like you make it out to be though i learned to grind in the first final fantasy and dragon warrior games as a child if it isnt obscenely ridiculous i can handle the grind i draw the line at needing to grind 1000 fights between each boss but i have played agarest generations of war and if you thought octopath was bad you havent played anything agarest i have put 33 hours in and only cleared 1 out of 5 generations and gotten 9 out of 50 achievements there are even worse grinds than that ive played rpgmaker games made by sadists another smash hit your excellency oof that xenoblade 2 roast i like the video and the explanation but to add to your rant the only interaction between new characters and the ones you have which can be missed if you have a switch and dont see the tiny plus sign in the top right corner is only accessible after completing one of their chapters different review atleast but why didnt my man dunkeys talk about its artstyle i heard somewhere that finley reads all his comments so find this dipshit since the game is on top of the game sales charts its probably good but i get your opinion play mother 3 yeah i wasnt expecting it to be very good youre wrong on this one thank goodness i thought i was the only one realise now how much of a vaccuum reddit is i chose ophilia first and couldnt make it past the intro of the demo oh no dunkey doesnt agree with me reeeeeeeeeee some of yall really need to step back and think about why youre having such negative reactions to this video agree with him or not a lot of the arguments i see in the comments here aimed to discredit his arguments are baseless and silly if you want to refute this video dont be so reactionary come back with a well thought out argument or just say well i like it anyway and move on with your life video game bunkey i was having a really tough day and then i watched your bideo and it was better as much as i know you hate jrpgs why playing ot then its a great game anyway thank you for sharing your opinion i always like to see the game from different perspective best part of the video was the music at the end literally all the people siding with dunkey on this terrible review saying things like youre right this game is shit wouldnt even think to make these comments had he just praised it smh damn sheep mmmm good review but am gonna still play it because i dont mind all of the things that you hated in this game actually i love grinding and leveling my character i honestly thought this game was some splattoon dlc the first time i heard the name i dont understand why people play a game genre they dislike for 50 hours to see a story about a guy wanting to destroy the world im not gonna lie i lost any interest i had in this game when i realised it had nothing to do with octopi once again donsly reviews a game badly because its slow paced i mean it was so obvious dunkey would hate this game no matter how good it was did he just dislike all jrpg because of random encounters did he live in 1950s i guess there are things i like about this game but the candor around this game feels like a massive circle jerking off session to me not saying that dunkeys criticism was very fair i could see that it wasnt but he still had some legit points but fans dont seem to be willing to admit anything is wrong with the game when it obviously isnt perfect its seems like a good jrpg but its definitely no where near chrono triggers level i think part of the reason might be the games 60 price tag when people sink that much money into a game when the pricetag is kinda questionable maybe they want to see it as an amazing game with no major flaws so they wont have buyers remorse over it im not sure though maybe thats just a crazy thought haha anyways kotaku to me actually has a more fair review of the game that points out both its strengths and weaknesses without bias dunko your excellency i am very sorry but i have to disagree with your opinion in this case you see my reason why is because this is a dumbass opinion and youre dumb for having it dunkey why are you reviewing something thats not knack 3 at all baebyyy i wish i had money but you overlooked the one thing that makes this game greater than any other game the starting letter of each characters name spells out octopath o lberic c yrus t ressa o phelia p rimrose a lfyn t herion h aanit thats your opinion and its ok i have also had wrong opinions before what game is that at 28 i wanna play it i just got a boss baby ad i just smh ign literally said the opposite you forgot to put dunkview into the title dunkey im surprised that you are the only person not impressed by the game i guess it means people like different things this is the exact kind of review im looking for thank you drankman and my friend recomended this to me i feel offended why do u keep playin jrpgs if you hate em so much dunkinald yknow you didnt like this game you should try bookworm adventures deluxe thats a good game 7k people are a little pissed dunk but not me though great vid your excellency random encounters were the only reason i couldnt finish undertale tbh i would have to disagree on some points however i can see your side of view and respect your opinion i have completed all the chapter 1 missions and are currently on the chapter 2 missions and im enjoying it so far but i completely understand and respect your viewpoint of the game so you are saying the game is perfect 1010 and this is why i dont take dunkeys reviews seriously i think the problem is that now that dunkeys mixing his usual jokey videos with more serious reviews people are having a hard time keeping track of which is which which i have to wonder if he predicted and made that part of the joke is he getting too meta with us anyway its a jrpg everyone knows he doesnt like em some of his points arent totally invalid but he just wasnt the intended audience for this so probably best not to think too much about this can you play detroit become human hmmm since its not turn based combat in and of itself that turns you off but rather the execution dunkey have you ever given thought to checking out divinity original sin 2 this review feels like a 1 out of 5 dunko points but the ending statement there are promising elements somewhere in this game but i dont think its worth waiting through a sea of monotonous grinding to find them feels like a 25 or 35 what was positive that you thought you saw this is so gay can we hit children this is why i love you dunkey you stand by your opinions and make good reviews without making them overly long while i may not agree with every review you have thats fine because i know itll be consistent and of a high quality differing opinions are awesome especially when you can trust the reviewer its actually quite pathetic watching all these dunkey fanboys defending this video filled with bias and misinformation this video was just a bad lazy and unfunny attempt to cash in on the popularity of this games release i enjoyed almost every dunkey video up to this point that doesnt mean i wont call him out when i see whack opinions like this where he bash the game solely for being a genre he doesnt even like and purposely tries to make the game look bad with terrible and ignorant gameplay footage that clearly demonstrate that he doesnt even know how to play the game so heres to the first downvote ive ever given a dunkey video a shame that dislike bar isnt bigger just goes to show how many mindless drones are eating his shit up without thinking for themselves a guy who hates jrpgs didnt like a jrpg shocker oh the game is finally out the only game i want in switch glad someone isnt afraid to pinch off the circlejerk so you dont like jrpgs but you review one your excellency i actually dont mind the whole 8 difference stories thing what no score the kights voice is is that sung won prozd it looks pretty tho fucking thank you dunkey i hear this game get so so much praise and i watch the commercial and realize that i already played this game when i had my first gameboy advance and 8 cartridges of the same genergic ass rpg and the way you explained why turn based combat is such a waste of time sums up my resentment for it so perfectly that even though this video isnt really funny i give it my game of the yeartm ps i hope you read this because it is my first comment to my favorite youtuber and i think you are full of shit when you say you read these even after watching the video about youtube comments i realized that the bookworm guy is obviously just your dad leaving comments for you how can i get this game at least the graphics were interesting at least the soundtrack is bumpin dunkey once said in his game critics video you dont actually have to look eye to eye in the reviewer so many blue pilled weebertarian cucks in this comment section black pill all weebs on the absolute state of modern anime and jrpgs praise god king dunkey and his beautiful destruction of the modern gaming industry ign is fake news people praise the combat system of this game but it sounds like its just like bravely default if so then i think ill pass while bds combat was novel at first it just didnt last with me i think it got kind of monotonous to fight enemies because it got too easy when you got the method down and learned how to take advantage of the charge system its still good just nothing amazing to me personally i should play chrono trigger again i agree with dunkey on most of his points even more than the average viewer i cant play most rpgs because i get bored of the story and gameplay all the weebs jumping in to defend it and still none of them have the guts to try and justify the shitty writing or dialogue i wish this game was called octopus traveler and then you are an octopus fish swimming in the garden of life if i hear your excellency one more time im gonna go buy octopath traveller and find the squid easter egg see you say you hate jrpgs but in your videos you constantly make reference to and use music from all those great jrpgs of the 90s if you are a former jrpg fan who was burned by garbage nonsense i get that im in the same boat i was out of the genre at ffx and havent been back since i regretted playing bravely default for example and thought xc2 more interesting from a design perspective than from a story or gameplay perspective thing is those old games like ffvi arent terribly wellwritten either and at first ffvi is a riff on star wars plotwise chrono trigger is the best game of that generation by a landslide and one of the few that stands up today if you are someone who pines for good oldstyle games you could do worse than octopath traveler and you cant do much better yes even storywise dig in a bit like ffvi this story is in for a long haul and it does interconnect and its text dumps are rewarding to read and immerse yourself in dozens of npcs great video your excellency your excellency its a dream your excellency this is outrage how dare you insult octopath your excellency its actually funny god dammit you disappoint me dunkey when did you turn into such a shill the first video you put out in a while is nothing more than a hapless grab for views going against the grain most of your complaints lie with turn based jrpg mechanics as a genre but to go as low and to be as desperate as to say the characters are boring olbric isnt the best character story but its good its the fact it isnt a tale of revenge but one of finding a way to forgive and understand that makes it unique no its not a game about a great evil force its a refreshing look at individual characters lives you took the two easiest characters to pick on made a critique only around them and rolled with it you changed dunkey i expected more from you of all youtubers dont let this shit continue in the future if you have true complaints voice them dont fault only parts of a game and shit on it as a whole i dont like jrpgs but this looks like a jrpg and i dont want to play it is dunkey loosing his touch video was neither funny or insightful come on now man who hates jrpgs hates a jrpg shocker huh i wasnt expecting a proper review like this especially a negative one i played the demo and found the opening chapter i played the alchemist dude bland cliche and overlong i can imagine people getting into the flow of the game but it feels so worn out and the only jrpgs ive managed to subject myself to all the way through the end are tales games beat symphonia and zestiria boy was that one bland almost done vesperia played 10hrs of berseria before deciding to go back and continue my 30hr file in vesperia which ive heard have massively cliche stories and characters how did they manage to screw the writing up so early the dialogue sucks because this game was basically put into google translate and ended up being localized poorly the japanese version is less annoying personally i really enjoy the game but im see where he is coming from at parts im one of those people that doesnt get bothered with random encounters and a bit of grinding i also dont mind the characters and the story i like the game overall and its going to keep me days to finish this game probably its not perfect but its a game i honestly enjoy i respect your opinion dunk you would have liked it if it was bookwork adventure just saying the entire review i was distracted by how incredible this games art style is a shame such a waste its a shame because the art was beautiful in that game everyone has their preference i guess i would like to just mention that the characters actually do interact but only as little heart to heart style events after everyones first chapter and the job system does help to diversify the combat but once again you only unlock that after everyones first chapter not a bad video but maybe play it a bit more before acting like you played the whole game breath of fire 3 ahh love the usage of one winged angel everyone complaining about this video just need to watch the game critics video i disagree with your opinions on turnbased combat and random encounters remember when dunky would do funny titles reggie has failed us again when you see the graphics and think its gonna be pretty good and then you see every other part of the game why you play jrpg when you know you hate it even though hes complaining about the flaws in this game his video actually makes me want to play it in shadow hearts 2 covenant you must ascend a 100 story tower during the man festival where you fight men who balance curry on their heads in order to win a mask that powers up your wrestling vampire cool game indeed your excellency youre that ninja your excellency you should review anime please second time i sort of disagree with dunkey first was with batman arkham city ive never hated rina chans voice more maybe if you learned to play correctly the battles would be faster or if you liked oldschool jrpgs in general guy that doesnt like turnbased jrpgs doesnt like this turnbased jrpg more news at 11 to those critcising him for dumping on this game heres how it is 1 just because awful writing and voice acting are part of the genre doesnt mean they get a pass if anything it highlights how embarassing it is that these games refuse to improve 2 hes explaining why he doesnt like the genre think about it like this dunkey how come you dont like jrpgs youre probably not playing the right ones dunkey wow how come youre playing jrpgs just to mock them hes electing to explain his reasoning if he hated shadow of war a game i personally thought was great id want to know why i hope you dont make any other videos this poorly parts of this are simply not true or nit pick hard not even funny somehow im not surprised that a game meant to celebrate everything dunko hates in a jrpg isnt to his taste p i think its interesting that dunkey will at least take the time to review a game maybe not even one getting a ton of attention and say i dont like this real glad i picked up persona 5 instead the world is actually pretty engrossing with tons to do and replacing random encounters with a stealth game is a welcome change plus if i run into several weak enemies i can just knock them all down with one move and extort them for money the combat is quick and just a little side thing enxt to exploring interesting dungeons yeah didnt really understand why this game was getting so much praise i played the demo and almost blew my brains out glad to see were on the same page dunkopath i completely agree with this video and i actually like the game you bring a lot of valid points the only thing i can say is i do find the combat fun with certain characters like alfyn who bring good mechanics like making potions that heals your team or do damage to foes but the fights are long did a boss fight for around 30 min cause i was underleveled im honestly surprised you gave then game a try just because in the past you said you didnt like turn based combat and random encounters glad you did though been awhile since ive seen a decent game get a negative review with fair points great video dunko i legitimately have no clue why people were so excited for octotrash the demo they revealed ages ago showed just how fucking terrible the game is the only redemption would be the combat and even thats shit having to put up with the god awful graphics doesnt help its some trash uninspired art style and they just shoved 50 shaders over it so you go blind as you play and i guess that was their hope so you wouldnt be able to tell it looks like garbage none of the characters are interesting or written well the strippers story makes 0 sense the stripper chick goes to a town because apparently one of the dudes who killed her parents goes to the strip club there so she does what any intelligent girl would do and becomes a sex pet dancer slave for like 15 years and gets raped by the towns pimp waiting for some dude to show up in a bar and once he does she nearly gets killed because of course her sex master pimp wont just let her leave dumbest story ever typically i agree with dunkey but not this time i adore this game it has the best combat system ive ever played in a turn based jrpg and i love its characters and their stories this isnt an attack on dunkey however were all allowed our own opinion and im not a child who stops watching a favorite youtuber because they have a different opinion than me on one game so this game is basically dragon quest 4 mixed with some newer elements it is bad for me to say i love this game hey fallout elder scrolls random encounters are pretty cool and interesting the turnbased jrpg isnt everybodys cup of tea and thats fine what a weird sequel to octodad nice to know i wasnt the only one who thought the story telling and structurewasnt good i was hearing way too much praise but hey ff6 nostalgia overpowers it all right this video was shit oh cmon this is freaking excellency the amount of anime pfps downvoting this video is hilarious i dont fucking care what you say this game and its gameplay is great i have to be honest dunko this game is no earthworm adventure deluxe who made this bumbler interactive clearly jrpgs aint your thing why even bother trying with this one its literally catering exclusively to jrpg fans how did you expect to even enjoy it if you hate random encounters and turn based combat youre dumb sometimes dunkey this game lacks excellency i give octodick 010 because the title is very misleading there is in fact no tentacle hentai im jrpg fan but i dont play this game solely because i dont like the battle animation i know they trying to bring nostalgia but i hope they have better animation has he ever said anything about the evil within id love to see that v i knew it so he cant not like a game i see good to know at least its a pretty game to look at meanwhile im enjoying the 19952008 classic shiren the wanderer an rpg with seamless and thoughtful combat where grinding makes you starve to death wait thats it mindless story telling random encounters and it being a turn based jrpg but dunkey thats like every other jrpg out there wait is that the point you were making wow there are a lot of salty fans of this shitty game downvoting this video turn based annie may thats my personal hell game was trash ever since i played the demo really wasnt that interesting at all edit holy fuck the amount of diehard weebs attacking dunkey is making me laugh so hard i disagree about the criticism toward the combat the best part of the game imo otherwise dunkey nailed it an overrated game but not terrible it just needed better writers and direction it seems you have angered the horde your excellency bookwarm adventures like 2 minutes into the demo i realized the game was 1000x better without the voice acting turn that shit off in the settings right away other than that game is good if you dont like jrpgs dont review em compares persona 5 to pokmon smt 1 came out first this game should be 20 i really like the game but dunkey makes some valid points good video is that dios voice actor i hear tbh one of my favorite channels actually had me sold on this game based on their playthrough of the demo and i really appreciate this take on it it still interests me but im definitely going to wait on it for a while to see if its really worth it because youve highlighted some things about it that i also really dislike in rpgtypes all jokes aside thanks for an alwayshonest review i typically enjoy your vids dunk but this is scraping the bottom of the barrel to find problems with a game thats honestly not that bad the game as a whole is enjoyable yeah ill admit switching between the characters in the way you do is a bit eh i started with therion and the entire time i kept thinking why am i going around gathering these people im a loner and would just do what i need to by myself but even still i cant put this game down because i want to finish it i want to see how these characters grow some of your criticisms were valid but the majority are really just minimal non issues that dont impact the game as a whole thanks for the vidya your dunkellency i disagree with every one of your points but thats okay the games not for you i guess you could say the comment section got chrono triggered its a shame because the style seems cool when the title of the video is just the games name you know dunkey is serious one of the worst comment sections i have ever seen the little kick at xenoblade 2 hurt yeah it went a little hard on anime tropes for whatever reason especially compared to the first game but its still easily the best game on the switch not counting mario terrible uninspired played out five outta five dunkey i need the dunkeyscore for a complete dunkview this must be the most controversial dunkey video in history this games story is so rough but i like the game play 3 its like a slower paced bravely game i think the bravely series is a little too fast and comical so this is a good change of pace boom dunkmaster nails why jrpgs suck dunkey the problem here is your perception of fun you are simply a gamer who doesnt like to think when gaming and thats alright however bashing on a genre you dont get along with is not frankly simply put because you dont get it and it actually hurts these developers whose target audience was not you you seem to dislike and bash on pretty much any strategyrpgmacromanagement game out there unless like you said provides some unique feature that makes simpler its like saying chess sucks because it requires you to sit around for hours at a time looking at static wood pieces well thats the point i mean that part at the end you can kinda just apply to nearly all traditional jrpgs really am i the only one who watches every dunk vid twice what he said about the story was spot on the story is unfortunately the weakest element in the game whats the point of having all these characters if they dont interact with each other and are basically nonexistent in each story however everything else he said is very biased and incorrect he couldve beaten that snail in 2s if he properly geared his team at that level sure its still slower than shooting a grunt but thats what jrpgs are it makes no sense for him to criticize a turn based jrpg for being turn based and a jrpg its like if i dislike forza for having driving and not having golf dunkey i love you man but you went full on bugsy when you made this the cringe my god im not sure you understood the nuance of octodad traveler clearly your didnt notice that while the family is human the father is a squid but ever since you picked warigi instead of larwig for mario tennis ive became yous too youre incompetence its fine if you dislike the game but how you cherrypicked the flaws in this game and purposely avoided the positive points of the game makes this is pretty terrible review in all honesty and yes this is a review a dunkview to be more specific the tags literally says dunkview not gonna lie this was honestly one of your worst reviews yet however im looking forward to more though regardless click read more for my editorial note edit my bad that i wasnt clear on my purpose of making this comment so i want to quickly clarify my reasoning of commenting this dunkey is pretty biased in his negative dunkviews often which i often dont like even bad journalists in gaming at least tries to go out of their way to mention something positive dunkey will very often fail to do this and he will go out of his way to cherry pick every single negative detail that he can while purposely avoiding any positive statements about this game this game is famous fo i agree with dunkey on a lot of points and im glad someone else thinks this dunkey probably left out story elements to avoid spoiling people who do want to play the game so ill give an example of a lack of character interaction pissing me off spoilers for primroses first chapter below when i got to primrose i had a full party with cyrus tressa ophilia and olberic i ditched tressa to take on primrose headed through the minidungeon and got to her boss fat balding hentai man which initiated a cutscene fat balding hentai man stabbed primroses friend whose name was yukata or something and threw her at primroses feet to bleed out in the sand ophilia apparently sat offscreen fingering her lantern while this was happening because she didnt lift a goddamned finger to help and whatshername died now this is a common trope in rpgs and games in general that have healing items and spells cutscene damage is unforgiving and almost always lethal but you know what would for people complaining about his opinion on story telling if you think about it objectively it really isnt that good the story of the single characters are ok but man let me tell you they had 8 different characters and not a single story intertwine with each other they had such a big opportunity to make it way more interesting you have a priest and a thief and obvsiouly the priest isnt about killing stuff but the thief is and you can take them both on the thief mission where you have to sneak in a mansion and kill stuff and the priest doesnt say a single word about it theres no character dialogue between them also some quests seem more urgent than others in terms of storytelling but you can just make them sit in the bar while you travel as 4 other characters thats just stupid there should be a reason to prefer one quest of the other i dont know it just seems so bland i feel like everyone in this comment section forgot to watch dunkeys video on video game reviews very pretty graphics do a reaction of the new titans trailer im a fan of jrpgs but even i cant say i enjoy octopath traveler while i do find the combat engaging the characters are just the most bland cutouts i found primrose to be the most interesting but her story wasnt enough to counteract how boring the rest of the characters are graphics are absolutely gorgeous though beyond that this game is pretty trash i dont like it therefore it sucks everyone has different tastes ok its not the end of the world if dunkey disagrees with you were not clones and for the record i despise turn base combat and i hate gta 5 which dunkey likes still his videos are a mastahpiece thank fucking god i bought this game and was struggling to understand why people are getting their minds blown left and right dunkeys right though and i knew it from the start this games story is so painfully generic i dont agree with dunkeys review for this game and thats ok i totally respect the criticism on the disjointed storylines but there are so many other amazing elements to the game that werent mentioned such as the tiltshift graphics job system and the storyline later game its seriously a very decent rpg not sure why you chose to play this game honestly you knew you werent going to like it and did a kinda halfassed review i dont like these games either but cmon man get yoself together i knew this game was a jrpg i knew dunkey doesnt like jrpgs i had a feeling dunkey wouldnt like this game and i was right i think i got this game free who ever invented random encounters should be thrown into a pit of spikes and shot with a bazooka lol gotta love that people dont understand that dunkey unequipped all his items and party memeber during the snail fight for exagguration not to mention comparing it to something as inconsiquential as a grunt the point it that random fights are unavoidable which is dumb especially since even when oneshotting them they take too much time it wasnt malitious it wasnt ignorant it was hyperbole i had a dream martin luther king jr your excellency random encounters and turnbased combat were in undertale and you loved that game i dont even know what im trying to prove im just gonna play radiant historia while i wait for shin megami tensei 5 ironically enough now i am interested in this game i heard theyre making knack 3 into a jrpg this video is the only video of dunkeys that i will watch once suck my excellency i agree ophila is the most annoying didnt you make a whole video explaining how reviewers have their own taste in games including you so your audience should know what to expect of yours and others reviews dunkey they had a demo they are very upfront with what this game is i dont even like it either but why did you play it why do you do this to yourself this is what happens when square doesnt know what made their rpg actually good watch as dunky shits all over your favorite videogame this feelingis this how assassins creed fans felt xd anyways i still love you dunkey and i know that we do not agree on things when it comes to jrpgs look at all that butthurt i just dont think that you like these types of rpgs dunk great vid though you guys might be upset that dunkey says this game isnt good but dont you remember in his game critics video how he says one of his faults is how he has zero fucking patience dunkey said that he doesnt like turn based combat or lengthy rpgs from what i can understand about that segment of that video octopath traveler just isnt the type of game dunkey would like that doesnt make it a bad game it just doesnt appeal to him personally like i dont like the song bohemian rhapsody that doesnt make it a bad song it just doesnt fit my tastes to each his own this video couldnt make it to 5 minutes because there are not enough things wrong with it to make one its a good game and i dont like it so its bad is a bad logic thank you your excellency for posting a lot lately silly donkey opinions are for humans people are salty over this but its accurate octopath doesnt do anything remotely new with this formula and it barely has any reason to exist let alone to justify a 60 price tag there are great jrpgs out there but its not one of them and its not close okay honestly here are a lot of the problems i have with this video sure youre mostly a comedic persona and actually make good videos but i just have to disagree with literally all of this you say the game isnt fun and has little to no character conversation when there actually is after chapter 2 and the characters will begin to actually talk to each other in most unique ways which means you not only halfassed the review but you also never bothered to continue after chapter 2 you say that turn based combat and random encounters were the main flaws you had and last time i checked those were in every jrpg which is the genre this game actually is apart of so theres a major flaw there you say theres cringe worthy ps2 era dialogue in the game while showing a scene from final fantasy x made to be comedic which isnt what the full game is at all and therefore counteracts your point automatically for your arguments about dialogue in this game you show only one scene o why would you review a turn based jrpg if you know you dont like turn based jrpgs you got mad at it for basically being a smooth interpretation of everything the genre encompasses love your videos but this one was obviously very biased game looks good for what its supposed to be its not pokemon its pokmon dunkey lots of butthurt weebs today maybe my memory is failing me but i remember bookworm adventures deluxe very differently yup thats why its sold out for 2 weeks now such a crap game shit i didnt even know this game is such beautiful now i gotta play it no matter what yeah i could never quite get on the octopath hype train dunkey make a stardew valley review please senpai i mean your excellency i loved the video willingly play a jrpg in english complain about the dialogue come on dunkey youre better than that i stopped watching dunkey when he said bubsy 3d wss bad tldr dunkey continues to despise jrpgs nothing to see here kids man thats disappointing jrpgs really need to step up their game dammit reggie how could you this yea but jrpgs without random encounters are worse so its good you obviously didnt play the game very much jason slow start yes but later on every battle is strategic also you dont need to grind at all to beat bosses just be good at the game and smart also the characters do interact with each other after chapter 1 also you can lower the random encounter rate which makes me only find like 3 or 4 fights in a whole dungeon the game is more than just the first chapter bookworm review next please pokmon isnt really that bad with the encounters the entire objective of the game is to find and capture different pokmon and if you dont feel like it you can just use repels your excelency should you really be reviewing this game if you arent a big fan of turn based combat and random battles throughout this review ive just gotten this feeling that you arent a big fan of jrpgs in general and thats fine but you shouldnt be reviewing the games if you have this bias against them at least it seems like a bias considering a lot of jrpgs have turn based combat and this cringey ps2 era anime writing that youre talking about also persona 5 and ni no kunis dialogue is not cringey i just hold b to skip cutscenes and flee those lvl 1 snails cuts out a lot of tedium at the end of the day i just play jrpgs to watch bigger and bigger numbers fly across the screen a great video once again your excellency i expected a video exactly like this from dunkey sorry for those jrpg fans out there i liked this game a lot tho it honestly looks like bravely default but not as thought out fun fact chrono trigger sucks damn first video ive disliked in awhile we all have our own opinions honestly the only thing i really agree with is how annoying it is to have to play through a prologue for each character too bad its not bookworm adventures deluxe but your excellency this is not bookworm adventures deluxe sooooo are you saying you like this game your excellency i love dunk but ive learned not judge games based on his reviews especially jrpgs its like listening to someone who doesnt like pizza rate a pizza if they say wow this pizza is incredible then its safe to say thats probably a pretty damn good pizza if they say ugh this pizza is terrible it has cheese and sauce and pepperoni and its made on dough then its probably a good idea do try the pizza for yourself first im glad someone very succinctly put together for me why i dislike jrpgs so much its something ive struggled to ascertain myself so hearing someone else put it together is comforting gonna have to hit you with the hard disagree shifting storylines and shifting perspectives are a very common thing in story writing the reason why it works is because the story is told in chapters uust as octopath is told however thr good thing about octopath is that you can play anyones story whenever you want to so as such you dont have to have shifting perspectives you can just take it one at a time however you need to play all the storylines to see how everything ties together this much id a given as for the gameplay whilst the random encounters arent necessarily thought provoking theyre necessary in order to provide proper levelling for the player to feel as though theyre growing with the pace of the game making encounters avoidable means that it becomes exceedingly easy to fall behind and feel especially underpowered and lose a lot of momentum but the bosses in my opinion are very well made aside from one boss that makes the whole fight spam a to win a dunkey with 6k dislikes is that a joke this is why we cant get real opinions and give real criticism anymore because once its thrown out there a sea of fanboys are there to shit on it disgusting so many salty weebs in the comments oh the first thing i did when playing this game was turn the voices off because i usually read faster than they can speak idk dude i fucking love this game iii enjoyed it though i was thinking about buying this game tried the demo got bored bought fredric 2 instead turn the subtitles on and whenever he speaks the subtitles make dunkey become the legendary octodunk lmao i thought the outro would be more dunkeylency i hate pixel graphics and anime gaymes thx dunk wont be buying this shit game turns out praising a shit game from a genre you love has way more comedic effect than shitting on a good game from a genre you dont see dictionary for opinion subjective this aint it chief i mean it cant be any worse than a pokemon game right why so bully for real though you make a lot of valid points but im still enjoying this game but tressa is the worst most boring ass character ever of all time i almost bought this yesterday so glad i saw this lmao dunkey this isnt bookworm adventure deluxe wow never thought id see the day id disagree with and not enjoy a dunkey video this is not an actual review its not dunkview hes just hating on the game because its a jrpg guys its just a haha funny if u like the video ok if not ok why so butt hurt lol i played this game for 3 hours please dunk weve had enough of this peasantry drivel we need more knack 3 news videos your excellency how about daffy duck meets batman i just want to know if the characters interact for around half the game or if every character does their own story regardless of whos in the party dunkey more like i guess i can understand this doonkey my favorite rpgs generally have more interaction within the battle so most dont really hit home with me now i havent even played this game so i personally cant really say anything but like holy shit this has to have the most constructive and fair criticism ive seen in a comment section in a long fucking time and stunky i think this video has to be a joke i knew something was off when you were doing 110 damage to a level 1 enemy which i assume is for the exaggeration of how long the combat takes from what ive seen this is complete misinformation 8 anime characters go on an adventure that took up waaaaaaaaay too much time during the nintendo directs i knew this game was going to be terrible from the first moment i saw it now that i know dunkey supreme overlord of everything shares the same viewpoint i can make my view public without condemnation remember when dunkey was entertaining dunkey thank you for finally putting into words what ive felt about these kinds of games all along last really good one of this type i played was legend of dragoon still waiting on that rebootsequel epic game but when are we seeing bookworm adventures deluxe your dunkness i fucking love this game and i knew that dunkey is going to hate octopath traveler its just weird that he called the turn based combat in octopath traveler mindless when its the most engaging combat style i ever played edit i meant turnbased combat in a jrpg so relax people dunkey did you never play saga frontier oh man you need to look back dunkey has never cared for turned based rpgs and neither have i i did enjoy how he summarized the game i know jrpgs not really dunkeys cup of tea but since he noted that he actually likes persona 5 i would love to see a video from him on it i agree with every point in the video i thought i was the only one some of yall actually expected a reliable review from dunkey when its about a genre he made clear he doesnt like it sucks seeing all these youtubers bash this game i truthfully enjoyed it but i guess its controversial even though i kinda like the game i have to agree i enjoyed the demo and was sure the full game would be dope but unfortunately it doesnt really open up to anything much bigger and all characters lack connection the good part of the writing is surprisingly fewer than i thought its like they worked hard for the first few hours of some characters but then got lazy for the rest feels more like a bunch of minigames packed together rather than a full blown 60 game but hey i might be wrong gotta keep going to see the full picture i guess but so far thats how i feel about it you dont like jrpgs anyways so your opinion is invalid my friend welp to each their own i love this game is but your excellency the new yes daddy when you were cracking jokes about ps2 era games you showed all my favorite games then you said the worst thing to come out of gaming was random encounters and turn based fighting and that was enough to sell me on buying this game that is everything i am looking for in a game maybe not every game is for everyone man this looks fantastic to me theres plenty of examples of bad writing to be found in this game for sure using and cutting out a repeated honorific is not one of them what was the ff song i like how people are upset about dunkey exaggerating how bad this game is but they loved it when it was metal gear survive thank you for bringing me back to earth on this one i had almost succumbed to the hype around it the earth is round dunkey doesnt like run of the mill jrpgs i dont know why anyone is debating or suprised about anything here he says generic uninteresing characters when nathan drake exists took bad you are missing out on that bookworm adventure delux provides more adventure than this game yeah a jrpg with a bad storywriting is just a drag to play and that is one of the worst ive experienced although still much better writing than persona 5 so it was kinda hard to get through it especially since there wasnt anything crazy unique about the game a jrpg like disgaea for instance is never boring even though there is massive amounts of grinding because of incredibly humorous writing and in battle you have so many options at your disposal from a certain character that turns into a bomb when you throw them to stacking all your units on top of each other and attacking enemies with your human tower then you have the persona series which has a unique twist with the whole high school parts this adds a nice break from the fighting as well as an interesting way to shape the plot especially in persona 3 and 4 where the writing is impeccable and even to an extent in persona 5 which has a solid story but really falls flat due to the complete lack of subtlety in the writ its because nintendo is trash i still want bookworm adventures deluxe on this channel just dunkeys usual and extremely biased hatred of turnbased rpgs nothing special to see here thank your excellency bbbut the art style first time watching one of your vids based on the reaction of a friend who loves your vids and i see in the comments you apparently dont like jrpgs and as ou can see i have a p5 avatar so i guess im a jrpg fan but regardless of all things considered thoughts on an rpg or not i think this is a poor video regardless of bias to a style of game rpgs cup of tea or not i cant tell much about the game from the way you speak of it i think a good vid is one that even while youre not passionate about the subject that there is at least an air of understanding or concise thought but all i hear is pointless drivel like i feel like i know less about the game than i already did its very poor execution of your script that i dont get why my friend is a fan and if this is parody it is not a good one at all cause i didnt find a single joke all you said bad about this game are only random encounters and turn based which obv what you should expect from this type of rpg so as an jrpg lover i would def give this a try it looks cool thanks anyway for introducing this game whoever said the jrpg community is taking this well is illiterate because they are all crying over this review deliberately misleading you just dont like the genre why review a game you dont like i still love you but proceeds to complain about what he does every video trying to say hes just being unfair to this game yea no i was considering this game but if the fans are these types of people id rather have a drain cleaner enema dunkey might not be giving it a nice review but you shouldnt expect one for jrpgs from him the fact it makes you write the types of comments you do is gonna be the reason he quits one of these days and if that ever does happen i hope every single one of you whiny ass losers feel abysmal i love your content dunkers you can be criticized but the criticism shouldnt be your opinion isnt mine vocal minority can suck my toes your excellency i wanted you to play bookworm adventures deluxe so good to finally hear someone complain about the truly awful story lines and dialogue in these jrpgs cant stand that shit i have no strong opinion either way i am however enjoying a nice burger your exellency never thought id see the day when ign gives a better review than dunkey dear everyone this is satire he called dialogue bad when he skipped through it he said reggie blew it when square enix made the game stop whining at least 75 of this amm thoughts video is wrong you clearly didnt even play 1 chapter of any character before making this video which is fair enough if you didnt like it from the start ill be giving this game a shot because ive always liked jrpg games i liked this game better when it was called romancing saga and even more so when it was called live a live so dunkey say for sake of example i was making an rpg would random encounters be okay if i limited them to dungeons and minidungeons and that literally zero grinding is required to beat the game take this review with a grain of salt as he has already voiced his dislike of jrpgs before i think this just doesnt suit his tastes reggy tried his best man cmon i disagree with you on this one i really like this game and haveing a blast youre also wrong about one thing characters can interact with eachother in your party after certin part of the story a prompt in the top right will have traveler banter between the character whoes story your playing and other members of your group dunkey i hope this comment finds you well i am writing to request that you make a video about divinity original sin 2 i believe its one of the greatest games in a long time and deserves the attention but what do i know im just a dvd copy of shark tale i mean i thought it was fun 3 dunked please this video was awful seriously are a sale out now come on i wait three month for this worst video ever even if its a review which is debatable like if you agree even if ill still be picking it up since i enjoy games like this ur still a great and consistent reviewer thank you but your excellency whats your overall score for this game people act like they expected him to enjoy the game guys hes said he doesnt like turn based rpgs multiple times your royal dunkeyness sorry i dont agree with your opinion i feel that you cherry picked problems and thats all you didnt touch upon anything else it almost feels like this video was incomplete like you accidentally released it before properly editing and adding the rest in hey dunktopath traveler this sounds like they kind of game you dont normally like to play so i appreciate that you gave it a try anyway even if you didnt like it in the end dunkey i think you might dislike rpgs a little to much to remain unbiased when reviewing them one of my favorite games of all time is fallout 2 which has both random encounters and turnbased combat and its an rpg which probably is something dunkbo doesnt like but i can still really enjoy his stuff i agree for me what killed the experience was the gameplay i knew going in that dunkey was never a fan of turn based jrpgs i can respect his opinion of the game and not get super pissy about it but what i want to know is why did he get the game knowing that he is not a fan of these types of games video seems kinda forced to be honest play games that you like and make videos about them today on dunkey triggers everyone idk who olberic is but hes hot dunkey talked all about how you got to get familiar with a reviewer to know what theyre about this is an excellently consistent video from the dman he didnt give the game a number score how am i supposed to know if i should play it or not did everyone miss the fact that this isnt a review its an opinionit usually says dunkview which obivously a lot of people disagree with while i am not agreeing with his opinion i will still defend it and say that its perfectly fine if someone you watch doesnt like the same games as you my favorite jrpg is kingdom heartsyes its technically a jrpg even with the disney stuff that game gets shit on all the time because of its crazy plot but i dont get mad about it because thats other peoples opinions they are not facts yes you can criticize his points in the video but thats how he feels he also stated his bias in the video which is a huge factor in this case i enjoyed the video for what it was a comedic approach to a game that he just didnt like i do wish most rpgs would take the mother system of just autobrute force weak mobs and continue on with your life play bookworm deluxe random counters not like that became outdated game design by the fucking early 2000s we should keep utilizing it till the end of time good idea fellow rpg developers the problem is hes comparing it to knack one of the more forgettable games of this year glad to see someone else who hates turnbased combat and random encounters most annoying boring and timeconsuming shit ever its not a good game everyone needs to get over it one thing i do like from what i saw was the marriage of 3d with the oldschool sprites the modern lighting and camera angles looks really cool too bad the gameplay looks dull and boring as hell though wait wait wait youre telling me youre the excellency 16 bit sprites and english voice acting reeeeeeeeeeeeee ya gotta mention that the game is at least gorgeous and the visuals are pretty unique a golden return of the jrpg era if you come to a dunkey review expecting a perfect review of the different aspects of the game weighing the pros and cons in times new roman font size 12 then why tf are you here ps knack 2 is still the second greatest game of all time behind super mario 2 babyy only 3 minutes of what dunkey doesnt like about a jrpg sounds like its pretty good so whats a great turn based strategy game knack 2 baby people dont like it when you dont have fun the way they want to these nuts ur excellenzy i already want to kill her guys this video is not a review its just meant to be a funny video about a game that dunkey dislikes nowhere in this videos content title or description does it say the word review dunkey intentionally exaggerated things about the game that he didnt like to get some laughs go back to reviewing bubsy saga this game is too excellency for you best rpg are the mario and luigi series please review sorry dinji but im gonna go with jims review for this one i like these comments i still think this shouldnt have oversaled bravely default all these jrpg fan boys raging about dunkey being bias lol dont you think youre bias for liking jrpgs doesnt that mean your opinion of the game shouldnt count either im buying the game anyway but i cant because outtastock bubbarino prepare yourself for the comment section i swear to godthe girl saying your exilency her voice actor does silica in the sao english duband knight guy is gamgoori in kill la kill i love you mr meatman beats me the primrose story arc is really good imo this just like the bubsy video he completely dropped the ball by not saying how great it is bubsy makes very funny jokes that only a smart rick and morty watching viewer would like also before you criticize anything anyone does ask yourself this could i do this thing better if not then you have your answer as to if your criticism is valid ps dunky shouldnt have an opinion your excellency will you play bookworm adventure deluxe i love these graphics tho thank everything you can thank damn i was waiting for someone to be real about this game the most over hyped pile of garbage since the order whats the pokemon meets inception game damn dunkeys really falling off first that awful spla2n review and now this the combat is much more deeper than is shown in this video and the characters do interact with each other with travel banter in their chapters so idk if dunkey just wanted to meme it up but it sounds like he didnt spend any time actually playing the game the banter comes in at chapter 2 and once you unlock the subclasses the combat gets even more deep so it looks like he barely even got into the real meat of the game intro chapters are skippable too so you dont even need to do them also ophilia repeating your excellency is to show her respect for the person who has cared for her and it is only near his death that she feels worthy enough to call him father voice acting and writing in this game is great and has believable characters with flaws and strengths like any normal human this isnt an attack or anything towards dunkey just the people who take this video at face value when it is very misleading the characters in this game are 50 50 half are trash and half are interesting battle system is poorly represented here it gets going once you get into it characters do interact after big story elements are revealed in the secluded sections and the game gets deeper as you progress man why you gotta diss xc2 uhh dunkey if you need to grind in a jrpg youre obviously playing it wrong the game gives you all sorts of tools to shit on enemies the very first turn you not using them or not bothering to discover them is not the games fault lol i love how fanboys get triggered at dunkey for speaking objective facts you definitely have to be willing to put up with grinding part of the combat is making your party based off of different characters abilities and combining them to your advantage however its not a new concept and ill agree with that but the old pixel style with updated tile sets and shading is interesting at the least and its kinda nostalgic from those older games the music is also very well done and fitting to the game the bosses all have their own unique style and this helps give this game its own taste among other jrpgs of this type sure this game is definitely not for everybody but what kills this review for me is that you didnt even show footage of majestic marmot hello bad form update boy title should have been your excellency octopath traveller maybe the game is good maybe it really isnt but can you at least beat the damn game before you say something stupid main problem is using english vo typical normie weebs jrpgs cant be bad dunkey must be the one who is wrong still love ya dunkey but i know you hate even the good rpgs wtf is a jrpg octoknack adventures deluxe 2 is almost as good as super mario bruddas 2 i like the game and i like the video universe just got broke your excellency youre that ninja play the game with japanese dub and its the best anime ever even though i gave you a thumbs up you are wrong good day sir but your excellency thats a fair assessment of the game but for us old fogies that grew up with saga frontier this is a nice touch of nostalgia i hate the story telling in this game but i loved jrpgs from the 90s this was exactly what my brain was thinking why do all these games seem like a bot script wrote them octopump trabeler gets a 101010 out of 3 by ign do you drive a porsche that has a license plate that says knack 2 its a shame this game isnt excellent excellency you should really play prince of persia mashes attack button instead of using charge system or break system this combat is boring im kinda torn with this review i dont like jrpgs i get too bored with them too quickly and when i hear bad stuff about how boring and long they are i usually dont dispute it too much because i dont really like to take the time to sit down and play them to prove otherwise on the other hand i feel like donkey has to be somewhat joking here he didnt end with a review score and this isnt titled a dunkview no ladders 0 outa 5 in the extreme background what a thrill i love jrpgs and turn based combat but i completely agree with dunkey they lend themselves to dull simple filler battles too often its not as though the turn based combat genre is a lost cause to anyone who wants something quick though making the game harder or adding a fast forward combat feature can really make battles in any turn based game feel both more worthwhile and fluid gotta say im a fan of jrpgs this video was hilarious because the dunk doesnt like em ive never heard of this game and tbh the art style looks really pretty i might check it out dunky buys a game reviews it returns it hey where is book worm on the left side you can see the dunkey fanboys ready to defend everything their favourite youtuber says on the right side you can see the jrpg maniacs who would give their lifes to protect the turn based combat this my childs is called the battle of the idiots like im sure dunkey makes great points havent played this but holy fuck if those visuals dont make me want to lose my life to this game i love fortain where was that guy who made fun of dunkey for not giving any criticism to nintendo they thought putting octo in the title would make it good like splatoon they had a rude awakening though i dont agree with his opinion on turn based action i can see his reasoning i do enjoy honest opinions so i leave this video with a like i really dont see why you keep playing jrpgs when you clearly dont like them youre free to have your opinion but stop making yourself play things you obviously dont like dunkster i love jrpgs i like anime tropes and turnbased combat this video was hilarious stop taking yourselves so seriously it was an opinion not quite a review with some good points stop saying its biased its obvious its biased dunkey is not an ign reviewer everything on his channel is his views and his opinion and his insight with humor mixed in you seriously cant defend the rehashed jrpg formula too much and thats what this game is its so safe its the call of duty of jrpgs wildly over appreciated because of the lack of similar games to be compared to on the switch its undeniable the industry needs more variation and fresh stuff persona 5 was a great example of this in his video a great game even someone who dislikes jrpgs like dunk can appreciate and i dont mean tailoring games to every taste just getting new ideas in there learning from other genres cheers i never want your videos to end i get sad when i see the end cards but i end up just rewatching stuff binge style i guess i am a little surprised but i suppose i shouldnt be i dont think ive heard dunky say anything positive about a jrpgwell ever they dont seem to be his thing i did try the demo dialogue is garbage like wtf who made that shit but its a nice game it does has mistakes but i give it 3 stars not worth my parents money but would play it for free im just here for beef stew yeah i sort my game reviewers btc what type of games they like i already know you dont like jrpg type games so youll be more critical of them and less forgiving ironically this video made me want to try the game out the game looks cool first time hearing about the game too haha i see some people havent watched his old videos too many ass kissers in reviews dunkey is just honesty is badly needed how could you say something so controversial yet so brave i am playing and loving octopath knowing full well that the game isnt for everyone this take is fine oh no i dont agree should i write a fucking paragraph or move on with my life sunk in 7 hours on day 1 and i love it never played a jrpg before this unless pokemon counts and i loved the combat i can see where your criticisms are coming from though still going to be a fan of yours until i die they got the graphics at least just finished captain toad now im gonna try octopath out tbh anime dialogue in any language is so awful your excellency this isnt bravely default dont forget about that one mechanic in earthbound where if you encounter an enemy you can oneshot you just win the fight automatically without entering the battle screen at all yea the game is shit i really wish you put more hours into this and splatoon 2 great games that i understand may not be everyones main game but great games nonetheless that everyone should try and its tilting for the people that have actually played the game where as you obviously stopped before 20 hours in thank god for this video i thought i was taking crazy pills for not liking the game hey dunkey just one of your subscribers here just saying thanks for another great video man you truly are funny i love to watch every single of your video today was one of the worst days of my life due to the fact my great grandaunt passed away at the age of 101 i was feeling like trash that she passed away because i was reslly close to her but i realize thats life you live it to the best possible way you can and well by the time you know it you reach the end with that being said i personally wanted to thank you dunkey for the time you take out of your life to make these videos to put many smiles on peoples faces because i know you have made me laugh more times then i could remember i also want to thank you for making just making a horrible day for me into a great day with your one of your videos i know i am just one subscriber fan talking to a big youtuber thats probably hears this all the time but honestly you deserve it hope you are doing great man and i love you hello your dunkullency how are you doing your dunkullency you did a great review your dunkullency what in shit did this kid do to get 5 million subs great review dunkster this was much more informative than alot of other stuff ive seen dunkey could make another youtube comments video just based on this comment section quick someone tell dunk to play the fucking bookworm game really what was the point of that snail battle you call it boring and repetitive because youre not hitting weakpoints or strategizing your points seem so lazy gotta leave a dislike eh i love octopath tbh but i respect the dunks opinion i thought dunkey never really liked rpgs to begin with this kinda turn based fighting always made these games boring for me and if i remember correctly dunkey said something on the lines of he is too impatient to enjoy rpg games kinda wierd that he would still review this if i hear excellency one more fucking time ima low my rains out that weeb shit what i like about reviews both positive and negative is that i can be like hey this guy said these parts of a game sucks but the rest of the game still looks like a ton of fun like yeah dunkey here has a lot of negative criticism about a game that just about everyone else adores i could go on and on about how biased he is and complain that hes tearing apart a good game based on his own individual preferences but that wouldnt be right and it wouldnt be a constructive argument however in the end his opinion of octopath traveler and other games dont matter to me because i the consumer have the final say in whether i will buy and enjoy games or not i can completely ignore dunkey and other reviewers and that is a wonderful thing dunkey doesnt like rpg who saw this coming residentsleeper wait octotravler is out this is a very deceptive review lol especially that snail fight the way dunk showcased that fight would be like someone not using their gun in cod i know he doesnt like jrpgs especially after his xenoblade 2 video but god damn this was just a mess you dont like this game your excellency combat are boring because all we need to do is clickthats why and the stories and the characters is also not really that much fun and more sense of humor like undertale look at undertale with a bunch of humor but this game is not its doesnt even tell anything valuable in life but maybe we dont need something too high like that but argh even you can one shot enemies but its just too much with boring fight mechanic of a jrpg game you cant blame dunkey anything because you guys didnt even know what is fun game beside playing for fun i feel like id really enjoy this game if it wasnt for the random encounters and turn based combat damn i love your videos but you need to release new videos more often or at least make them longer it was a great video but 35 minutes is barely a video dude youre back i thought you died from ligma edit if you read this you must be sugondese ive never played this game but im pretty sure people love this because its a square game the most infuriating thing about this game is how pretty it is it has a stylistic charm to it thats infuriating because its hard to enjoy with all of the negatives you also have to deal with i got the demo and enjoyed it but its core one of the main good things about this game is its character designs and art style so essentially he doesnt like anything about jrpgs welp i know that for future reference you should play bookworm adventures yes the stories and characters are very generic and if you dont like the gameplay then there isnt a lot for you to like i enjoy the turnbased combat and the random encounters arent common enough to become a nuisance i agree with everything else you said though you didnt touch on the music and graphics which are both excellent idk i think ill still get it if the price goes down cause the demo actually blew me away when i played it and im interested to actually see the stories to play out octopath is fun not even a 2 outta 5 just you blew it reggie so uhforgot the dunkview nano machines gene therapy your excellency dunkey feeling the need to make a video about an rpg always feels like a dung beetle feeling the need to host a show on the food network it just aint the right subject matter for either to speak on youve got a lot of great qualities as a gamer and a critic of video games man but the ability to appreciate and speak knowledgeably or sensibly about the mediums primary genre for storytelling and substance just isnt one of those qualities you should just stick to the funny stuff this game was such a disappointment it looks great it sounds great but if fails to deliver what its very name promises whats the point of an ensemble cast if the characters stories and individual stuff dont interact with one another just look at the credits for this game the director is just some guy who works on special effects and graphics and only 1 out of the 2 producers have any experience with such a story driven genre the one being masashi takahashi which worked on bravely default the game has 3 writers 2 of which have no prior experience on videogame writing and have only been credited as art designers or cinematic artist and the 1 guy who has actual jrpg videogames writing experience is yra kubota who is credited on an obscure erotic jrpg for dos called dragon knight 4 this game just did not have the talent behind it to pull this kinda concept off and im confused as why nintendo made such a big deal about a game that had zero prominent people behind it kicked into a pit of spice we talkin paprika i was excited to buy octopath since i just finished disgaea 5 but youve put some doubts in my mind i stopped listening to dunkey after he said ea was a bad company why you hating on random encounters there are some garbage uses sure but some of the most magical storytelling is used through open world games random encounters i wanted to put my fist through my monitor everytime i heard your excellency your excellency dunkey random encounters are the worst turn based rpgs i tend to get bored of however xenoblade 2 is one of my favorite games and one of the reasons is because of those rpg mechanics without random encounters i probably wont get octopath traveler any time soon because ill probably lose patience but maybe one day your excellency japanese developers should take inspiration from rpgs like xenogears and the shadow hearts series and give the faux medieval europe generic fest a rest games with archaic graphics should be taking risks with gameplay character and story dunkey doesnt like jrpg so he would never like this game why are you guys shock he doesnt like this game yeah fuck this guy for having his own opinion on what he likes and dislikes about a video game s for real if you really are hurt by what he said watch his game critics video in it he says he dislikes rpgs and turn based games so knowing that you can see why he would have a negative opinion on this game at the end of the day everyone is allowed there own opinion how you take his opinion is up to you but dont just be an ass because someone didnt have the same opinion as yours ps love you dunkey your excellency people are saying this shit is the next ffvi though what because its 16 bit and has turn based combat because im not seeing many other similarities yeah but i like that shit so im still gonna enjoy my time with it if your like me and didnt enjoy playing this game at all but bought it anyway its a good excuse to play russian roulette every time ophillia says your excellency pull the trigger at least then this game will be remembered for something good it did if dunkey says knack 3 will be the best game ever it will be the best game ever that dialog seems pretty bad in the two stories you showed does anyone who played the game know if you can get through the whole game avoiding certain storylines dad im early we just need a knack jrpg to calm down dunkey dont read the comments unless you have one of ethans cringe resistant hazmat suits dunkey doesnt give 2 fucks about anyone of you well dunkey i dont think this review is fair dunkey this isnt a review its a rant its shit if dunkey says its shit get outta here other demographic still a better game than knack when you get a league ad on dunkeys vid hahaha get out of here and close ur channel u r a child kid if u cant handle random encounter u dont even know how to play strategy game seeing a lot of comments saying that dunkey was misleading with combat he has in the past not been 100 accurate in how things occur or in what order they do this is done to exaggerate a point or make for a good joke no reason to get so upset about it happening this time first time ive ever thumbs downed a dunkey video you are wrong and should feel bad i know dunkey doesnt like jrpgs so i wont take you seriously this time you sexy dunkey i actually really liked xenoblade 2 being not a big jrpg fan however i dont get the hype for octopath it just looks outdated with its story characters and game design graphics are pretty i wanted to like it i take it you dont like the game your excellency the salt reggie ok thats all the time ive got i gotta get back to playing animal crossing new leaf on my nintendo 3ds the weebs are coming watch out glad to see you that you made a video like this to know my predictions were true nintendo wants square to rush it out square does so and this happens i was sad to see dunkey not say nice things about a game i love but his criticisms have some merit im equally disappointed to find that a lot of what he said was true thank you for making another video your excellency the combat in this game is really really good but the way the story is presented and just in general is garbage if youre not really much of a story buff youll really like the game if you really like story like me and enjoyed xenoblade 2 this is not really the game for you i never felt connected to any of these characters and without a climax for all these characters all this game is is fun rpg combat not enough for me i actually really like the game probably my favorite on the switch im a big jrpg guy so im usually pretty forgiving to the genres shortcomings especially when western rpgs have been doing so well in recent years but i at least agree with dunkey as far as story and dialogue go in this game i like the aesthetic the music and the visuals are great and spark some nostalgia for sure and the battles are good fun but the writing is so bland and the fact that none of the characters stories interact or the characters themselves for that matter is a huge missed opportunity great vid as usual your excellency cover image final fantasy tactics is that you thanks for the view i had no childhood memories with jrpg so maybe thats why octopath traveler is not attractive to me at all though so many other guys blow it to sky i dont like it when the man say he do not like game i like because it creates a dimensional rift in my perception of reality happy i didnt get it then artstyle looks incredible but cant handle this turn based combat nonsense why did he even play this this is by far dunkeys weakest review cant believe that ign aka aquaphobia game review gave more input than dunkey not even some good goofs and gafs in this video i want to play this now i just bought this game today but this old school jrpg shit is what i grew up on so ill probably still enjoy it i love turned based combat fight me when its your turn this should be called what i didnt like about octopath traveler you make good points theres nothing i really disagree with tbh however id like to see you review more elements and point out things you enjoyed too the music is awesome for example i think the game has some issues but overall the good qualities outweigh the bad comeon dunk whats the tea i have a dream word its strange that a lot of people in the comment section who disagree with you only take the game for face value storytellingdialogue is a defining element of the greatest jrpgs and this title falls short in that respect ive got to get through the whole thing but the dialogue is similar to that of a 99 cent mobile game but muh graphics n musica yeah well thats as superficial as it gets you can plate a steaming dump with gold but its still a steaming dump bbbut your excellency it is a jrpg genre it is all about the repetitive grind your excellency good thing i didnt buy the collectors edition for 90 bucks but ill still buy the game looks awesome and the demo was really fun jrpg weaboos are worse than flat earthers id have to agree your excellency pokemon meets inception is the only thing im referring to the persona franchise as from now on uh octopath wasnt made from nintendo the game was sick and i loved it music is good as fuck and the game was relaxing and a great time if ur hating why though its only game why you have to mad so glad you said it i played the demo and it was boring as shit then reddit fucking roasted me for not liking it the game is just so freaking boring your excellency i dunkey please yeah that dialogue was awful i know a lot of people said the graphics are really impressive but this looks like garbage imo its hideously overrendered with a load of filters and shaders slapped on top to try and make it look good this is just my opinion but it looks like a fucking 2015 minecraft shader engine lmfao its like they couldnt decide on an art direction or style so they just used all of them i find it fun but on the other hand it kinda feels like 8 plots se had on a shelf they couldnt develop into full games thrown into a pit of spice and shot with a bazooka im still laughing at that uh ohhhh an unpopular opinion brace yourselfs my favorite developer my favorite kind of game but i still agree with dunbey im enjoying the game but the voice acting is generic and your basically following 8 totally different stories where the characters lack an appreciation for each other theyre basically just there if i didnt spend 60 i probably wouldnt keep playing psycho mantis thank you i trust your taste its actually so mundane and cringe i wholeheartedly agree with this video you guys know that you dont have to believe everything dunkey says right who gives a shit if dunkey doesnt like a game that you probably already knew he wasnt going to like how could dunkey make a video i not only disagree with but highly disagree with him damn when he dissed ffx i chose a different video specifically how to rob by weegee plays the va for ophilla is cristina vee tho howed she agree to this crap i could listen to dunkey say the word goomba all day i could listen to dunkey say the word goomba all day your opinion is that its a garbage game my opinion of your review is that its garbage so were equals now chrono trigger a game that came out more than 20 years ago has enemies with more than two frames of animation the artstyle was clean and didnt need a shitload of postprocess effects to make it look more complex than what it actually was it also told a compelling story about 7 very different characters who interacted and helped with each others storylines it didnt even have random encounters think about that look at all the people with confirmation bias losing their shit in here were about to get a follow up video on jrpg bullshit and the community that tries to justify it calling it now lol the dunk the masta is back babbbby fk all yall dumb mfs damn regi when will you learn harambe loved paper mario but never finished it damn the first time i dont agree with dunkey likes anyways i wish i had a female slave who referred to me as your excellency constantly your excellency you know its about he graphics thats what this is really all aboutyour excellency i still thought as a person who only has a playstation this game looked and sounded cool especially with its witcherlike playtime someone with a varied and sorted opinion this is an outrage still stuck on the first boss dunkey you stopped playing league because you hate the game and dont enjoy itso stop playing jrpgs because you hate them and dont have fun playing them man this game has 100 hours of awesome content and good stories with interconnected plots and amazing combat that requires strategy and thought the bosses are amazing and the character classes get op and satisfying to play to where you look forward to trying out your new abilities on enemies but man if you go into this wanting it to suck youre going to waste your time i like your videos but you missed out on poking fun of some of this games actual flaws and could of made a good comedy video but you just made a more serious gripe video about jrpgsagain some of the dialog and voice acting is cringey af but not actually what you used because it was taken out of context their are way better opportunities to make a funny video especially with the huntress who speaks a combination of normal english and olde english that could whats that music he used at the end its certainly a good game but not a wonderful one this was clearly a budget game to test the market in rpgs for the switch i think people are more upset in the loss of potential this game had rather than upset for the game being bad almost overlooked this video because of the generic thumbnail but its always nice to hear your opinion on games eeeeeehhhhhhhhh you didnt say before that you hate jrpgs and you will never make a review about it dunkey in his game review critic video said never listen to his opinion on turn based rpgs he obviously wasnt going to like this game lol he cherry picked it and made it look like it was terrible jrpg game it reminded me when i did the same thing to my friend when i let him play persona 5 but regardless this video was pretty funny oh yeah i forgot dunkey just hates jrpgs for some reason and thinks theyre the greatest evil ever invented this is why chrono trigger is the king no bullshit 5 minute fight till you can move around the area again can we get a video on dos 2 i feel like its a really overlooked game by most mainstream youtubers unpopular opinion but ok i agree completely that the storytellingespecially writingis weak as someone who doesnt mind turnbased combat though i thought the gameplay started off strong but as soon as the introductory chapters ended the momentum declined severely getting to each new chapter is a matter of undertaking a tedious repetitive grind on top of that when you finally progress to new chapters is youre rewarded with what is essentially repeating steps from introductions but with stronger enemies more abilities etc so in summary i feel that the game is simply boring and unspecial id even say the same for the atmosphere music and visuals and so forth its more reminiscent of a generic rpg maker indie game than a highbudget mainstream product in that regard that chrono trigger music one of my favourite rpgs ever i dont know why you have to lie about the combat though misinformation is kinda weird coming from you i understand splatoon 2 you used sticks instead of gyro so you were just a pleb but you knew how to play this game ey munkey you never let me down whenever i smoke a blunt the dunk shows his distaste for a certain genre of games and i feel like someone could miss the point of this video if they havent seen his video game reviewers video bassically he isnt trying to make an objective score hes trying to give his honest personal feedback and to change his review of the game based on how well liked it is flies straight against the idea of having a personality and taste you are not supposed to see this video and think man dunk is attacking a well loved game on release to be edgy and different its actually wow dunk really dislikes jrpg games the man is entitled to his opinion not sure if dunkey made it passed the demo but there is character interaction similar to fire emblems also once i got into lv 24 story quest areas the mobs are not easy what do you mean rpgmaker v isnt good anymore what was the game with the red dude walking around in the sand good video your excellency keep in mind dunsley already has a unfavored biased towards jrpgs so it doesnt matter if it was a good game for its genre its still in the dumpster for him since its just not his flavor of gaming you could have just titled this as jrpgs or some shit and it would have been the same nonetheless still some good points about disjointed storytelling for the first quarter of the game otherwise just nitpicking on the genre in general 410 should have just played bookworm adventures delux instead visually the game looks good but everything else is bad if you dont like turn based games and long grinds i have bad news for you tbh this game looks super visually appealing and the comment section helped me understand that dunkeys fight scene wasnt indicative of what the gameplay is like using weaknesses etc thanks guys im also glad that i can take into account the fact that dunkey doesnt like jrpgs i myself have not gotten very far into octopath traveler yet but from what i have played the game has been a mostly enjoyable experience however hearing that the storylines are completely independent of each other and that the characters hardly interact with one another in conjunction with the fact that random encounters exist cant be toggled sucks this game really nailed it on the head as far as atmosphere and tone goes and the character design looks very nice but outside of the few areas the game is kinda pitiful compared to titles like bravely default where encounter rates can be controlled at any time to avoid the tedium of a fight where you just mash your way through and the lack of any kind of dynamic between characters is especially weird considering that this is the same team that made bd which was a game that i felt really fleshed out its characters and their interactions people are getting upset that someone who doesnt like jrpgs reviewed and disliked a jrpg i personally am not a fan of them either so i appreciate the commentary from a reviewer with similar tastes for criticism of entertainment people should find people with similar tastes so they have solid recommendations for things to play since generally they have less time than critics if you listen to critics to hear what you want to hear thats not really a critics job in my opinion its more to provide recommendations to those with limited time and or money this pretty much is the same reason why destiny got popular both octopath and destiny came out when both of their respective consoles and platforms didnt have something that hit in those genres so they get praise because you only have that game to play for the genre atm so when looking back it will be the best in the series and when they did it right when they make sequels when in reality the signs have been there from the start that it wasnt developed properly finally somebody i can agree with on octopath traveler gotta tell you this might be it your excellency this game wouldnt be so bad if it was 15 bones60 dollars wtf i really loved the combat system music visuals an cyrus characterstory why isnt this game called octopus traveller nows thats a game ill tell you why random encounters are even used the first and utmost important point is laziness and level scaling the developer uses these encounters as way to have the players fight at least 5 monsters and potentially get a rare encounter as well as progress through areas if you change the encounter rates of every jrpg locations to zero so you wont get an encounter youll quickly realize that there isnt a lot in that location and that most of these can be skipped almost entirely and the game is pretty short if you find a way to counteract levels and bossfights we all know dunkey doesnt like games that are bogged down by random encounters and such but thats the problem anyone who has watched dunk enough could have easily assumed what his thoughts are about this game on top of what we know about his tastes a game with this level of required timeinvestment never really had a chance dunk might as well have tweeted that this game wasnt his cup of tea due to shit like random encounters but that wouldnt have weeded out subscribers that cant accept that he is a human with his own damn opinions my only problem with his review is that we all could have seen this opinion coming from miles away and its a 3 minute video with two jokes in it it feels like only half of another video because dunk didnt have anything positive to say so why force that i just dont think it was necessary to spend time editing this at all grinding in an rpg you say color me surprised its so out of character for the genre obliterated was hype for the inevitable your excellency psycho mantis but it never came dunks ive gotta say im disappointed ive always thought of you as the most consistent youtuber in terms of video quality your uploads may not be that frequent but each one is a banger im including in that list your review videos which always seem to consider the important factors of a game and how they affect gameplay while also invoking deep thought into what makes a game subjectively enjoyable and objectively good or bad game design you openly claim what you personally dislike in a game and as you eluded to in your video on game critics this allows us as consistent viewers to build a rapport with you and how you respond to certain games this video seemed to completely ignore those extremely insightful points just to bag on a game genre you have previously made blatant that you do not enjoy as much since you have no fucking patience i hope you dont see this as an attack on you and your content if you do read this comment you are my absolute favourite youtub random encounter suck a pilots license your excellency what for yeah i stopped listening to this guy after he said bubsy 3d sucked i hate dunk boy because he hates my favorite game waaaaa please no more i love you dunkey and i respect your decision but i still think octopath is a great game ok i was really considering getting this game but you actually pointed out a few good points not too sure now thats jrpgs tho if you dont enjoy grinding you wont enjoy this genre dunkey hates grinding so its expected that he wont like this nothing stopping anyone else from enjoying it tho wtf but i dont think nintendo made this gamebut you can play as raichu in this game if you beat the game with every character like 5 times without taking damagemy uncle works at pokemon great review your excellency if you have a problem with this video you need to go back and watch his game critics video you should expect that he wouldnt like this game hes not trying to be a contrarian hes just giving his review instead of being some sold out bastard he didnt like the game oh well that doesnt mean you cant like it why is paper mario the best turn based rpg i have played this better be a joke or else ill play bookworm adventure to each their own i guess i will honestly disagree with your undertale statement it just kind of mediocre on all fronts not bad and while its a more involved rpg its also a butt easy bullet hell with little to no depth to its system yee its ok dunk we dont have to be agree on everything any time of the day i think octopath traveler is great for me simply because im ok with monotonous random encounters and shitty writing no seriously ive played through xenoblade 2 twice and still not particularly bored im glad you still gave the game a chance even though i know you already explicitly said you hated most of these rpg suckers first time i disagree ive genuinely loved this game and i cant put it down excuse me donkman how dare u critizize my favorite game genre i am unsubbding immediat i think the problem lies more in the genre than in this one game as this could apply to a multitude of jrpgs he just doesnt enjoy turn based rpgs he doesnt like having to wait or grind to get to the real challenge or highlight thanks dunk your reasoning legitimately answered some questions i had that other critics wouldnt answer tried the demo and after what dunk said i dont think ill be picking this one up why would you play a game for the story in 2018 that was the mistake the game starts off slowly but the combat and exploration get more robust nuanced and exciting by the hour and seeing your characters advance in poweroften unexpectedly is just extremely satisfying by level 20 i was beating level 25 mobs without taking damage 2 of the characters first skills lower random encounter rates which are fairly low to begin with basing your opinion on the first 2 hours of a game designed to be enjoyed more as it opens up gradually on is misleading and youre missing out on an extremely great game dunkey what happened to the legendary wraps well this kind of makes me not want to get this now well if dunkey doesnt like jrpgs turn based combat and random encounters why make an entire video about a game that is a jrpg and has all those things seriously it would be way better if he focused on something else and didnt make a misinformed review that could potentially turn people away from the game all because of a personal grudge this video and his review on metal gear survive are really bad in my opinion pretty weak video tbh some points you make do sounds valid to a certain degree but others just sound like nitpicking and the fact that everyone knows that you dont like jrpgs doesnt really make this do any justice like did you expect that this game would play like a action rpg like the tales of seriesim pretty sure we all knew what we were getting from the trailers jrpgs just arent for anyone just like any other gaming genre im not a big fan of turn based rpgs or point and click mmorpgs but i can definitely see why games like xenoblade 2 are received so well despite the learning curve i cant say too much about this game cause i know so little about it but based on what people who also played the game are saying it doesnt seem like you put the time and effort to learn the game i like octopath traveler a new video your dunkey excellency this is kind how i felt about it too i was really excited for it but now that i have it its just kind of bland boring and bring very little innovation to the genre its like they churned this out and were like hes another ff style jrpg for you go nuts psycho mantis dunkey how dare you have a different opinion than me dont you realize that this is actually a masterpiece and turn based combat is the best assassins creed is a good franchise at least some the sprites looked great thats the most i can give the game without playing it wow he doesnt know good games for shit i mean he doesnt like xenoblade 2 well he probably never completed the first few chapters which were the weak ones but the rest were amazing wasnt this the rpg everyone was hyping like all hell people who thought the story was interesting clearly havent seen an interesting story people have their own opnions reeeeee this video makes me cry dunky no you were supposed to bring balance to the force so you dont like jrpgs why couldnt you have just lead with that hes right you know the only reason people are going crazy for this game is that there arent many good rpgs on the switch right now if this had been year 5 of the switch this game would be called out for what it is mediocre with nice old school graphics for all the people criticizing this review remember dunkey doesnt love rpgs its just not for him the power of a critic relies in the consistency of his voice what you can take away from this is that this game is probably a good rpg but doesnt do anything that gets dunkey into it like persona 5 did dunkeys taste doesnt need to be your taste have to say i am disappointed not a jrpg fan myself but this video was very low quality usually you will address a games negatives and positives while doing your best to explain why you feel a certain way about the title you will accompany these opinions with funny yet insightful commentary memes and usually a very well timed and appropriate bgm to emphasise your points this video had very little humor or creativity and just felt like a rant if you do not like a genre of games dont go out of your way to make content about it especially if your opinion is so heavily biased that you cannot uphold your usual standard of quality all he did was criticize the level design im not very patient so this game never really grabbed my interest agree with donkey after divinity original sin 2 i can never play other turn based rpg again if you want make your game turn based at least make each of your character turn meaningful not just simply scrolling all the available commands and choosing one of it i made that game alright dunkle let me tell you why your opinion is wrong first of all you are black second of all you dont even actually play video games third of all you dont even have the real experience of going on a real in life quest in a time period where castles and such existed so how would you know second of all random encounters are based on real actual life fifth of all you cant spell right sixth of all you got dick cheese just turn off the english voice acting lmao its not a secret that its bad i personally enjoy turn based combat theres definitely more strategy to it than just using the same move over and over i see turn based combat like a game of chess where sometimes by reading your opponents moves two three even four turns ahead you can be rewarded greatly i believe that with the right mindset it can be very fun plus i sorta like the hell of grindy ass games 45 game for me i never liked turnbased combat i played the demo for about an hour and a half this game just isnt for me i know people have been sweating it for this game to come out forever and everyone already loves it but i never gave a shit it never looked interested to me outside of the art style i know what kind of games dunkey likes i saw the notification for this video and i said shit is he gonna like this and no he didnt dunkey doesnt like turn based jrpgs par a select few this is why i like him as a reviewer you know what he responds to you can base his tastes off of your own hes only confirmed to me that i wont might not like this game your excellency i havent seen so many angry people in dunkeys comment since his last of us review i respect your opinion and actually agree with a lot of your issues with it but damn dont i love a good grind a generic story telling every now and then so excuse me when i say that your missing out on a great experience later on your excellency basically i listen to dunkey and that determines if im gonna buy a game or not you made a video that said you dont like turn based combat so then you come in and bash a game for being turn based honestly i could have done without a review because it only talks in the broadstrokes the things you talk about are in any jrpg i wish you would have made a different video with your time not because this one is bad but because it doesnt communicate anything unique rather just reinforcing that you dislike rpgs this kinds of videos makes me say that dunkey is part of the reviewers he mocked in his shitty reviewers video you should review persona 5 dude dunkey your excellency love your videos so much but this one was just way off and fiercely biased this was a 30 dollar game sold for 60 dollars i bought and though i did play it and it was good it was not good enough to be a full priced game considering the jrpgs that came before it like persona 5 if im gonna get an jrpg on the switch ill get disgaea 5 cuz its on sale and it has more content and value than this 8bit overrated nostalgia cash grab why isnt there a dunk branded video game if angry video game nerd can do it you can its not even out yet and i can already give it 5 dunks out of three lmao actually that snail isnt present on olberics path you just took a character that couldnt hit his weakspot on purpose to make the battle longer guess blatantly lying is comedy now yo is that gatos theme as an rpg fan im disappointed i love the visual style and was really excited to check this out if it was good wasting your time with this go play a good game like bookworm adventures this video didnt make me feel like watching a dunkey video i hate fortnite but you wont see me making a rant about that game and posting it on youtube i know when i see you review any rpg that 9 times out of 8 itll be complete shit and boring however i do appreciate the fact you wont swear them off for review and attempting to enjoy them i do appreciate your reviews you hate an turn based rpg for being a turn based rpg aight dang i was hoping you would like this game tension is probably one of my favorite tracks on this games soundtrack and i actually have been enjoying the combat system so far oh well its not for everyone cant wait for this next video the worst part about this is that when he eventually does make the bookworm adventures video there will be no possible way for it to live up to the meme octopath traveler characters water with medieval food coloring thanks for the review i liked the demo but it never let you get the the second chapter of each characters story to see if they ever interacted now that you have said they dont i probably wont get the game dunkey you gotta play night in the woods your excellency youre that ninja i think dunkey should be allowed to play games even if he doesnt like the genre i mean he even ended up likeing persona 5 despite it beeing a turn based jrpg and if he already played the game might aswell make a video about it the game is recent and popular and im sure many people including me wanted to see his opinion on this game or people told him you have to play it its so awesome and now hes making the cold statement that he just didnt like it i mean it is a full retail price game i also want to know some of the negative critics about it before i just buy it especially since the demo personaly didnt really impress me at all and i love jrpgs i think youre just hating on most things successful now guys please watch his game critics video first before watching this bunky play ninokuni2 will be worth hahaha this game is only as popular as it is bc its on the switch which isnt getting to many games atm the truth of turnbased jrpgs with random encounters spreads wow people are really salty about this video i agree this game is fkn boring this game really makes you feel like your excellency rip dunk i heard the ligma finally got him do a review of the streets of rage trilogy maybe the fan remake as well i still wanna try this game as a nonfan of jrpgs just to get a taste of the genre and i played the games demo and liked it enough but i have to level with dunk on one thing why the fuck are random battles still a thing at least let me see where the enemies are moving on the map so i can choose to fight them or not at my own will this isnt 1987 any more thank god this game already sold a lot of copies otherwise this video could wrongfully prevent many people of potentially buying this amazing game by spreading misinformed information about the game i bet ea touched it your excellency huh i want to get this now thanks dunkey looks like the game is too complex for your average washed up video game youtuber got excited to see this video but ya blew it what if they did a rpg style with random enemy encounters but instead they had fighting like street fighter instead of turned base combat see if game developers are willing to try that because it seems fun this guy cant be more wrong about the game his portrayal of the game is very misleading and not accurate at all this sounds more like bashing and trying to be original by hating on the game while everyone is loving it such youtubers are to be avoided in my book for me this perfectly sums up why i feel like this game isnt worth the full 60 they are charging its not that the game is bad or anything just that the tier that it is trying to be in has a pretty high bar for rpgs damn dunky although i respect your opinion i completely disagree pretty harsh on this one lol i find it refreshing to hear some criticism for this game finally i scrolled 8 comments down and i can already see the frustrated octopath fans deleting comments now what a coward this game is excellent stories are kind of meh but the combat and soundtrack are second to none in the genre lots of truth has been spoken in this comment section all but the fact that tressa best girl youre just the autistic kid with adhd of the neighbouroud who cant handle more than two second of thought when playing an video game octopath isnt an excellent game but you obviously dont even try to play on that encounter with the snail i dont understand isnt this game selling like hotcakes in japan dont let this distract you from the fact that waluigi is not in smash haha all the weeb tears i love your videos dunkey even gave this one a thumbs up and i dont necessarily think your points are wrong in this video but i have to ask did you do any research before buying this game your primary criticisms though fair are all things one can easily recognize by looking at a few screenshots waaah dunkey said mean things about my favorite video game im a salty retarded child who doesnt know how to maturely handle a dissenting opinion people like this need to unironically be shot your excellency the first 2 paper mario games are the only games that do turn based battles right to me first time seeing a dislike ratio that high on dunkeys video gohan approves this review dunkles shitting on nms and andromeda is fine shitting on this dunkey must burn xenoblade 2 is top of the list dunkey you are wrong i cant believe dunkey was actually secretly egoraptor all this time i dont usually leave comments but good video short and to the point review nice donkely butt hurt fan boys denying this game is doo doo dunkey please review suikoden 2 this has always been may all time favorite game please basically its a bogstandard jrpg despite its interesting look with nothing to set it apart aside from that not for anyone who doesnt already like jrpgs 05 no octopus most games its not about the story its about gameplay this game 60 of the video complaining how the story is crap entirely ignores good gameplay elements munkeys bias is only ok when its not trashing on my weaboo feelings why would you bother reviewing a jrpg if you dont like random encounters grinding and being smart when fighting poor review my dude wow i mean i know its a joke but this is really heavy handed panning of a game and game type me and all my friends enjoy and that sucks dude i dont understand why you feel you have to tear this game down when its what so many people have wanted for so long i love turn based combat i dont see why thats so bad of me i get this isnt what you wanted but this video is so unpleasantly negative and doesnt even really have a lot of jokes in it sorry donk can not agree with you on this one jesus christ thank you i bought this game day one sold it on ebay the next day because gamestop or any other company will give maybe half of its value the game is boring the dialogue is cringe inducing its like every part of bravely default done worse and that game was pretty meh too please dunkey quit playing jrpgs why bother if you dont get the appeal in the least this is probably the most pointless video ive seen you make and i generally like your content this is just like the previews that didnt go deep enough with people pointing out there isnt character interaction among the travelers and all ive seen is compliments for a true final boss oh man and i was so eager for his review the point is the story sucked balls like hardcore yeah combat i thought was fun but i just couldnt keep playing when a 5 year old could come up with better dialog what happened to the epic story telling square like wtf now play skies of arcadia if you want to enjoy turn based my guy if you cant handle random encounters why would you get into a rpg also through most rpgs you could either bullshit your way through and have a harder boss or grind a fuck ton and make it more easy for you most of the time if you put a fuck ton in you get a fuck ton out so im strongly inclined to believe that a typical rpg isnt your style this is the best youtube for people saying this is a serious video just look at the end card its really unfortunate i was really excited about this game then in passing i heard about how the game handles its story structure and all my hype just came crashing down dunkeys totally right its still a good game just in spite of its flaws certainly the excessive random battles are a nuisance if you only care about the boss fights and dialog but the random counters can actually be challenging if you arent overleveled or overgeared compared to other jrpgs the random battles in this are far more interesting because of their difficulty and the benefits of strategic combat instead of just mashing your strongest attack due to the break system its not something everyone will enjoy but i love it the disjounted stories are an interesting innovation but i feel there should have been more effort to connect them and thats the weakest part of the game in fact all games are bad no rating your excellency the acting really was cringe and the battles drag on and on im 70 hrs in and i wanna kill myself already its so monotonous nothing i do feels worthwhile and youre travelling with a group of people but feel alone good lord people stop acting like this game is a god send it really is kinda shit when you think about it hes just fucking with sky right thanks a lot dunkey now i know not to waste 20 on this crap what i find surprising is that you even bothered to think it would be a good game i know you like to give games like this a chance especially knowing you despise jrpgs with a passion but this wasnt worth giving a chance to begin with seriously the trailer of the game makes it so generic looking that i knew from the gecko this is formulated garbage play bookworm adventure your excellency i respect you dunkey i have been playing this game and loving it and i am honestly happy to see this video from you you are not afraid to give your opinion about a game that is coming out to high praise and state your reasons as they are your own please keep speaking your mind so i can keep trusting your opinions even if they differ with my own you are awesome oh no dunks you triggered the fanboys dunkey i dont agree so dont follow me realoneman you didnt even break the snail to make the fight go right try fight with all four hidden class boss and final boss then come back and do your funny video even if the game was the best lookingsounding game in the last decade if the gameplay is boring that is not going to help it and for all those people saying to play through the beginning and that it gets better there are so many average games out there and i just dont have the time to sit through a blandboring beginning in hope that the game at some point gets better if it doesnt wake my interest in the first 12 hours i will never play it not because i lm impatient or anything just because as somebody who has a job and other thing to do i dont have the time to wait and hope that it turns out to be a decent game in the end i cant really bring myself to give the video a dislike since its dunk but im sorta disappointed on this one bookworm adventures sounds like a better game its not even a jrpg dunkey stop making these types of games make bookworm adventures deluxe 2 i really hope your fanbase doesnt skip this game because of this video youre obviously oblivious to many many qualities in the game after all i could list an insane amount of qol features streamlined mechanics and overall design decisions that cater moreso towards wrpg fans than jrpg fans im very much used to your fanbase either praising or panning a game because of your joke videos if youre seriously just making shit up to push comedic tone such as fighting a weak enemy with the wrong weapon type thats available to you via button press to pad out combat then im not even gonna attempt criticizing your video any further but its very frustrating how i personally have been very cynical about jrpgs for a while then i pick up octopath and fall in love with it head over heels for so many reasons only to have the guy who doesnt like jrpgs massively shit on a game that doesnt really deserve it as a whole deliberately going out of his way to m i called it this is not a game its a playlist to me music in this game is on point xenoblade chronicles 2 is number one for me only thing i disagree on with dunky the video was okay not great but okay you know i gotta say mad respect for the jrpg community whenever dunkey puts out even a highly comedic game review fans get all pissy in the comment section but here i can still easily find the jrpg fans but for a different reason theyre openly accepting and often times agreeing with his criticism respecting the fact he doesnt like games in this format listing flaws he may have missed as well as great things he didnt touch on i may not like the same games as you guys but i like how open you guys are to negative comments about what you love virtually every other gaming community could learn from yall well obviously dunkey doesnt like jrpgs i get it i hate mobas but i can at least acknowledge the things they do well dunkey completely ignores the goood of this game such as the gorgeous graphics in favor of completely trashing it for comedic purposes ive never disliked a dunkey video but this is the firstbad form im glad im not the only one who thought this game was dogshit dunkey ive liked all your videos even when you called ffxv average even then i had to agree however though ive played octopath persona games 35 i cannot say that these games are comparable i can understand your hatred of jrpgs you hate random encounters and turnbased except for persona 5s turnbased persona has a lot more to offer but in a way they are simply much too different your points in this video are much too stretched from personal experience for one there isnt actually a need to grind if you can just spread out the character stories instead of focusing on one whyd you showcase only one of the characters as being generic where are the rest the english voice acting in anything is always horrendous to me so i just turn on japanese va usually always better quality and i cant even understand them so problem solved i aint a fanboy in the slightest your points are still valid but from it sounds like youre calling this game dog shit a i bought it 1 hour before this video was made 0 regrets alright guys pack it up we all know dunkey was done the moment he quit league this was the last strike just in case you cant tell this is a joke thanks dunkey ill be sure to dodge this game in the future was going to play it but after seeing this it must be absolute trashtier ps1 rpgs for life listen here pal if i dont see a dunkveiw for majors mask you and i may have a discrepancy on our hands bucko nah but seriously i need that shit knack 2 baby those graphics are incredible though i think turn based games are boring grabs popcorn you know something is up when dunky spells the title correctly wow dinkey ik this game is slow pace however u got to appreciate the games stunning visuals which after this video it is a department u are lacking the characters and there stories are very simple so u dont wonder off and completely forget what the character is fighting for the soundtrack is better then ur game snake nuice my only problem with this game is random encounters are garbage and that the 8 characters should interact more i give octoling traveler a 84 so far i only have complete chapter 1 for every character so far ill edit this if it gets any better ive contacted reggie and he said he wont be jumping out the battle bus with u because of this review how dare u talk bad about a work made by the same team as book worm adventure deluxe another masterclass jrpg im not sure of what other rpg does this but i always highly appreciated the first time playing earthbound and realizing that the game if youre at a high enough level above the enemies in a particular area will automatically win your random encounters without you having to even bother with the fight dang dunko going off the comments section people really aint digging this video i love the game every time i hear octopath traveler i think its a splatoon dlc or something the graphics look beautiful though dunkey is a fat weeaboo who only enjoys nintendo games i enjoy the game and i think its a good addition to the switch but i dont love it dunkey are you depressed you havent uploaded a gaming video in such a long time leave it to dunkey to make me think twice about buying a game i usually agree with dunkeys videos but i really love octopath traveler its fun with cool rpg elements and the pixel art with realistic backgrounds are extremely beautiful but its your opinion and i respect that waiting patiently for the next video how can you say something so controversial yet so brave splatoon 2 the octopath expansion lmao will slam munk ever get serious the best rpg game is m a r i o b r o t h e r s 2 jrpgs are almost always way better without voice acting pokemon meets inception never played it but there are a lot of people who just value slower combat over faster combat its literally the exact same as how some people like slower music over faster music or how some people like to drive slower instead of driving fast whether or not the gameplay is good is completely dependent on that particular persons preference that story still trash though it is the best meme that reggie gets blamed for everything oooooh these comments gonna be guuuuud i keep seeing reviews salivating about this game but this shit was obvious from the demo alone like its not bad its just annoying and monotonous even in the demo i was running to the save guy after every fight because really i did not want to redo those fights and the game is mostly about these fights this was a great video your excellency i feel really bad for the people who find games like this well written dunkey doesnt like a game that i like and that makes me angry 12 year olds commenting on this but dunkey your excellency i hate jpgs png master race its a pretty rad game if you just pick up a book and read all of your imagination can come to life no need for these bad video games dont get why this is so controversial he literally said before that his least favorite things are anime and turn based combat its like a high budget rpg maker game dunkey is the hero we need but not the one we deserve he is the only one who can criticize jrpgs without massive backlash this comment section is an absolute shitshow smh thank you for making videos dunkey ive watched everyone of them and many of them over again you are truly the best creator on this sight and you bring me joy every day keep it up man shit dunkey i love your videos but complaining about the literal backbone of jrpgs being on a jrpg would be like complaining about cod cause you shoot shit and the story is all fast and loose if you want a good story with interesting characters play bookworm adventures deluxe good thing dunkey reviewed the game now i know for sure i wont be playing this laugh stock of a game a whole loooooout of truth in this video try tales of berseria then shit im out of repels again i like turnbased combat when done well but youre right that mixing it in with shitty random encounters makes its flaws much more pronounced man i dont recommend you play any final fantasy or dragon quest or any old school rpg because i can put your voice clips in them and nobody would notice the edition please review mario rabbids i fucks with dunkey heavy but youre not gonna say xenoblade 2 is a bad game welp remind me to never watch a dunkey video for a jrpg even if some of his points are valid i cannot agree with his overall opinion and the videos arent fun to watch either i do agree that random encounters are tedious and a bore and that the dialogue can be corny and repetitive but i feel like you didnt get far enough to appreciate the better parts of this game the characters do in fact interact with each other from chapter 2 onwards and its regarding actual events in their stories its not a lot but you made it seem like there was 0 interaction which is completely untrue what also sets this game apart from other jrpgs is its equipment nuts go ahead laugh and secondary jobs most importantly allowing you to get creative with your character builds the armor isnt just buying the next best thing you gotta decide what best fits the build you are going for nuts allow you to augment the stats of your character to better adjust them to the build you want for them and while the differences may not seem much at first if you commit to feeding the ones you want for your character the nuts will make a difference over time secondary jobs are whole lotta virgins in the comments mad that dunkey doesnt share the same opinion as them that moment when for the first time your opinion doesnt match your favorite youtuber he did a good kid pointing out the very real flaws but is clearly biased understandably against the slower more tactical nature of jrpgs edit im glad he didnt make this a dunkview smart move turn based jrpg with 16 bit visuals and some cool 3d geometrynot worth the 50 but thats my opinion and who careslooks more like an indie 15 game i respect dunkeys choice in the games he plays he breaks the norm by showing off games that we have never or wouldnt pay any mind to playing spicing up the reviews with comedy love ya mate i see people complaining about dunkey but no one disagreeing with actual arguments damn the first video im gonna have to disagree with so much hate just because he gave his opinion lol i agree 1000000 characters were very plain this is kind of expected from dunkey being he doesnt like jrpgs was waiting forever for this video and im devastated lol i was hoping dunkey would love it your excellency you should play bookworm adventures deluxe i think your being a little to critical your excellency damn dunkey made a video i disagree with this is so sad alexa play gusty garden galaxy 2 whether or not you like the game you really gotta love those character illustrations square sure has some amazing artists working for them this video is not in my sub feed dunno why but i clicked the bell now check it out dunkey winstons really moved up in the world a king idk guys i think he didnt like the game good god thank you i dont always agree with you but the amount of praise this game was getting in spite of its bad dialog and bafflingly bad scenario writing was driving me crazy way to gloss over all the good stuff in the game dunkass maybe mario teaches typing is more your kind of video game i took a shot every time she said your excellency im typing this comment from the afterlife wasnt worth it i heard there is a really good jrpg called bookworm adventures ligma deluxe an amazing game why are so many comments getting deleted before anyone shits on him for not liking the game so much he has already stated that turn based rpgs arent his thing and in this video he says he doesnt like random encounters because they do very much suck even in pokemon with the trainers you end up turning into solid snake cause you are sick of the fucking battling and you want to just get to the next location and continue the story still waiting on bookworm adventures switch only fans are willing to kill to justify this 30 dollar game as a aaa title its clearly not 710 at best well ill buy it pokemon meets inception you mean jojos bizzare adventure rip off for those who will get offended by this video please try to remember 2 things 1 dunkey has mentioned disliking rpgs in the past so this doesnt come as a surprise 2 this is his opinion which means its how he sees the game and his experience with it if you dont agree thats fine but it doesnt speak for you or your experience with it so calm down please thank you well shit i had so much hope for this game rip as far as random encounters go i hate when its anywhere on the playfield at least pokemon makes it somewhat strategic in only certain areas like grass that you can choose to avoid or even chop down entirely people salt over a video game review i love the internet this video made me want to play halo 2 psycho mantis your excellency is this the sequel to octodad finally dunkey releases an unpopular opinion and people dont blow it off as satire definitely not a strong sequel to octodad at all huh this may be the first time i dont agree with a dunkey video this game is fantastic dunkey reviewing jrps is so cringylike we get it dude you hate these types of games doesnt make them bad games just means you have different taste personally i hate platformers but ya dont see me takin a sht on mario love the aesthetic and gameplay hate the story your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency psycho mantis your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency now this is a video i can get behind made some fair points i can respect that the clerics story was trying at times so after what dunkey said in the video just remember that he himself says that he despises jrpgs or any rpgs for that matter in one of his videos since turnbased combat is his demise in video games this is his personal opinion i just hope that not everyone will decided not to buy the game because of this vid its a good game even the voice programmer is bad have at you twice during a fight with a snail no no no no at most every three snails you should say hey i found lunch dunkey my excellency an good battle system utterly ruined by repition and a boring story someones been taking notes from modern square enix you know its dunkey when he doesnt like a turnbased jrpg this is what i expected from the trailers and is why i havent bought it yetalthough i will eventually this game is cool but bookworm adventures deluxe is the best why are you reviewing a game that came out 67 years ago this was a magnificent game review your excel cough ahemvideogamedunkey the random encounters arent that bad if you have ophilia cyrus in your party they have support passive skills that allow to not getting into battle super often this game has a lot to offer the mechanics in boss fights is fun and difficult at the same time worth the play through even if youre new to jrpg games your excellency p s y c h o m a n t i s my favorite kind of dunk video the one where he picks apart a game because its just not that fun what did you play chapter 1 and decide it was shit holy shit your taste is terrible they acctually do interate and have more complex histories if you keep playing and try out the other chapters they talk make jokes and prim even makes cys learn to dance the many character with their own story sound like a dnd campaign each charcter there has a background byt they group together for whatever reason sounds like dunkey needs to play vesperia well the reason why the story is cringeworthy is largely because youre playing it on a disgusting english dub i mean youre wrong you dont have to grind in this game the game throws you into boss fights constantly about 1 every hour and a half you have to spend very little time grinding in order to be competitive with these fights also its kind of shitty to call a game bad just because you dont like the genre like you saying the game is bad for having turn based combat and random battles is like me saying halo is bad because it has shooting i am not saying the game is perfect but this review feels halfassed why didnt you dunkview before i bought the game why dunk barley this was a really good video your excellency 1 the knight guy decides to find the comrade that usurped the king because he finally had a lead on him 2 you cherry picked the worst dialogue in the game and dragged it on 3 youre supposed to hit weaker enemies with their weakness so they are paralyzed and unable to move this makes grinding easy and rewards you in the process 4 undertale is ass game is amazing and so is the combat xd wait is this sponge bob battle for bikini bottom video hasnt even been out for a while but those dislikes are insanely high the only things i dislike about this game are the cutscenes some aspects of certain stories and voice actors the pacing of the cutscenes are slow as hell and the dubbed actors are atrocious aside from that the music battle graphics and literally everything else is perfect in my opinion lets fight this level 1 snail 1 defense weak to daggers hits with sword hmmmmm honestly the only real problem i have with this game as a huge jrpg fan is and its a big one theres no over arching story the characters no matter how interesting you try to make them no matter how well voice acted they are come across as uninspired dribble because they act solo through the whole game theres no real development no interactions between them the game kinda just happens and it feels like a collection of side quests rather than its own game you mean to tell me its guys like dunkey that wants to push jrpgs to look more like action rpgs theres still people who complain of how jrpgs play during combat im sorry dunko but your opinion is wrong when the majority zigs dunkey zags a is there are least japanese audio in the game to make the dialogue more bearable it is from the same developers who created bravele default and second those games were repetitive cringe fest that only weeaboos would enjoy they were so stupid sick and boring that i felt fooled by positive reviews i refuse to believe that people who are able to write a professional review would enjoy that trash it was probably bribed reviews and they are repeating the same corrupted scenario with this lazy trash too thanks for an honest nice video videogamedunkey i wish next time they wouldnt forget to bribe you too and would pay twice more than they usually pay for positive reception he nailed it this time really gotta agree with dunkey this time i didnt like the demo and i avoided this game ever since bout to nut your excellency leave it to dunk season 4 idk why japan eats this shit up make longer videos you sad loveable ball of fuck 3 yo i think youre missing the point of this review fellas hes saying that this is basically the most jrpg a jrpg can possibly be without any real crossover appeal like persona 5 and shit so if you dont like jrpgs theres not a lot there for you on an unrelated note anyone remember those garfield pet force novels where he and his friends got swole and fought crime in outer space that shit was bonkers meh i liked the game i hate this video dunkey becauyse you are black i agree with his points its not a perfect game by any means but still worth a play through if you like jrpgs typical weebo shit games play bravely default and persona you will change your mind also phantasy star series is an honorable mention god i love that game insert joke about bookworm adventure deluxe suck me weebs to completion this game looks like it was made in the final fantasy v era of rpgs as great as it sounds octopath traveller is another square enixs version of pokemon videogamedunkey here made an excellent point on whoever invented the random encounter system ive been watching dunkey for fifteen years and i have to say that im shocked that he did not enjoy a jrpg damn this man speaks truth this game is so over hyped its not even funny it may be a good jrpg but no way in hell its a 9510 goty material in 2018 so sick of all these reviewers on youtube basically regurgitating the same opinions as the mainstream reviews from igngamespot with no original thoughts of their own i dont mind turn based random encounters but the storys disjointed nature makes me sad guy that dislikes core elements of jrpgs dislikes new jrpg more at 11 make it more like knack 2 isnt this technically a dunkview its actually good but it is very jrpg i think that might even be why dunks didnt make this a dunkview he knows hes biased so its like saga frontier but with no combos am i understanding this correctly why would you play and review a jrpg if you hate jrpgs srsly why oh wait cuz money but but your excellency its supposedly a heart warming game your excellency reminds me of final fantasy or the crystal games thats why i love videogamedunkey he hate this kind of game and i like this kind of games he explains this on his reviewers video his opinion is consistent and besides i dont agree with his pov dunkeys points are pretty valid good job donsley i honestly love the style and animations tho the mixture of 2d and 3d with excellent lighting is pretty unique why do some people hate random encounters so much i find scripted enemies to be way more boring but i agree that slow menus and interfaces need to be wiped from the face of the earth it wasnt even the random encounter or turnbased nature of the combat in dunkys example it was how long it took to conclude the fight that wasnt even fighting and the lameness of the actions pretty much nailed the issues i had with the game when i tried it oh well at least chrono trigger still exists the best game of all universes and timelines this game is so ugly when i said its not an aaa game and should not have aaa price people bashed me dunkey play darwin project next please waiting on the next dunkview they help me know which games are good since he sees the flaws in the games fuckin random encounters are bullshit i thought it was octodad part 2 he blew ityour excellency why does everybody think dunkey is this god and that when he reviews a game you cant disagree with him lmao what a great video your excellency even a day old hamburger looks good to a starving man im just waiting for the knack 2 jrpg remix another video thank you your exellency ill have to wait for disgaea 6 like its kinda obvious that unlike most games dunky does these on he didnt get very far in this game at all i get that somethings get played up for comedic effect but its very unlike dunky to lie about a game so i imagine this is just a jump on a trend because the characters do interact with each other and the easily disposable enemies are very easy to beat if he had used one ability olbric the fighter he chose had he would of one shot the snail all in all i love dunky and am saddened by this 3 finally one of the worst subtypes of rpg jrpg its so disappointing that this game didnt turn out like it should have im not even sure who to blame they touted 8 characters forever why dont they interact the visuals are great why does beating one snail take four rounds of combat every pro has a substantial con hanging off it like a damn albatross i heard this game was good and was tempted to get it but then this video reminded me that much like dunkey i hate jrpgs and extremely slow grindy games thanks again dunkster i really like turnbased combat and none of that atb bs but dunkdunk is right its almost never done right i want nier automata to nintendo switch so dunkey when are you gonna make a video about bookworm adventures your exelency kinda wonder what your opinions are on games like the tales series i mean the stories really never crosses they all get together cause they re what a band of misfits there was a time when games could be this bland not anymore for me at least tho i get some people may enjoy it i feel bad for the bookworm adventures guy cause now everyone is stealing his joke wasnt expecting to watch this and get turned away from the game alas here we are your excellency wow i seen so many good reviews but i trust my man dunks thanks bud yes dunko we know you hate jrpgs whats the point of this video i just wish it was final fantasy tactics instead the music is pretty kickass what if knack was an rpg what i give the game credit for is that it makes the combat much more strategic than most turn based jrpgs most other games are comprised of hit it with whatever youve got until it dies combat which gets repetitive and dull if done wrong the developers did a demo and genuinely listened to player input regarding game mechanics but mediocre voice acting and bland characterization cant really be addressed by a demo playing such a frustrating game can be draining maybe recharge with a good game like bookworm adventures deluxe i knew your opinion before watching the video i just came to give you the dislike i would only buy if they hadnt made it turnbased combat 1010 ign your a buttface you know what game doesnt have random encounter bookworm adventures octopath traveler is insanely over hyped and turned out to be boring and dunkey is the only one saying it from what i find about time great video your excellency see i feel like you do give nintendo an easier time on reviews yes i know the game wasnt made by one nintendos developer teams but its their exclusive so my points are valid but you review the whole game mainly negatively but instead of giving it a score you just dont give it any score for any other company you wouldve made this a review video just saying also no hate on dunkey i love his videos im just saying i had an odd problem with the game with some of the volume mixing some voice lines are super quite and make you want to turn up the volume but then you get blown back by just super loud ones might have just been me but still super annoying other than that an okay game with bad pacing and some subpar endings cough cough tressa cough cough this games story and characters blow dont indulge this creatively bankrupt nostalgiabait genre do sea of thieves no way its as bad as xenoblade chronicles 2 though where is the rating that he puts in every game review no idea but listening to you berate this makes me want to play it gotta get past chapter 1 as that is just the intro to each character also theres fast travel and one of the characters has a support skill that lowers your chances of random encounters glad im not the only one that doesnt like this game i played the demo and found it so boring yo donk what do you think about chrono trigger you should do a dunkview on it or just answer my comment one of the few times i dont agree with donkey didnt even mention the fantastic music or visuals i like this game but it certainly isnt above criticism haha rnintendoswitch has been worshipping this game since before it was released and i had a feeling it was going to be a forgettable game thanks for telling it like it is dunkey probably not the best thing to watch if youre on the fence about the game i respect the man but its not hard to tell he dislikes jrpgs also dunno what hes smoking the cast does interact with each other generic jrpg 152156454 but this one has the square enix logo in it damm dunkey you realy went hard on octopatch i was excited about this game but now i think ill save the money after that review did you enjoy anything in the game like the music the story or the art for those of you who enjoy jrpgs dont let this review sway you characters will begin interacting with eachother in unique ways secondary jobs will be opened up to you which allow for cosmetic changes there is so much land to explore and this game is visually stunning if you enjoyed golden sun i highly advise buying this peace damn donkey i used to like you but now you made fun of a game i like i just cant take you seriously anymore worst video yet 55 really makes you feel like your excellency stop playing the demo love ya dunkey but i disagree with this one ive been loving every moment of this game there are definitely some shortcomings but ive been hooked since it came out your excellency this is a great video hey to everyone who will see this video and discredit the game please take a look at other videos most of the things dunkey was complaining about actually turn around in chapter 2 you get character interaction and super compelling stories also you can definitely notice connections between the stories even in their first chapters look at primrose olberics and cyruss first chapter and you will find similarities and cross overs olberic used to be my least favorite character but seeing his interactions with the others in their other chapters has made me like him so much more also dunkey really didnt touch on the combat system if you use their weaknesses and break them the fights are much shorter you can also dual class which makes the characters even stronger and funner to play lots of strategy there when building your party to me it seems like dunkey maybe just played the demo and didnt dive any further than that i will admit the random encounters and leveling can be an thank you dukney all my life ive hated random encounters and people hated me for it thank you thank you how are you level 22 and only doing 100 damage with only one character buy a sword my dude and get some more characters before yall shit on dunkey remember he does not like jrpgs i personally also do not like them but if you have played and enjoyed a jrpg in the past chances are youll like this game i feel like a jrpg being the main release of july might have hit a nerve this is one of the first videos in a very long time that ive felt was unfair almost every negative you stated is something universal in the jrpg genre its clear that you have a problem with the genre rather than this game specifically you made a video a while back about how hard it is to get an honest opinion from game reviewers because they show bias but you clearly arent practicing what you preach if this had just been a video that took the opportunity of octopaths release to explain why you dislike the genre then it would have been fair but instead you decided to take the opportunity to mask your issues with a whole genre as specific complaints on a new game that has been receiving praise just to be the guy that has a contrasting opinion its sad to see a youtuber with this much influence excersise his authority by misleading potential buyers just because they feel like it you have people in the comments who have clearly never played the game who are taking next review do tales of symphonia a better octopaths traveler that fixes the complaints you have for the most part plays on gamecube friggin amazing if you play its sequel tos dawn of a new age that one not so great but youre free to play it i believe there is a remastered version on either ps3 or wii comes with bonus stuff so i recommend that one if you want a modern version of it play tales of abyss is a good one its an unusual game style i agree thats is boring but there are public for that kind of game divinity original sin play it please trust me really dont see why this game had to be a switch exclusive feels more at home for the pc but eh we doesnt seem like im missing out on much here thank you imagine being so disconnected from another dudes definition of fun the game is actually good dunkey is just memeing as usual dismissing dunkeys opinion on this just because its a jrpg is stupid as he just stated that he liked persona 5 tbh the game looks fun af lol try darkest dungeon as it doesent have most of these issues also the stress bar is a really good mechanic i love random encounters and cant understand why you despise it but the way you explained how much you hate it cracked me the fck up that really does look like a cool game if they tweaked out the bad parts dunkey has said he doesnt like jrpgs why are you all surprised that he didnt enjoy a jrpg oof octopath travel caught the ligma suikoden 1 an early ps1 game had much bigger nicer more expressive sprite art than this 2018 game i dont care if they were shooting for a retro style these tiny blurry desaturated sprites look bad each new game bashing i feel closer to dunkey when i see people praising ubisoft for example whilst theyre doing today the same shit theyve been shun for in the past and then i hear a dunkey in the dark taking a big shit on them it feels good same here i love you and all by why bother reviewing a game in a genre that you hate we all saw this verdict coming so if i convert this from the dunki scale its a 710 right i mean he said in his game critic vid he has no patience and hates anime so a partly egdy animeish rpg is not really the game for him so why is he doing a video on it dang i was really hoping that you would put up a bookworm adventures 2 video damn perhaps the most controversial video since his bubsy one looks like a half 2d minecraft mixed with pokeon with some trashy shaders ah yes a quick and contentless video about a popular game to cash in on that youtube money i mean if you dont like jrpgs anyway whyd you buy it in bravely default you could turn off encounters at any point as sort of a choose your own pacing and difficulty option is this not an option in this game i loved that feature dunkey how could you forget the most important element dont worry ill tell them dont forget to like comment and subscribe i completely get the whole random encounter thing but everything else just kinda looks like a mediocre jrpg i dont think you needed to make a video about this and it wasnt that great your excellency doesnt even sound like a real word anymore waiting for the reading comments video man i was just waiting the entire video for that but moment however it never arrived this poor game the game sucks bruh this isnt book work adventures deluxe 2 shots fired octopath and xeno2 damn dunkey loves nintendo this isnt a review this one came out so much sooner than expected thank you for your blessing mr donkey i enjoy the game but i could not agree more with your point about none of the characters interacting with each other at all i found that really weird have you heard of played darkest dungeon and if so what are your thoughts im so relieved to know im not the only one that despises turn based combat and random encounters take the random encounters out like in persona and it can be kinda fun but its so fucking rage inducing when youre just trying to get somewhere and you have a constant knot in your stomach praying there wont be a random encounter and then of course there is one cuz they happen nonstop and as you also touched on killing trash mobs takes 2 fucking hours lol save playing dumb for april fools dsp jr i love you but this seems to be a tad biased towards your on values why are half the comments in this video people talking about how dunkey said he didnt like jprgs despite playing and making a video on one what a bunch of guys thanks for the honest review i almost bought that game good to know i almost downloaded this nothing compared to bookworm adventures deluxe 3d so this game looks really good and the only complaints where minor nice glad pokemon lets go wont have random encounters i dont see dunkview so im guessing this is a joke it honestly seemed like a cool concept at first but i started playing the second demo and lost interest yeah octopaths storys suck but its gameplay rocked and at least primroses final villain was good still as cartoonishly evil as all the rest but good because he was her joker basically lol i give this game an excellent c great video as always dunkey although i am personally enjoying the game i can understand alot of the points made in this video keep up the good work man so did you just dislike this one game or the entire genre of turn based jrpgs personally i enjoy turn based combat and random encounters im probably in the minority here though your excellency you should play book worm deluxe can you do h3 podcast again please i appreciate this video cause i was really thinking about buying this game but was on the fence about it i just dont have the time to grind out a slow paced game like this especially if the small scale stories dont really intertwine that was something i was kinda looking forward too owell another missed game thanks dunkey i never have to deal with grinding in this game most of the fights are easy youre likely with area where your guy did not start so you dont have a weak point to trigger people saying he is just like the game reviewers he doesnt like but hes saying the exact opposite of what they are also we all fucking know he hates these games so it obvious he aint gonna like this either like i really dont like pokmon games and theyre trying replicate old still turn based games am i gonna like it of course not doesnt mean im wrong or your right just an opinion so no need to get triggered over it the color palette is even more boring than virtual boy games wow i played the demo and said almost all the same things its nice to know im not alone on this i cant belive this is a retail game dunkey can you please make a vid on the r6 twomad tournament you were in wondering if turnbased combat can ever have a creative solution to fix its boring aspects dont get me wrong in the beginning turn based combat can be fun and has potential every game nowadays with this system makes you rely on spamming attack until you hopefully kill your target if you fail you go spamming attack on lower level targets until you yourself level up to spam attack on a stronger target spells are usually limited and are only used to accompany attacks or to heal yourself to continue attacking there has to be a diagram out there somewhere which displays how everything you do just revolves around attacking and also shows how there are no other strategies to taking on foes i wouldnt label something like undertale as a solution as its passive mechanics are only used to drive the story and do not carry traditional timebased mechanics instead adopting a kind of bullethell dodging mini game its much more enjoyable yes but isnt what the answer im ive heard nothing but praise for this game lately interesting ik this was dumb from the moment i saw it i had to look to the comments for actual reviews of the game what is happening i think you should try to play divinity original sin i didnt like turn based combat too but that one is pretty good and some mechanics like damage by environmental destruction moving exploding barrel using electricity when its raining etc make the game more enjoyable and not just duh better spam this spell its eazzy also in this game there are interactions between your party members anyway maybe you wont see this comment but just in case you should really try to play this game ps i personnally prefered the 2nd game over the first so if you want to check ou the series you can play the one you want because the story in the 2nd game takes place a thousand years later why did you even bother playing this shoulda played bookworm adventures instead the 8 bit characters give me that fire emblem feels haha he did not say it is garbaje he just said that he does not like it that means it is ok liked the video but wish it was bookworm adventieed you should do a review on that ill have the spaghetti and meatballs honestlythank you dunkey i thought i was going crazy with everyone praising octopath i hate it i actually hate this game and im a huge fan of jrpgs its just soooooo bleghand cringeyand the story and character development is cookie cutter turned up to 11 if you want a good jrpgjust play knack 2 bb bubsy 3d is much better than this looks like dunkey ran out of nintendo platformers again better luck next time dead game damb thats a lotta dislikes if youre a fan of old rpgs from the snes era like chrono trigger final fantasy vi and super mario rpg youll like this game if you dont like turnbased combat like dunkey does you shouldnt be playing it let alone reviewing it ditching a game just because its from a certain genre is a bit childish as much as i love dunkey he flopped really hard on this one its as if im a food reviewer but i hate pizza and then i go and fucking review dominos no shit sherlock is anyone else getting sick of game devs using the pixel art style i feel like at this point its just used as a crutch to avoid having to use up processing power and cheaply invoke nostalgia thank you sir dunk your excellency this isnt super mario bros 2 i always thought this game looked terrible when it was first announced and now i have the facts of a respectable intelligent reviewer with no bias to turnbased rpgs to back me up honestly i dont know the point of this video anyone thats seen your previous stuff already knew you wouldnt like this game why make this those are valid criticisms thank you for your input you should do book worm adventure deluxe dunkey hates jrpgs because you cant date lex the bookworm from bookworm adventures aint no paper mario ill say that thanks man he isnt even going to mention those visuals i jizz in my fucking pants everytime i look at footage of this game it looks so fucking cool i know donkey is poking fun at the game and that he hates jrpgs but i was hoping he would of given the game credit where is due i might not like most of the nintendo games that much because i prefer rpgs with amazing story music and character development but i acknowledge that nintendo excell at making games fun and have tight gameplay either way funny video as always dunkey dunkey youre being pretty hard on your own game why did you design it this way if you dont even fucking like it ya but you bought it so they already won rip thats it dunkey love you bud but i came to you to get an honest review of the game you told me oh no i hate rpgs the characters are probably boring but thats it thats your whole review 15 dunkviews awesome soundtrack though dunkey is my excellency i was surprised he even reviewed this i knew he just wasnt going to like it i mean its not for everyone i love jrpgs and its kind of lackluster tbh how did he know the snail was weak to dagger weapons while playing as olberic the game encourages you to play as all the characters so that you can take advantage of the enemys weaknesses if you struggle against an enemy find the nearest town and recruit the character the game is designed well enough to not overwhelm you with information but treats you as a human who can learn just play the demo its freaking fantastic one of the best ive experienced and easily one of the switchs best releases theres a reason physical copies are sold out unconcerned with watch time your videos get right to the damn point i keep wailing on this one enemy over and over again with the wrong attack this game is so boring well hi there dean takahashi what an absolute misrepresentation of the combat system as if 99 battles are like that even if youre not using the break system after dunkey whined about sexualization in xenoblade chronicles 2 im convinced he just has an antijrpg agenda to push but but but he loved persona 5 yeah because he follows the pack i got the game and played for like an hour and havent even got to the combat yet lol hey can you do bookworm adventures i dunno if im happy or mad that you tried this game probably a bit of both your excellency i knew you wouldnt like it these game arent for you your excellency but props for trying to like another jrpg your excellency a jrpg with subpar voice acting and shitty friendship script gee who wouldve known i think my main problem with jrpgs is that the battles dont require you to be there in normal jrpgs you tell the character to attack and they attack but then in both mario rpg series you actually attack the enemy yourself if you want to swing a hammer you have to be actively playing the game to maximize the swing you have to be active to jump on the enemy twice in one turn you have to be there and be focused to dodge or guard whatever crazy shit some of the later bosses throw at you if you can just press a a few times to watch your character swing their sword and then instantly kill some weak random enemy then that isnt engaging or neccesary meanwhile the enemy encounters in areas in mario and luigipaper mario games need you to at least have some modicum of focus and feel like theyre actually part of the area that youre able to avoid rather than oop random snail in the cave press some buttons youre not wrong but i do find the game mostly enjoyable i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys classic jrpgs such good graphics beautiful music and incredible combat whats the song played at the end of the video make a ff9 video kept english subtitles and used japanese ova i was wondering about that last night how the characters dont interact with each other does kind of suck dunkey points out all of the most crucial flaws in this game incredibly well but also manages to miss all the beauty and greatness that the game has to offer i think this is very clearly because of his bias against jrpgs which is more than finei cant stand fps gamesespecially because he even states this bias clearly to start off moreover he decided to make this more of a solo video and not a complete review not even giving it a rating at the end specifically because of that bias and the fact that he probably hasnt finished the game tldr he makes really excellent points on what the game is lacking in things that remove it from the realm of the best of the best jrpgs but misses out on a ton of its charm and hype didnt even mention the insanely good soundtrack and clearly didnt see it through to the end you excellency its called hentai and its art i am struck by a line in one of dunkeys earlier videos im not a huge fan of rpgs so you know that if i review one its probably decent even if i dont like it or something like that i think it was the game review video i prefer the pentapath stationarer my subscription to dunkey was free but it saved me 60 was worth i feel as if its supposed to be generic and cliche its almost like a throwback to the first few final fantasy games which alot of people cant play anymore because of the systems they were on just a fun generic jrpg not trying to be anything more and nothing less you showed olberic who in my opinion is the only character in octopath whos story is a little on the generic side but with 8 protagonists its not gonna be easy to write a 1010 story for each of them the likes of primrose and therion however their stories are topnotch but hey thats just one guys opinion yong out he didnt play past the first chapter hes flat out wrong about the characters not interacting but he would have had to play the game to know that im not a fan of the voice acting but the writing is actually fantastic he didnt even mention the magnificent music the character are far from generic but again he would have to play the game to see that disappointed in him for making a video this stupid this game is like a love letter to jrpg fans which means not for dunkey if you are mad at dunkey for making a video with a opinion you are either a spineless b retarded c both the visuals on this game just look so generic its like the most cut and pasted anime artstyle that is seen a million times before yo dunkey just wanted to know did you like skies of arcadia at all i felt that octopath traveler had a really similar vibe and feeling as that game dunk reviewed octopath hes gonna fucking hate that game 4 minutes later yup dunkey i love ya man your videos are usually super funny and youve introduced me to games ive really enjoyed i can understand that you dont like this game cause you dont like common jrpg tropes but why do you need to delete negative comments about your review thats shady man the resources used to create this game couldve been better used to make a proper ff6 remake whats the rating got here again under 1 mil im on a roll or need to get my priorities straight this may be a bit biased since i love jrpgs but i dont really agree with dunkey on a lot of his points i feel like most of the shit he demonstrated in this video only happens if you have no prior knowledge of jrpgs and no patience at all like the whole slime thing he clearly had a dagger which the slime was weak to that fight could have been cut to half if he had used it i understand why people would appreciate the opinion of someone who usually dislikes jrpgs but stating their opinion while not explaining everything like the vulnerability sistem which is nothing new to the genre but its prob the most fun aspect of combat is just going to upset fanboys and the like i do agree that the whole characters not interacting with eachother is extremely weird but in terms of each individual character their story and personality is just fine for a classic jrpg they clearly werent trying to break the genre with this game generic or troupy does not equal bad i think a lot of you should watch dunkeys video about game critics before you get too upset about this one i dunno i tried playing the demo twice but each time it was just so freaking wordy i could get into it at all honestly the only game that handles random encounters well imo is pokmon my biggest problem with them is that i could be walking in some open field and then i take two steps and some giant lizard kicks me in the groin its like really off putting when you cant see the enemies in front of you but what pokmon does is that it only puts random encounters in either tall grass or in caves the tall grass is an excuse because youre not supposed to see them if they are hiding and in caves it sort of works because its supposed to be dark so getting surprised by a pokmon is to be expected it pretty much has designated safe zones and danger zones that the play can avoid in some cases and in any case the play always knows when to expect a random encounter big fan of the 3 second clip of the sephiroth song when he brought up his distaste for random encounters i think that when you were addressing 2018 e3 you spent a second dissing octopath traveler as a nobody in the scene of gaming so when it actually turned out to be well received you had to do a video poking at it can anyone tell me the intro song i cant say i agree but going back to your video on critics i dont have to like everything you say to find your reviews funny or worthwhile in some way all these dumbos in the comments saying you shouldnt review games you dont like what a bunch of amateurs i felt this way until i hit chapter 2 on the characters they become far more fleshed out plus there are interactions from chapter 2 onward probably the only guy im subbed to that actually despised the game lol not only am i enjoying the hell out of it though ot continues to sell out in some regions in japan its so bad that used physical copies are being priced new to each their own i rate this game higher than xenoblade chronicles 2 personally you are a hack you got thousands of years of literature and this bland dump is all nintendosquare can muster its just a 50 hr grind fest id rather get my grind on at the strip club for 5 minutes and id be happier with my purchase the game looks nice dunkey is our excellency kicked into a pit of spikes and shot with a bazooka love it dunkey thinks sonic mehnia a 10 that explains his shit taste just try earthbound its fackin undertale on drugs thank you your excellency souls this is proof that you have a nintendo bias if this game was on the vurtral boy you would think it greater then knack 2 but nope you just hate games on non nintendo platforms like switch and samsung galaxy s5 i actually really enjoy the core gameplay loop but yeah the stories and dialogue are trash spoilers for the first hour of octopath when you finish chapter 1 of your main character the screen pops up with this is just one of 8 stories you should go recruit the other 7 adventurers in a huge tutorial style window then on the map it shows those 7 other character locations and says that the recommended level for their chapter 1 stories is 5ish the same as your level it then shows your main characters chapter 2 at 22ish after finishing all 8 chapter 1 stories your party is around level 25 and can start on the chapter 2 stories to play it that wrong for that long its either willful or completely ignorant it would be like somebody complaining that dark souls is really hard because they never equipped any weapons handholding only goes so far its far more likely that he played it right then made a clip of him playing olberic solo at level 22 to make a joke we all know dunky doesnt like jrpgs but we all clicked anyway from what i managed to piece together based on this video octopath traveler is dragon quest ivs distant cousin now you can experience shit 8 times love all kinds of rpgs played the demo and was pretty interested to start and i have to say i agree with every point dunkey made holy shit is the writing atrocious i had to put it on japanese voices just to not shoot myself in the face even after that the way everything is written is just not good the writing makes characters to kill them off even though there wasnt enough to get invested and they want to have brilliantly smart characters or cant seem to follow any logic at all the most interesting thing to me about this game was going to be the prospect of eight characters interacting and their stories intertwining turns out there wasnt hardly an attempt at achieving that the combat has interesting elements with being able to boost almost any ability but thats about where its complexity stops really wanted to like this game but its really not up to standards i dont believe anyone who says the stories pick up i played three characters in the demo if you i was originally excited to play this game but then i played the demo and was instantly bored and unimpressed ive played enough of these to know where it was going why are the most pissed off people always the shitty weebs did dunkey hurt your feelings i dont think people understand the term game reviewer people say dunkey isnt a game reviewer or shouldnt be doing this and people really dont understand the concept if you play a game you have an opinion on it no matter who you are the only difference is dunkey makes videos about his opinions to inform other people what he thinks about a game and to express his side of the argument saying he isnt a game reviewer is just false he has literally talked about a game from a critical aspect online you dont need a pass to be a reviewer it can be anyone what annoys me the most is this isnt actually a review i will admit the title should have probably communicated this better but its more of his first impressionsrant instead of a review sure a first impressionsrant shares similarities to a review but a big difference is the fact it isnt a review tells the audience this shouldnt be what you base your purchase of this game on and more of his personal experiences wit i appreciate your opinion even when you dont keep it to your undergarments your excellency that your excellency scene isnt nearly as bad with the japanese voice acting the english voice actors really dont put the same tone or cadence in their lines honestly good video he explained his points pretty well i love turn based combat but the issue with most jrpgs is that they dont require any strategy you can just blast through the whole game using the same couple moves over and over and just grind a bit more if you run into a challenge yeah octopath underwhelms really exhibits xtra clichd execution looks lifeless empty nice coverage yo this game is amazing obviously people that dont like jrpgs like dunkey wont like the game because its literally a fucking jrpg with every single feature of a jrpg i really dont understand this video its like a guy calling an fps shit just because he hates fps games its obviously biased and doesnt mean the game is bad at all btw all of his major complains go away after like 2 hours of total gameplay there is a skill that literally cuts the amount of random encounters you get in half and its one of the first skills you unlock and the stories really pick up after the intro this game looks like that chapter in history class that everyone slept through i absolutely adore this game i was more than hyped when it was announced and when it released i spent every waking moment playing it the stories while yes they are fairly standard jrpg fair are unique enough to hold their own and each characters is varied so if you dont like one characters your bound to find one of them enjoyable or relatable i personally enjoyed them all yeah ill admit some of these are basically every jrpg plot ever but i liked the characters enough to ignore it and just enjoy their stories my favorites characters are ace attorney cyrus albright and capitalism ho tressa im most surprised that dunkey didnt like the combat its basically like persona with a dash of bravely default the break system turns mindless attacking into thoughtful strategy would you want to break the enemy before they go or maybe you need more time to set up some big damage while theyre stunned should you spend your bp for a max boosted skill or maybe save it to bre xenoblade chronicles 2 is one of if not the best game on switch right now all of your points are completely true but i have always these types of jrpgs regardless anybody who enjoyed the old final fantasy games would probably enjoy octopath traveler hey dunkey can you play threads of fate at some point its a quirky game with a small cult following released by square reggy blew it 5 this game try to hard to be like old clasicschronobreathmanafinal fantasylucaterranigmalunardragnvagranttcticassega rpgs and long etci think based inn my old experience this look just like genric rpgs nothing new o great to show stop showing thid awful consol called switch expensed and horrible justo plays amazing rpg maker do with less s money and more new stuff switch suck nintendo died un wii generacin stop playing switch tales nobody cares switchwhen steam gog etc have beter jrpg and new ideas cant believe that gaming media is hyping this up all it has going is the art style but we can all agree that the music is amazing you this guy havent played this fame more than one hour horrible video thanks for nothing dunky its funny that of all the characters he bashed he bashed the one with one of the better stories in the whole game but said nothing about alfyn with the boring ass story with zero character development havent played octopath so i have no idea what its like this video seemed unfunny to me even the dunkview videos are usually humorous but this video was kinda dull in my opinion i didnt like the voice acting in english either alfyn in japanese is incredible dunkey cant even break armor lmao kinda sad the bravely team went off to make this bravely default is one of my favorite games of all time and bravely second is almost just as good please if there is a god let there be a third papa johns ads youtube knows this video is bad but it doesnt matter i stopped listening to this guy after he said bubsy 3d was bad no offense to the donk but hes been pumping out videos lately id rather one long video rather than 5 three minute videos yeah right dunkey if other kinds of games are really so good why didnt you review them first bookworm adventures i stopped listening to dunkey after he said your excellency play league of legends mind you youre running your mouth tho i agree wirh you for the first time ever and thus your excellency a new dunkey comment section meme was born reminds me of the days of lufia 2 on the super nintendo lmao i havent seen this many angry faggots since they cancelled inu yasha cant wait for donkey to play the new wario ware when it comes out your excellency does this game make you feel like batman all im gonna say is persona and pokemon released the same year lol and mainline shin megami tensei games predate that but i understand what youre trying to say with persona 5 being like pokemon even i have to use it to explain it to people who dont know about megaten can you start rapping again instead thanks dunkers i love your videos when you shit on turn based combat games i can see your points but man i love them bahaha grew up playing chronos trigger final fantasy pokemon and so on and iv been looking forward to playing this game weebs coming out en force your excellency is totally played by prozd maybe sounds like it its like an actual dunkey review your excellency we need a gal gun 2 review dunkey made it clear that he do not like turnbased jrpg the fact that hes doesnt like this one shouldnt say anything to you if you do this is a nothing video loved the crono trigger music you keep talking about persona 5 dunkey but have you played persona 4 you should im still pretty much at the beginning god please tell me there will be something like a repel like in pokemon please whats even better about shooting grunts is getting the grunt party skull and shooting them in the head its more rewarding to hear that little hooray xenoblade 2 is better than all of the rpgs you mentioned dont me hurrah youre excellence videogamedunkey has uploaded today oof dunkey i would appreciate this more as a rant if you didnt cherrypick some issues the whole excellency dialogue happens for 5 minutes but you acted as if it was her entire character arc yeah itd get annoying to if i just edited every time sam said nathan or vice versa and cut out the entire conversation in uncharted which is what you did you just cut the entire conversation short just to show that a character uses a title then you proceed to just not play the game well like youre blaming the game for being slow when in all honestly you were ignoring the entire gameplay part of the game the point is that every enemy has a weakness to a certain weapon and only certain weapons go on certain characters otherwise the enemy gets a defensive boost the equivalent would be that in an fps you have different ammo types and certain enemies can only be hurt more with specific ammo but then you call the game really slow and drags on in the combat and show us a clip o dunkster we all know you hate jrpgs and turn based combat you no that too so why the hell would you play a game you know your gonna hate and make a video fussing about it all your doing is hurting the success of a game that doesnt deserve all this hate i completely agree with the beginning about storytelling in games i really cant play jrpgs nowadays and get invested because of how bad the writing is compared to the masterpieces naughtydog puts out i just cant wait til my more dunkey shirt is in honestly will have to disagree although i do like boring turned based battles and random encounters due to the fact that its fun to me what makes this game enjoyable that i keep playing is the vast world and exploration the characters are wildly different and theres many ways to go about to completely destroy your foes theres many jobs super bosses random dungeon the music is really great that it makes me want to fight battles longer and having the time to think and strategize in a battlewinning its fun honestly wish youd put more time into the game instead of rushing to say whats bad first sorry dunkston gonna have to disagree with you on this one the later chapters are worth the wait ill concede to the argument that the storystories momentum is brought to a halt but once you collect all of the characters the skys the limit you can choose not to finish a characters story as well im sure ill skip one or two that was honest what i really like is dunk is doing something unique here he is saying that a very critically acclaimed game has a lot of problems and usually people see that a game has a great review score and they wont say anything bad about it if they dont like it then they will say its good but its not for me no thats bullshit explain why you dont like it do a proper review scrap that dont review it critique it tell us what is wrong with the thing people are so fond of that is what i think dunkey was doing here and i appreciate that this game isnt on pc why are you even reviewing it come on brah that art style is alluring as heck though why play and bash an rpg with two of the most hated systems you dont like i understand someone not liking those types of gameplay but just to bash a game because you already know you arent gonna like it come on dunk youre better than that you probably didnt even finish one of your own rules which is completing the game i love me some dunk but man did this video missed its mark uh oh youve stirred up the weeb nest here they come i for one am enjoying this game a lot i went in with zero expectations and have only played chrono trigger in terms of jrpg games i absolutely love octopath for what it is the art style the combat each characters story etc voice acting doesnt bother me all that much either i feel like it gives the game a certain charm which i personally like overall i think its a really fun game why are you deleting comments funny that i could tell the exact contents of this video by the likedislike ratio alone i played the demo and gave this game a hard pass you should change your youtube name to videogameexcellency this is why i turned it to japanese voices immediately i usually dont mind dub but its so bad in this game youve been releasing a lot of videos lately thank u mate oh no dunko almost everyone disagrees with what you said its ok just make a bookworm adventure deluxe video and everything will be fine i love your content dunkey but i feel like most of your complaints exist because you dont like the classic jrpgs that this game pays tribute to this comes off more like a critique of the genre than it does a critique of the game itself i agree that the pacing at the beginning is not great but the idea ends up being really cool and creative the combat in this game is honestly fantastic as well and is one of the better turn based systems ive seen its fine if you dont like the game but i dont really see the point in reviewing a game that is a purist throwback to games you dont seem to like very much great vid your excellency the only thing i got out of this review was that maybe i should play persona 5 a 3rd time be careful dunkey youve now invoked the wrath of classic jrpg fans dopped up on nostalgia can u do a other no man sky review when the new update comes out plz and thank you i fucking love this game i probably put over 30 hours into it already so good thanks dunkey for reminding us you dont like jrpgs reminds me of the cave a bit except in that game the individual characters had interesting stories good thing the option to play with japanese voices is available and im sure there are options to turn it off entirely which may be the best way to experience this game i really really hope you check out dragon quest 11 when it comes out it is turn based but theres not only twists and unique mechanics but encounters arent random to go into battle you have to strike an enemy or an enemy has to make contact with you so avoiding combat when you choose to is an option and now we wait for the comments saying that dunkey always praises nintendo games i normally enjoy your content but youre completely wrong about this game yup seemed pretty mediocre unless youre huge into the genre i gotta say bumbler interactive really isnt what it used to be this was the first rpg where i regularly skipped dialogue because so much of it was bland clichd and incredibly repetitive radom guy thanks for saving me i couldnt have done this without you same guy that enemy was too tough for me speechbubble 3 i need to train harder in future so i can protect my beloved ones speechbubble 4 because that enemy was too strong for me speechbubble 5 i couldnt have done this without you speechbubble 6 i wont let that happen again i promise omg skip all back to back spoken by random dude no 123 im pretty sure those writers were payed by the word i really like the combat though and ill keep playing i guess maybe the story will pick up im at chapter 3 i have to say while i personally enjoyed octopath you did a great with talking about the games flaws without delving into spoiler territory the general incentive of this sort of game i must applaud the quality of your review no rating i want to know how many 3ds it is out of a bubsy man the comment section is a shit show rofl really liking this upload schedule the character that always says letten bothers me so much because the way she uses it makes no sense its the past tense version of let she says letten my arrow fly when it hasnt even happened its like saying shot the gun as your line before you shoot a gun or moved the chair it doesnt work at all and its painful bbut donkey octopus diddler is a unique twist on the classic jrpg genre d why would you play a game that you hate all of its core mechanics its a really good game i can taste the weaboo tears in this comment section the worst offense this game makes is that theyve forgotten that there are colors and you should use them honestly one of your worst reviews you blatantly lie in the vid and your bias for jrpgs show im disappointed everyone know that we would rather be watching knack 2 baby donsley you are the best youtuber out there keep it up keep doing what you do while i was over seas my buddies and i would watch your videos and laugh our asses off they were one of the few things positive we had in our lives at the time youre the best and i thank you man nuf said hehe dunky u triggered the weebs jrpg sucks xd but the music man the music do overwatch videos again i think the main problem i have with this video is that it gives off the impression that the game is bad when in reality the came is a lot fun and the story may not be grounding breaking but its enough to compel you to keep playing for the combat but it would only been seen that way if youre already a fan of jrpgs turnbased combat and have come to accept that dialogue in jrps is going to come with a bit of cringe i hate platforming games i think every mario game thats come out has been shit i dont see the point of it theyre not mechanically challenging repetitive and i find the core gameplay loop to be unentertaining so why would i go out and buy mario odyssey then make a video confirming that yep platforming games are shit this game is a platformer ergo im not going to downvote the video its still a quality dunk vid and ill always support you for making a video on we it is you want to make a video on u could at least complement the soundtrack since u usually love games with good osts i think u shouldnt be so harsh if the game is just not made for you thats the same as me playing a generic shooting game and call it trash and make fun of silly stuff in the game im loving this game and its easily in my top 3 games for the switch at this point but hey its just opinions i knew i couldnt be the only one who thought this was trash xenoblade 2 is less cringy with japanese on is he shitting on ffx writing ok fair enough but still good game that really sucks because it looks so gorgeous the amount of dislikes is almost as high as the number of times she says your excellency damn people have been praising this game like crazy and boom dunkeys like yeah its shit lmao btw that snail wasnt lvl 1 its literally impossible to face a lvl 1 enemy when youre a lvl 20 character because the enemies slowly get stronger as you get strongerprogress through the story welp thats unfortunate but at least donko saved me another years worth of money on not buying a switch i fully disagree with your opinion and for the first time am really floored that we disagree so much but i know that u dont love rpgs turn based or random encounters which also fucking annoy me so i respect your opinion keep making great videos oh man dunkey never criticizes nintendo games but your excelency we cant forget about knack 2 your excelency just play chrono trigger it still holds up today as one of the best rpgs i would just replay chrono trigger instead of this this review was very straight to the point huh neat with me i have this very weird thing where games just either connect with me or dont for me i really enjoy kingdom hearts but dont like final fantasy i love pokemon but dont like older jrpgs like chrono trigger or secret of mana i enjoy metroid and love hollow knight but for some reason cannot get into any castlevania love xenoblade 2 and ni no kuni 1 and 2 with a burning passion but the tales games are very hard for me to play for some reason with games like octopath i just played the demo and understood it wasnt for me i get demos arent a great representation of the whole game but i tend to keep that feeling going into any game i play the demo of and so far every review of this game hasnt convinced me to give it another shot one thing i would say is good is the unique 3d pixel graphicsart style not gonna lie i think the only thing appealing about this jrpg would be those pretty 3d lookin maps dunkey sometimes i wonder if u have any soul left anymore tt the reviews are cool but try to keep some more funny videos coming as well d your excellency you should play book work adventures deluxe i think its really weird that dunky keeps reviewing games in a genre he dislikes with a combat system he dislikes i mean of course youre going to dislike octopath visuals look so good shame they didnt get anything else right your excellency wow thank you for killing my hype gotta admit the graphics look cool but it looks fuckin awesome to me is it better than knack your excellency anyone know what the outro song is back to bubsy 4d meh love you dunk but i think this is where our tastes just differ alot i like random encounters what when are you going to review bookworm adventures your excellency ill talk all the salt from the comments and put it on my french fries a serious dunkey video oh no yall remember the lord of the rings game on the gamecube that was some good turn based combat cant wait for shadman to get ahold of this game i cant be mad you dont like this game the music the combat systems in place like bp and break the graphics and the different classes really make this game one of my favorites this year i was surprised you like persona 5 one of my favorite games of all time but it had a lot more diversity than this game does it can be repetitive but i felt the game was rewarding and addicting im looking forward to your next video any exposure is good exposure so im glad you made a video about this game this video is a summary of what i think about almost any jrpg they dont know how to write dialogues and like way to much grinding 1010 would kick into a pit of spice and shoot with a bazooka again choices alter the story ahaha nah it gave a sonny vibe its funny watching people going on about how dunkey shouldnt shit on things people like yet hes done that to others games these very same people would applaud him for theres nothing wrong with dunkey sharing his opinion he has just as much of a right to do so as you or me plus the game has sold out twice in japan its doing perfectly fine for itself why are people mad i thought everyone knew his taste was trash knack 2 baby attacks 107 dmg heals 107 hp oh hell yeah youre the only youtuber i turn ad block off for your excellency to preface this i dont own and havent played octopath traveler aside from the demo awhile back i dont have any strong opinions on it and i typically enjoy jrpgs and turn based combat i think people are being a little ridiculous in saying things like dunkey shouldnt review games he doesnt like its true dunkey has admitted he doesnt typically like jrpgs for some of the reasons he listed in the video but that doesnt mean hes banned from trying any of them out he gave octopath traveler a chance and he didnt enjoy it as much as the next guy thats fine hes not being hypocritical to his opinions on game critics hes falling completely in line with what he said getting to know a reviewers tastes helps you determine whether or not you might like a game even if your tastes fall completely contrary to them he doesnt like more traditionalstyled jrpgs meaning that if you do youre probably going to like this game people are acting like want turn based done right try divinity original sin 2 its actually a work of art love your super detailed reviews dunk keep it up i dont look for dunkeys opinions towards turn based rpg games rarely does he ever have a good opinion of popular turn based rpg games we see it time and time again its fine hes not into the genre but there definitely seems to be bias against turn based rpgs vs some other games in a diff genre that are about the same quality yet he will love more he can be into whatever he wants to but you will always see him be more critical of them that aside the biggest fault that he mentioned j can agree with is being thrown around in stories its almost impossible to do an entire story of one character while enjoying the game bewildering dance from dancers solves the grinding issue but makes combat less fun i am trying my hardest to love the games so far and not regret my purchase but all of it has been a generic and bland experience so far but i havent completed chapter two of any of the characters stories yet so im trying to give it a chance i love jrpgs along with random encounters and turned based combat its just something about this has not wowed me yet remember in the game critics video he said you can understand where a reviewer comes from when you know about them dunkey doesnt like these types of gamestherefore his opinion is wrong in this one apologies your dunkcellency oh boy this gonna make people mad and here we see dunkey doing exactly what he criticized game critics for doing the your excellency issue is a nit pick its obviously a hold over from the japanese translation where that type of speech formal is not only normal but expected fight me dunderbutt ahhh another one of those classic i hate jrpg videos i love dunkey damn making fun a of a game that most people actually genuinely like we already know you dont like these kind of games oof10 for years ive asked that question hahahha as much as i am personally enjoying this game i agree that the group of characters does feel a bit disjointed at times other than that i love the combat and the world it is set in just comes down to personal preference nailed it this is not dunkview guys lol sorry bro but this has gotta be your worst video yet geez your excellency is sooooo 1200s and the fanboys have awoken i dont even have a switch and even i can see this is bait honestly i think the comments section is kinda biased against dunkeys pov and is now starting to nitpick and nitpick away at this video because on the internet opinions are illegal but dunkey i liked this game now im going to have to hate it hey heres a game everybody is loving let me gimme my opinion on it even though you clearly dont like the genre i dont understand why dunkey would even play a game that comes from a genre he clearly doesnt like he mentioned in his journalism video that he doesnt like jrpgs he might as well have said jrpgs are all bad and saved me three minutes of my life instead he picks at the game for being what its trying to be and then pretends thats objective criticism i love dunkey and have been subscribed for him for a long time and will continue to be subscribed as well im not saying its wrong to have a different opinion or anything but this video is like if i played mario and was like i hate how you have to jump on the platforms in this game about jumping why dont they make it so you romance the platforms instead i dont know if this is parody or irony but if you hate these games just say it dont spray it wow so many triggered weebs watched this vid 4k dislikes and top comments of a bunch of haters uh did u not even watch the beginning of the video he showed classic jrpgs like chrono trigger and earthbound along with a recent hit in persona 5 its when they become the complicated waste of time mechanics to increase gameplay hours along with a generic watereddown cringefest story like this one that it becomes a problem if you yourself like the game fine but leave it to certain square enix fuckboy fans to take a mans opinion out of proportion imagine being so impatient you ruin fun gameplay for yourself fucking arthas graphics look really good though yeah this game doesnt look that sharp but you know what game would take your breath away bookworm adventures deluxe boring disconnected story monotonous hardly promising 97 out of 10 ign ya blew it dunkey yea haha i knew you werent gonna like it for me its the best turned based game from square in a long time i thought it was worth it but hey thats me casual piece of shit this video reminds me of that time dunkey beat sky in bookworm adventure deluxe i considered purchasing this game but nah after the dunk view id say hell no that battle theme doe honestly didnt think youd even touch this game your excellency yes dungus we know that you hate animu now move on please and would you like a bucket of salt to go along with that sir if you hate random encounters turn based strategy battles systems then dont play games that rely those systems octopath is an awesome game imperfect sure but if you have enough of an attention span to build the story and characters its extremely entertaining narrative and combat system with fun challenges but to each their own if you dont like jrpgs dont play them seems simple to me ive been saying this since the demo first came outthis game is boring trash i dont think youre very credible as a game reviewer as you wont even give bookworm adventures deluxe a chance that game is a mastapiece person dunkey is so awesome how could you hate him dunkey makes video on game person likes person yep opinion discarded you didnt even give the game a chance bro it gets good 20 hours in but nooo you had to just play for 19 hours huh disliked unfollowed your excellency is the new psycho mantis dunkee can u review divinity original sin 2 its ok this is good but can u beat sky in this bideo gaem at least its pretty remember when you called out that reviewer for playing half way thru crash and put his review up well you did less than that now dunkey and the hypocrisy is showing alot in this review guys please please please this video isnt a review it doesnt have dunkview in the title or a rating at the end its just a rant kind of video stop saying stuff like oh dunkey you shouldnt review jrpgs if you dont like jrpgs also have you guys not watched his videogame critics video even if this is a review video and he doesnt like this particular videogame then anybody out there with the same taste in videogames would probably agree and not have to waste their time thinking about whether or not to try it out on the other hand if he did like it and people know he hates turnbased combat and jrpgs then it must be pretty damn good then youd have to think thay oh this must be pretty good since he doesnt usually like these kinds of games theres undertale for example which he did a gameplay video on and he clearly enjoyed fighting low level monsters in that game is how it feels to play wakfu maybe learn how to actually do the combat correctly and the level 1 snail would actually die in 1 or 2 hits they have weaknesses and in this game you have to use them meh he dont like jrpgs anyway idk why hed like this one any more thanks for the save dunk was about to head to the store and pick up octopath because it looked interesting thankfully i didnt spend 60 on a mediocre game hmm one of the few videos of dunkey that i dont agree with this games reminds me so much of bravely default one of the best rpgs of the last few decades the complaints he makes in this video are kinda nitpicky to be honest most of which arent even an issue once you get past a certain point people can say all they want that having a slow beginning means the game is bad all they want but the game is fantastic once you get going also theres never a point where you have to grind in this game as long as you have some kind of strategy outside of mashing the attack button you will never have too much trouble with any boss or enemy the dunkaful thing about beauty is his consistent opinions which differ from mine might check this game out now guys he literally brought this exact topic up in his reviews video if you love turn based strategy or jrpgs you dont go to dunkey as a reviewer because you know he already hates that kind of stuff or better yet you go to him knowing ahead of time that those things arent his cup of tea so you take his opinion with a pinch of salt dunkey will favor platformers or shooters because they are more engaging for him so if you hate those kind of games then dont immediately buy them if dunkey says the game is great different strokes for different people its okay not to like jrpgs but making a video saying octopath traveler is terrible for being a jrpg is kinda going a bit to far the story can use work but the overall game is fun and entertaining your excellency your supposed to be playing bookworm adventures right now the effort that you had to put in to make that snail fight look as bad as possible should be a clear indication of how biased and unfair this review is you had to go out of your way to remove party members from your team just so you could make it look as grueling as you could you may as well have told me how hard brocks gym was because it takes charmander forever to take down a geodude using nothing but scratch dont you dream to once co create an actual great video game that would be cool id play a dunkey developer game this octopath travelers actually good when you talk all high and mighty on a shitty game like cup head and prefer it over this or a good game like uncharted ur view and opinion is invalid esp when your channel is trying to be funny teying being the key word even i could have told you that dunk wouldnt like this game why on earth did he even buy it i was shitting on this game before it was cool and whats with all these new games coming out with 1632bit pixel art like its a design choice now that shit was great 25 years ago when it was pushing the envelope but if you arent an indie trying to use it to make ends meet put some damn budget into modern graphics that random encounter that takes five years is the problem with the newest pokemon they constantly call for help and it drags the hell out of what should be a quick battle or catch in this weeks episode of dunkey thinks he is a game reviewer but isnt this donkey wrong for this jrpgs are shit sorry do zucc become human next oh lord im so glad i watched this before buying it lol i might check out some other stuff because i actually freggin love turn based rpgs and there arent freggin any of those anymore gonna have to disagree with you on this one dunkey i absolutely love this game and i with a handful of exceptions tend to hate traditional jrpgs yo lot of weebs around here i mean who else plays these kind of shit games anyways stop deleting comments pl0x i understand you hate jrpgs but you seriously gotta keep shitting on xenoblade chronicles 2 i know its not the best in the series in fact i would even say its the worse but its still a pretty good game with a fun combat system and decent story ocean psycho mantis your excellency is this excel promo guys its not a review whats the point of reviewing a game in a genre you dont like if the video is just going to be i dont like this genre its like this every time before i watched the video i thought this would be a game about tentacle porn something tells me he didnt get past chapter 1 for either of the characters because the story and character development only improve still a great video from dunkulees you should try the trails series by falcom very story driven theres a turbo mode to skip stuff no random encounters good characters that has actual development amazing world building one of the best jrpg out there wow and a lot of people had recommended this game to me saying it was one of the best jrpgs ever glad i decided to get mario tennis instead i gotta say no interaction with the characters does seem pretty upsetting i cant wait to play this game now thank you dunkey this video was awesome this video doesnt make any sense i havent played octopath yet but this review sucks dick more proof that dunkey is way past his prime i like octopath traveler its fun a bit grindy but fun do do people know that youre allowed to have your own opinions your eccellency they do interact with each other look at the top right of your screen and press the sign when it indicates that your party wants to talk to each other reading the comments by all the butthurt octopath traveler fans is almost as entertaining as the video itself x people are going to say dunkey think its bad because he hates that genre but as a huge turn based lover and a fan of that a rtstyle the game is hugely over priced like its 30 dollars at most the story is uninspiried the voicing is uninspired the characters barely notice each others the music is okay the job actions outside of combat are more of a gimmick than anything else way overpriced for something that is all on the look and nothing on the inside put lisa and undertale within 2 seconds of each other ohhhhhhh dunkey whatve you done this still isnt bookworm adventures i just want bookworm adventures deluxe your excellency youre that excellency i dont mind random battles but i agree with everything else you said i played to a certain point and had no desire to touch it again he gave his opinion thats all i wanted to buy this game so badly but after this review my hype is kind of gone but the graphics look so damn good still gonna buy it though bcz dunkey hates 98 percent of all rpg jrpgs always has that boring repetitive gameplay dude best to put it on easy if theres an option and enjoy the story unless they have you grind to a certain level to proceed on with the story dunkey i love you man but you are wrong because i like this game youre free to hatelike on something but using your bias to misrepresent it is a different story come on dunkey youre better than this this game wouldve been great in 2006 on the gba yet here we are to all yall saying that this is an unfair review and getting ready to type up a storm keep in mind that this isnt a review did it say dunkview in the titleor in the video did he give it a score did he say it was a review no these are just his thoughts about the game and hes entitled to them just as you are entitled to have similar and differing opinions about the game yall dont have to write up a complaint because he didnt like it gotta say it looks amazing the shading is very well done but graphics dont make a game i can respectfully disagree i personally really enjoyed the combat in this game i wanted to shoot myself when she said your exellency doesdoes he think reggie makes the games wait what does ophilia call you again i cant remember playing jrpgs with english voices remember the holy trinity of what dunkey doesnt like rpgs anime and turn based combat this has all of that so of course he wont like it im surprised youd bee in the minority of people that dont like the game looked like something youd like next review any pokemon game oh shet i was going to buy this game too lol edit never mind i just needed to read more comments i agree with the dunk 100 on this one and trust me i love jrpgs i think the biggest problem for me is the lack of interactions between each of the characters it feels like a handful of fragmented short stories that have no grand purpose and due to that the story suffers when i think of a jrpg i think of a wonderful plot that delves into the characters as well as the party as a whole and how the gameplay and world reflects that when compared to last years persona 5 a masterpiece like chrono trigger or even ff 6 which octo is supposed to emulate it really falls flat it doesnt innovate it doesnt do anything to push the genre the strategic gameplay changes feel drab and uninspired just my thoughts respect all the different opinions here tho 3 your excellency is going to become an ongoing joke now isnt it to anyone and everyone salty about this review please view dunks bideo game critics psycho mantis yeah but the art style though finnaly a review of this game i can relate with although i disagree completely with this review i understand and respect his reasoning for disliking this game and other games like this one id love to see him make a video just on jrpgs in general explaining in detail all of the issues he has with them i agree with him this isnt something i really want to play in this age chronotrigger and earthbound are among some of my favorite games but turn based jrpgs just arent something i want today unless they have some huge innovation ill stick to the witcher for a story experience or play path of exile for the number crunching dungeon crawling type of gameplay experience oh what a surprise a guy who doesnt like jrpgs doesnt like a jrpg what a shock guys who handed dunkey a jrpg we all know its his kryptonite dunkey what was your rating for this game the color scheme is so browwnnn and muted it makes me sleepy man i knew this game was gonna suck ass but turns out its worse than that its a shitty secret of mana 2 rip off that is as lazy as possible damn chill with these comments its dumb to say he cant review a jrpg because he has a bias against them its like saying some one shouldnt review the game because he loves jrpgs and that will alter there final score there isnt a dunkview tag so im wondering if this is satire or in some form of a juke on your reccomendation i picked this up its great thanks dunkey omg i was literally at gamestop with a copy in my hand that i finally tracked down and i watched this video while waiting in line needless to say i opted out of buying that game and picked up breath of the wild that was in my other hand instead i got to my car and went back to buy it lol 2 games wooo the only problem i have with this game is that its not very streamlined at the start so you assume you must collect all 8 characters but then you see all of the chapter 2 storys are like lv 22 required and your main guy is only 16 there must be something im missing but i have to assume you must straight up grind several levels of an entire group in between chapters i still enjoy the game though you have to either play only five minutes of this game which dunkey obviously didnt do or choose to completely misrepresent how the combat system works in order make the point dunkey did its ironic because if anything octopath is a fantastic game for doing exactly what he says better games do smaller encounters can be quick and satisfying the battles are based around three systems boost points enemy weaknesses and breaking enemies each has a counter of how many times they need to be hit with attacks they are weak to in order to break them which stuns them for the rest of the turn and the next one and massively lowers their defenses boost points in turn can be either used to do additional physical attacks making it easier to break them or enhance the power of your abilities letting you damage them harder after theyre broken giving the game a level of decisionmaking on that every time i hit a random encounter in this game i immediately think wh i personally think this was a pretty poor assessment cherry picked a couple of minor annoying things and made out as this was the whole game all games are bad compared to bookworm adventures oh ma ga so many likes thanks dunkey i was going to buy this game but this video saved me 92 yeah i know its your opinion but its objectively wrong you dont like this game therefore you shouldnt review it dont ever change internet you played league for a long time how do you not like random encounters and turn based combat smh thanks for confirming my worries dunk saved me 60 dollarydoos well if youre not a fan of turn based combat and random encounter i would really recommend this game called bookworm adventures delux it has the perfect mix of strategy and story telling and a fantastic pace and i would say its one of if not the most intuitive games of all time give it a try dunk id love to see how you feel about it i think most people think the writing in octopath could at least be better if ya like jrpgs tho its pretty darn good the two things that he complains about other than the writing grind there is a character to beat a cat with a bag that appears randomly beat it and you get like 47 level ups instantly reducing the grind encounters you can have a character like cyrus who learns the passive ability to have less random encounters making the game more enjoyable for people like him this is meant as a throwback jrpg and dunkey obviously doesnt like jrpgs so people here shouldnt base the entire quality of the game from this video playing it first and then forming it is better but people probably dont want to do it for those who wonder why the game looks like it does its meant to like how people remember the classic rpgs from the 90s from their memories that get changed through nostalgia and similar aspects its meant to have this kind of look and its very enjoyable at least for me i actually really enjoyed xenoblade harsh but this is exactly how i feel about almost every rpg with traditional turnbased command and no action rpg elements neat to see a prominent games commentator who actually shares this opinion hes right on all points but forgot to talk about how involved combat can be way better than clicking the same menu option over and over to win also should have went over how bosses have way too much hp every time ophilia says your excellency take a drink and youll be drunk in five minutes chronotriggerxenogearsfinalfantasy6phantasystar4 some other decent 816bit jrpgs all the other dreck octopath traveler all the games i like you dont like in so confused i really enjoy the game but i understand that dunkey has different tastes in the rpg genre i say give it a shot if you enjoy turn based combat games there is a lot of depth to the combat not seen in this video also if you hate random encounters and turn based combat avoid it overall the game has been very successful and i really hope they release a sequel dunkey has the patience of a hyena on ritalin octopath issa good game tho man dunk had a lot of good points in this video but what really made me mad was that this clearly is not a bookworm adventures review whats the pokmon meets inception game he mentioned shit i thought this was octodad whoopsy dunkys my excellency satisfying video im so sick of this boring uninspired game being advertised to me by nintendo jrpgs of this calibur are a remnant of the past and have no reason to be played in todays world its funny to see all the jrpg fans get triggered about this review what do you expect him to sayhe hates these games also its not really a full review of the game no dunkview tag so the argument that its not a complete fair review doesnt hold much water either i think square needs to make new stuff besides rpgs everyone knows you are not fond of jrpgs so why whoa 100 hit the nail on the head with this one i want to like the game the artstyle is pretty good and i usually like rpgs but the writing is horrible and like you said the gameplay is just monotonous everything is bad and i didnt even go that far in the game thats basically the review lol love your content when its not tryin to review games though i was hurt he didnt like this game but thats dunk he doesnt like jrpgs still 1010 even though i like this game so the game is good the only thing you really got wrong in this review is the number of random encounters you need to fight between bosses unless you forget that fast travel exists you should never get into more than 10 encounters before finishing a chapter and your example of a tedious battle took less than 20 seconds this comment section is evenly split between people who really took dunks opinion to heart and people who watched his game critics video with other comments somewhere in between the way you say reggie kills me every time basically dunkey you do not have patience lol well its not a bad thing its just stop picking the goddamn games that require patience next up dunkey reviews hearts of iron 4 first second into the game where the fucking shooting button well if this game is this bad why arent you reviewing bookworn adventure deluxe instead the your excellency spam is why you dont dub japanese gamesshows the long repetitive fights against low level monsters is why final fantasy 8 was terrible woah whats with the 4k dislikes excellency is the word of the day yeah hes not wrong i really like turn based games though so i dont mind dunkey is a fool yes it amazes me too that people still can sit there all day and play turn based games you should do a review of toontown people literally playing that game for hours a day and its just slow 1 button turn based combat was good when i was 7 like wth atleast play a game that you do more than pressbutton does combat sequence hahaha still better than xc2 thou yeah they cant all be winners youre forced to grind you arent forced to grind the characters never interact the characters interact look at this poor dialogue a woman of the church is referring to an important figure by their title nuns dont just call the pope francis battles take too long theyre actually quicker than your average turn based rpg because of the boost and break system with he deliberately showed poorly jesus christ dunk at least try to come up with a compelling argument i didnt think the gameplay or the story would impress anybody but rather the asthetics would the soundtrack is impressive and the art style has an interesting take it was a junior dev team making this so i didnt really care that much about the game just how they were making it and how passionate they were towards criticism impressed me the most its alright it really makes you feel the excellency whats with the dislikes seem much higher then normal upset fans of the game maybe i thought this was a great video im really liking the game personally the characters may not be super unique but the way the story is told has been really entertaining to me and keeps me playing the game to find out what happens next which is more than i can say for some jprgs final fantasy games bore me pretty quickly the random encounters do kinda suck i think they happen too often in this game but the turn based system itself i think is pretty good the weakness defense and charge system gives it some variety and something more to think about during the battles a lot of the boss fights i find you legitimately have to think about your moves and whatnot you cant always just spam your most powerful attacks i think its a pretty good game your sexcellency god though her voice is like a angel though oh boy you really triggered the jrpg fan boys with this one and so this was the day the nintendo sub reddit formed into the mech and marched on dunkey that game kinda sucked you blew it reggie oh uh i mean your excellency 30 and you got yourself a deal does the girl sound like marinettemorgiana to anyone dunkey i dont agree with your opinion but i at least understand that the consistency of your voice as a critic implies that i personally shouldnt listen to your opinions on rpgs because i understand that your tastes are different than mine good bideo i see nothing wrong with this review keep up the good work i normally hate jrpgs every final fantasy game ive tried bored me to death so much that i couldnt finish any of them due to this i didnt expect to like octopath traveler at all i quickly found out how wrong i was after trying the demo the stories and characters are pretty cliche but i still found them to be very enjoyable the battle system is what has been keeping me engaged the most the boost mechanic is fun as hell to use above all else though the best part of this game is easily the soundtrack its godly i can understand why you didnt like this game dunk but how could you not mention the soundtrack i was dreading seeing this video pop up in my feed because we all know your take on classic jrpg elements kinda want to see a debate between you and sky now lol thanks dunko keep makin honest reviews and telling me when games are shitty your excellency id pay 15 for just alfyn and tressa but never 60 for the full game for those of you who havent played the switch demo the 3d2d art style is incredible the combat is very satisfying strategic for an rpg and the voice acting and music is very good when youre not on ophilias path if you can get past a generic story youll want this one i was hoping for some real witty comments from the characters to each other kind of like dragon age can we just take a step back and appreciate the masterful story telling in the amazing jrpg puzzle top down fighter bookworm deluxe wish this game came out on xbox or pc what game is that at 33 seconds pokemon meets inception i honestly dont agree with dunkey most times and dont think hes the person to look to for a good review just an entertaining one but yeah ot is boring it has a job system so ill buy it this game is excellency different strokes for different folks my man thats what its all about im loving this game by i also love classic jrpgs at least we can all agree on knack ii game is pretty at least and opened a door to make better ones out of that design the first never aways success see knack 1 for exemple they had to make the knack 2 for perfection that is some amateur voice acting me wtf is this game everybody losing their collective shit over it dunkey meh me guess its a meh game pass i really dont get wh you even review games you dont like people dont watch your for your opinion on games but for the comedic value in your videos and just like the splatoon 2 review a i dong like the game its shit3 minute review there is no entertainment it kinda feels like you bought a game happen to dislike it and then need to vent your displeasure in a video it saddens me to see dunkey fans getting angry at each other in the comment section even if you likedislike octopath traveler or jrpgs at least theres one thing that we can all agree upon and that is bookworm adventures deluxe is the greatest video game introduced to mankind another press a button 200 times to win game yay even as he trashes the game i look at it and want to pull my wallet out ekselenci yup this word dont have meaning anymore are we alone in the universe do a review on no mans sky when its update comes out tomorrow tales of symphonia is the only good jrpg its right there next to bubsy 3d using english in a game with dual audio usually love your stuff but for the love of god you just dont get the jrpg genre kinda sucks you took the opportunity of a really good new one coming out to just shit on it with your popularity tons of kids that mightve enjoyed itll end up not even trying it getting a lot of jimmies rustled nice soo many fucking ads everywhere i like dunkey but he is not the guy i go to for deep reviews on games nor is he the guy i go to for reviews on rpgs firstly i know he doesnt like rpgs so he is gonna be harsh on them no matter what secondly he likes gameplay that is actionbased which rpgs can do but usually doesnt i respect dunkeys opinion he doesnt like this game thats fine but i am sure there are people out there who thinks this game is amazing thats all i have to say hmm i remember how you once said in the gaming journalism video that dunkviews are where you put criticism and opinions but this isnt actually a dunkview so im really confused on your angle on this one is it a actual review on the game or on the jrpg genre it wasnt exactly clear on this one so its pretty hard to judge what you have on the game itself so it just seems to be complaining about the formula but using the game as a point of reference i understand the criticisms on the genre but i feel like keeping the heavy focus on the game and just outright making the title of the video the games name is a poor way of doing it youre just making it sound like the game just straight up sucks going against pretty much everything you said was dumb in the journalism video sorry munky this vid didnt make me feel like your batmancy i dont understand why anyone would play these unintuitive jrpgs at this point in time they used to be fun cause we didnt have better games to play must admit this games got a good soundtrack from the osts that ive heard in this video dunkey doesnt like turn based combat anime writing random encounters dont get mad if you like those things theyre not for everyone its funny with each thing you criticize it makes me want to play the game more lol maybe i just like formulaic jrpgs excellency 2 baybeeee psst its not an actual review if it was he would have put dunkreview on the title and gave it a score so this is just the rant to take the piss out of it and lord its taking the piss outta people too i guess the game got ligmaed i came into this video expecting to disagree dunkey is clearly not big on jrpgs doesnt mean i cant respect his opinion and enjoy his content ah so like your game critics video said when you say you hate a jrpg that means its average and still worth playing i was a little disappointed when i realized this was a review and not a funny gameplay video then i remembered dunkey hated these type of games if i hadnt already played 60 hours this video may have turned me away from playing it that being said dunkey makes good points but i agree that at this point i feel like he is just complaining to complain he has stated his case many time before about turnbased games and the sorts nonetheless i love your videos no matter what dunkey still a 8510 for me despite its flaws metal gear your excellency very upset this wasnt bookworm deluxe ackshually in the second chapers of each charakters story your partymembers will talk with each other about the current plot events your excellency that was a pretty good video boi huge shame it had so much potential if dunkey thinks its terrible im inclined to believe it might be really good hey dunk review divinity original sin 2 he was payed to say this by machinima why do you review games of genres you dont like its fuckin madness and it does a disservice to the games you review your excellency youre excellency this game is great youre excellency a person who doesnt like pizza wont like papa johns but that doesnt mean a person who loves pizza wont like papa johns im getting a bad feeling about this the fanboys this isnt going to spawn a comment war this is gonna spawn a fandom war woah the guy who doesnt like turnbased jrpgs didnt like this turnbased jrpg what a twist man who really dislikes turn based rpgs doesnt like a turn based rpg ngl i adore this game i think it is beautiful why even review this when you hate jrpgs im disappointed in you game bad for impatient players like yourself its more suited for someone who prefers a calmer and slower game some of these comments are saying stuff like oh the complaints dunk made are gone by like a few hours in well it seems to me like some of the stuff like grinding dont go away cause when you are lv 20 and you arent one hitting lv1 enemies there is something wrong there keep in mind dunkey really doesnt like jrpgs or turn based rpgs so adding this altogether isnt his cup of tea i do agree on a few points although i do really enjoy the game and respect that he doesnt simple sthat still a damn funny video xenoblade 2 was pretty good in my opinion ive been playing for 30 hours and i can say at least two things the story of the priestess is a very big piece of shit and that the ballerinas story is really cool finally someone who isnt shooting a constant stream of nut over this terrible game not to be sinister or anything but when that grunt screams to me its kind of funny can we please just get a dunkey rpg already id play that kinda reminds me of zelda i never played it as a kid and when i picked it up it felt so corny your term used to refer to a person of high excellency this is not book worm you should play that this game looks like minecraft with shaders octopath is actually a really good game if you like rpgs its been amazing so far quick now do an ace attorney video dunkey is back baby games arent hitting the margin for story at all lately did you play all the way through not doubting you at all as i havent played it but ive heard the story gets better as you go that not true its knack 3 baby i really like seeing that consistency on your opinions its odd how i grew up playing games like chrono trigger and ffiii hating the turnbased combat and random encounter system and favoring bethesdas style of rpg and then playing octopath and being totally enamored by the combat but there are some noticeable faults namely the insane difficulty spike from chapter 2 to chapter 3 one of the characters chapter recommendations went from level 21 all the way to 40 thats way too much and especially with the amount of gold and exp the game tends to give for level 2030 fights it takes a lot of grinding the game world also doesnt feel fluid in its spacing of areas i can understand flat lands leading to coastal areas but stone arch lands leading straight to deserts and forests leading to deserts that doesnt work too well and rpgs need to have fluid game worlds the english voice acting shouldnt have an expected level of quality akin to games like uncharted 4 and bioshock infinite but the stories are incredible i feel tha the game is more of a love letter a return to form for traditional rpgs i agree that a lot of the writing is really cliche and trope riddled but i respect the homage to the golden era of jrpgs sky is gonna be pissed try out majin and the forsaken kingdom dunkey this is mostly just a criticism of jrpgs the dialogue and battle examples you gave are par for the course and i see nothing actually wrong about them the only unique thing you really hit on in this is the way the split storytelling doesnt amount to much besides a disjointed adventure i actually liked this game better than mario eh different strokes i guess visually that game looks really unique and interesting but if the game itself is bad im not gonna play it well i really like this game at least regards to the grinding in fighting enemies though i understand but i really enjoy how regardless of what level you are you can go or at least attempt to go anywhere and going into areas higher level than you and realizing that if you play it just right you can win and it nets you more exp and faster leveling to explore even more dangerous areas i played the demo for a bit as the merchant girl i thought a merchant character sounded interesting in a game like this but it wasnt she sucked wow its like people arent allowed to form their own opinions and openly like or dislike certain elements of something without criticism one more excelency and i would have nutted hard jrpgs are objectively trash uwu please review the splatoon 2 dlc you hate it because its a damn fine jrpg thats fine just play further than the first chapter of each character next time dunk also no comment on the music sad panda while this game has flaws dunkey is not a turn based rpg player you should try divinity original sin 2 the problem is that you need to pay extra attention because the game doesnt give you a lot of clues and the nintendo fan boys jerk off to this game because its exclusive dunkey man this turn based battle takes so long wins in 3 attacks despite not using the weakness system at all and is soloing at level 22 for some reason you blew it i am glad that dunkey hate turn based combat as much as i do a guy who openly dislikes jrpgs dislikes a jrpg and people are mad about it is this dd just play dnd i cant waste my time with a videogame like this i dont agree with this but i respect your opinion dunkey i feel that dunkey is not someone to go with when criticizing a story sure hes great for comedy gameplay and graphics but he doesnt seem to have the attention span to be able to sit through a wellwritten story that took a long time to write because it is in fact wellwritten and thorough take his watch dogs review for example he was definitely right about the driving physics and the combat but 14 of the video was him complaining about how 4minute cutscenes were so boring and long its perfectly fine to not be interested in the story but i dont think that should be taken into the review excuse me anime gay your videos are one of the few things i can always look forward to as soon as i saw the thumbnail i thought you were going to give the game praise but i guessed wrong at least the grahics and art design seems pretty good they dont interact with each other well that bunks i was really looking forward to this game what is life final fantasy iv did it right looks like a fun jrpg honestly my only question is is there an option for japanese dialogue or to turn the voices off entirely the english voice acting sounds cringe af damn dunkey you triggered a lot of people here lmao remember how nintendo hyped this game up in both the nintendo direct and e3 and this is the result of that a new dunkey video your excellency a new video your excellency i havent played the game but if this game is an rpg than the story needs to be good or at least interesting if its not than the dialogue needs to be good that voice acting and the dialogue lines dunkey used as an example are a big red flag for me beautiful graphics dont do anything for me anymore either im going to dislike not because anything in the video was particularly offensive but because ive noticed critical comments just dissappearing if youre going to spread misinformation you shouldnt stifle people correcting you neckbeardweeb comments inc hey dunky would youhave you ever played shadow of war dunkey i used to like you but after calling out random encounters and turnbased combat youre now my favorite video game commentator how can you even address a persons excellency wowthis was a surprisingly shallow review for you i expected better and here im thinking octopath is my game of the year clearly we dont enjoy the same things the game makes it feel like its forcing you to move slower through the uninteresting dialogue its boring and you cant rapidly press a to skim through it its awful sure you can skip it but then you miss everything i like what the game is trying to do and it looks awesome for what it is but for the steep price tag it has its really ridiculous i was disappointed i really liked the demo gonna grab it soon hopefully its a bit sad to see dunkey rip on xenoblade time and time again the games good it has a bit of a slow start though stop reviewing anime games you uncultured swine jk play for the king generic jrpg that cashes in on nostalgia that has bland colors gets hate dunkey i love you but why the hell do you review jrpgs when you very clearly hate them lol this is my first turn based jrpg i have ever played and i genuinely adore this game the combats engaging the characters are likable some more others the ost is fantastic too the stories not being connected was a disappointment though but otherwise its a solid game that you can sink a ton of time into the writing is bad but i think that is due to translation being bad whats going on with these comments your excellency even the demo was better than most rpgs ive played in the past 10 years so idk what it was that turned him off to this but ive heard nothing but praise for this game sad he didnt like it but im positive id love it even the primroses story in the demo hit me pretty hard hey at least it respects my brain more than xenoblade 2s writing did the dunk has spoken so when bookworm adventures deluxe personally im enjoying the game but dunkeys criticisms are good points the start of the game is essentially a long slog through getting all the characters and there isnt enough character interaction at all that said the characters do have small optional dialogues here and there but no actual appearance in the cutscenes for each others stories the combat really isnt as bad as he makes it out to be battles go by pretty quick once you learn enemy weaknesses which allow you to break their guard and make them skip a turn all in all the game is pretty good but the previous game from this studio bravely default is a much better game that said ive not completed octopath traveler yet tbh is not like dunkey is the only person to make these points about the game i hate turn based combat so i am loving this video lmao i think that your criticism of the combat is flawed because of how you approach it with out mentioning any quirks in the combat things that make it unique etc your criticism of the dialogue is fine and the story and pacing equally so but you fail to address the combat in its entirety making it come across as if you spent barely any time with the game at all its important to know a games mechanics at least somewhat and it is equally important to address such a thing in a critical piece as just saying the turn based combat sucks cause its not instantaneous like in halo isnt good criticism i would recommend going back over the game dunkey not for the story necessarily but to make a much better review of the combat wow book work adventures much im with what the deleted comment on this one yet somehow in some way this type of game keeps appealing my senses of nostalgia despite being monotonous grindfests 9 times out of 10 local dunkey who hates jrpgs doesnt like this jrpg why would you play this game youve stated before you hate this type of stuff i mean i get why you review it i just dont get why you picked it up in the first place and id appreciate it if youd reply dunkey usually have good opinionsbut his opinion in this vid is shit it shows he dunno wtf hes talking abt when it comes to rpg stick to knack reviews dunkey these people havent beaten the game and theyre reviewing it dunkey doesnt beat game and reviews it i usually love your content dunkey but thats a nice bit of hypocrisy there incredible almost as incredible as a really painly papercut i disagree but i also know that you dont like many jrpgs while i am a big fan of them you make some good points espcially with ophelia and olberic but i think it neglects some of the more interesting stories like therion or primrose a well made video for sure but not one i agree with keep up the good work jrpgs are objectively worse than most games in terms of writing and gameplay they belong in 1999 not 2018 love ya dunk but cmon we all know jrpgs arent your thing this seems like an unnecessary jimmy rustlin if i do say so myself the sprites are garbage turn based combat doesnt require skill the dialogue is bad not sure why anyone plays jrpgs besides weebs or the japanese sorry dunk but i gotta disagree with ya your excellency youre that ninja im rewording this comment as the previous comment doesnt show my true opinion if this game its an overall good game but its storytelling is rather repetitive and im left wandering a world thats filled with little split paths to chests incredibly easy or incredibly vague side quests and towns with little variety from one another aside from there looks while i do enjoy the combat quite alot and am currently set on beating the game theres things that couldve been changed to make this a classic to be replayed and remembered but this is all my option so whatever i keep getting this mixed up with that owlboy game and its really annoying damn i really cant tell if everyones serious or joking anymore someone help comments criticizing this video are clearly being removrd honestly i really agree with you here i was so hyped for this game leading up to release but the constant story introductions and resetting are wearing me down i dont really have any motivation to go back to the game just to do the same thing over and over again with little payout and few interesting things to keep me coming back i have to force myself to turn the game back on and play it of all recent turnbased jrpg games only one did something interesting with concept and it was darkest dungeon youre literally just describing any 2d rpg every time she says excellency take a shot that is the best explanation of why turn based combat sucks that i have ever heard lol thank you for saving me countless hours of my time octodad deadliest catch splatoon 2 octoexpansion octopath traveler i think im onto something your excelency the characters are bland the writing is weak random encounters are dumb but i fucking like this game but i also like dunk heelllllllpppp whatamigunnado i hope dunkey doesnt try trails series because the writing in that is really goodbut pacing is one of the slowest in any game in general and thats mostly intentional by the devs because they actually made the world important to the overall narrative and characters actually react to situations really well id say trails is one of the best jrpg series since suikoden and the amount of mystery it has with zemuuria is always enticing and interesting but its not a game for everyone certianly not for the casual players but unlike most jrpgstrails use tropes as a base and actually subvert them like rean goes from this bland protagonist as an archetype of a light novel hero to a protagonist actually finding his path as a young adult and learning not everyrhing is needed by him he also works really well as a teacher than a student same with estelle brightshe goes from a ditzy and brash heroine to a mature and slightly patient heroine while also acknowledging herself of her actio inception dunkey youre black go home i actually thought it looked really good o am i a normie wow hipster much this game was a fun nostalgic trip to an era where it was actually fun to stay up all night and grind a game it seems like you either a dislike jrpgs or b are not into turn based games if either is the case then why even bother with it just move on not even a rating thats ice cold i went to check out dunkeys castle i told my friend and he told me and it sounded like a ass website a couple days later he saw a drunken eating his shoes press 8 to hit that snail now hit 8 about another 100 times to see what grinding is like dont agree with some of the things you said but i enjoyed watching this video whats the name on the anime movie he showed in the start that moment when you dont know if dunkey is kidding or not so i havent played the game yet but i was looking into it dunkey made some excelent points while playing the demo i destested the frequency and time that the random encounters consumed this was my main deterrent from buying release day i origionally thought the stories were good but in the course of the demo i never got to see how they entertwined and apparently they dont this is dissapointing i think ill wait to get the game if dunkey doesent like turn based and random encounters you should play a tales game dunky when tales of vesperia remastered comes out pick it up it is quite good story and gameplay is a blast not all characters are great but most of them are good or atleast interesting 15 none of the playable characters were octopi whats up with all these triggered weeaboos this game looks cringey af not gonna lie anyone who enjoys playing cringey grind fests with boring ass combat needs to get a life psycho mantis theres something for everyone 910 he doesnt like splatoon 2 xenoblade 2 or octopath traveler thats 3 strikes dunkey you know what that means youre officially a guy with different game opinions than me hope youre having a good day keep up the good work i really really hate voice acting in english i really dont think dunkey is exactly qualified to judge turn based combat since has said several times that hates more than anything but it is his video so biases comment on biases video review you gotta admit though the music is nutty i think dunkeys dislike of jrpg style games is pretty known and i can understand the statements made about them as someone whos been playing them for a long time it hits a lot of good marks and definitely smacks of that old school polish highly recommend it to anyone who has any interest in the genre please dont review jrpgs anymore please its fascinating to watch this directly after jim sterlings video on the same game just a neat window into how completely different priorities can be also just a man with a sword nothing more who read wheel of time in the writingtranslation staff well we all know dunk and how he feels about these games but i always appreciate the counter opinions to my type of game oh and you blew it reggie leave an intelligent comment or go straight to insulting dunkey personally you guys already know the answer yeh u sux dunkle im dead because you make me laugh so hard dunkey needs to play the turned based knack rpg you think thats slow try ff9 combat the game is great and its probably one of my favourite ps1 titles if not one of the best titles in the whole final fantasy series but goddamn some fights are just so slow great video as always dunkexcellency i like xenoblade 2 and whenever he makes fun of it i feel personally attacked ya blew it rick hahahahahahaah dunkey can we get the bubberducky mousemat as a shirt excellency you could have at least actually tried to fight that snail properly lmao damn everyone disagrees with dunkey lmao this game really makes you feel like your excellency play indie pogo it just released on steam recently and it is your type of game dunkey if you hate jrpgs random encounters and turn based combat then stop reviewing jrpgs and games with those things in them youre already biased so every game like that is going to be bad to you thanks for the warning i thoroughly enjoyed this game if you enjoy pokemon or rpgs in general this is a good time guys this is not a real review because if it was then it would have dunkview in the title yeah but the music i really hope he played through just more than each intro chapter which all just show the reason why that character is traveling the battles also get more intense with there being 34 enemies pretty often and the difficulty is to scale which i think is brilliant you miss out on nothing no matter who you start with you dont have to like the game and i respect that but the game is barely two weeks old and any negative light is going to sway people octopath traveler is almost like a love letter to fans of jrpgs and if you dont love it back that genre why are you reading the letter if it isnt meant for you eight paths and none leading to the release of knack 3 this game sucks this video nails everything thats wrong with jrpgs these days seriously with the exception of kingdom hearts and persona there is not a single other jrpg series with main titles that are actually consistently good also lol at the 4000 autistic weaboosnintendo stans that disliked this vid lmfao i see your main points and they are true but the selling point of this game is that its supposed to be a classic jrpg and to me it nails it they should have had jimmy neutron as a character yeah olberics story is kinda meh but primrose is a stripper with a kill bill storyline you couldnt have used that as your example sorry dunkey but your review gets 1 dunks out of 8 its shit i played the game before dunkey made it popular im sorry your dunkellency were only hard on reggy because he live him anachronox is better jrpg than this poser piece of crap i almost downvoted this video for how shitty this game is guess its just not your jam dunkaroo people who do actually like jrpgs will like it though a black man criticizing a real jrpg lmao when i saw the trailers it was bragging about how the story had 8 characters with 8 different stories which is what almost every rpg with multiple characters does this was a very short video your excellency man i like your reviews normally but you are not the guy to go to when looking to judge jrpgs considering youve stated yourself you hate most of the genre conventions i see what your saying but 8 characters tho i must disagree with you on this one your excellency why are there so many pseudoeducationalreview style videos coming out of dunkey recently i just wanna watch some funny jokes dunk not a 3 minute video on why a game is good or bad im gonna say it i miss old dunkey russian subspls to be fair that was not a level 1 snail and he didnt go for the guard break also not really sure why he had a single party member at level 22 its great for rpg players so basically everyone thinks dunkey is the armond white of rpgs now are you black your excellency you already told that you dont like rpg like this i agree whit you i think this game is crap but its only because we dont have the patience for it i am pretty sure that everyone who like this type of game will enjoy this one still dont understand how people get mad at someone elses opinion he made an entire video shitting on one of my favorite games ever batman arkham city and it was hilarious personally i like this game and think its quite fun but its interesting to see different opinions about it i can see where youre coming from but i just cant relate however you made good points and i respect you for that i had high hopes for this game but didnt really like it went back to xenoblade chronicles 2 lol i dont know why dunkey hates that game so much im 500 hours in is that actually the voice acting sounds like blist voice actors reading their lines badly on purpose wow i love octo expansion if i see the word excellency in the comments one more time the travel banter is actually pretty fun when you search it out from what ive seen each other character can comment on the others stories if theyre in the party for a part of it switch around the party each after cutscenes exclude ones that already commented that chapter and you get some gems included in this is one in which primrose has to teach tressa what a prostitute is primrose chapter 2 and alfyn developing feelings for ophilia chapter 2 cant remember which of theirs it is thimble weed park dunkview i know youve played it the game looks so cool though disappointing your missing out dunkey my uncle who works at square enix tells me that you unlock knack if you beat the game in 3 minutes but the soundtrack tho anyone else agree man this comments section is a shitshow dude i was so ready for this but never mind i hate just even seeing the name of this game anywhere cringe overload the musics great though oof that like dislike ratio this game looked half ass and fan service anyway and they tried to make it a bigger deal than it was i really like the battle mechs and the soundtrack slaps so hard the art is beautiful too but the story is so so so atrocious and the script is even worse super disappointing it could have been an iconic game im not saying i dont respect dunkey or his opinion im saying that you shouldnt go to dunkey for your turn based combat rpg games just lovely dunkey my insatiable thirst for a new video has been satisfiedfor now ill just have to watch it like 11 times until you release something new damn im addicted to your videos prims the only decent origin story the rest is shit and yeah the disjointed way in which combat just happens to have all your characters makes it seem like you travel to some weird dimension just to have battles dunkey said himself that game journalism sucks because theres no connection between the reviewer and the reader we dont know them or their interests well with dunkey we do know him we know him extremely well at this point and what we do know is he hates random encounters jrpgs and turnbased combat so naturally a game that goes back to its roots with all three as classically as possible with little to no shortcuts involved dunkey aint gon like that one i came into this review expecting that got just that and my personal interest in the game remains unchanged thank you for the review dunkmin but im sorry i dont listen to your reviews anymore because you didnt like bubsy 3d holy shit people are upset in the comments ive been playing this for a week straight since release ive been traveling through europe and usually play it during the night at hotels the game is really good even with its faults the music is lickass too trust me psycho mantis your excellency after all the positive reviews i was predicting youd love this game dunkey thank you for the honesty you liked ffxv more which i already have so yea not buying the switch yet i will probably never play this game because i dont own a switch and im not saying the game is bad or anything but this just annoys me for some reason people keep saying its sold out everywhere but at least where i live germany the game was produced in tiny quantities just so nintendo could be like woops we sold out so polpular apparently they are having production issues which sounds like a lame excuse this is one of those games that i instinctively want to stay away from only because of the hype and weirdly triggered fanbase why is everybody offended just because he didnt like the game hes not a reviewer for some company he doesnt have to finish the whole game if he didnt like it and he is allowed to have an opinion on it and make a video about it about his opinion dunkey you should play more good games like knack before i even scroll down i know your excellency is going to be one of those memes that gets spammed i the comments below for this video and future dunkey videos this game looks boring thanks dunkey for saving my money dunkey i love you my guy but did you finish the game before posting this review in your game critic video you mentioned that you hate when reviewers put a review out before they finish the game so i wondered if you did the same if you hate random encounters so much why did you buy this game when you knew it had them in it this game looks nice but its just a ripoff of bookworm adventure deluxe but i like this game i see what you mean but since im sort of new to jrpgs ive had a lot of fun with this game basically i think its been great for me and probably any beginners to these games i respect all of your reviews but i just wanted to share my views on this one as i slightly disagreed cheers i like the game okay i like it sue me flips table oh and good video you actually have good points made but i dont have to be happy about it only turned base combat i like is in something like xcom or wasteland he already said he doesnt like turnbased combat except persona 5 this is no exception even if you dont agree with him yo dunk i love your videos and usually see them as a great way to get an unbiased laugh and real insight on games but you gotta realize this game was made for the fans of the games that made square enix such a big deal in the first place and this is their sonic mania also square didnt send a bunch of jrpgs to beat you up in middle school baybee a wonderful video your excellency report garen for feeding in the wrong game cmon now i wholeheartedly disagree but i see where youre coming from thanks for being real dunk first the game isnt bad and i must write a full paragraph on why your opinion doesnt matter and mine does your excellency i disagree but can see where your coming from personally i think the multiple characters is good and im not sure how far youve gotten but ive seen in other reviews that the stories do eventually intertwine either way great video always love to hear your thoughts its no divinity 2 thats for sure you are my favorite dunkey but this just seems like an excuse to slam a genre that you dislike turn based rpgs and random encounters are my best memory of games and this game was a breath of fresh air for me thank you your dunkcellency disagreeing with dunk i thought this day would never come its what weve all been waiting for dunko super mario odyssey dl oh nope its october dad voyages nice video man i do agree with the lack of interaction the characters have with each other and the weirdness of the story system what i like about this game though is the beautiful soundtrack the boost mechanic art style and overall athmosphere there is also a seemingly openness to how you approach side quests and fighting style which makes it a worthwile time for me even if it doesnt satisfy the storygamer i normally am your excellency keep it up p is that garens voice for the bland guy how fitting lmao at the people disliking because they dont agree with your opinion while i disagree with your thoughts on the game and think that the game is a very enjoyable experience i still liked the video because i like you dunkey call me 3 i just think you dont like jrpgs and this definitely wasnt a game for you the things youre pointing out arent even really flaws as they are expectations with classic turned based rpgs and do have an audience i love you my dude but i dont really think this game was for you from the git go i cannot take this review seriously it doesnt say dunkview so i feel like youre playing me here donkey i absolutely love jrpgs especially the old shit but the fighting mechanics in octopath are garbage i honestly cant see why anyone likes it okay now im annoyed by ophelia incoming people who like the same basic jrpg story played over and over again with the same graphics but with shaders d you had to grind with one character in the party im over 40 hours in and i havent had to grind once the only grinding i did was reloading a save to steal the endgame gear that had a 3 steal rate consequencefree and that was totally optional i agree when i saw this game revealed i thought it looked like the most generic rpg ive ever seen fun drinking game take a shit every time she says excellency just a thought maybe turn based rpgs arent your cup of tea its only been 2 hours and theres already 31k dislikes your exxcelslandudys aaaand now the word doesnt have a meaning anymore hey guys different people like different games and yet people say its excellent but always get blinded by graphics are switch owners required to cream themselves over every original release because its not just another port friendly reminder that xenoblade 2 is bad clearly states several rpg games he has played and enjoyed due to a fun battle system reeeeeee dont talk about a genre you dont enjoy too fast likes too fast comments i cant reach it anymore i agree with dunky its just a half assed dragon quest 4 but credit where credit is due the games is pretty check out ogre battle 64 similar feel to this game but done right octopath traveler makes you feel like excellency im surprised dunkey picked ophilias dialogue to make fun of haanits is even more grating a lot of people disliked this video for a multitude of valid reasons but i just dont like it because it doesnt seem like dunk put his full heart into it tldr this aint it chief yo comment section dunkey likes jrpgs and doesnt like others dunkey does not like random encounters which are a part of many jrpg games dunkey dislikes how grindy this game in particular can be included in the embarrassing handle on the world building ex characters in party do not have meaningful interactions characters in party do not change anything involving stories for an individual character characters have dialogue that is a bit 1dimensional despite the game being a calling card to classics the game is a soloplay experience and aside from game mechanics dunkey doesnt enjoy what it takes to get through the story nor does he enjoy how it was handled please stop dropping comments instantly attacking the idea that he didnt like said jrpg or others in general making me mad much love dunkey i really like the look of this game but i was worried i would be super bored with it like i was with ff3 not 6 the real 3 that was ported to ds thank god someone finally says it why would you actively lie and deceive people about this game its the yearly i dislike turn based rpgs so you shouldnt enjoy them either video iconic drunksley moment that snail battle didnt seem realistic you can recruit party members and utilize enemy weaknesses to stun enemies and use the boost system to destroy enemies like they showed in the trailer before they game was released this game at lack of main character interection which is suck for rpg in my opinion that is wait im more confused at what dunkey expected hes already said tons of times that he absolutely hates turn based jrpgs so why is he unimpressed by a turn based jrpg thats trying to go with the older lineage style of jrpgs huh i wonder you can have a differing opinion but its as he said before you know what you expect when it comes to the reviewer i very rarely expect dunkey to praise an jrpg and he does like some elements in the game i think that gives it enough merit octopath aint a perfect game but i think for those whore into the bulk of jrpgs will enjoy it and thats perfectly fine a much better game with multiple stories and characters livealive for the snes yeah thats the vibe i got from the demo music is nice tho another excellent video your excellency so many angry weabs in the comments who disliked his excellencys video anyone know where i can find a reupload of dunkeys classic 2007 video dunkules your excellency you have convinced me to dislike this game oh i thought octopath was another one of the octodad games if you want a sick ass jrpg with a bunch of different protags thats super cool play saga frontier this game is made by bumbler oooooooo controversial opinion cant wait to read these comments this video was bs dunkey disappointed in you i figured it would be a huuuge upset if dunkey actually liked it as hes made perfectly clear there are a ton of elements in this kind of game that he just really doesnt enjoy respect to dunkey for going out and giving his own opinion and not just going following the fanboy bandwagon i mean if you played passed the introductory chapters then yes the characters do interact with eachother this is an embarrassment you dont like the game sure we expected that its a jrpg compare this to something like your xenoblade chronicles 2 review another jrpg and this video is exposed for what it is its a pathetically short collection of half baked jokes youve told countless times before its a rehash of opinions about games youve already reviewed and commentated on theres no life no creativity no desire to entertain surprise or at least say something worthwhile in your writing why was this video made to cash in the only interesting or original content here was in your opinion on the story which was tragically short glad i dont take your videos seriously lol bc this one sucked ass this is like watching a car review from someone who doesnt know how to drive in chapter 2 of their stories the characters talk to each other ophillia was so fucking painful to play through but honestly i am enjoying the rest it would be nice if the thief wasnt a emo douche but hey oh and thank you for the snippet of lisa man i enjoyed beating those damn games excuse me dunkey this isnt bookworm adventures 2 this is not the content i subscribed for great video your excellency dunkey never said dunkview in the title its not serious guys why does dunkey bother covering jrpgs if he hates them all more like why doe she even bother buying them opinions aside the video is really low effort dunkey has said numerous times that he is not a fan of jrpgs in general so its no surprise he doesnt like the ode to classic jrpgs a jrpg plays like a jrpg this is unacceptable this might be the first time i feel like you dont know what youre talking about i feeeel like you shouldnt review a game when you only played the demo thanks so much for this i was really sceptical of this game and you just convinced me not to waste my money its just better when you review things you actually like you spend more time on those videos and theyre more entertaining this was a waste of 3 minutes dunkey i get that you hate all but 7 jrpg games but at the very least dont pin all of the genres faults on this one game to some people octopussy journey is a mastapeece aww man thats it im sorta disappointed in this surface level review your excellency is for peasants the correct term is your knackcellency your excellency has uploaded once more knack is a playable character the characters do interact with each other from chapter 2 theyll comment on the story you are currently doing and sometimes 3 or 4 characters will interact with each other in the tavern alfyn cyrus therion and olberic even have a drinking game nice review realllllllllllllllllllllly looked like dunkey reviewed the demo for this game story sounds like star ocean second story but halfassed i guess dunkey doesnt like turn based games then every single comment i disagree with dunkey therefore this is a bad review dunkey i love you but why are you trying to be objective to a game you have a bias against based on the genre it kinda seems hyporcritical to be calling out large sites like ign and kotaku for bias but then also make a vid on a game in a genre you hate and expect people to see it as an unbiased view i i dont understand why people keep calling these characters cliched jrpg tropes maybe in terms of straight fantasy sure but if anything persona 5 and kingdom hearts are both guilty of far more cliched generic jrpg character writing i havent gotten the game yet but i like the aesthetic and the laid back vibe it doesnt feel like its as much about saving the world from terrible evil and more about going around completing the characters personal quests plus i like turn based combat so shrug different strokes for different folks i guess not your best video agree with you on the story points and on ophilias intro being fucking awful but then you lose credibility by trying to emphasise your dislike of the combat by blatantly ignoring the enemy weakness the bit about the characters not interacting was also just completely untrue so probably should have played longer or at least fact checked on google first it have to do with you not liking rpg games but i do agree with some things you had to say projared was shilling this generic turn based rpgsorry we have had this shit for too long gamers want more thab turn based rpgs dunkey i dont like jrpgs lemmie review one gee this went as expected i dont agree with his thoughts on the combat but i can understand his thought on the story its pretty disjointed dunkey hating on xenoblade nopons do suck storywiae though your excellency lets keep in mind as a reviewer dunkey doesnt like rpgs in general as he said in his popular critics suck video so this game is no stand out above all games but still fun for a jrpg fan personally im 25 hours in and i enjoy about 5 out of the 8 story lines ophelia teresa and alphonzo being the weaker of the bunch with my personal favorites being primrose and therion they took a risk that couldve been done better with the 8 story lines as they dont mesh very well if you compare the traveling pair to the likes of say ff15 or persona 5 it falls flat for my jarvan the king i enjoy this video refreshing that you pointed out some flaws in the game good games can have flaws people also the japanese voice acting is really good just overall never let americans voice something that was supposed to be japanese from the start they never do a good job of capturing the tone or emotion dammmn never seen you shit so hard on a game not that thats a bad thing listen my opinion about this video is a litte weird i do enjoy the game but not as much as other people the game is pretty mediocre like dunkey say in the start of the video there is nothing special about it and i do believe the marketing around it was very important for the success the game is finding but i really dislike the way the video was presented it is essentially a guy yelling i hate jrpgs and most of the critics come off nitpicking and petty attemps to make the game looks worse than what it actually is other person in the comments mention how dunkey actually manipulated tha battle against the snail to make it look more boring that what it actually is because of these points even if some of my views about the game align with dunkeys i honestly think this video was awful this and my previous experience about the xenoblade 2 review which was a game that i didnt play at the time of release because of the shallow and petty reviews saying the game was bad hhhufff hhuffff hfff whewi just swam through a sea of dislikes to get here this is the only video from dunkey ive considered disliking but then again he just really doesnt like turn based rpgs i could listen to cristina vee talking about her excellency all day i completely agree i jumped into the first demo of it and wanted to pull my hair out why do i need to spend 5 minutes fighting 1 garbage enemy just to fight some more it feels like holding a button down to interact with something why hold down x for 15 seconds so i can open a chest i hope these fights go away haha i still wanna play the game really bad he says he hates turn based games on his game critics video even when i disagree with this guy its still fun to watch i really like turn based combat idk why i just like the thrill when your fighting a boss thats hard and your having to think of the best strategies which each move but i hate random encounters especially when they are like dunkey said where they are just easy little time waster i knew this shit sucked a fuckin knight had to hit a snail 3 times 3 times your excellency youre that ninja ive never heard of this game but it looks beautiful but having to listen to my excellency repeated by that character i have no interest in playing this game at all thank you dunkey you blew it whos that i agree i dont like this kind of games i just cant get invested tbh this is a game i knew you wouldnt like no argument can change your mind because i know you are a impatient person but the idea to start a new story with each character sounds great to me and would build a lot of story around the characters looking forward for this game dunkey you know you forgot the new dlc for octo path its the octo expansion i feel like this is just someone who doesnt like old jrpgs complaining that this game was made like an old jrpg the pointless criticism is fine for a joke but this one isnt even funny not your best work dunkey only love this is possibly the worst dunkey video i like dunkey as a youtuber because he usually goes into lots of detail about what he likes and doesnt like and it can be entertaining but with this one it felt like he just shat on it its clear you dont like jrpgs from your other videos dont review them then you didnt even mention the combat system or the soundtrack nor does it look like you played any further than the first chapters of each character i would agree that its a slow start and a bit disjointed but once you get into it its a really fun experience i just feel like you didnt even give it a chance dunker ima have to disagree this time i dont like this game either but dunkey did say he despises anime and turn based combat rpgs so no surprise why hes very skeptical of ot dunkey has some shit taste in rpgs but good vid as always this game is ok but i was hoping it would be as good as bookworm adventures i can see the complaint here this game doesnt reinvent the wheel that being said the art style is something else which would be great if coupled with engaging game mechanics learn to speak like someone above the age of 5 dunkey lmao i think the problem i have with this video is that you seem for some reason to expect octopath traveler to be different than most rpgs from square enix of course its going to be exactly like final fantasy everything about it looks like final fantasy you didnt even cover the job system and being able to skip low level skills and learn high level ones instead it would be very hard to incorporate 64 different variations of each persons story depending on the characters in your party hence why they each have seperate stories im afraid i cant compare this with tobuscus as he has not uploaded a video on this but please know he would do way better feels like a new league video exactly the same experience xd id take this review with a grain of salt or whatever that saying is mainly because i love that style of classic jrpg i actually really like the combat and random encounters and i found the characters to be interesting but i can agree with dunkey that something more was needed but basically these reviews and everyones reviews are o p i n i o n b a s e d dunkey might hate the game because of the turn based combat and random encounters but i love the game because of that so yeah people should stop getting pissed at him for having an opinion that doesnt match their own opinion try playing gal gun dunkey you gonna love it how to piss off people animeshit i still have faith that theyll launch this game on a pc all true but isnt that super nit picky no game will ever be perfect you always focus on the spirit and soul of a game so why did you skip that here terrible review even for casual entertainment dunkey does not have to like the game but this feels like a pot meet kettle situation because he ranted about journalists not finishing the games and then reviewing it but then does the same thing himself i get that he doesnt like these types of games especially turn base but why even play it all if thats the case i feel like he didnt even try to bring up any good qualities about the game because there is a lot to talk about i think this game is not perfect but it also has a lot of great things going for it like sprite design music charming characters and the list goes on i dont know why people feel like every character has to have a deep background story because sometimes a simple straightforward approach can be nice and refreshing well doesnt surprise me that he didnt like this game since hes said time and time again that he doesnt like jrpgs on the othe hand if you like jrpgs this game is awesome some of the best turn based combat octopath more like upmyas i aint gay pretty much theres an endless sea of generic unimaginative turnbased rpgs i just skip over all of them these days i dont have the time for them the closest thing ive bothered to play recently is bravely default because it made every effort to speed up the usual painfully slow aspects of these games and let you enjoy the good things for its flaws at least xenoblade chronicles 2 had a new kind of combat system and for every badly written or voiced scene there were just as many if not more excellently done sections dunkeys getting whole paragraphs from people with anime pfps im done ps2era anime writing lol i love how you always throw in a subtle jab at kh3 whenever you mention it just to trigger the cult 29k dislikes i mean i disagree with dunkey on this one but its his opinion god thats so true your excellency this is a wonderful video your excellency yes dunkey the fights do last a while if you use the wrong weapon dunkey is a filthy casual when it comes to jrpgs also thats not a level 1 snail thats a snail with 1 level of break shield also 90 of these clips are cherry picked played a 100 hour game for 3 hours and made a video love your videos but you have such narrow taste in games oh shit people are triggered so how many dunko points out of 5 does it get yes every battle is exactly like that level 1 snail battle s oh so nintendo made it that explains a lot holy shit man i respect your opinion but you dont know enough about the game obviously to speak such harsh criticismfirst time as a fan of yours i have disagreed completely with yousad day the grind is just hilarious i am supposed to level 8 characters to level 40 whatnot just to play their story i bought this game because everyone was like this game is awesome and its a bit better than mediocre at best the boss fights take ages and barley reward you at the very least as far as i am at around level 30 i honestly dont have a problem with grinding but not when the combat it that slow though the combat system is pretty good not mad about the review just disappointed you didnt get the ffx laughing scene ugh two videos in one week we now have new expectations for you dunkey well i know one thing and its that im still not buying this ive been considering buying this game since there so much hype over seas thank you for saving me wallet mr dunk uh oh dunkey you didnt say that octopath is the greatest game of the year the rpg kids arent gonna like that played the demo had to sit through a boring cutscene immediately deleted the demo i agree with your opinion your excellency just a hunch but i dont think dunkey likes jrpgs lol god damn dunkey pullin no punches i personally think earthbound and pokmon did turn base combat the absolute best in earthbound if you got to a point where you were too powerful then it would automatically kill the enemy you encounter before it does a fancy transition and in pokmon every attacks have its ups and downs based on every pokmon this it requires you to think about what you are doing so it isnt mindless at all thanks for another video your excellency time to say bye to this channel everyone just because dunkey didnt like this one doesnt mean you have to get up in arms if you did nor does it mean you should be discouraged from checking the game out at some point end of the day its his review and hes entitled to his opinion even if it feels quick misguided and the video seems very surface level its his choice i felt a little hurt too to see this negative review myself but rising above it and finding enjoyment in either your love of the game or the humor in this review would make both you and dunkey happy instead of just crapping out a complaint about his video dunkey you know you dont like these games so why do you buy them i get that youre reviewing them from your own perspective but you already know that perspective is going to be negative toward that specific type of game dont get me wrong though i feel the exact same way about these kinds of games i dislike the boring menus of battle screens when im battling something i want to actually use skill not push a button and watch a guy do the attack im just generally curious as to why you spend your time on these games you probably already know you wont like the story is shit but i like turn based gameplay you definitely are correct the beginning of the game is kinda boring and too long if you dont instantly love the combat which i did but i really think you gave up on the game to quickly and i am happy you sort of admitted that you didnt get in to deep good thing youve admitted you dislike turnbased rpgs so we can peacefully disagree knowing it may be because of taste great video as always dunk and an important counterweight to the positive reviews ive seen well at least you started with the best character dunkey your excellency sir dunk just so you guys know just because he doesnt like it doesnt mean that you cant that should be obvious i really enjoy that pretty much all the negative feedback from the comments is stuff he talks about in his game journalism video if you came to a dunkey video on a japanese turnbased rpg and expected him to enjoy it well that was most likely not going to happen whatever happened to reviewers knowing their own limits you already knew that you would have this game why play it also why bother making a review when you barely go into the game and why bother lying about the games combat summary he doesnt like it because its a japanese turn based rpg with random encounters and japanese writing dearest videogamedunkey i humbly submit that you seem to have misplaced a crucial piece to your dunkey video what turn based game did you like and what did it do right nostalgic retro game is nostalgic and retro and somehow that makes it bad do you also find shovel knight to have too many pixels it kinda seems like your excellency decided to dislike the game before really giving it a chance btw i sense that a new community meme has been born everyday im haunted by the terrorizing thought that dunkey will never play bookworm adventures its such a brilliant game with a deep story that hits you right in the gut the graphics are amazing and the controls are out of this world whatever magic jrpgs had died a long time ago i recommend lost odyssey as the last good jrpg to everyone i can seriously its such a hidden gem probably because it was an xbox 360 exclusive octopath octopat octopa octop octo oct oc o bookworm adventures delux apparently the localization team really fucked up the translation that doesnt change how messed up the storytelling is but at least supposedly their dialogue isnt supposed to be that shit ooooh nice game wow this is not bookworm adventures rpgs are the absolute worse genre of games why people click on reviews only to see people praising the game if you are not going to listen what a reviewer has to say if is negative just dont watch reviews and play the game im talking about the people hating and not the ones disagreeing theres a reason most royal good guys say please just use my first name while the villains are all like yeah the more titles the better how can you be so wrong about everything c i mean your opinions i can manage random encounters and the monotonous nature added by turnbased combat but when a level system comes into the mix i find it far more infuriating now youre also required to do these fights whether or not you want to in almost every rpg ive played ive always been underlevelled for boss encounters with kingdom hearts especially while not true random encounters i get sick of fighting the same group of enemies every time i pass through that area and i start running past other enemies because i dont want to effectively fight an army every time im just running to the shops your shrekellency to be honest i this is probably the first time i disagree with you on a game review the quality of the storytelling varies very much from character to character you only showed the two least interesting ones same goes for the voice acting for most parts it is actually incredible you didnt show any of the points which makes octopath traveler such an outstanding game the soundtrack is memorizing and catchy the combat scene you showed didnt at all represent the game it has many strategic twists which make especially boss fights a blast and most importantly what separates this game from the competition is the fantastically realized world the world is filled with interactions and easter eggs what makes exploring rewarding and fun it might not be a game for everyone i get that but its a truly special and unique jrpg and one of the best to come out in years and if this video just wants to mock the genre there is honestly way better material out there you dont like rpgs in general the game is a solid throwback why even make this video reggie is a war criminal lol i got bored in the demo good thing to know im not alone not enough boss baby your excellency sorry dunks but did you even beat the game why are people trying to use the excuse that dunkey hates all rpgs therefore that somehow makes this video invalid when he mentioned 2 fuckin rpgs in the intro that he likes one of which was turn based jesus tap dancing christ didnt even give the game a fair chance sucks that a lot of people will be turned away from the game because they worship dunkeys opinion but whats your take on ligma your excellency hey donzo make good videos again there are a couple things preventing me from giving it a chance too the voice acting is kingdom hearts bad for example from clips ive seen i dont mind jrpgs in general having enjoyed ff9 and the ff3 remake for ds ever played legend of the dragoon if not you should dunkey we told you on the xenoblade review if you dont like jrpgs please dont play them it is obviously not your niche of gaming but for a lot more of peopple they are so people come here to hear donkeys opinion on a turn based jrpg and are disappointed to hear donkeys opinion on a turn based jrpg octopus traveler dunkey with the voice of reason again the comment section is hilarious btw dunkey i love your content i really do but as someone who got this game on launch day i will completely disagree with you on this one i think that the random encounters in this game were handled much better than in the early final fantasies for two reasons one normal enemies wont whoop your ass quite as hard and that the only real threat of having your party wiped out is by bosses two the random encounter rate is so much less frequent than any other jrpg ive played sure i get frustrated when it happens but i can actually explore the dungeons more freely due to the dropped rate of encounters and when encounters happen i love that the battles are so flashy and epic combined with the break mechanic and on the topic of character dialogue i think its very well written sure there are some characters that are less inspired than others but i think octopath actually takes the established archetypes and gives them just enough character for me to actually care about t you should have at least 20 mil subs at least play warframe plz so dunkey doesnt like old school jrpgs and he doesnt like this old school jrpg either in other news water is wet thanks i learned a lot have you played the octo expansion yet didnt even play alfyn where its just coincidence after coincidence into dude literally forgot the diseases symptoms that literally had him on his death bed i love dunkey but this video was just a video to trash on jrpgswhich we know he already doesnt like so whats the point of course its his channel so he can post anything he wants i just kinda thought the video was just dunkey complaining about a genre he doesnt like so yet again what is the point of making the video thumbs down for pointlessness lol to all the nerds who take dunkeys reviews seriously boohoo internet funny man has different preferences than you lol get a life this game is not good enough to spent my money your excellency i dunno this game looks pretty okay to me youre acting like its a 15 when it probably a 35 i know where youre coming from dunk but youve said before that you dont like this stuff why play it this might be the first video of yours i dislike not because i have any interest in playing this game myself but because its already well known you hate these kind of jrpgs so the video feels kind of redundant and its not helpful for people who might be interested in this game since your opinion is extremely biased yeah shit on the game so no one plays it nice work completely gloss over the superb combat or strategies gg i like the funny videos more than the reviews earthbound is amazing ffiii is amazing pokemon gold silver is amazing dark souls is amazing paper mario and super mario rpg is amazing octopath traveler which is a terrible title is mediocre i do like the levels and most of the visuals are really good sprite work but the game play is lacking at best the story is dog shit vid was excellency whens the play through dunkey never had any interest in this game or its entire genre but i dig the art design were on to you dunkeydont think we forgot that you did not review bookworm puzzle yet am i really the only one who loves random encounters and turn based combat i dont know why people say i look like bowser reggy 2014 dunkey is cool and all but almost all of his complaints kind of go away by the 5th hour finally ive been looking for a brutal review that completely ignores how pretty the game is when you review games its supposed to be nonbiased but with this one it seems you were ready to throw it in the trash when you got it because of the turn basedrandom encounter battles i agree with the story as them just having their own and the other travelers just going along for the ride but this is a very very polished jrpg almost every townsperson has an intricate story the characters have different job classesthe backgrounds are nice and the soundtrack is absolutely stunning have to put a thumbs down for this one dunkey last i the i checked your sub count was 43 million now its 48 million the only explanation for this phenomenon is that knack 3 has finally been teased dunkey my boy if you can look at pillars of eternity 2 its an rpg experience you wont forget essentially its the closest you can get to playing tabletop dandd with all the shenanigans strategy and depth you can want bless did you play the whole game it seems like youre doing what you claimed that crash reviewer of doing is your excellency prozd dunkey sipping on that bad opinion juice man it seems weird that dunkey is criticizing the game he made how dare you not justify my purchase downvoted your excellency i absolutely hate turn based combat this reminds me of dunkeys video on reviewers understand the reviewers tastes and know that if theirs doesnt line up with yours on a certain genre like rpgs then dont listen to them about that genre oh you actually did it hold on wait this isnt bookworm adventures deluxe very disappointed zero stars you blew it dunky more like dumbky finally a dunk video i though you caught ligma or something dunkman play persona 5 please at least the sprite work and style looks super good sees new dunkey review its not bookworn adventures deluxe but your excellecy prozd should voice your excellency playing with english audio i hated xenoblade chronicle 2 but loved this one thank you for this video your excellency this obviously wasnt for dunkey i dont understand why he even tried it i like octopus trapper but i agree in saying it may not be the strongest jrpg maybe too traditional also ive seen your videos on videogame journalism where you speak about how personal taste are important to to discuss their reviews and how youre not into this genre so and im not at all surprised of your reaction anyway i think you made some valid points your excellency i loved ffvi and ffvii when i played them but random encounters in a modern game is just nope get the shotguns the anime zombies are here and theyre salty cut em down now wheres my bookworm adventure deluxe dunkey youve cured me of my switch jellies ty stop hating on ophilia lol just refrain from making videos about turnbased rpgs now octopath is fantastic but excellency has become a dead term and i legitimately turned off my switch out of sheer agitation i think you went a bit too harshly on this i agree that the story is bland and the characters are a bit monotonous on their own but i enjoy the banter you have between them i think you also overlooked the combat too it looks great and breaking your enemy is always a lot of fun i thought the gameplay was actually really good its old school jrpg where grinding was legit i pictured kicking some one into a sea of spikes and shooting them with a bazooka far too vividly lol if you truly didnt enjoy this game try silicon softs other series bravely the combat far more fun and immersive the art style doesnt make your eyes bleed and it uses the 3ds hardware in any and every way possible thank god i watched this before i bought the game imagine my shock someone that doesnt like turn base combat doesnt like a turn base game thank you for your submission dunkey love ya man but stick to getting paid for promoting triple a developers graphical anus excreetions thumbs up tho i can not disagree with you more love this game still a entertaining video to watch your excellency excellency doesnt even sound like a word anymore he obviously didnt get very far into xc2 i love the artstyle so fucking much i didnt even notice anything else so far im feeling the same meh over it the only characters i like are therion and primrose dunkey how did you feel about lisas combat i know you said you dislike random encounters which lisa only has in a couple of areas in the painful and are nonexistent in joyful fights to me were more strategic than something like pokemon and enemies which were meant to be a piece of cake die in 1 turn id like to hear your full opinion on lisa since it is one of my favorites and we share a lot of the same tastes in rpgs also have you played lisa the hopeful or lisa the pointless the characters to interact in little banter segments i wouldnt play this rubbish if you paid me i dont get the hype over this game octopath more like octo suck heh this aint it chief plays a jrpg with english voice acting child of light i was expecting a more positive opinion but i digress to each their own make a video on bayonetta 2 boi i love this game but its shitty that so many butthurt people disliked this video all games especially jrpgs are not for everybody and dunder gave a fair review based on his opinion he deserves every ounce of praise for his honesty well this happens when you let some fucking weeabos to translate what happened to the basic sir your characters do interact just not in an obvious way if you have certain team members in your party after each story cutscene you can press the plus button to see them interact with each other there is no way to tell this outside of luckily encountering it or a guide so thats a design flaw i just thought i would say it here since what is said in the video is incorrect colour me unsurprised seems like you and i have the same feelings about turn based combat and random encounters dunkaccino okay but is there hentai of it yet im getting flashbacks to a certain content creators video in which he said that people who understand their biases should be careful on how they review games on this video alone there are already dozens of swift and thorough rebuttals that could be their own video without padding over single repetitive jokes your excellency perhaps this is not something you should have covered although i ended up being convinced that this game is probably worth my time by all of the people who strongly disagreed with your opinion so i suppose some end result was achieved either way eggcellency olberic cyrus therion ophilia primrose alfyn tressa hannit octopath i need you to do a video on baten kaitos eternal wings and the lost ocean yknow i dont agree with everything here but i get it i get why dunkey wouldnt dig it the comment section is salty your excellency at least if he could have learned the very simple to understand battle system just seems like this isnt his type of gamenever seen his other review vids best turnedbased combat ive ever played is divinity original sin 2 every encounter is a challenge in a way and there wasnt a single time where i sat there wanting to just skip my way through it and spam some overpowered attack instead every fight is a real engagement and you get to really plan out your every move moving around a battlefield instead of standing in one spot using different attacks the combat mechanics are excellently integrated into the openworld environment instead of cutting to some scene in a forest or a mountain or whatever another point which dos2 does infinitely better than octopath was the way the characters interact different characters have to meet the same person for their story and the others always have something to say about each others decisions and story through the regular conversations held by the different characters which really in my mind adds a layer of realness to the fact that youre a team playing it together and i honestly here come 12 year olds just putting excellency in their comments so they can get likes why tf ya all gotta stretch something so much ya all are the same people that would yell pickle rick your excellency needs to play 7 wonders for pc itll evolve hope sorry dunk but your opinion on rpgs is immediately discarded after you dissed xc2 see kids thats why you dont mess with nintendo fanboys hears excellency 50 times ya know i dont even think excellency is a real word oh wow the comments werent nearly as bad as i thought they would be good job internet your excellency is going to be destroyed by the comment section after this one knack 2 your excellency the japanese voices are 200 better man why did you stick with the shitty english ones especially since you didnt like it everything in the game is subtitledtext based so its not like you needed to understand it gray fox its that excellency i mean guys if you know dunkey he doesnt like turn based rpgs which is solely what this game is so of course hes gonna hate it i thought this game was a gem heard alotta good reviews for it pretty dissapointing tbh least favorite dunkey review yeah its no bravely default at least the game is a decent retelling of warriors of lightthis looks good but in a super jrpg romancing saga kinda of waydef a jrpg thats not for everyone itt butthurt remorseful buyers cant believe you spent 60 dollars on this trash lolololol these comments are so full of original pranksters and predictable jokes shut up please if you have nothing to add to humanity rpgmaker is not a programming software amirite fellas the new splatoon expansion looks great dunkey no offense but after seeing how your review on splatoon 2 was based on playing the game for like an hour and then going on to make bad assumptions and showing an announcer say however a million times and how people proved that you were pretty much lying about some things you said about survive while completely omitting others im not sure how i should take this video i know its fun to shit on games and express your honest frustration but whenever you give games a bad rap when they could deserve a bit more appreciation thats ruining the fun for everybody who actually liked these games hating on it becomes a meme public opinions go sour market research gets botched and sequels and further content gets scrapped you have almost 5 million subscribers dude you leave an impression you used to make reviews that were just messing around and werent too serious these reviews now are serious and im not gonna say you got any responsiblity i just dont see why are the stories separated though whats the point i generally enjoy all of your content but the your excellency bit made me laugh harder than ultimate skyrim did the first time i love your timingpacing i use it as a time killer nothing more i like looking at it and upgrading shit but it has to have the worst story in a game ive ever played i get this is supposed to be comedic but jrpgs just arent your thing man dont complain about its shortcomings when its just comes down to preference i love jrpgs i love turn based combat and i love random encounters i like strategizing and beat common monsters to build my way to the boss these are not flawed game mechanics you just dont like the genre your excellency youre that ninja holy shit dunkey i just found out you can run by watch your video haha triggered fanboys all over member when jim sterling gave botw a 710 and the same fanboys lost their panties over it oh i member alright dunkey is probably gonna get shit on for not liking this game this game is great but is isnt bookworms adventure deluxe so im gonna have to pass 210 i dont think its good that dunk is being so harsh to reggie he need to remeber that we need to give reggie a good reputation so he can eventually give us our knack 2 hd for the switch someone should send this to etika the only thing this game has going for it is the art style had my doubts about this game and you just solidified my fears thanks dunk you mah boy pack it up fam youre done back to the microsoft sponsorship best 3 minutes of my week so far wait how many dunkopoints did it get im disappointed there isnt an octopus path just imagine it so far you have a group of different yet similar people on a journey and then you just come across a new character and its squidward a bard that plays a clarinet so poorly it can damage enemies and does dances so cool it can buff your team the hidden final boss is squidwards brother who has a unibrow and a forgettable name dam it ricky you blow it again whawt i dont agree with wunkey i must dislike video bro you are the best reviewer this game doesnt do anything new you can interact with the world by guiding npcs to either fight beside you or take them to quest points you can choose to steal items or just buy them from npcs you can duel any npc apart from bartenders the story is generic but then you point out how you didnt pay any attention since its not a generic revenge story the dialog can be bland they all have different accents and ways of speaking and it gets right to the point theres not 2 hours of introduction for each character its short and to the point the your excellency is part of the story shes part of a religious following and hes the head of that church what do you expect her to call him supp big papa you seem to be complaining the game is a jrpg and not anything wrong with octo itself i generally like dunkeys videos and this isnt a game im invested in but damn it seems like hes trying to complain for the sake of complain not because the dunkey what is your psnsteamnintendo gametag so i can follow u i give this review a 07 for not using the title octopoop travesty why must you dislike things your excellency 23k salty fanboys you are the toxicity in every gaming community personally i love this game and what sucks is that you make very convincing points but youve already mentioned that you generally dont like jrpgs in your game critics video so the game isnt bad just because youre not the biggest fan of the genre but what do i know im just some idiot writing a stupid youtube comment and trying not to offend anyone i kinda hate random encounters and turn based combat too but when i play pokemon this become not a thing your excellency wheres the rating this video was such an excellency everything is made by reggie now curious how far into the game you got youre the dankest dunk who ever dunked a dank im just surprised justin y hasnt commented yet 1 game has the best story ever 2 the fights are supposed to be that way 3 the stories has something in common except if you cant win some snails to move forward so that you are able to see it 4 its maybe the only game in this genre that has been sold out twice or maybe more games did that 5 good old time graphics with fresh technologies thrown into the mix i get it that this is your thing to get the views but still that game not deserve it could easily do that on the treasure hunter the mario game or however it is called ps jrpg with english voice have some honor please a turnbased rpg that dunkey hates wow that unheard of switch exclusive god i hate exclusives id actually play this if i could get it on pc book worm adventures is a much better game i would highly recommend you playing it this game is garbo because it doesnt even try to reach a graphical standart hope this 816 bit shit trend goes away soon i will fight you dunkey i agree i love jrpgs and the sprite work is beautiful i expected a slam dunk the music score is inviting the engine allows for a wellintegrated use of blur to make the world map immersive instead of a new favorite i find the characters and dialogue insufferable cyrus in particular is an absolute tool anime protagonist the game has such an egregious amount of random encounters to the point that combat is a chore if i dont have the support ability to reduce random encounters im doing some earthbound levels of fighting sometimes as often as every 6 steps there is just enough preduction value for it to be a 510 but this game is far from a love letter to the nostalgia of the audience intended only half the characters had an interesting hook but its jarring that they all run in parallel without interacting during stories there is an overall shadowy presence among some scenes but the narration just falls flat its really annoying to have the pace of the st dunkey where my octo expansion video at all the points he didnt like are the reasons i picked up the game i mean the demo was free we all knew what we were getting into its a 45 lmao dunkey is my kind of player classic jrpgs are so damn cringy play playstation now cutout soundbites of a character addressing another character by their title isnt an example of bad dialogue come on dunk you can do better than that oh damm i heard so many good things about this game i honeslty thought you are going to give this game a positive review anyway thanks dunkyy d keep it up im going to play persona 5 again because of this lol reggie did nothing wrong your excellency this video is intellectually dishonest your excellency ive put over 45 hours into the game and that include skipping all the cutscenes for ophilia and olberic because they have the worst ones but then you get to primrose and its kinda dark and really interesting or haanit which is just a cool character in general not all storys are equal but fuck you get eight so rank em how you please dont just pick the 2 lame ones and pass them off as a representation of the game everyone will feel a little different about the narratives but its in the name so duh combat in this game i find much more fun than persona5 which is similar but doesnt do enough with its mechanics that are interesting or fun but in octopath its a ton of fun doing guard breaks boost to either chip away at guard or to maximize damage building your team and customizing with different job classes which make no team or same set of classes the samethis game a ton of mechanics in combat that play i was waiting for that metal gear solid reference ouch i heard this game was good tho when i saw the first trailer i thought they were going to design the game around your choice of character like if you pick one you will see the other characters in different parts of their plots and interact differently as well making every playthough on each character different its disappointing that you just do the same stuff with every character and that it doesnt really matter who you pick at the start because you get everyones skill at some point sometimes its the simpler things that make it fun dunk oh please your excellency have mercy its really upsetting dunkey was so on point with that game critics video it was so true but this video proves to me that hes no better then any of those game crtitcs that dunkey made a whole video critizing immensely dissapointed with this video octopimps new games just arent the same i know you hated 2 but if youre looking for a jrpg that i think youll actually like play xenoblade chronicles 1 the writing is a lot better the voice acting is actually really good especially shulk the battle system is kind of like 2s except with a lot less character specific bullshit and the anime tropes that plagued 2 are almost completely absent in 1 in favor of actual character development and worldbuilding hell even the furby has his moments guys let it be knownopinions exist i love this game shit maybe because i have the biggest hard on for jrpgs and i give credit to octodunk for tryin it out his opinion shouldnt effect yours it was a valid opinion given by someone who played the game hell even i agree with some of his points chill out what makes a recent jrpg good persona 5 why are you playing a jrpg if you said that you hated turnbased rpgs that doesnt makes any sense boi this game really makes you feel like the bookworm adventurer but it has pretty lighting what is your problem this is turned based like quest which if you dont remember you rated it as a good game to me it was a great game and they tried to capture that nostalgia for us once more on top of that the story of quest was great even if the dialogue sucked a which ohhh looky there same thing i love dunkeys content regardless but after you got banned you seem to have this distrust with games and them trying to recapture some good ideas and bring it back youre about as creditable as buzzfeed when it comes to rating any game lol you yourself ruined that credibility when you rate great games so low but used to dick ride league of legends which your growth in subs grew from there in which you said was repetitive and boring hmmm yep playing a boring game makes sense to me lmfao good job dunk youve 180d back into rants more than actually trying to rate the game 1league of legends uh oh here comes the downvotes from the fanboys look i wanted this game to be good like everyone else wanted when i first saw the game it looked amazing unfortunately it isnt thanks for stating the truth dunkey dunky review the splatoon 2 dlc spitting out facts i knew this game would be trash i have no clue why nintendo pushed this so hard for so long wow i saw a lot of people praising the game and when i played it i felt just like you dunk im glad someone had the balls to say how the game really is this game is flying off the shelves and selling out if you hate rpgs dont fucking play or review them your opinion about this game has 0 value i mean if you dont like grindy turn based combat this isnt the game for you its just simply the genre of the game i reccomend knack 3 what if we could just go after pokemon that we could see in the environment and like actually track them and see how they behave in the wild and control the pokemon so that we could actually try to dodge attacks and use more than 4 moves turn based combat fucking sucks it pleases me greatly to hear this young african hindu lord explain so eloquently what ive been saying for years about turn based combat and random encounters i see where hes coming from with a lot of his points but personally im very much enjoying this game i like this one dunko but it aint bookworm adventure 2 dunkeys worst video swing and a total miss on this one this review was not even in the right ball park reminder that this video is meant to be funny and not a serious review to everyone taking it as one and getting upset that dunkey has a general negative opinion on most jrpgs what the actual fuck is wrong with youalmost all stories that had this game sold out on the first day and your shifting on thisi mean yeah the story is long but if you played the prologue demo youll know there storys and you can skip themduh still gonna wait for a sale on this one if someone hasnt noticed yet narrative in videogames doesnt appeal dunkey too much pixel game with good graphics and terrible story ehhh lets just call this one minecraft 2 i respect and understand your view on his game your excellency but i really like this game i loved the gameplay however your excellency i do agree that the characters or at least the one you picked which i also picked are somewhat generic i know you have the patience of a toddler dunkey the game was made for people who enjoy slow pacing not for videogame dunkeys breathe easy sonic fans sega got this one right thanks reggie im with dunkey on this one i seriously fail to understand why more and more games get horrible hoooorrible voice acting i wouldnt know if its horrible in japanesea language i dont understand so i can only speak for the english va and then proceed to have the game fully voiced i just want to play the game not have an aneurysm i can handle turnbased combat and random encounters except for maybe the ff style with a billion menus and submenus i got through fire emblem awakenings only because somehow it gripped me holy shit this guy has an opinion actually thought by himself what a legend if you want to play a real game you should play bookworm adventures deluxe uses english dubs on a japanese game its cringy welcome to the earth donkey uh oh this review isnt in favor of the game nintendos gonna copyright claim it quick i love ya but youre wrong about this one your excellency no but seriously the writing and world building in this game is just as good as dark souls probably better yeah this was a pretty meh review i was expecting till the end that he would say something positive but nope too biased its a good game for any jrpg fan and made by the same guys who made bravely default second please no buy this sht download a snes emulator and play final fantasy vi your dunkcellency the way the game looks is pretty cool tho a surprise to be sure but a welcome one it honestly seems from your video that you didnt even make it 14 of the way through the game i found your review this time to be way offtarget you are correct that it follows my leastfavorite jrpg trend where it takes way too fucking long for the story to actually begin and get rolling but your review seems to miss the parts where you have to chose which character to follow how they begin to intertwine to form a complete story and the combat which gets way more involving than in your own words just wasting your time with mere pawns the game isnt perfect by far and it does have my least favorite jrpg tropes but nothing that stands out about the game was mentioned here this seems more like a first impression video than a full dunkview octopath traveler is definetly a game for people who like rpgs so im not surprised by this outcome dunkey straight slaughtered this game you dont like classic rpgs fair enough that could be your whole video in a sentence octodad traveler just doesnt live up to its prequel in terms of quality no rating what is the meaning of this the thing about this game is that the story is great but the gameplay sucks i wish this game had better combat so dunkey makes fun a real game bubsy 3dand everyone laughs but when donky makes fun a stupid gameoctodad traveler you guys mass dislike nice dunkey really struck a chord with this one the game is actually great i am not sure if the guy that made the video hates rpgs or something however there is definitely something wrong in his head if he can honestly say that octopath traveler is a bad game stunkly has been a fake look at his face reveal he looked so young so fresh now he looks like boogie2988 if he was poop this aint dusley come on he lubmly loves league of legends not owl man i gotta agree with you dunk i was happy to hear this was gonna be like a final fantasy 6 2 but it is terribly paced and boring for me about 6 hours in kinda sad we got a video on this and not persona 5 this title is the prodigal nostalgia bait jesus that was so brutal i didnt even get to finish getting stoned by the time regi blew it i dont agree this this review but if you were gonna dog on the writinghaanit haanits way of speech was out of control your excellency wheres knack 3 this game makes your excellency feel like reggie its begun the nintendard uprising the game looks and plays like an uninspired mess of pixelated bloom it panders to nostalgia fags stuck in the old ages of gaming thank your excellency i didnt buy this your excellency sounds scarily like prozd if i had a dollar for every time ophilia said your excellency id be the king i felt like i was alone in not liking this game now i jumped into the demo expecting an old throwback to snes era final fantasy style gameplay but after the initial cutscene starting off one of the characters i was immediately disappointed with how theres a radar telling you where youre supposed to go at all times there is now literally no point to try to figure out anything on your own or to talk to npcs and when i did the exploring in town and went to the waypoints on the radar all the cutscenes were boring as hell explaining information that had already been explained and taking too damn long doing it the graphics themselves i shit you not is literally just a basic 25d rendition of final fantasy 6 graphics with a bunch of filters and a muted color palette please guys give me one reason to play this over ff6 again i havent grinded in the game cuz spamed bewilderin grace c thats too bad but he did tell us he hates turn based combat like five maybe six videos ago i myself usually hate it too but this game definitely is different to me but to each his own its good to have a reviewer that has consistency and doesnt flop opinions around like a fish on dry land the only good jrpg i have ever played was bookworm adventures deluxe i dont see dunkview in the title im laughing at all the people saying you just dont like jrpgs thumbs down he gives examples in the video of jrpgs that he likes for being unique and fun even turnbased games like persona 5 have interested dunkey dismissing criticism for the reason that he doesnt like this genre is as dismissive as saying its good simply because you do like the genre dunkey pointed out the reasons the game didnt interested him and felt subpar compared to other games in the genre in what universe is that dismissive in the era of gaming were in its entirely reasonable to compare jrpgs to other games if turnbased combat isnt unique or done in an exciting way and if the style of the game is similar to games of the past its perfectly reasonable to judge it as such im not saying octopath traveler is a bad game but if octopath traveler is a game that borrows from older jrpgs but is released in 2018 of course it should be criticized as a modern game theres plenty of other jr i was wondering if youve ever played banner saga and what you think of the turn based combat in that game so it really is a great jrpg you know nothing your excellency oh no dunky does like the game that i happen to like what is wrong with him why cant he think the same way i think even though him not liking the game is inoffensive i guess ill go back to liking and enjoying the game even though im still mad at him for some reason someday reggie is gonna call you out dunk im warnin ya dunkey i got a boss baby add on this video how do you do it whats the ending music also the game looks gorgeous i mean i dont like turnbased rpgs either but thats just my taste much like the other comments on this video your complaints about this game are about the genre in general and its not really a good review because you already have a bias against the game im so mindboggled by all these people hating on this video for him not liking jrpgs i will accept the review is flawed but i mean people are saying why did you buy the game if you knew you werent going to like it and that is just baffling to me if this way of thinking was happening i wouldnt have ended up playing games as phantom pain r6 and persona 5 because im not into those genres i wanted to try them out because they could be different and they were very good and different if this mentality was on than nobody would play videogames because sometimes people will buy a game even though its from a genre they do not like because there is a possibility that the game will be different also this could be applied to you in the first place why do you watch this review if you know he is going to bash the game well maybe because maybe his review was going to be positive than why cant he try a game from a genre he does not like if he thinks it will be good lot of salty people that like boring video games if dunkey hates it it must be a good game whats even the point of this video yourre a comedian and not a reviewer so what do you gain from doing something you dont like you take things out of context and deliberately ignore mechanics to fit your opinion its like youre intentionally missing in a shooter and say this shooter is bad so this video is neither informative as a review nor funny you failed in both categories you want to be if you dont have something creative to upload instead of this cheap quick shit dont upload anything at all i stopped watching dunky after he said honk kong 98 for the apple ii was bad dunky its a jrpg what were you expecting i still really like this game i do wish that the characters interacted with one another and had their own opinions and thoughts on the actions of the other characters but i still enjoy going down the story of each character i really enjoyed bravely default even with the random encounter turn based combat this game takes a similar route in that you can boost in a similar manner that you could brave in bravely default allowing a different type of tactics it really does depend on the person thankfully there is a demo that allows you to try out all 8 characters before you even have to buy it plus it saves your progress on those characters so i do recommend trying out the demo at least full persona 5 dunkview when cant wait for octo dad with 8 dads battle royale looks like shity divinity original sin still not bookworm adventure deluxe i remember a video i think the ign sucks one where dunkey says he dislikes jrpgs he pointed out things jrpg fans arent going to care about so yeah from what ive heard its still a solid game the funny or unfunny thing is that dunkey claims the core mechanics of the game are slow and then procceeds to show an example where olberic explicitely doesnt use weaknesses to break the slug and make the fight faster and just keeps spamming the basic sword attack also he was runninh around with a lvl 22 olberic solo wheres the rest of the team wheres the mention that the enemies on the different chapter 1s level scale so that was actually a lvl 22 snail and not a lvl 1 one dunkey should stick to comedy skits because hes honestly shit at reviews your excellency youre that ninja tactics ogre 94 need to grind set units to ai and kick back plenty of characters story choices so nice uh oh people are gonna be mad about this one dunk all the dislikes are just from people who wish this was as good as knack 2 i watch dunkey videos for entertainment and memes not this biased showcase for a genre hes known to not like i still love this game i wonder if sky told dunkey about this nah fam good game is good battle system is tops music is fantastic story is comfort food love the game yes i guess battles are long when you leave the other 3 characters at home use the basic attack without boost only and use the wrong weapon type on top of that basically the weakest least damage dealing thing he could possibly do short of simply hitting defend every turn and he did it and his retarded fanbase thinks the game is like this now this isnt a review guys can you make an octopath traveler video the art style looks so good tho i like the game i find it great but i do respect your decisions and there are boring parts to the game i agree with you for some things but i find it fun but also respect your opinion do you think you could do a full dunkview on persona 5 i know how you feel about turnbased anime rpgs but i do remember your little snippet saying that it was pretty good and i thought your pokemon mixed with inception was pretty funny but i would like a more in depth dunkview if you wouldnt mind doing it generic jrpg no way bro your shrekcellency now play deus ex i understand that it would be time consuming but they shouldve really figured out the character relationships between the travelers so thered be unique and interesting dialogue depending on the order you add them to your party was this video real well dunkey did mention before he doesnt like jrpgs so ill take it the game is good to all the guys getting offending and disliking this video because of the dunks opinion 1 watch his video on game critics 2 come back in ten years you almost got to the good parts but yeah chapter 1 for 6 of the characters suck butt and primrose and haanit have really lame chapters that first character is literally just obiwan kenobi look i like dunkey as much as the next guy but i cant take any review of his seriously if its about a turned based rpg because he hates them lol hes got a bias going into it and never mentions anything positive about the games what is this romancing saga 4 i didnt know where to look blurry sun bright background or tiny pixels of a character play bookworm adventures deluxe from now on i will only refer to dunkey as his excellency something tells me dunkey just isnt a fan of classic turn based jrpgs in general horrible writing in this game i love this game but the video isnt wrong at all hahai just have a lot of patience for shitty jrpgs in general so this is fuckin amazing comparatively how to enjoy the game step 1 turn off voices step 2 skip the dialogue step 3 enjoy the combat system and how fluidly the characters can interact with each other in battle the video is about as redundant as the game itself none of it is really eye opening or entertaining im totally with you on this one dunkey maybe a better system could be one that once you are strong enough to kill something quickly it doesnt make a big deal of it patent pending holy shit donkey i was on my way to buy this thank u donkey why is this comment section the saltiest pile of fanboys ive ever seen opinions are opinions my friends honestly i think its the best jrpg ive played totally offbase with the snail fight comparison almost every fight requires a good amount of thought especially if you want those end fight bonuses you have to think and consider if you want to use up a point or three now or wait because each point you use now is in a sense two points wasted later because by using points one turn you dont earn one the next turn combine this with shield breaking and you have layers of strategy to think about well i could use three points right now to break this guys shield this turn because then he wont attack my healer and potentially kill her but if i do that then i have no points to buff up my attack while his shield is broken but if i take it slow to break his shield ill have three points to spend on beating the hell out of him when his shield is broken and thats just one of your characters with one of the enemies the complexities multiply when theres 9 guys on the fie tales of symphonic baaaaabbyyyyyy always first why does dunky play jrpgs when he knows he hates them and not one that bucks formula but one that from day one has advertised itself as a throwback specifically for fans of oldschool jrpgs is that a pro excellency prewatch thats a lot of dislikes postwatch negative opinions are controversial and i guess the animation must of given it a lot of diehard fans so yeah i can understand but that soundtrack tho doesnt like turn based games doesnt like new turn based game reviews it for man child audience and so his mothergirlfriend can talk him good job lmao i got excuse me princess ptsd when i head your excellency over and over and over and over and over and over and over again do prey ur excellency i really like the game but i like jrpgs i can see how ppl who dont normally like jrpgs would hate the game you blame an rpg for random encounters and turnbased fights this review is literally more stupid than too much water just wait for shin megami tensei v an actually good jrpg i take it he didnt get through haanits dialogue that bothered me infinitely more than ophelias terrible dialogue i love the fact that now dunkey hates splatoon 2 and ot 2 of my favorite games in the switch and i still kinda like him i dont know man this game seems really fun damn just some straight truth random battles is why i never liked final fantasy games even in the 90s i couldnt see what was so compelling to all my friends i hope now this type of battle system is seen as antiquated and not done any more i had a good go at chrono trigger at the time because that feature wasnt as bad but couldnt stand the grind of boring battles and couldnt beat the first boss it was just ordering attacks off a restaurant menu and waiting 20 seconds for them to appear on the screen id already played quake by then yeah playing a game for a short amount of time in comparison too the lenght of it will do that to you i would say that octopath is worth it and complaining about grinding when you didnt even play that much kek youre excellency youre that ninja sponsored idk im a fan of turnbased rpgs but two things about them above all else need to be updated with our future space technology random encounters and grinding the latter was somehow managed by bravely defaultsecond where the customization and option for autobattle means that youll likely be max level long before you ever reach the final boss as for random encounters its hightime that all random encounters occur within the game world and not some alternate dimension if you really wanna stretch your graphical capabilities then make it so that the turnbased combat seems almost seamless like if transistor combat was fullyrealized ah so refreshing this excellency makes you feel like batman finally legit review the game is generic af but looks gorgeous man v is losing its shit okay but knack 2 and bookworm adventures deluxe are basically the same fucking game when it comes to comparing which one is better a real shame dunkey puts one in the shadows and knack 2 on a holy grail i liked it but i respect your opinion your excelldunkey persona 5 really made one amazing improvement on the jrpg combat system and that was the held at gunpoint mechanic that means if you fight the same guys you can just use their weakness and they will surender given that plus the handcrafted puzzle filled dungeons which seldom happen in jrpgs and a robust and deep combat system made it an exceptional jrpg talking about the combat here i wont compare school slice of life with fantasy so why do developers keep sticking to the old ways of making jrpgs if one game fixes the problems learn from it its like if fps developers wouldnt use real 3d because somebody else has used it before honestly when mentioning dialogue i was expecting him to shit on haanit and that awfulness hast thou seenith this person o hunter havent watched the video yet but the first thing i have to wonder is why he chose to play this game if he tends to dislike jrpgs specially this kind i mean im not really surprised dunkey doesnt like turnbased rpgs or anime there was like 0 chance he would like this game i knew this game looked boring also 911 was an inside job first time ive completed disagreed with dumpy this game is the art style story and battle systems ive missed since the ps1 its not for everyone but for us that its for its amazing whoever made random encounters should be kicked in a pit of spice and shot with a bazooka thats actually my favourite dunkey quote from now on this game just got roasted hard by your excellency complains about random combat encounters tfw passive ability to make that happen so little at the start my only problem with the game is that characters not in your party dont get any exp to level up along side your active party id appreciate even a little exp i think the tales of games do this but not 100 sure this would make playing the game much more enjoyable for me also the travel banter thing which begins in each characters 2nd chapter as far as i can tell only your active party can have travel banter which sucks when i wanna hear what someone not in my party wants to say about a situation ive finished 48 2nd chapters so im hoping im wrong you have up to 8 playable characters but the 4 youre not actively using just act and feel like theyre not there soits a mastahpeeece any good jrpgs in this style for ps4 im itching to play one but idk where to start knew it was too good to be true put this on the ps4 damn i wouldve liked to hear a more detailed and specified critique i aint mad that u dislike the game but the writing of this video fell short this was actually a useful review why did dunkey review this if he hates jrpgs now a bunch of the braindead dunkey fans are gonna hate on this without even playing it i never played this but i know bravely default had some good ass gameplay bad video dunk i still love you tho reggieyou gone fudged it up either you fall for a character or you dont get into the game i immediately bought into tressas quest to bring equitable business practices to every corner of the world this comment section is salty af dunkey is funny as hell and i love that boi but yeah he didnt do jack in this game the grinding isnt bad considering hes in the low twenties fighting a level 1 snail which you cant do thats its shield and not making use of boost he probably overleveled in low level areas without making proper use of the boost system breaks and skills which yeah if i did that id probably hate the game too to me dunkeys channel is based on talking about whatever shit he wants to talk about whether it be something he likes hates or anything in between people in these comments seem to think this is a serious dunkview or something when its simply a discussion on rpgs using octopath as an example im a fan of rpgs but i dont see why you guys are criticizing his decision to make this video exactly like it is xenoblade 2 is good though shouldve played it in japanese with subtitles play book worm adventures 2 your excellency this looks like something shat out of rpg maker what im wondering is when dunkey is gonna finally do final fantasy x2 for its better battle system much better than x 93 out of 10 has something for everyone and it makes you feel like batman when even was the last great jrpg 1997 no offense but your critique on jrpgs should be taken with a grain of salt since you dont really seem to like them in the first place youre right about all of that but lemme tell ya somtin no this one isnt for you dunk its a great game but yeah i didnt think youd like it just give me final fantasy tactics 2 dang i really am liking this game this game did not live up to the hype the story and combat are so uninspired at least my 100 copy came with a pop up book one of the most entertaining games on switch right now 7810 not enough excellency its a fine monday to see a dunkey video uploaded your excellency from what i can construe its just a jrpg played straight no gimmicks but no real innovation either and considering dunkey isnt a fan of the genre in the first place the main selling point which is the story is hit or miss this is the logical review its a niche game in my opinion but at least its a popular niche gauging by the amount of positive reception it has recieved thus concludes my opinion of the opinion stated in this video i rate this video 35 this video sums up why i didnt buy this game i loved the demos dearly but i could tell theseissues especially with its story structure would bother me greatly stick to comedy dunkey open the salt catchers its gonna be a good haul today the year before last i beat every final fantasy up to 9 100 for an essay on the topic of religion and extremism themes and what it means to be blinded by faith or battling faith under orders with no understanding of it needless to say i dont know how i can play invest a second of my life in a jrpg unless im sure its worth it which considering how all of them are damn near the same itd have to have some compelling game mechanics and its own original thing going on to ever do that to myself again octopath looked like it couldve been fresh im glad dunks covered it so i know its not also final fantasy are some of the most stupid games ever theres a mute in ff2 that can communicate with beavers in ff7 theres a enemy thats a triceratops with motor cycles for legs theres also a house you can fight ffvs final boss is a tree final fantasy 4s epic ending involves a mech like liberty prime and an adventure on the moon final fantasy the first look up time loop in ff6 moog i am offended and feel personally attacked if you spam j on the keyboard while watching this you get a a dunkey remix bbbbbback bbbback while ive enjoyed the game so far the your excellency shit got real annoying that being said i need to get into the chapter 2 sections and see if they actually have some character interaction i heard there is some so heres hoping that you also are just not as far as i am this guy only likes knack and memes octopath traveler heh more like psy i am hit in the head with a pan killing me instantly hey if you dont care for the game you can give it to me complaints about voice acting like this makes me happy i learned japanese yeah the game is still generic but as always the japanese voice acting is done a lot better the interjections also make more sense because the japanese use a lot more hmmms and similar nonwords to express things whereas in the english va everything has to be a word yeah i stopped listening to dunkey after that time when he did not play more bookworm delux 2 wait a minutethis isnt splatoon wtf complaining about a jrpg having turn based combat is like complaining about an fps having guns this review is straight ass how many your excellencys out of 5 dunk god ophelias story dragged on for so long and the dialogue was so cringy never cared for octopath dunkler you should review streets of the rogue i knew dunkey wasnt gonna like this game when i first saw it i was like fuckkk this game is gonna disappoint the highdetail 2d sprites on pretty 3d environments makes for a dope ass aesthetic tho can you give me a list for the games in the start of the video thx having to listen to dunkey shit on one of your most enjoyed games of 2018 was hard i didnt even see an octopus anywhere in it this game really makes you feel like your excellency your advice is nice the world design looks amazing tho why is dunkey doing a review of a jrpg he knows hes not gonna like didnt he make fun of game journalist for doing the same thing he just did rn guys just accept it classic bythenumbers jrpgs are shit random encounters have no place in this or any game after we got out of the nes its just holding on to a shitty tradition for traditions sake eh i like the game turn based combat is fun for some people and the story gets better you really dont need to grind like crazy in this game just do all the chapters and you will be fine the boss battles are usually engaging and require strategy it kind of feels like you went into this game ready to hate it you already mentioned in previous videos you dont like jrpgs so why bother dragging this one down this game must suck this game is bad because it doesnt appeal to my specific standards and sensibilities damn dunkey really channeled his inner egoraptor for this one disclaimer this is a jooooke im jooooking dunkey not liking an rpg might still be good game if you like slow combat cuz the animations are sick gotta love these reviews tho thanks dunkey some people here are misconstruing what dunkey stands for as a selfproclaimed game critic and who he is at his core would it be ideal for all game critics to become entirely objective completely removed from bias yes but unfortunately the world doesnt work that way every reviewer has hisher biases something that stands out that would potentially break or make the game dunkeys just happens to be turnbased combat and random encounters dunkey has offered justification for this entirely subjective opinion in the past and it is up to not dunkey but the viewer to determine what to do with that justification it is up to the viewer to look at their own biases what they value in a game and look at what dunkey values come to your own conclusions tldr literally watch the game critics video i actually like primrose and her story a new video your excellency so when dunkey says a turn base jrpg game is bad that means this jrpg pretty god damn good ok but its still not bookworm adventures deluxe dunkey y u keep playing rpgs if you hate them even i dont like turn based combat in general but dvinity original sin 2 is has awesome turn based combat this guy is funny but this was bullshit this entire video doesnt matter since its a rpg and the story doesnt matter its all about the action how big is the game its 60 reggie didnt drop the ball my friend hes hard at work crafting the next addition to the knack eu with mark cerny this also explains the lack of crossplay from sony theyre waiting for knack 3d to blow your velcro sandals off its gonna be one for the history books my friend its gonna be the next 1997 my friend dunkey spent tons of hours grinding minions in league now complains about grindy game which u can complete in 60 hours most of jrpgs are all about grind but i love you anyway baybeeeeee honestly the turn based rpg genre is just flawed only a few games have done it remotely well undertale paper mario etc sorry but this was a really bad review man know you dont like rpgs but youre really showing your bias here your only valid point was about the stories being disconnected that dialogue was cherrypicked and taken outofcontext and that wasnt a fucking level 1 snail your main character was level 21 dude if thats how youve been levelling up in this game then you clearly dont understand what exploration is because ot does not require any fucking grinding if you dont like random encountersturnbased combat then fine but this review just makes you sound like a fuckin idiot dude please try hyper light drifter ive played through only 3 12 hours so far have 4 characters and not once did i have to grind yeah the your excellency thing was so fucking annoying but it was slightly needed to show her growth that she called him father one last time random encounters were done very well and i have not encountered the snails just yet but maybe you should have went to a different area youre supposed to exploit your enemys weakness not wail on it especially when it has some form of healing the mechanic that doubles triples and even quadruples your attacks and attack damage accelerates the gameplay and with this mechanic you are able to wail on people if you do not have their weakness you should be able to do more than enough damage to kill it with this but if the encounter is taking too long due to healing or something just leave and come back with someone who can exploit the weakness stories are very broken up and it does ruin a bit of the game because at the point where since i have a ton of similar opinions to dunkey so i was excited to see this review since i was on the fence and i was expecting to hear lots of good things about the game lets just say my decision has been made dunkey try darkest dungeon i think you might like it yeah this game isnt for people who dont like jrpgs but if you do its a really great one wheres my bubsy jrpg nintendo to be honest games made with only nostalgia in mind end up ruining the memories hey dunkey if you by chance dont want the game anymore can i get it ill pay full price for it hey its me can we just admit that jrpgs just arent very good maybe in the 90s it was impressive but times have moved on im sick of hearing that its an acquired taste or that im close minded to other cultures despite years of being told this people outside of japan still arent buying them the way that they do mass effect of the witcher which is more likely that all those people are intolerant and close minded or that the games simply arent very good but theres no grappling hook something something bookworm dekuxe confirmed your excellency for smash bros 2k28 confirmed here we know you dont like jrpgs so stop making videos about them the ninth secret character is knack 3 looks like a generic saga frontier those graphics though just another horrible bravely default you know back in the day turn base rpgs were actually the best games out there what happened bbut its a good game your excellency dragon quest 8 is probably my favorite jrpg and chrono trigger too dunkey calling it like it is one game at a time so many people bitching in the comments that dunkey cant review this game because he doesnt like turn based combat do whatever the hell you want i enjoyed the video and im sure many others did great now all the dumb people who cant think for themselves are gonna be like durr im gonna play octopus traveler cuz de dunky told me too sad how this happened with enter the gungeon even though that game was out since 2016 now people are giving a shit about it lol your excellency may i suggest bookworm adventures deluxe dunkey is the first person who i havent seen dick ride this game aw man im so disappointed not in the review but in the result i wanted this game to be awesome with so many characters i was hoping theyd interact and stuff but if all it is is random long winded encounters and stilted story then thats a little bit of a drag man i never turned the english on the japanese va is great i feel so bad for people who played in english even the name of the game is misleading there wasnt a single octopus to be found anywhere come on reggy this review in a nutshell if you dont enjoy turn based rpgs you probably wont enjoy this one i literally just bought a switch and was considering this game but nah you know bookworm adventures deluxe doesnt have any random encounters so play it instead so whats his deal with random encounters i get it can be repetitive but its not that bad the sound design is god tier and the combat mechanics are compelling for me a lover of all turned based and even my absolute beginner girlfriend everything else is absolute shit though and thats really disappointing i mean in all fairness this is coming from someone who hates rpgs basically anyone who doesnt loves the hell out of this game you would think they thought that through i like the art haha guys he said the thing about the video game and that makes it bad because dunkey said it everyone laugh at the game now because you all believe dunkey and dont think for yourselves he pointed out annoying dialogue haha guys laugh its supposed to be funny dunkey im warning you you better play reader rabbit random encounters is the reason why i never finished ff7 holy shoot dunkey the black guy shoot a new video cmon reggie this wasnt your best stand love the graphics and the background styling but damn this looks bad otherwise well fights in rpgs as a whole are longer than in most games thats where grind comes in ffxv tw3 and tons of more do the same and theyre not turn based i know rpgs isnt your thing mostly but this is something that a lot of people criticise only about turn based games while ignoring it in any other game its not a problem its a part of the genre yeah but the artstyle tho dunkey if you are interested in a rpg that has excellent storytelling great character dialogue and character development i definitely suggest final fantasy 9 i would thoroughly enjoy you doing such a video i do have to say that it has random appearances and turnbased combat its so worth it though does anyone else get a saga frontier feel from this yeah this is precisely why the only rpg game i really play is pokemon but even then its because pokemon was the first game i ever played and the sentimentality and nostalgia can get me through the mindless grinding that is random encounters there were random encounters in the original phantasy star which was the original jrpg so blame them octo expansion path traveler if i write your exelency in the coment section i will get so many likes this game is a huge step down from octodad gotta disagree with you on this one dunk first time that i can recall disagreeing with dunkey on a game oh well to each their own gotta agree on this one jrpg as a genre has struggled to advance past its tedious roots which were moulded by technological limitations throwing you into hundreds of identical tedious fights was once acceptable because it was the only way to make a lengthy rpg game essentially it was padding with hardware and memory limitations lifted the genre has in my opinion failed to grow with some notable exceptions you can tell he didnt actually play the game for more than a few hours when he says the characters dont talk to each other dunkey you should make a video about octopath traveler this video was good your excenllency if its not fun why bother im really glad someones finally being critical of this game everyones so busy jizzing themselves over it since e3 and ive been like um sounds like generic old jrpg with unforgivably bland turn based combat no thanks not even if it was free im just waiting for nintendogs hd to come out but with a more darksouls aproach where you really feel like batman your excellency should play bookworm adventures deluxe its amazing if i hear excellency one more time im blowing my brains out dunkey hates rpgs proceeds to berate rpg game in video okay then so basically this game is great for rpg players hmm this is like the first time ive disagreed with you i agree on most parts but overall i love the game as it feels like almost a next generation jrpg in the sense of the audio assets being top notch voice acting and music excluding that shakespearian crap and the priest repetition its the first jrpg that i have actually wanted to play more than thirty minutes i dislike turnbased and these types of game in general i dont know if its the comfort of playing it on the switch and good audio thats carrying me but i am just glad to have a jrpg i can actually enjoy this looks like final fantasy to me all these salty people in comments about one review lol playing pokemon on an emulator and being able to fast forward through all the annoying ass random encounters has been life changing did you find any characters to have an intriguing story primrose did it for me but the rest i can definitely agree with you on the story felt under developed bland and generic for the most part turn based rpgs res is not a combination i would enjoy either aside from pokemon because even pokemon knew that its annoying as shit and created repels nippon software is the only company thats created turn based jrpgs to fit my liking like the disgaea franchise or phantom brave etc because of their unique approach to it and quick yet fulfilling battles at higher levels where octopath traveler had nothing but what id see as tedious repetitive grinding i was really hoping for more unfortunately 90 of comments knack hahahaha if you do this you need to jump off a bridge not upset it was enjoyable as usual but since you said octopath was unremarkable wouldnt it have been better to make a video on rpgs with a quick note of your disapproval of the game as an example to emphasize your point i love you dunkey but im 40 hours into the game and i can tell you that every one of your complaints except for the general concept of turn based combat and random encounters which just boils down to whether or not you like the genre were gone by the 5th hour once chapter 2 starts the stories get pretty damn dark and interesting even if they arent completely original and the combat is very deep and fun granted you like turn based combat thanks for the vid your excellency is octodad a playable character this game is such a rip off of bookworm adventures deluxe jesus your vids are so boring recently people are actually taking dunkey seriously you fools speaking out against dunkey will accomplish nothing you are all heretics i liked this game finally the switch receives its knack killer knack 1 that is not knack 2 cmon lets not be animals here compare this to the pro jared review i always expect something funny in the last 3 seconds of the video another good video your excellency lmao id love to see a dunsley vid about kotor and kotor 2 before i even watch lemme take a crack and say that dunkey hates it because it is a classic jrpg and hes gone on record saying he hates them hey at least the soundtrack is good this video is the equivalent of a hockey fan saying baseball sucks because its not as fast and violent song at the end still waiting for you to try warframe hahaha the writing is cliched boring and often embarrassing but after rolling my eyes and sighing through the story segments im still liking the game for its battle system the reason the snail was hard to kill was because dunkey was intentionally playing poorly as well as using a character thats bad against them youre supposed to figure out and exploit weaknesses instead of mashing a even though the writing as a whole is typical animelevel tripe ive enjoyed primroses and alfyns story so far you have an interesting take on the game dunkey but i for one thought the game was fine but the random encounters are something i can also agree with yassssss boi get it your excellency or psycho mantis edit olberic is legit one of the worst starts as well rpgs were never dunkeys thing so i expected this going in on the flip side im loving octopath and know many others who do the writing may be generic but its generic but good unlike some and the combat is a delightful spin on the classic style of find weakness spam weakness win method i really enjoy the break system and how each of the boss fights have been actually challenges instead of stompfests but like i said dunkey doesnt like rpgs really so to eachtheirown i always say i love your stuff dunkman but how are you not even going to mention the visuals the spritework and lighting used make this game look like nothing else but you completely disregarded it im not saying you should focus on it but you didnt even mention the graphics i mean after all thats what this is really all about i am totally fine with independent story the path action was the real letdown on my first four character i got 4 unique path action and path action was my favorite thing for the game but then i got the same genre of guide allure and here i thought it was just a coincidence then as i unlock my last four character i slowly picked up on the pattern and how this would turn out so you basically just get 4 kind of path action my favorite thing for the game literally turned into my least favorite thing in the game one word laziness but other than that the game is quite good and i dont find the character not interacting to be annoying but just find it disappointing for such a misopportunity yes just about every kind of personality has been covered in the game but it is through interaction do we find uniqueness in a game not saying the game is bad because i do love grinding and will spend quite some time in it just saying it was another lost potential i disagree with the review but at least hes consistent with what he said about his review style in his game reviews video good news it wont interrupt our nintendo directs again incoming heat from the fans lol so you played 8 hours of a game 10 of the game is that what you played this probably your worst video did armond white write this aw i was hoping this would be a somewhat positive review because although i normally get bored of jrpgs after day or two i could play octopath nonstop and enjoy a lot of its mechanics to each their own though this video got me through some painful moments on the toilet thats such a shame its from the bravely default team so i had high hopes yeah i dont think dunkey will be where i get rpg recommendations thank you for this video your excellency i actually enjoyed the game am 60 hours in with only the final boss left but i definitely agree with dunkey that the storytelling is really bad because the storys are bland and not connected and whoever wrote the story of alfyn needs to be fired i just hope that square enix improves upon the story telling in the next game and i am happy yeah i stopped listening to dunkey when he said octopath traveler sucks dunder making dem quality posts i like final fantasy 12s approach to combat there is no unnecessary transition to a combat screen because the battles take place in real time you still get all the combat options you would expect from a turnbased rpg and the best part is no random encounters can we just refer to everyone as your excellency now and replace all pronouns referring to someone else with your excellency can we just make every word in the dictionary become your excellency your excellency excellently executed excelling excellence the octo mom really stepped up her game with this new batch of kids bubsy your excellency omg thank you dunkey i knew this game was a pile of pretentious from when i played the first demo thank you for reaffirming my opinion i could list off a number of things that i hate about this game which only sums up to like 5 or 6 tbh dunkey you were super transparent about the genres you like the splatoon 2 video fine you play shooters so fair opinion on that but you made it super clear you have no patience when it comes to rpgs so why would you ever play and review a game that you know will hate hmmm i dont like this comment section the style and cool edition almost baited me into buying this game but it seems that the gameplay and story would get me bored and prevent me from completing this thanks for this whatever you want to believe i utterly love this game nintendo kept pushing this so much but it never really looked interesting and no one was hyped up and now it arrives and its just as expected i remember that on time when my dad beat me that was fun hey dunkster ive been following you way back since your octopath traveler video keep up the good work does octopath have dual audio i like this sort of shit but that vo is killing me play league of legends i thoughed its been sometime seens someone last wrote that to you so why not be me that one ok this game has a nice art style but thats it i seen a lot of dislikes i think people gotta remember dunkey is not a jrpg guy a lot of people do like jrps and what comes with the territory though myself included havent played the game since im yet to own a switch but im surprised about what you said on the lack of interaction between the characters the studio that made this game is the one that made bravely default and second two games where the heroes just keep on speaking to one another making the whole thing enjoyable i believe what you said so im just a little sad the bravely series had an option to tweak random encounters to your licking even enabling you to disable them outright if you just wanted to explore around is it also absent for octopath im not sure the brave and default mechanics are in it either man i stopped listening to this guy when he said bubsy 3d is a bad game this game really makes you feel like your excellency i really dont think octopath is a god game like people seem to be saying its alright its good guys its alright its not the most memorable one ive played but its alright to say its terrible though i have to disagree with your dunkcellency though anyone that knows your dunkcellency knows he aint about these turnbased jrpgs anyways the game would have to be mindblowingly good lol i have never disagreed so strongly with dunkey this felt like kind of a cheap shot to the game as a whole it compiled the few and far between lulls of octopath while completely glossing over all the charming details exciting moments of course boredly fighting low level enemies isnt fun butyou have the option to flee from those encounters too i know dunkey isnt a fan of jrpgs and most of the time neither am i that said ot is easily one of the most engaging games ive played this year i hope people give it a shot before letting this video turn them off completely bbut reggie can do no wrong your excellency while i have always just about agreed with the dunksly i have to say octopath traveler looks like a decent play off of first glance but i cant disagree and say that mountains of random encounters by lower leveled geeks sent by the game in the attempt of catching you on the off chance your weak and unprepared is very unappealing i have yet to play this and see how the vibes are recieved from my point of view but i have massive respect for dunk because he was able to make those who understand what is actually wrong with the game without completely offending those who favor turnbased combat anotha mastapiece of a vid dunk i give it a mario hat 26 pastrami slices pros beatiful graphics nice music various characters cons everything else book worm adventure delux is so underrated bookworm adventures deluxe doesnt have random encounters random encounters turnbased combat so this is pretty much darkest dungeon but for nintendo haha i thought the same thing with ophilias dialogue looked poopy for the start the characters are pretty original for jrpg actually they arent a bunch of spunky teenagers trying to thwart an ancient evil theyre adults with actual professions alfyn is an apothecary first and an axewielding hp tank second its like travelling with steve from accounting he prefers to keep the relationship with the party professional but he wields a mean lance and he agrees to balance the partys checkbooks as long as you help him level up to confront his boss at the cpa conference in golddust town haha she said that phrase a lot nice meme your excellency splatoon 2 octopath expansion i switched the voices to japanese and that makes it a lot less cringy i really enjoyed the game but i can understand other people not feeling the same either way man you da guy i love the game but i definitely agree with some points of dunkeys review there is one thing id like to point out and thats character interaction there is a decent amount of one on one dialogues search up travel banter and read about it but while it isnt executed super well it is there still no connection between stories though i think i disagree with you black men but i do love all the things you hate dunkey i see your opinion however this video is excellency i agree the creator of random encounters should be thrown into a pit of spice aight dunkey but knack 2 is better chapter 2 does introduce some party interaction but yea its not the best game is this knack oh come on you cant blame all this on reggy does bookworm adventures have random encounters a lot of the comments are saying that they enjoy the game and wish dunkey would remain more objective but i beg to differ i want to see the negative reviews even if i dont agree with them so i can see the flaws of a game i may potentially buy while dunkey does have a bias against jrpgs its still good to hear his opinion and if nothing else his humor if you want a fun turn based game play epic battle fantasy either play 4 or 5 when it comes out soon tbf i dont really care if youre not being objective about this game because i dont like jrpgs either im just here for the luls oof the comment section cmon its a good game trust me your excellency sad you dont like it but to each his own is the story writing really that bad cause ive watched some generic anime and i dont want to immerse myself in such generic messes while im on my switch maybe i should consider mario rabbids as my next game cant believe i typed that keep in mind dunkey isnt a huge jrpg fan to begin with i got an add for boss baby on netflix before the video so the standards are pretty high for this video dunkey is not the guy to go to for opinions on a classic style jrpg i still love him not bookworm adventures deluxe so no thanks psycho mantys yout excellency i love jrpgs i adored chrono trigger final fantasy and other classics but octopath still hasnt made a mark on me its playable but it isnt a standout game in my eyes im jealous of the people who are loving this game if youre not feeling the game at all i dont blame u i felt the same way after i played the demo and i also chose the knight but after i researched more of the game it interested me as far as the random encounter there are support skills that greatly decrease the encounter rate and as far as grinding if you just unlock each character and do each chapter you never really grind so much i dont really play much single player games but ive sank over 50 hours and it takes me back to my ff79 days well im going to say something different why does someone have to like the gamegenre to review it sometimes it helps looking at something from a different perspective especially if theres people like myself who arent really into jrpgs either i dont like turn based strategy games but i gave mario rabbids a chance and i loved it a review is not an concrete bible of the quality of a game at the end its just someones opinion and i think when youre trying to buy a game with your hard earned money that you sometimes cant get a refund for it helps to look at all the criticisms since not everyone is the same person so hes not a nintendo fanboy why is everyone so mad i thought the video was fine and funny wow dunkey hates the game that iove what do i do now every time i saw one of the ads for this game all i could think of was how outdated the concept was it seems like another boring tedious and longwinded jrpg but with this ridiculous gimmick of playing as eight different characters yeah i stopped listening to this guy after he said sonic 3d pinball was bad nice move nintendo keep it up proud of you your excellency youre that ninja octodunk splatoon 2 dlc videos from the dunkey baaabbbyyyyy knack 2 play me me yes your excellency i dont get it there are lots of games nowadays that put a whole new spin on the random encounter turn based rpg type of combat chrono trigger displayed enemies in the overworld undertale was about dodging attackd in bullet hell sequences south park and paper mario both had enemies in the overworld and had combat the player could directly influence with careful and correctly timed button presses why do some rpgs still go back to the generic menu based random encounter rpg system is it so hard in pokemon to show small sprites or models of wild pokemon that the player could aptly avoid but your dunkellency i i completely agree with you on every point you made this is the most overhyped nintendo switch game ever dunkey if you dont like random encounters and turn based combat why would you even buy let alone review this game thats like if i did the same with mario rabbids even though i completely dislike that games genre of combat personally i prefer fire emblem or advanced wars how dare you insult the nopon people have their tits twisted about this but the man speaks thr truth it takes like 25 hours before you get to interesting bits of story and even then its just bleh want a better experience for less than a tenth the price go play an old snesps1ps2 game with a similar battle system any of the saga games for example or a turn based tactics type i believe square did this better in livealive we never got a port for that in the west your excellencycan you pin this comment i think you should play a bit more of the game before you make a review like video or at least be more considerate of the genre you shit on the jrpg for being an jrpg and it doesnt even seem like you played it that much awesome review dunk ignore the annoying children who actually believe this game is some kind of miraculous gift to humanity the game is decent at best but seriously gets annoying with how bland the battle system is and how cringey and annoying the story can become at times buy it if you want but even in terms of jrpgs this game was mediocre bookworm adventures has the best story in gaming ever sees dunkey video me too kind your excellency bookworm adventures deluxe is far superior ooooh shit when sky sees this hes gonna flip rememeber people dunkey isnt really into jrpgs like some people including myself and thats perfectly fine i knew coming to this vid he was gonna joke with the game cause he isnt a big jrpg fan people gotta learn to not take things to heart and attack someone who has a different opinion than theirs i completely agree with you way to trigger thousands of nintendo fans dunkey jrpgs have nothing on bookworm adventures deluxe you should try it oh no a turnbased rpg donphy is out of his element you didnt give it a rating how will i know if this is a 45 with a few problems a brief look through comments leads me to believe some people have forgotten this but this genre of game really doesnt appeal to dunkey when he says he doesnt like the game mechanics but doesnt point out some way in which its failed compared to other games with similar mechanics you can kind of take that with a grain of salt if these sorts of games are something you enjoy even his boredom with the storystorytelling method can be questionable as everyone has different preferences in writing and this one just isnt for dunkey maybe youll find it riveting does this video have no value for someone who enjoys turn based jrpgs not at all for instance the lack of character interaction seems a bit iffy regardless of what kind of stories you like that will probably be disappointing you now also know that a certain character says your excellency excessively dunkey isnt a dickhead because he finds a game you like boring or a game you hate interesting hes a dick no its good game dunkey its good game turn based combat allows for more combat strategy more characters and diversity and interaction of abilities when it does this and keeps the pace up at the same time it is done well i would agree though that random encounters suck balls and always have ct did all of this quite well ff6s combat was quick though did have random encounters fft had a compelling combat system but was never quick so i totally understand your hatred of it however at the same time i think it could be done much better than it has been you can do some things with turn based combat that you just cant in live combat you horse you dont even know how painful it is when you have no choice but to listen to german translation like 90 of whats translated ruins the entire experience it might even have a completely different name altogether bec i dont faging know what theyre thinking dont deny it dunky sky will come out victorious when smash drops just you wait i know that dunkey doesnt like jrpgs but i still clicked i played an hour and a half of octopath demo and it was okay but after coming off it i never picked it up again nothing really special or anything that grabbed me i think fallout 3 or nv would be a great port to the switch i respect your opinion as your own and still think youre funny but this video is just plain bad so many things are wrong about it that it isnt funny its honestly more akin to something id expect from kotaku and not you but oh well they cant all be winners you all know right that donkey hates rpg or games that take time to be fun and that are turned based where the hell is knack 2 but is it better than knack 2 octopath traveler more like octofanastyboundmontale hey dunkey but pokemon is awesome at 400 speed thank u donk i wouldve bought this game but i got a real pros opinion thank u eternally u may have my first born as payment wow dunkey uploads now man i really like octopath but i agree with dunkeys complaints except for the story to a degree its nothing crazy but it works imo take a shot everyrime you here your excellenty my excellency there is still a late request for worm of books travels you know god you idoiots stop taking a reviews of a genere on record said he despises more than anything and taking it as fact seriously watch other review of people who actually like these kinds of games says he hates turn based combat and jrpgs makes fun of journalists for not liking the type of games they review reviews a jrpg with turn based combat doesnt like it who wouldve thought before you unsubscribe remember that dunkey dont like classic jrpgoctopath is a classic jrpg t the core and that is why i and many others love it psget ready for when he plays dq11 this reminds me of the time your excellency beat sky in smash bookworm adventures is so much better than this whoever created random encounters should be kicked into a fing pit of spice and shot with a bazooka may just be the best thing i have ever heard at least since three beans please the only turn based combat system i enjoy is pokemon and random encounters are just random encounters so you cant really judge the game based on that the story on the other hand was pretty disappointing i only played the demo but based on the first chapters of the thief and the apothecary dont remember their names i knew the game would be boring the only reason id play a jrpg is for the the story and characters the voice of a generation you arent going to enjoy a turn based rpg if you dont like turn based rpgs this game really makes you feel like your excellency this game really makes you feel your excellency good ol persona the pokemon before pokemon thats actually just known as pokemon anyway shit opinion dunk into the garbage i mean that snail fight just shows it all you clearly havent even tried learning the combat so i think its safe to say you barely played to even know anything about the overall story well i guess we can add your excellency to the growing list of brain dead dunkey memes was this supposed to be a dunkview video sounded like one adam sessler would be proud you i love you reviews but you and me are different on rpg i like that other character story are simple i live random encounters because its its kind of like reality like you have no idea whats going to pop up at you but when youre trying to go get somewhere to do something and youre going to get there oh and i love your work by the way i actually like the game a lot and the combat is a lot more fun and interesting than i think the video shows theres also some more character customization with jobs that comes after all the first chapters however its still a slowpaced jrpg so if thats not your thing i dont think this game would change your opinion feels like an homage to oldschool final fantasy and i can agree the writing is pretty disappointing its kind of just 8 separate mediocre stories in one game sucks cause i loved the style of the game visual style dunkey post a video your excellency the funniest part is always when he says reggie hmm one of the first times i really disagree with dunkey he picks out the worst stories to poke fun at the english voice acting which you can change to japanese and game mechanics that shouldnt have been a surprise to him going in to the game meh why is it any video criticizing something with good points can be accepted and understood but all the sudden if the game has anime characters people go crazy and think its a perfect game that cant be criticized kingdom hearts jrpgs gee i played the demo and i thought looks kinda fun might give it a try then i saw the pricing 55 euros already bought i am setsuna for i think 50 euro and was heavily disappointed maybe my standards are too high and im expecting the second terranigma from square enix you know whats the best character of any video game ever the protagonist of bookworm adventures dunkey should play it possibly god the random encounterturn based rant is so deserved the fact that some games give you an autoplay sometimes should be a red flag dunkey really long time subscriber do you feel like xenoblade was a miss not really a game worth playing really interested on your honest opinion i love it when games have repeated irritating dialogue because theres always the chance dundo will play that game and your excellency it till the cows come home is dunkey just a game critic now sorry to hear you didnt enjoy the game dunkey but i can certainly appreciate the whys youve presented looking forward to the next video the developers says that they create a game that only japanese people would like what was the game in that clip at the start with the dude wandering through the desert so between having to play through them and making funny videos about them do you actually enjoy playing bad games thisw is the first bad review ive seen for this game and even sstill i wanna play the heck out of it your excellency wait we want more dunk your excellency this video needed more dunk your excellency ill give this a miss too many white guys in it people still play jrpgs why your excellency in all seriousness i actually enjoyed xc2 despite its anime writing and this game still looks interesting enough for me to pick up as well after all until fe16 comes out thiss the only main rpg in the switchs library besides xc2 until pokmon lets go comes out in november butthats basically pokmon for babies too bad its impossible to get atm due to squenix and nintendo underestimating how much itd sell do we all agree bookworm adventures deluxe is better maybe he should play that instead im glad you gave your honest opinion i really like the game and ik alot of people do too i think its probably one of the only turn based rpgs i like other than pokemon but im glad it didnt change the way you see the game keep being you im sorry dunkster i have to disagree with you because i think story telling is a huge part of this game and the entire point that square is trying to accomplish replay ability is the key goal is for this started out with the knight maybe try primrose the dancer who was domestically abused by here master on top of it all is a wonderful combat system that pays homage to games like final fantasy 5 and 6 and correct me if im wrong but i dont think that you ever brought up the visuals holy shit the visual hd2d is something i want many more games in the future to adopt anyway thats my thoughts on octopath totally up for discussion for anyone who wants to comment pokemon meets inception knack 3 understandable have a nice day this is all reggies fault finally a new dunkey meme your excellency a sea of monotonous grinding i have played this game for 60 hours now and not once did i have to grind its fine to dislike a game its fine to make shit up cant you avoid battles in this game with the scholars passive as well as escape from them if youre strong enough i love jrpgs and everything said about octopath is totally true and i agree with it what a boring game story wise why are you playing and reviewing jrpgs if you hate them this isnt a very good review honestly dunkey clearly didnt play too far in because there are character interactions once you get a little farther in the game and random encounters become much faster once you have multiple characters and why bash the voice acting when you have the option to turn remove it entirely if you dont like it no mention whatsoever of the strategic gameplay or the amazing music and visuals i dont understand why dunkey would even review this game knowing his general opinion on jrps being negative no jokes either just bashing lame vid dunkey the art looks cool though all i got from this review is that dunkey doesnt like jrpgs your excellency when are we getting bookworm adventures 2 dunkey plz review divinity original sin 2best turn based combat ever you know what other game sucks bookworm adventure you should play that instead i have a problem with this review why do you cover games of genres you dont like by default with mechanics you dont like by default this game really makes you feel like your excellency ok but replace your excellency with daddy just think about that for a moment the games fucking beautiful too definitely some people who could enjoy it but not me too bad i mean this video is good and all but come on you gotta play book worm adventure man this is the first video i disliked from you the game is really good if you like the genre i got a league of legends ad this video knew you were gunna hate this game from your previous opinion on turn based games yes we know the voice acting is horrible just turn it off lots of valid critism but most of your reviews are at least funny man the style of the game looked amazing i guess it wasnt good gameplay wise like dunkey said you watch a reviewer because you want know how a game will fit into their standards this review just so happens to be from the perspective of a reviewer who tends to dislike jrpgs so thats the perspective you should take it from dunkeys videos shouldnt be the reason you buy or dont buy a particular game hear other perspectives then make your own decision to be fair dunkey did say in his critics video that he absolutely hates these types of games so i feel like theres a bit of bias to the argument id give this game a chance just based on the art and design but the characters do look pretty boring lol i actually really enjoyed this game when is reggie gonna make a game about reggie dont even care what genre it is action reggie sports reggie dating simulator reggie dont care just need a reggie based game in my reggieless world octopatch is a good franchise sorry dunkey but this review is obviously biased towards your hate of turn based combat the criticism about the story part is valid but the rest is just cherry picking of the highest order if you dont like a genre why bother doing a review can you take a look at pit people wild arms 2 on the ps1 did it better full disclosure i played that game for about an hour and a half when i was in elementary school i dont remember much about it other than a vague sense of having enjoyed myself and it had like three different characters each with their own intro story why are there a thousand dislikes metal gear survive pay attention to your stamina this your excellency damn i thought the people who made bravely default would be good at making rpgs everyone loves to jerk themselves over this game but dunkey breaks it down to its core shit writing and 8 shit stories with no reason to play them other than youre bored and have 60 dollars that you didnt want to spend on food or an actual good game thanks dunk shouldve replayed knack 2 please stop with this pixel art bullshit and make a game i havent seen a million times on other consoles before ten years ago aaaaarrrrggggggggggg i think people are just jerking this game off to be apart of the hivemind its absolutely bland and brings nothing new to the jrpg genre there are 10 other games which do what this thing tries to do but better there is absolutely no reason for this game to exist the bloom filters and contrast are absolutely eye bleeding 80 of the party members are horrid the story is the most generic pos of all time but if youre a fan of classic jrpgs youre supposed to like this because the group tells you to everyone loves this epic nintendo switch game so you have to aswell or else you arent a real jrpg fan sorry ill go back to playing actually good jrpgs like shadow hearts and secret of mana oh my 1k downvotes already anyway my only major complaint when it comes to jrpgs is never knowing how much hp an enemy has like why paper mario 64 and ttyd did this right by adding a way to always see enemy hp now i know this is the best jrpg of all time thank you dunkstein gonna be honest while i appreciate dunkeys views i feel like he didnt make it to the second chapter in this especially since thats when the characters begin interacting with each other and talking through problems it isnt much tho so maybe he just dodnt think it counted i also wish those bits couldve happened more as they were some of the best in the games writing this is one of the worst videos you have ever made not because i disagree with it but because it contradicts an entire video you made earlier outright and doesnt even have any underlying irony to it you just burn into this game a game in a genre you clearly dislike there are parts of this game that people enjoy because they like the jrpg genre when you clearly do not to the poinnt that you barely put enough time into this game to discover all the mechanics and barely making it past the beginning you only enjoy jrpgs when they arent a jrpg or conform to the norms that other people who enjoy jrpgs like you are doing the thing that you hated game review sites for by reviewing a game in a genre you are unexperienced in why would you just buy a game that has all hte markings of things you specifically dislike that others like still waiting for a phenomenal rpg on the switch after breath of the wild and skyrim still waiting when theres random encounter there will always be a avoid encounter consumable in the shop if no this must be a mistake the family depends on this hot selling item not worth buying english dubs are the worst lmao psycho mantis youre that excellency owhhhhh i see you had a bad start and grinded to level 21 on snails lol the enemies auto adjust to your level and number of party members to a degree to give you a constant level of challenge anyway yes the game has some weakness in story telling but it is enough modivation for me to explore the world and get deep into the battle mechanics if you like turnbased jrpgs buy this game if you dont like them or if youre on the fence this game wont do it for you is this a sequel for kratos of war 2 your dunkeyellency meh looks too similar to book worm adventures such a fanboy he wouldnt rate it at the end lul breaking and sad news everyone immediately right after this video was uploaded dunkey died from the most dangerous disease known to man ligma he passed away while holding knack 2 in his hands in his bed im sorry your excellency just beat a useless lvl1 snail oh the thrill of the fight the length of combat for rpgs of this genre has always deterred me from picking them up although i love rpg elements in other games your excellency um your excellency was that a review octoling expansion traveler ive put about 35 hours into octopath so far and ive loved every second of it im new to turn based games and i really like the combat system in octopath its a really nice break from the standard generic garbage that dunkey tends to give positive reviews i think hes kind of antinintendo these days anywho i recommend trying it dont base your gaming experience off what a cheeseloving winsconsinite thinks this might be the first time im thinking why the fuck does this game have voice acting triggered people in the comments hhehehe zuthar and dunkey uploading on the same day this is gods sign but the graphics try bravely default i wonder what dunkeys opinion on chrono triggercross encounter system is i always thought it was a great balance since you could see the enemies usually and go around them earthbound also had the system of automatically winning low level encounters i disagree with dunkeys opinion but hes made it clear in the past he doesnt like most jrpgs and their typical combat system although hes not wrong on pointing out their faults i like the artstyle thought that 3d pixell was amazing this games writing is atrocious and its honestly depressing to see how low the bar for dialogue is when it comes to gaming the fact that people are actually ok with the writing in this game is really sad my meme is dead im quitting with the bookworm in a nutshell good game your excellency new game every time you hear your take a shot in all seriousness xenoblade 2 while having some cringy anime stuff had a great world story one of the best soundtracks and fun gameplay 2d skyrim is that you story is shut but i like the combat system that keeps you on your toes dumkey you have been dead of chokama please come back who made this it cant be limbkey imposter we all know dukey likes turnbase rpgs in his video on video game critics disliked and reported the only positive thing i can say about the game is that it looks pretty cool the art style is amazing with the tilt shifted world and pixel graphics but other than that its your basic turn based jrpg its definitely one of those games that was made for a very specific audience and anyone outside of that audience is most likely going to hate it i mean in that snail battle you couldve used a dagger to break it or look for its other 2 weaknesses granted its the beginning of the game which is where jrpgs are at their most limited and thats not an excusable thing but still you werent fighting that battle very efficiently i agree though i havent played a lot of the game yet but it is very generic and relies heavily on its aesthetic it doesnt help that the localization team changed the japanese dialogue so that it sounded all medieval which is just generic in this day and age edit wait i take it back you were level 2122 in that snail battle you shouldve known way way better by that point what you shouldve done you either werent paying attention to the mechanics or you were intentionally drawing the battle out to prove a point both of which dont do much for your argument disappointed that you didnt even mention the pretty elaborate combat system which takes a lot of thinking and strategy probably the most important part of the game imo it makes up for the boring cutscenes which you can skip anyway bubsy 3d meets fortnite but dunkey why didnt u just use your dunkey thrusters to skip the boring parts of the game jrpg stories were only praised back then because it was the only games that actually had stories to tell now that western games does it this unique trait is gone when we now have wrpgs like witcher 3 and fallout new vegas that have well written stories and interesting characters without having annoying random encounters cheesy voice acting unengaging combat and other pitfalls of jrpgs that in hindsight makes the past games not age well this is probably why i think wrpgs are better today quick reminder this isnt a reviewdunkview and he doesnt have to be objective i love youre videos but you actually got something wrong the characters do infact interact with each other throughout the storyline and they do it about three times one part of a story line i just started playing this game 2 days ago and while its enjoyable i have some of the same complaints when i was running through the lower level zones to get the new characters i began to dread the random encounters because like he explained unless i blasted them all with my high sp aoe attacks the encounters would still take a while and reward you with little exp it seems like a fun game to pick up now and then but its not a stellar rpg for me also i loved xc2 no sarcasm spent 180 hours on it beating it 100 and would give it 1010 the soundtrack is really fucking good though its garbage because it isnt bookworm adventures dunkey doesnt like a turn based rpg stop the presses dunkey why the do you play jrpgs when you know you have the attention span of a child and the expectancy that you arent going to like any jrpg its a waste of your time and ours dunkey thank god you dont have ligma the gramphics tho you required my assistance your excellency i thought octopath travelwr was that octopus game i really like the immersive design presented though sprites but the background and foreground have such depth to it from the small amount of footage i saw here that would be the main reason i would ever consider this game to just admire the look of it what is this weird ragnarok online rip off lmao the only reason this video has more dislikes than normal is because it is not bookworm adventures deluxe dunkey you did it again right when i start liking a game you bring up whats important about its genre an rpg that falls flat in story elements is misplaced as a video game if anything octopath traveler seems more like an incomplete approach to a dd campaign the game has potential but didnt deliver in what was supposed to be its unique feature octopath traveler is disappointingly disjointed to beck too mario 2 m8 what i always appreciated in the mario rpg games is if youre a high enough level and attack a weaker enemy on the field theyll die when you enter the battle its not lighting fast but it does help make those games less tedious i disagree with him on most points but i admit that i was disappointed that the characters do not interact with each other but i didnt think it was too disappointing so far ive really enjoyed cyruss and haanits stories the most i agree that ophelias story is definitely weak especially since she doesnt act like she has been raised as a nun at all personally i think critics would go a lot easier on this game if it wasnt full price and even i dont think it should be more than 40 i personally think that this game is pretty damn neat i mean yeah the story is a random mixed clusterfuck but inside that there is a game with the potential to become a very interesting rpg with unacceptably good graphics just my honest opinion wow for the first time i disagree with dunkey why must you hate everything i like good sir but real talk i think you have a habit of dwelling on a games flaws a little more than you should i am not really saying you are wrong because if you dont like turn based combat random encounters and grinding even though i am 40 hours in and i have barley had to grind then no shit you are not going to like a game like this it is a good game though for anyone who likes turn based rpgs and if you can get pasted the less than spectacular way the story is told then there is a good one to be found here 8 good ones in fact one of the rare times i disagree with ya dunkey ths is one of my top 3 favorite games of all time why are you reviewing jrpgs if you dont enjoy jrpg mechanics yeah the lack of character interaction or acknowledging that theres 8 other people with you is jarring as fuck but if you like jrpgs in general youll probably find the characters likable and the combat system engaging you clearly dont understand the appeal of these kind of random encounterturn based rpgs you never did please stop talking about them and stop pretending that its the fault of their design that you dont like them so dunkey doesnt understand or enjoy the concept of an anthology story and the combat is bad because it isnt brainless enough cool ur my excellency not you i mean the other guy the dude in the back no the dude with the orange eyebrows just forget it the demo turned me off completely from the full game why pretty much every reason dunkey pointed out i agree with everything dunk says worst parts probably are the random encounters and the unconnected story between the characters however if you are like me and sort of like the graphics and turn based battles you probably like the game my favourite part of the game are the boss battles they are long and theres a ton of them for each character you see a grunt boom dead you see a goomba boom dead you see a lvl 1 snail im sorry thundersnail shin megami tensei was before pokemon this octodad sequel really went off the rails cant help but feel bad for this game for being so bland and generic i mean it looks really beautiful the first chapters are repetitive for sure but did you play the rest of the game before this review so much potential in a game just completely fucked by reggie your excellency mustve played bookworm adventures deluxe to be raised to such a position can i get some thoughts in this thread of mine i really enjoyed the game and couldnt wait for it to come out i thought the dialogue was amazing and the voice acting was better in english for once primrose is eh imo and im a hardcore subfag i get that the game has its generic jrpg elements but i thought it was still fun even if unoriginal the ost was already good and overall i was actually hyped for the game to be great that being said though it seems as if it wasnt completely as great so theres not much character interaction as there should be i noticed that in the demo but if thats really the extent of the game then that actually sucks hard please give me your insights even if copypasted thanks so out of a game with 8 different stories you chose worst onesyeah thats not dumb hell i havent even played the game yet is this bookworm adventures your excellency lmao didnt ign give this like a 9510 yeah character interactions really is a big turn off for me but i enjoy the game noneless the games music at least from the few hours ive played so far slaps though so thats something you had some great points in your game critics video try to uphold your own standards alright i thought it was going to be a good game hey dunkey i know custom robo is an rpg but have you ever played it or like it its got a lot of variety and different ways to play we need dunky to review hollow knight please you can probably one shot some monsters in bookworm adventures deluxe with a word as long as excellency fire emblem octopus edition this game really makes you feel like your excellency i dunno man xenoblade 2 cutscene 159 is one my favorite story moments in a video game ever although i disagree with dunkey about random encounters overall he is right in how tedious it can get to kill grunts especially when the transition from the combat screen to the overworld and back eats up so much of the actual grunt encounter time itself i think that this video is kind of unfair some points are validstory structure and characters having blend premise but some arent the battle example is bad because you forcefully ignore a way to end the battle quickerboostbreakshaving more then one character and ignoring other parts of the gamesoundartpath actionsbattle systemend game i would also like to know if you finished the game many statements focus on early game what about bookworm adventure deluxe huh soup when are you making a video about the new bot lane meta obligatory i have to shit on a nintendo game so people stop saying i suck off nintendo video basically the perfect game for people that like grinding in rpgs ok ok we got it we wont ask you to speak about a jrpg ever again i mean its like your opinion man you have the right to be wrong here before justin y the characters are so mediocre unlike the characters from bookworm adventures dunkey what do you have to say about the rumors that you are sugondese most honest review out there not gonna lie i dig the art style they went with tho excellency doesnt sound like a word anymore i agree with a lot of ur points but the characters do interact with each other from chapter 2 onwards i kinda have to disagree with you on turn based combat and random encounters i honestly think that i well executed these traits can really make a game more indepth of course you have your standard mario type enemies i like those too but with turnbased combat youre able to strategize your next move take pokmon a fragment of that game can be seen in your video as well i think that this game really nails this concept taking both of the things you made an argument about and making it not horrible if you dont want to encounter any pokmon you repel then there is the hard pokmon battles these are the ones i prefer over the bosses in things like mario or games like that in mario the most you can do to prepare for the boss fight is slap on a powerup or get some extra life hearts in games like pokmon you are able to prepare by building a team and choosing the moves they have you dont have to grind to fo this the game is made with gradually leveling up your pokmon in look at the dislikes that happens when you joke about your excellency i really hope donkey was joking about this review im actually in the middle of making my own review about this game i would like to speak with him oneonone if he doesnt mind i would like to use his review as references as well not this time dunk im sorry i fucking hate loved bravely default 400 hour game that was only really good at the first 10 hours and the last 10 finally a reviewcritique of this game that isnt just describing the 8 character gimmick and actually addresses what the game is one less customer one more munkey fan this game is excellency ill admit that square enix slacked off on the stories in this but i knew right when i saw this video you would hate it its like dunkey kryptonite you cant kill the gamers the gamers will live on christians tried to kill the gamers but they failed as they were smote to the ground politicians tried to destroy the gamers but they failed as they were stricken down to the ground feminists tried to kill the gamers hahahahaha they failed as they were thrown to the ground no one can destroy the gamers the gamers will strike you down with a vicious blow we are the vanquished foes of the gamers we tried to win for why we do not know journos tried to destroy the gamers but the gamers had their way feminists tried to dethrone the gamers but gamers were in their way christians tried to destroy the gamers but the gamers were much too strong court rooms tried to defile the gamers but the courts were proven wrong gamers played the demo felt like i was looking through a toilet paper roll due to most of the screen being darkened and blurred did you even play past the first chapters the characters interact with each other on every characters chapters 2 cant buy this game at retail simulator do you know who also hates random encounters poland just wanted to remind everyone that this video isnt a dunkview and isnt meant to be a review at all its just dunky saying he doesnt like jrpgs for 4 minutes psycho mantis your excellency this game is not very excellency lol u posted this 2 hours after i bought the game hu donkey i jist wana say yorer my favorites fortnite steamer plz wall u inv me me to fortnite so i can show u the victery royals dunkey i get it you dont like this type of games but that doesnt mean its a bad game i still love your videos but ill be like i was never saw this one wow dunkey is just literally wrong here random encounters arent really an issue for me some games do them in a way that isnt frustrating do you know who also hates turn based combat hitler you should try the first xenoblade it has less cringe and much better voice acting and contains less anime trash honestly had to take a break during that dialogue because it was just too much its worth noting theres a demo available for this game i like jrpgs and turn based combat and i was already tired of it by the end of the demo playing through each characters opening chapter before getting to any real story means a lot of filler and the combat is okay but the opening areas seem to be start here then fight random encounters until you reach the boss i got tired of it quickly so definitely play the demo its going to be enough to tell if the game is for you and if you buy the game your demo save carries over so you dont have to start over this looks so much like final fantasy tactics advance holy shit meh guess it aint for everyone 8 characters and not one of them is waluigi 05 you have a good opinion dunkey as bad as the game is you can always look back and say you can have eight characters well i was on the edge of should i buy this game or not low and behold this video appears thank you your excellency bubsy 3d is my favorite jrpg you dont even like jrpgs why review something that is clearly not aimed at you in the first place if i hear your excellency one more time i swear if dunkey doesnt like it then the game must be good i must respectfully disagree with you for the first time ever your excellency 10 hours in the combat system is actually pretty good it forces you to think strategically how to use every thing at your disposal im not a big fan of turnbased but its also not the worst thing in the world but god i hate randomly showed up enemies the writing and voice acting are actually not bad i know at times it can be a little pretentious but its really not that bad in my opinion my biggest complaint though is that you have to reach a certain level to traverse certain area it limits players creativity and desire to take challenges to the point that i feel like that im not playing the game instead im actually following instructions and doing all the grindings its like working and im not even getting paid was thinking about getting this game the other day is it good ya know i entirly disagree with most of what you say here but i understand that jrpgs certainly dont appeal to everyone good on you for sharing your opinion even if most outlets have praised that game littrrally was on the switch store from the switch we got yesterday saw this in the store for the first time in my life 6 minutes ago and right after that you made a video on it are are you the switch dunkey are you watching over me to avoid making bad purchases goddamit raggie stop lollygagging on the battle bus man this game looks awesome i like the game but everything dunkey says is accurate and its consistent with his previous views as well cant really ask for more dunkeys not particularly a jrpg guy so if youre also not a jrpg guy this game wont be much of an exception for you stop playing jrpgs if you hate them yep exactly as i expected youd think about this i felt your specific hatred the whole time i played like you were over my shoulder half assed half hearted review thing usually love your stuff if you dont like it then its not for you its a nostalgia game for people who miss this genre this game really makes you feel like batman im about 20 hours into this game and it still feels like a grind the stories get a little better as chapters move on in most cases and there actually is dialogue shared between party members you hit the start button to view party banter after chapter events occur or in the taverns sometimes although its very brief and doesnt lend to the story much im enjoying the game enough to finish it but certainly understand where youre coming from dunkey damn gloves off for this dunkeyview theres a whole lot of sensitive weebs in this comment section the gameplay is definitely multiple levels worse when one does battle without using any of the options they got and just easymodegrind through the game you dont have to grind at all and can use pretty strong options in battle defending reduces damage shortens wait time and gives you a boost point its basically overpowered healing and buffing of characters holds up to 9 turns the characters have character specific buffs that are also pretty overpowered the special abilities of each character are just on a dumblevel of overpowered stealing trading luring fighting people that block the way to items get percs in villages get powerful monsterspeople that help you fight ophilia has the ability to run away 200 more likely from monsters you can run away from monsters that are the same level or lower as you easily in general all the side stories will have lower level than your mc making them autofleeable bosses in this game do not req your knackcellency ypur excelency mr bookwerm adventurrrre how could you say something so controversial yet so brave even though it looks like he didnt even play this game for more than 2 hours when will you refrain from these lackluster reviews and actually be funny again i was going to unsubscribe if dunkey was actually planning to support this game and say its good thank god were on the same page here that was unexpected whats bad about xenoblade 2s story you said you like interesting concepts which it has then you praise kingdom hearys for letting you play as wreck it ralph ok i really like this game but i agree with octodunk on some points this comment section is a mess im not surprised tho this isnt book worm 3 deluxe get this shit out of here what are you doing dunk boy you are throwing away your career we need book worm deluxe 3 special edition review right now this is why i cant get into jrpgs even when story happens to be good there is this damn grind and slow turned based combat so its the demo times 8 they actually do interact with each other yeah i stopped listening to dunkey after he said bubsy 3d was bad whoever made random encounters should be kicked into spikes gary gygax is a lich that wont work the outcome of this review can be expected given dunkeys track record with similar titles in the jrpg genre and his already stated biases but of course this video cant be counted out just because of that octopath has some real problems with it especially to do with the interactions between characters i will say however that many of the problems dunkey has with octopath has more to do with problems with the genre turnbased combat slower fights and random encounters are almost a staple of the jrpg genre meaning that to dunkey their predictable inclusion was deathknell in his opinion of it i agree with the basic points of his review however this game appears to be a diehard jrpg fans jrpg i havnt and probobly wont play this game but given the praise its been getting as the indie masterpiece to rival undertale or taht one game with the bitch and the strawberries i thought for sure dunkey would have sucked octopaths eight dicks just like the other indie masterpieces fucking thank you yea this gam anus the whole point of the game was to forget the whole worldsaving adventure trope and tell eight stories that intersect not because they have a common goal but because they need help in their quests you might not like it but you cant really complain about the games high concept doing what it was meant to dunkey likes kingdom hearts makes me so glad hes a fan of classic looney toon characters reminds me of your splatoon 2 video file under he dont get it the way sky was talking about this game on his twitter made me think it was the second coming of jesus probably because of something gay only dunkey could make 180 my opinion on a game i personally really like it its a staple in the genre its a great if overall bythenumbers jrpg thoroughly enjoyed the 58 hours i spent with it though i do wish it made an effort to include the other characters in each others stories thats my take your excellency play divinity original sin 2 its the only turn based rpg that is actually enjoyable i see alot of people upset about what you said about their 60 this is why i dont like microsoft i am enjoying octopath but i have to say that your excellency repetitiveness was pretty freaking annoying haha random encounters and turn based combat allow the enemies to have more intricate and complex behavioral patterns programmed into them if they dont have to code them to walk around approach you etc etc etc then they can do things that streets of rage bad guys are not capable of instead they are on a different screen altogether have you ever seen a goomba heal another team member its also supposed to simulate fast combat slowed down so you can think about choices that would normally occur too quickly for you to otherwise make that action it also allows combat to take on a more strategic longterm approach this is why you cant stand grunt encounters if it takes you 4 hits to kill a grunt then your character is still a grunt and they arent easy youre still at the beginning and if you dont like slow paced character building and longterm strategy then dont play jrpgs you cant use that as a con against the game thats like knocking peanuts becau i havent watched the video yet but as soon as i saw it was octopath i knew it was ghoing to hur because i like the game 8 separate stories they dont intertwine like other jrpgs or have some common end goal of course they wont converse common sense if youre lvl 22 fighting something alone then youre doing the story solo and it will be like that you probably had the weakest things equipped then griped about it so all in all the only slight valid point you may have is the story but then again the game was created in a different way from other rpgs the rest is things that simply dont exist if you dont play the game like an idiotlie about how it works whoa you dont see dunkey rip games apart this bad very often 00 boy i dont really agree but this doesnt seem like your type of game who let dunked review this its his archnemesis jrpgs bill and teds e x c e l l e n c y adventure friendly reminder its okay to disagree with dunkey he can review games and genres he doesnt like and we can disagree because we like those things that is okay do detroit become human i gotta say i didnt enjoy this splatoon dlc i mean they removed all the mechanics from the base game shooting is replaced with turn based combat and the art style is completely different what the hell reggy when a game literally just uses its gimmick as its title a deep story probably isnt in the cards you are the best youtuber sorry man usually i enjoy your stuff but maybe octopath just isnt your style of game you make a few decent points but honestly im really enjoying this game this coming from someone who was dead set on not getting it until a price drop because of its nature i just really like the way the character are all equally balanced and the openness the battle system i find to be really fun i really enjoy turn based combat it upset me when the ff franchise started moving away from it ive been playing this game constantly lately to each their own i suppose fifa 19 is the only game im looking forward to as soon as i did ophelias solo intro i knew there would be your excellency memes abound i really love rpgs and honestly i still have no gripes with turn based combat at all its my preferred rpg battle system im about 12 hours in and this game is great for what it is but i do really hope that there is a sequel or dlc patch or something that adds more life to the game with sidequests and more to do also why cant i talk to all the npcs in the towns that was how it was in the demo and pretty much every rpg ever even if it was throw away lines it would breathe more life into the areas for sure 45 guy who hates jrpgs reviews a jrpg remember that video on journalistic integrity dunkey wellit looks good i guess still a better love story than pokemon meh meh meh your excellency fun video 1010 i enjoyed ff7 and random battlesencounters im also currently playing pokemon yellow to collect gen 1 exclusives so i can transfer them to gold version gotta catch em all each to their own dunkly youll never get me off turnbased games never heard about octopath not a fan of the voice acting i really like the game even tho it is repetative hey dunkalunk play mount blade its like an rpg but you can knock peoples heads off and take over the country its great 49 minutes since upload has alot of views what where beef stew at i stopped listening to dunkey after he said your excellency was bad they need to bring this to the ps4 i dont wanna get a switch for 5 games aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand thats why i waited for dunkey to review this game before i decided to buy ityour excellency i was expecting 55 at the end thank you dunkey your exellency the comment section salty as the ocean i think youre being too critical and a bit bias bubsy 3d is a ripoff of this game play cave story your excellency the graphics and art style of the game looks amazing though you have some valid criticisms and i know you hyperbolize stuff for comedic value but i think its still worth mentioning that a lot of this stuff isnt nearly as bad as its made out to be in the video i actually dont have much problem with the random encounters since the battles are really fastpaced for a turnbased combat system and of course itll go even faster if you have the right weaponsspells to play off of the enemy weaknesses i also agree that the way the characters are introduced is pretty jarring but its certainly not enough to take away from enjoying the game final fantasy crystal chronicles for gamecube im persistent thanks dunkey will definetly not get the game and i am recommending everyone i know not to get it either really nintendo really sir this is sega personally i disagree with dunkeys mantra that gameplay makes or breaks a game i think that when designing a game its easiest to maximize a few elements of game design to deliver a good product albeit with some flaws thats why games with good stories and characters have weak gameplay because the developers are not aiming to keep you invested in the game through the game mechanics but with the excellent story and characters the only way youre going to maximize all aspects of a game is with an aaa title like breath of the wild skyrim or witcher 3 i think that its subjective for the player on what they like in a game but i wouldnt think a game is bad if it had bad gameplay if it shines in other aspects then ill forgive the poor gameplay i agree with dunkey that random encounters are shit but i enjoy jrpgs if they deliver on what i expect from them good stories and characters i dont hold all games to the same standards it largely depends on the genre but i dont know why i thought the comments might be something other than a wall of your excellency memes the guy that has never liked rpgs doesnt like an rpg gasp im just glad i didnt buy hte game ty dunkey i know too many people who unironically prefer jrpgs to other genres because of the slow pace the turn based combat the long monotonous stories to those people i say just read a book or watch a movie video games are supposed to be fun and exciting its still one of my favorite games of the year its very comfy and cozy and even once they join your party they dont actually interact with each other their stories just play out in complete solitude with your team just happening to be there in the later chapters when you have other party members you can press the button at certain segments of a characters story for other party members to interact your excellency your excellency died from ligma why play a game you know youre not going to like the devs have been very upfront about what this game would be they relased two demos for it of course dunkeys not gonna like it so why make a video on it ahhh some honesty about this game you never disappoint dunkey i already had no interest in this despite it blowing up with people on social media and yt now im really not in the mood to play it lol gotta disagree with dunko on this one this is one of the best jrpgs ive played in a while can someone tell me what the very first game was you can see in this video im about 8 hours in and am a fan i think the battle mechanics awesome art style and great soundtrack make up for a lackluster story they did a good job of overcoming the jrpg trope of press a until you win the fight adding the enemy weaknesses and the break system give incentive for paying close attention to which orders youre giving your characters at least when your party gets bigger and you all the different skills at your disposal also the boss fights have been pretty whiteknuckle so far i think ive only been wiped once but ive come close on pretty much every boss well see if it holds up for the 100 hour playthrough ive been hearing about and if the overall story ends up paying off in the end but at least so far im a fan honestly not as good as my all time favorite game robots vs zombie birds i cant believe dunkey has refused to play such a timeless classic love ya dunky but xenoblade 2 is awesome it has a fantastic story and zeke is life come on nintendo put knack 2 on the switch wait i thought octopath traveler was the splatoon 2 dlc shout out to munky for making such nice little videos so quickly for us good horse this isnt bookworm adventures you should play that 1 use the japanese voices that way the dialogue isnt nearly as boring 2 choose cyrus 3 play it in handheld while on a commute or traveling i find its much more fun that way hey guys ear here sounds like somebody didnt get past all the chapter 1s understandable though because that takes a long ass time i played the demo and after about 2 full hours of nothing happening i gave up on the game wow a critical review of octopath traveler thank god you brought up a lot of points that should be obvious but ive not heard anybody bring up yet i enjoyed my time with the demo but the fact that those snails are still there after level 20 characters and the game didnt give you some item to repell those encounters is obnoxious pokemon meets inception adept most overrated game on the last 10 years probably do a video on wizard of legend microsoft excellency uh i disagree but thats your opinion dunkopuff we all cant agree i guess this and persona 5 are the only games where i adore the turn based combat i personally enjoyed this game but thats only because i have some degenerate brain that registers turn based combat as fun idk why but i knew he would shit on this game well whatever this game is amazing anyways im loving it your excellency you should really consider playing bookworm adventures the butthurt commentors are strong with this one dunkey is the armond white of rpgs i sure hope its not that bad because i bought it before watching this video thank you everyone is saying this game is good but its just shit completely agree with dunkey i just played the demo and got bored its a shame dunk usually youre on point but you fail to miss the magic this game has you had a good run but now i see clearly why you are a wukong main you can use one of the special support skills to make random encounters 1 js dunk all love here but a lv20 something olberic should be murdering things way faster since you should probably have a good amount of skills at that point hey youre that excellency pit of spice knew this wouldnt be as good as bookworm adventures whenever you see a dunkview you know its gonna be wellinforming legit content note of advice please look at another reviewer its not right to shit on a game because you dislike the genre look at another reviewer wholl actually give a good review without bashing on the game even if they dont like jrpgs its a bias dunkey has against them its his opinion so im not gonna shit on dunkey but please see another game reviewer i feel really dissapointed once again by reggies direction of this game he shouldve as the main programmer of octopath traveller invest more in cinematic grinding quests that let us feel the nature of completing compeling objetives i played the demo and deinstalled it i was just so bored and when finally the combat startedturn based oof hope sky williams misses the video he loves this game cant wait for squidroad follower why review a jrpg if you dont like anything about jrpgs you clearly hate jrpgs lmfao need to find a gurl like ophilia 5 excellency out of 9 octodad traveler his excellency now in theaters this fall why are you even reviewing this game when you dislike jrpgs i never heard the word excellency before until i had it reminded to me over and over again for 10 times thanks octopath like you said this game is bad you should play bookworm adventures deluxe now thats a good game it probably didnt help that he started with the two worst characters your excellency for smash bros ultimate october octoboner more than 8 books in bookworm adventures knack two your excellency but what does middleschoolerconnor think hey dunk add me on switch first negative opinion ive seen of this game but that was expected dunkey doesnt like jrpgs i used to dabble in eurexalancy but ive found it to be dangerous and unpredictable if i hear your excellency one more time i swear i will have a stroke and somehow that will still be interesting than this game in other words its not the kind of game dunkey has the patience for which i wont fault him for nothing wrong with turnbased combat especially if you set it up along the lines of the persona series or if you have a stat like speed that determines who will place first as for standard fights with such a system dunkey welcome to the grind either you put up with it and embrace it or you get the fuck out of jrpgville it aint going away ever random encounters are an acquired taste this day and age im fine with them but i see the point of having the choice to engage enemies and how thats appealing dragon quest made this transition and its all the better for it octopath traveler seems like its really trying to bring back 90s jrpg nostalgia which some people wont be interested it the game appeals to a pretty niche market was kinda hoping this was just a goofy title for the splatoon 2 dlc i can already taste nintendo fanbois tearsyour excellency you shouldve made the video eight minutes long remeber kids you are not aloud to criticize nintendo no matter what and i had high hopes hey there dunk long time fan every since the days of animating for the stimpsons keep making your cool pixar videos thanks was looking forward to the game but oh god what a waste of money i was gonna buy this but looks like its not very good change my mind bookworm adventures when psycho mantis this whole game was conceived and advertised as a love letter to the classic jrpgs of the 90s knowing that those arent your cup of tea im not sure how you could be disappointed unless you somehow expected something different i completely disagree with your video dunkey still like it 3 dunk has shown me the error of my ways because of his teachings i have turned my back on my many forms of weebery now i am just a man with a sword you should play bookworm adventures instead dunky playing the contrarian your excellency youre that ninja im waiting for the intro video game video game duuunkeyyy i feel like he reviewed it to counter the praise the game gets for no real reason you can make a rpg fun this game has cringe dialogue and even worse voice acting i had to switch over to japanese audio to get past hour one even then the combat is nothing new and the visuals are just hd bland washed out hd i was looking forward to this game for months now and i got it for 60 when i feel like its worth 30 at most if you want it wait for a sale but since its nintendo good luck i think the pitch for this game went a little something like this hey guys lets take bravely default and bravely second and literally mash them together give it a new soundtrack and a new coat of paint but leave out any interesting battle mechanics or charming character interactions tbh bravely default was actually alright but bravely second was easily a sophomore slump its not a lovely day for it its a terrible day for it the worst part is easily that the characters dont even interact with each other introductory chapters are fine but as they converge they should transition from his or her story to their story damn xenoblade chronicles 2 is my favorite video game story of all time yooooo patapon was a ridiculously good game please review on that its a turn based kinda game but not idk where is the octodad dlc cmon reggie thats a bummer i just saw this the other day and was thinking about getting it guess ill hold off the only true e x c e l l e n c y is knack of course i love these videos but oh my god theyre so short sky williams is not going to be happy with this wheres the rating score unsubscribe this isnt bookworm adventures play that instead man i thought this was gonna be a good game but if the interactions really are that mediocre i probably shoulnt buy it i guess youre giving this game a 70 thanks for the review dunk majestic marmot 2 baby thank god nintendo needs to step their game up dunkey i had hope that you would come in like a wrecking ball on this one when you see a game called octopath traveler youre thinking ooooooo we gonna be goin on some cool ass adventure as an octopus but then you find out that the game doesnt eeeeeven have any octopuses they just used the name because they have 8 tentacles and you can play 8 characters cammmmman reggie i thought you were gonna hit us cooool ass adventure not this octopusless shit next thing youre gonna tell me is that one of the 8 characters is a humanoid squid cammmmmmman reggie 05 yo turn based combat is the most unengaging type of combat gameplay in video gaming imho im pretty sure u misspelled your name wrong again just letting you know didnt want u to get embarrassed if anybody see reggie on fornite tell him not to do such things i liked ni no kuni design with random encounters where you would be able to see monsters sneak past them or run from them can you review more of the shiat games that come out during summer time d you blew it your excellency shits on octopath traveller and xenoblade chronicles gives free pass to crap like mario odyssey and uncharted nice come at me aww and here i was hoping dunkey would make a video on all the ridiculous shit you can do in this game i once saw a woman getting harassed by a drunk man in an alley so i served the woman some justice by beating the shit out of her and leaving her unconscious with the man feels good to do good i dont know how to spell exlency i feel as though my favorite game this year was verbally destroyed i actually really enjoy this game but i do agree with you with the voice acting haha i just set it to japanese their stories do get more interesting as you go on but i do wish you could choose to just play through one persons story all the way through instead of how the game makes you see all of the stories at the same time you are my hero i love you dunkey we get it you hate jrpgs and turnbased combat it coulda been a masta piece i poop the bed who durnkey i think the storytelling was a fair point to make but honestly the combat comes down to preference what dunkey describes as a problem in the random encounters is in my opinion a better alternative to what we usually get octopath traveler is one of the few rpgs where mindlessly mashing confirm doesnt win you the encounter the break system and bp introduces more depth to a modem turn based rpg and imo makes the game all the better for it this isnt knack iii your excellency first time ive ever strongly disagreed with you dunko this is a damn good game octopath traveler is the best pokmon game in 5 years tbh tommy you killed chef boyardee id be all like yeah biatch i am excellency finally someone public with the balls to point out how overrated this game is still cool but not even near the hype would love to see you make a dunkview for persona 5 or another jrpg you like always enjoy your content keep up the good work i am not a gamer just a man with knack 2 wait this isnt bookworm adventures dunkey your excellency will you please have mercy on thy comments it annoys me that she keeps calling him your excellency just call him reggie he hates turn based rpg games this is so sad alexa play gucci gang to be fair you are not usually a fan of these types of games so i understand why those elements would be tedious in your perspective thank you for this review amazing this game rolled out just like i thought it would i thought there would be a catch in there like something it would make it stand out just like you but you are going to tell me its just the stuff weve been trough these years with no big improvements ok im out sounds like you really didnt like this game this is for anybody that ever had a pepperoni pizza just have some sort of minicombat thing before every random encounter be it a quicktime event or some sort of stat comparison i want a swedish rpg psycomantis love your stuff dunk your videos brought me laughs during dark times keep em coming baby when will reggie go back to making the bookworm adventures remastered prepare to die edition with new funky mode and knuckles im somewhere in the middle here i enjoy the game but random fight encounters really frustrate me to no end yeah looks like another weeb trash dammit reggie you were the chosen one but is the game good good vid your excellency i actually extremely enjoyed this game and found each story was relatively interesting in there own right yes some were a but boring and generic such as olberics but other than that ive been extremely enjoying this game dunkey as already gone to say he doesnt enjoy turnbased rpgs in multiple videos so i already knew he probably wouldnt enjoy this but if you actually like jrpgs like the original ffs or playing the masterpieces that is bravely default this is definitely worth the purchase especially since its been a best seller and sold out everywhere but glad to hear your opinion dunk cant wait to see the next review its very clear you do not like classic style jrpgs and thus the game was not made for you it was abold game to make considering most jrpgs lately have tended to streamline their experiences bookworms new dlc looks great is this going to be a new meme your excellency maybe not the best idea to review a game when youre already biased against the genre i loathe turnbased combat and random encounters too fyi i actually really like this game i have been playing it non stop since it came out god i cant tell what is sarcasm or what is legitimate criticism i agree with almost everything but the last point looks like dunkey didnt play past the first chapters you bring up a lot of good points and i greatly respect your opinions on gaming but id like to share why i liked the game despite its many flaws the combat starts slow and it takes a bit for it to become interesting but as soon as you get more jobs the sky is the limit and you can really try any combination the amount of options you have during a boss battle is staggering and planning three turns ahead and dealing enough damage to obliterate the boss on the next turn is something that gives me immense satisfaction as for the characters and the stories they border on generic but there are a couple of legitimate twists that spice it up the best example is actually olberic whose final act is the exact opposite of what i expected and his character develops because of it last thing id say is that i think that if you use the scholar ability to evade encounters you rarely have to do any nonboss fight i spent the entire game underleveled because i tried my best to av reggie needs to stop trying to make anime and go back to making halo leave the anime to the big boys like snake the creator of the metal gear solid elbow nudge its no legend of the dragoon elbow nudge should have played in japanese voice they are all famous voice actor the experience will be way better clicked on this video thinking maybe dunkey will give me a reason to care about this seemingly boring uninteresting rpg everyone loves so much well sama should not translate into excellency but your excellency if your excellency is your excellency then your excellency must do what your excellency must for your excellency is your excellency and your excellency can become your excellency to collect 9 your excellencies unlock the legendary spear of your excellency and defeat the evil your excellency lord of your excellency then bake a strawberry flavored cream your excellency with a nice hot cup of your excellency your excellency your excellency your excellency this game is actually pretty good you blew it dunk this review is awful your exellency looks like you only put 2 hours into the game before giving up on it why even review it if you dont like jrpgs its xb2 all over again with you not giving it enough of a chance knack is e x c e l l e n c y back baby here comes the money well the game didnt look appealing to me in the first place now i know i can skip it ive played enough turn based rpgs a lot with an awesome twist like shadowhearts covenant or shin megami tensei raidukusunoa vs the soulles army or just the first one lucifers call this isnt bookworm adventures you should play that instead this reminds me of the time dunkey predicted that papa john is a fraud its pokemon that ripped shin megami tensei its just smt meets inception hey dunkey have you ever considered your opinions are sometimes completely biased dogshit thenk octodunk its a bad ripoff of bookworm adventure i was on the fence about this game the critique reviews were either fantastic best jrpg this year or medicore i guess ill wait a bit for a sale nefreo picking it up i dont see much seperating this from an rpg maker game psycho mantis your excellency yo dunk try out rune factory 4 a kinda poopoo story but it cuts out what you dont like this shits a straight up dumpster fire worse than bonein pizza go commit neck rope reggie im sorry your excellency but you should play bookworm adventures it stopped sounding like actual words u x l n c this video is excellency im expecting a lot of rage coming to this video lol honestly i love the game and the stories of each character especially the thief hes my favorite you just started as the generic knight its your own damn fault i love you dunkey but i dont feel like this video was a great representation of the game you have said several times you dont like jrpgs yet you decide to review a jrpg with every element you dont like yeah shouldve stayed on the battle bus reggie thank you finally someone agrees with me i dont see the appeal of taking turns fighting its just boring majestic marmot is your favorite bc it attacks with these nuts imagine being so braindead you cant even abuse weaknesses to one shot enemies imagine being so braindead you waste bp any chance you get imagine being so braindead you spend 60 on a game that you knew you werent going to like stick to memes dunk your opinion on games is as awful as the gaming journalists you always rag on every insult on xenoblade 2 that is made here increases my depression damn the art style looks so cool though yep your excellency meets the weekly dunkey meme quota thought i wouldnt take to this game but i actually ended up loving it after the slow start it does suck that the story is broken up into eight parts that dont intersect and that the characters hardly interact with each other but the writing is actually a lot better than your typical jrpg dreck cough xenoblade 2 as for the turnbased combat it never claimed to be anything else so i dont know what to tell you if youre not a fan of it i myself kinda love how strategic it can be and as someone who abhors grinding ive had to do very little of it damn thanks dunk been on the fence about buying this one and seeing this i think ill buy an old final fantasy on steam for a fifth the price instead its really interesting to see everyone praise this game and then see dunkey rip it to shreds hey dunkey you want a real game deadly premonition its like la noir meets resident evil 1010 wtf if you want yo discover the beauty of a jrpg in the first combat against a snail sorry not your kind of game i guess commenting because i love these videos and i think commenting helps bread is healthy you should eat it is delicious this video gives me very conflicting emotions on one hand i love this game the other i love dunkeys opinions what do i make of this your e x c e l l e n c y you should do a review on god eater i guess this video makes me a little less upset that i dont have a switch thank you dunkey reviewing a jrpg and saying its bad because its a jrpg because you dont like jrpgs and then nitpicking everything else is some really high level criticism nice going cinemasi i mean dunkey pretty sure he didnt actually finish the game either because all the footage and nitpicks were from very very early game and a lot of his points can just be straight up refuted by the mid game content which does have better writing more interesting battles and actual conversations between characters that is how an rpg is paced but im sure hed criticize that too oh i have to play the game for it to get better you done goofed reggie friendly reminder of dunkeys own video about reviewers where he admits himself that jrpgs arent his favorite and asks you to take all his reviews with that in mind just dont want anyone to count out a game you potentially might like just cuz dunkey didnt especially if youre already a fan of the genre so this basically proves that square enix cant do turnbased any more smh god i love fresh dunk i like the game dunkey doesnt oh its time for me to head into work dunkey is literally the only youtuber i clicked the bell for i will not miss a dunkey video for as long as i live your excellency brb buying all the dunko merch real quick oof dundleb roasted this game thanketh thou for thiseth videoen but wheres my mario odyssey dlc your excellency among first 3k comments his excellency dunkey just has confirmed the suspicions i had about this game its just a fancy graphic cover on top of the archaic jrpg structure it truly is a genre from another era your excellency i think we may have discovered a new drinking game psycho mantis jokes aside you do not like turn based rpgs dunk and i respect your opinion but ffvii and the like are historic masterpieces in modern gaming the game makes you feel like your excellency its definitely not for everyone but im enjoying the game a lot dunkey why are you reviewing something you seem not to like at all i prefer playing with the original japanese voices and the whole disjointed narrative thing has a seven samurai feel to it that i appreciate just cause these people travel together dont mean they have to be best friends or chat all the time theyre sort of like traveller roomates lol bookworm adventures is the superior rpg god fuck me japan either makes the best stories or complete utter dog shit dialogue with a cliche world knack 2 baby you should try bravely default on the 3ds they give you a lot of optional changes to the classic turnbased rpg combat system that let you not waste so much of your time my favourite is that you can customize the random encounter probability such that you can even turn them off all together i love this new video your excellency the way you portrayed the combat was pretty disingenuous my man i get you dont like turn based but it really looks like you went out of your way to make it look worse than it actually is its a neat concept but i wouldnt waste 4999 on a game that looks like it belongs on an snes im first fuh u mean is this ur excellency more like pizza butt god this kind of dialogue makes me want to never play a game ever again or play some bookworm adventure deluxe hey have you tried that new game bookworm adventures 2 i like the game but i agree that the dialogue in general is very dull and uninteresting a lot of times not exactly stellar writing at play here the only games on the switch that i own or plan to own are the ones that dunkey has had a negative review on your dunkcellency this sounds like a 20 game your dunkcellency i will surely wait for the price to drop your dunkcellency urexlency i bought xenoblade chronicles 2 because of your gameplay and absolutely loved it from beginning to end i guess you really dont like jrpgs im not first but 84752 just to let you guys know dunk i love you man but something tells me you didnt beat the game can you play the american super mario 2 and ready to rumble boxing on dreamcast i wish i was a video game dunkeyyou really should play knack adventures hd blood money absolution your excellence goty special edition i thought id heard your epilepsy and snorted thanks octodunk didnt miss that shade thrown at my favorite game of all time ffx walking on dangerous ground dunkey i cant even buy the game sold out ok thats just bullshit you dont give a starter enemy a healing move but dunkey why would you even bother we know you dont like despise turn based rpgs this game is literally a collective of all the things you hate meanwhile its a collective of all the things rpg players love i feel like this review was so short sighted you seem to have immediately come into it with a negative mind set seem to have cherry picked the worst examples completely out of context again we know you hate rpgs you dont have the patience for them but this review just seems negative for the sake of negativity i want dunk to push me into a pit of spikes and shoot me with a bazooka wow some more anime trash i will now refer to dunkey only as your excellency your e x e l l e n c y how to preorder it jrpg i used to play when i was kid didnt have turn based combat if there was a fucking lv1 snail then i just killed it with 1 slash so when i found about the combat was shitty boringass turnbased i was a bit disappointed tbh i dont really know much about the story so i wont say its cringy or anything i would play it if it has supergood story but the random encounters and turnbased battles make me hesistate for once dunkey i think youre full of shit dunkey wtf the snail is weak to daggers why dont you use the god damn dagger your excellency psycho mantis so its bad thanks dunko i keep forgetting that you really like jrpgs so doing a video about a game that is jrpg is sure right up your alley thanks for warning about this game tho not gonna buy it thanks to this lolololol yall who are getting upset need to watch dunks game critics video why would you expect him to like octopath well i still like octopath traveller a lot more than i expected to tbh i dont even know what the fuck its about so good review you cant say bad things about celeste this is so sad can we hit y o u r e x e l l e n c y why there is no dunkview in the title i cant understand if your joking or not if there is no dunkview in the title was it a joke do you actually love this game i am confused make it stop i find it funny that donkey took everything that i like in a video game and just roasted it the title of the game sound like a jrpg porno wow this is the first time ive disagreed with ya dunkey part of it may be because you didnt like something ive put some time into playing likely the biggest part but for some reason your welcome opinion doesnt wound me i aint wounded by disagreement color me 20 years ago i just really wanted a scene where therion tries teaching thievery to tressa and olberic tells him off its just ok basically just silicon studios take on a saga styled rpg it shares a lot of the pros and cons of those games minus the extra grindy way of leveling your characters in those games if youre not into that though avoid it like the plague id still say that bravely default is their best game at the moment it has a better story with characters that actually influence the overall plot along with a battle system that evolves with your job class choices plus the music is great their first game final fantasy 4 warriors of light was pretty mediocre and bravely second was a bit of a mess in the story and music department im hoping these guys put a lot more effort into their next project and focus on working on what made bravely default so good and well received i really enjoyed the game and the grinding isnt as bad as you make it sound i really disagree with this video tbh i love the game i dont really think dunkeys the right critic for it considering its solely a love letter to classic jrpg nerds and hes clearly been show to dislike them its fine he doesnt like it but i just dont think a whole video was nessacery i already knew dunky doesnt like jrpgs hes stated why before and i get that thats fine but what did he expect from a game that was advertised as a retro throwback and a successor to ff6 you know that one game where after a certain point the story cares jack about what characters are in your party so they just generalize the dialogue in quotations anyways i personally believe this game does what it advertised to do a lot better than other retro rpg throwbacks im a huge critic of kemco and tokyo rpg factory games but i do believe octopath does a lot to set itself apart from those games dunkey tried to undersell it by saying its only selling point is the eight playable characters that is the case for the marketing but theres also an interconnected world very customizable playstyles and a unique rendering style all im trying to say is for those who are turned off from the game because dunky didnt bother to use hardly any of the games mechanics to prove tha whats the game in the beginning with the yellow sky beam laser its important to note dunkeys disdain for jrpgs to begin with he said it himself that he thinks there is something of worth inside the game but its incredibly monotonous so for people like me among many others that dont dislike the monotony as much it might be a good fit going by his review f u n k i t u p ok people who are genuinley pissedits dunkey he doesnt like three things turn based combat jrpgs and animewhat did you expect also srsly reggie while the inidivudal narratives are simplistic and straightforward theyre written incredibly well sooner than read some excerpts of its wellwritten prose you just bastardized the narrative and didnt even attempt to hid your biases to address your criticism of the narrative seeming disjointed as a result of having eight individual protagonists your chosen protagonist is traveling from town to town searching for rest equipment and to bolster their ranks and coffers you are given the option to skip each of the individual characters personal novellas so you could further empathize with your own and to play out the narrative in real time not sure why you would on your first playthrough though because its also there to play on jrpg convention and show that each character has history personality and their own objective as for ophilia she was addressing her father a key figure in the church with respect much like you would address a king as your majesty bookworm 2 is definitely better than despacito 2 woah a different opinion the salt going to be intersting in the comments watch how every comedian in the comments milk out that one clever bookworm joke a guy made making it dull and stale instantly octopathmore likeoctocrap ha ha ha haaaaaaiiiigh so which one is better octodad or octopath really just seems youre hating on a jrpg for being a jrpg here but dunkey while i get you dont like random ecounters i find it weird that you hate on it by octopath but dont hate on it by persona or undertale also you said you dont hate turn base combat in a other video you saidi dispise this shit just saying what you said about the story i get i love this game but i can see where the dunk is coming from he hates turn based combat and dislikes rpgs in general so i can see why its a turn off for him the stories arent the best true and i think thats a big flaw to the game even if i found myself getting invested anyways what dunk fails to mention is that the boss battles are pretty fun and can often require quite a bit of strategy to beat and that characters do interact with each other from the second chapter onwards dunkey you admitted a while back that you dislike games with turn based combat yet you still review them do you think you can remain objective nevertheless i agree with all the points you brought up in this video love your work im early lemme say something cleveruhhhhh knack 3 amirite all the reasons you dont like this game are the exact reasons i do guess its just not for you but it is clearly for a lot of people based on the enormous sales so i shouldnt buy this game no character interactions who are these people remember guys nobody is allowed to disagree everyone needs to be the same person and think the same thing even though dunkey clearly dislikes jrpgs in general forget the fact he likes persona 5 and that means hes a bad person and an idiot ahahahaha fucking comments section damn the third splatoon game didnt hold up to its previous entries this game really makes you feel like batman now introducing the new and improvedroblox the turn based adventure play as roblox himself and venture to new lands just wanna throw it out there xenoblade 2 has one of the most engaging and entertaining battle systems ive ever seen in a rpg yes its agreed upon that the thousands of tutorials arent the best way to go about explaining the system but if you can look past that then you got yourself an incredible and unique rpg dunkey we realize you arent a fan of jrpgs but please be considerate when insulting one your review of xc2 deterred away many people from a great game just because it contains one too many cringy anime moments the only game critic we can trust first dunkey vid ive ever thumbed down i swear you have the attention span of a child sometimes how would rather play one of the easiest games of the year mario odyssey over a strategic and beautiful jrpg xenoblade octopath that voice actor sounds like prozd thank god you are perfectly right you blew me like an octorok reggie wheres beefstew dunkey what about megaman battle network 4 way to show off the first battles as an example of the entire game thats not biased at all with the right set up you can finish battles in 1 party turn also if you bothered to use a your spear which is the enemys weakness youd have broken it and increased the damage it takes which would in turn make the battle a lot faster but hey gotta misrepresent for those views you stand correct as always hey its me videogamedunkey his excellency youre that ninja thou art donkey i disagree with dunkey on this one and thats okay dunkey himself has said that hes never been particularly a fan of jrpgs so i know this game isnt his cup of tea his critique is a valid one because the disjointed narratives will turn off some folks me personally i love the game i think the combat is interesting i think the presentation is top notch and ive always loved jrpgs so folks dont down vote the video just because you disagree with the dunk he has valid points i know what theyre calling the deluxe version yeah i stopped listening to this guy after he said octopath traveler was bad so uh boss baby 2 was just announced im looking forward less and less to meeting reggie on the battle field in fortnite if he keeps putting out these bad games sorry reggie but book worms adventure was probably your best game should i get this game i dont really know what this game is about octopath traveler not so excellency edition smh still no 3d bookworm adventures dunkey your content is getting worse and worse if you dont put 3d bookworm adventures in your videos more often speaking of it you should try out 3d bookworm adventures i still cant believe they killed yusufa i mean i think you should power through with this one i mean persona v if you take it for what it is at the beginning then you would have missed so much quality that it offers some games captivate you early on some do the opposite make you hate it early on but try it some more and youll understand what it has to offerit is a jrpg im having so much fun with this game turn based engaging combats random encounters nice and understandable stories instead of a ff clusterfuck i love it i havent played a jrpg in forever i thought this would be a good game to have a feel for the genre again now i actually dont know if i should get it because of how suprisingly serious dunkey was eh o well this is the first majorly negative critique ive seen of the game while refreshing but as someone who likes the game im sad then again dunkey isnt someone who really likes rpgs anyway so im not too effected oh for a second i thougt this was bookworm adventures deluxe you should post that instead ay dunkey rough question here crunchy or creamy peanutbutter delet tis biased video and upload that sick bookworm adventures deluxe gameplay octopath traveler has nothing to super mario brothers 3 baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyybeeeee i respectfully disagree i actually really love this game but then again i love jrpgs so i can see where your coming as someone whos not a huge fan of the genre but hey at least you gave it a chance yeah to be honest octopath traveler was not what they hyped it up to be i still personally like it the spritework and the presentation are friggin amazing but the disjointed storylines are just jarring its a shame too because i do think there are interesting elements to the stories but its like you pointed out some of the characters are just bland and they only get so much time to fill out their character before they disappear so someone elses story can take over i wouldve liked it better if they tried something like having eight different starting points to the story but eventually all of the stories start to weave together for example maybe have the warrior guy cross paths with the merchant girl on the way to fulfill his journey and the like your excellency the game this guy isnt very good at movie reviews so i left a dislike court is in session all in favor of referring to videogamedunkey as your excellency say aye aye i wish i waited for dunkeys video before buying this shit its dissapointing that the other characters dont interact with eachother at all i played an rpg it has features that rpgs have i personally dont enjoy those feature bad game also how dare ophilia say his name i hope you dont actually hurt the games sales with this lazy video grasping at straws harder than a cinemasins video i disagree with you this time dunkey but i still love ya ill give it this the game looks fucking gorgeous i have a feeling lots of people arent going to like this just like the people who didnt like the xenoblade 2 one that being said if rpgs like this could make their main story 20 hours i would actually play a lot more rpgs but instead the main story is like 50 hours most of the time and you have to just sit there and press a over and over for hours at a time i just want a well writen rpg that doesnt get boring there is no need to grind in this game if you do all stories and side quests sorry but youre being dumb dunkey poor jared the best part about random encounters is the battle music thats it nothing else psycho mantis your excellency i was expecting the game to have cephalopods in it massive dissapointment pokemon has random encounters but i dont think its fair to compare it to final fantasy like you tried to do through editing yes the encounters are random but only when you are on a specific tile tall grass cave floor you walk in the grass you fight a pokemon you walk on the path you dont there are very few areas that force you to go through the tall grass to get to your location ff has it so you can just fight some random bitch whenever you are in the open areas no matter what theres no path through that guarantees safety as a side note pokemon also has repels a consumable item that temporarily prevents battles in the areas like the tall grass and the caves not saying pokemon is better or anything but am saying that to call its encounters random in the same way you are calling ffs random is disingenuous book work is the best rpg i agree the grinding in this game is next level awful your excellency with a side of salt they did better in the prequel octodad i agree with you on every point about the story but i enjoyed the game because i dont despise turn based combat if you do hate turn based combat like you do dinko then you will definitely not enjoy this game but where is the knack 2 qhd port to the switch octopath stands out on music and combat in my opinion but ill admit the story isnt really there and lacks any kind of connection with each character when i heard about the whole 8 different story concept i was intrigued and made me think i was gonna play this game for hours but nah you just pick one character and theres no reason to start a new game to experience a new story in a whole new different way youre gonna learn everyones shit eventually on just one save file how dare you drag xenoblade 2s name through the mud like that albeit the dialogue is kind of clich the game is amazing i was expecting some bomb chicken you blew it dunkey why would you make a video for a game that clearly isnt for you this game is only for people with the iq of 1000 we need a sea of thieves video oh man you were way too harsh on this game i understand its not your cup of tea and not perfect but its a phenomenally crafted in regards to visual and gameplay progression i have been having the best time with it even if some of the characters stories arent the best ill trade you your copy of octopath traveler for my copy of croc on the playstation psycho mantis your excellency now this is what a man needs gato theme in the back at the beginning made my day yes please imma actually have to straight up disagree with you here octopath is a great game and one of the few rpgs that has come out lately that is actually worth buying bashing a game because its slow is childish and just shows how much of a bias you have also the stories do interconnect later on marry me dunkey this game made bookworm games looked like a mastapiece i your dunkly should have knack in it smh pshychopath traveler at the beginning i was wondering why would dunkey upload a video about some generic looking jrpg now im at the end of the video and im still unsure i enjoy octopath only a few characters have lackluster writing but otherwise its serviceable enough theres a lot of great ease of use and quality of life improvements and its generally fun to explore i do wish you could speak to all npcs thpugh the world feels less alive without that where is bookworm adventures deluxe dunkey should try playing divinity original sin 2 waitis this the new knack 2 dlc your dunkeycy your e x c e l l e n c y another great video you have made insert your excellency joke here judging by the rest of the things ive herd about this game dunkys opinion is wrong wheres the new odyssey dlc huh reggie huh nintendo too bad i cant play this to see for myself i have a soft spot for these kinds of games knack 2 baby i hate jrpgs let me review this jrpg meant for fans of jrpgs too bad its only on the switch do you also gotta find four magical stones that represent the four elements every single person in dunkeys comments are hysterical because i read his youtube comments in his voice dunkey you gotta play more than chapter 1 who knew octopuses can be so bbboooooooooooorrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnngggg this game has some of the most thrilling and exciting boss fights in any game i played they can go on for hours but nothing gets your blood pumping like getting that clutch break when youre in a tight spot dunkey proves once again he has shit taste he didnt like it suck it up nintendo fans art style looks cool though lmao i love this game but there are so many flaws like how clich typical the characters are or how you can already tell what will happen to each one of them from the beginning or how you have to level up every single one of them almost individually if you wanna complete all the stories you should play bookworm adventures 2 deluxe your excellency devinity original sin 2 please man you could make so much fun content out of that game more than just a single vid man seriously its so good ive only played the demo and while i agree that the writing i saw was not good and having no interaction between stories is a completely bizarre choice for a game with 8 main characters i actually quite liked the combat system compared to other turnbased games having to break enemy defences leads to some interesting strategies where you need to kind of use everyone in your party to kill enemies efficiently the sad thing is despite this being a meme review apparently this even too off based the interweaving of the individual stories to the other characters isnt that solid which is very upsetting for a game that was marketed as an rpg where they made it sound like its up to you to choose who you wanna play as making it sound like each character hadg a set of skills towards reaching their objectives along with 8 different choosable protagonists that allowed for replayability since their abilities could open up new ways of interacting with the world i was super excited for this game im not saying i would never play it but im still upset with hearing all these reviews say how each separate characters stories dont really interlock together or tell an engaging overall story dunkey im gona have to disagree with you on this one i find the game really fun sure the random encounters are annoying and dont make sense sometimes and some fights take a while but they get more fun when you get more members i know a game should not be fun in the middle but the game looks beautiful and the music is amazing when you have the perfect team together and kick ass it feels amazing please finish the game if you havent already and give it another chance the game is difficult at times and that is one of the things that i think makes the game fun excellency intensifies biggest issue is fixed by switching to japanese dialogue your excellency splatoon 2 octopath expansion your exalency or whatever it means im rarted i feel like earthbound had many interesting and convenient concepts that many of todays turnbased jrpgs just completely neglected take for example enemy interactions enemies will intentionally fight you when entering new areas some of these enemies were frustrating and monotonous to fight but after defeating the boss of the area the enemies would start running away from you additionally if you were high enough level you would just oneshot the enemies and gain what you would in a regular battle with them it gave you such a feeling of accomplishment and it wouldnt waste your time on some bullshit that youve already fought many times why is it that their is hardly any actual dialoguewith the characters its just disappointing excellency intensifies when you try to make the story sound lame but actually peak my interests instead only on this channel do you still play sonic mania i hate that i hate nintendos new franchises we all want them to do something original and new but none of their new franchises are turning out to be that good so i feel like an ass for biting the hand that feeds me the art style looked fantastic this isnt the splatoon 2 dlc really glad you made this i was about to buy the game we get it you dont like turn based jrpgs do you really need a 3 minute video reiterating that fact again you left out a lot of things from this which makes me think you didnt complete it so a halffinished game for a halfhearted video did anyone really ask for that i never really saw why people were hyped for this game it just looked like what it is a generic jrpg this game is a solid your excellency5 wait this isnt knack 3 knack 3 is confirmed your excellency thank you donsly man i appreciate your support great of you for reviewing my tiger game i cant remember what it was but i remember a specific rpg that allowed you to just run into weaker enemies and kill it without needing a turnbased battle i dont know if many other games did this but i remember one specifically and i wish it was utilized more in modern rpgs fuck having to do a turn based battle on a level 1 when youre level 40 and you just got the fucking murder every god in this world sword thing also yeah fuck random encounters still like the game though i kinda dig the aesthetic they were going for but i cant say it looks enthralling enough to even try youre excellency i i want you to play bookworm adventures deluxe i still like the video for the humour but there are way larger flaws you could have brought up this came off as kind of nitpicky not to mention the complete lack of touching on the combat which is spectacular but no matter what i love me my dunk i watched someone play the first ten minutes and this is how it went they looked at all the characters picked one and after about a minute of dialogue i quit watching it didnt grab my attention at all it looks nice though i really havent played splatoon 2 that much to be honest trihard 2018 batman traveler 8 really makes your excellentcy feel like octodad dunkey i love you but youre wrong about octopath its a new blend of nostalgia strategy and storytelling and it has an incredible amount of content yo when is reggie revealing bookworm adventures your excellency edition dunkpath traveler become a donkey with a tux and shades with a cigar your excellency your that ninja poor reggie first he gets exposed for being too scared of making an e4 and now octodunk bastard flopped 375 people hit that excellency instead of the like button i swear i can smell my own ears alright donkey im going to let you finish but xenoblade 2 was the best selling xenoblade of all time dunkey just mad leah doesnt call him your excellency while i agree on dunkeys philosophy on game reviews that you need to understand the voice of the reviewer this review was basically i hate traditional jrpg elements this game has a lot of those also he picked olberic first who gave dunkey jrpgs wow usually i agree with dunky on everything but i actually 100 disagree on this octopus the traveler is an amazing game with a very thought out story and it leaves you to play it however you want like the old final fantasy days you use your imagination to bring your group together invent a story the gameplay is very thought out and strategic and if you are smart enough you can tackle some of the hardest levels early game the animation is pretty the music is beautiful and you can tell a lot of work was put into the making of the world you play at im kinda sad that dunky didnt appreciate such a good game dunky is black why do you even bother playing a genre you dont like this is a game that is made for the crowd that likes old school rpgs and most of that crowd can put up with the random battles and he turn based combat not all of the character stories are shit primrose the dancer has a really good one its not a perfect game but it has its redeeming points and i hope that with the sales being high we can get a more modernised version of this same concept disappointed that reggie didnt bring bookworm adventures on the switch instead this octocrap travelers happy i passed on this one ill wait for a holiday price drop too short i need more dunkboy sooooo like 2 chunks out of 5 dunks or something its a classic style jrpg honestly what did you expect at first i thought octobath traveler was a splatoon dlc id like to see finley review either mario tennis aces or a pokmon game the next knack looks great dunkey i love you i dunno ive played two of the beginning stories and i like it so far i agree that the characters should interact more you have eight main characters and you can make them meet each other in any order you want the game would be way cooler if we got interactions between the characters lol i know when dunkey reviews an rpg i can safely ignore it but did you save the mystic mungus dude i love this game but i can see your point of view but what about the cute anime girls your excellency this type of super bland jrpg is exactly what i like to turn my brain off to dunkey you just dont understand the allure of cheap beer i bet hey dunkey there is a knack animated movie its a masterpiece reminder to take it as dunkeys opinion and not a definitive review for the game as pointed out in his game critics video if you dont like his opinion thats fine its almost like thats how opinions work im just gonna leave my girl if she doesnt constantly call me your excellency ragnarok online sure looks different your excellency i dont think this is bookworm adventures deluxe obligatory justin y comment yeah i had a feeling dunkey wasnt gonna be liking this one your excellency yo i think that dude is the same voice actor as kana from poe good thing i am not into jrpgs or rpgs for that matter p the combat system in this game is cancerous i think it hits squarely for people who enjoy jrpgs dunky has stated he doesnt like them save for the few exceptions some people dont mind the grinding or random levels and this is where video game reviews have a bit of human error i dont like fps games i think they all play and look the same with boring grey and brown color palettes with uninteresting gameplay and concepts and this is mostly for the biggest kind of fps the military shooters now i loved doom 2016 and bioshock 1 is another favorite but thats because i found them fun unique and interesting it really just depends on what you like stealth revolution 2nd floor basement psycho mantis your excellency this game was made in the fortnite engine hes too bias against jrpgs to give out a decent critique of this game i hope people who watch this give a look at other reviews before deciding to pass on this or not im assuming you didnt play past chapter 1 cause while its not a lot there is character interaction during he later chapters these devs should bring back the battle system from legend of dragoons back at ps1 theres none of these jrpgs goin to take a risk of that and dont know why finally a review that doesnt just suck this games dick because nostalgia i have no issues with random encounters and turn based combat if they do it the way bravely default and bravely second end layer did it it had a slider in the options menu for of chance for encounters and you can set it to 0 when you dont want to fight shit and just run through an area im all for old school rpgs but fuck that noise lol wow harsh wasnt expecting that much negativity im three hours into the game and loving it its got plenty of issues i really wish the characters interacted with each other more the story can be pretty stop and start and ophilia really can be annoying but i like the combat and the writing brought me close to tears at the end of olberics first chapter still youre entitled to your opinion i hope you enjoy the next game you review your excellencyis this a knack 2 dlc honestly the game doesnt look that bad dunkey kind of reminds me of bookworm deluxe which if my memory serves correctly was the greatest game of all time dunkey is sounding like a real octopussy hahahahaha got em your excellency i data expunged could they not have used a shorter word than excellency my god she must be out of breath from saying that every sentence yo pin this the characters do interact though you might want to give the final fantasy 12 rerelease a go dunkey dont know if youd like it but it is very very different to every other final fantasy also no random battles i wait for a bookworm for better or worse it has the elements of classic jrpgs if you like lots of talking mild to severe grinding depending on how fast you wanna go and dont mind random encounters you will probably like the game but if you dont then yeah obviously you wont like the game i know dunk jokes a lot and i respect his opinion when he is more serious but i wouldnt let this video be a hard yes or no for the game i and many of my friends are completely obsessed if you think the random encounters in the game are bad play smt nocturne and youll have yourself a shitfest i get dunkey doesnt like jrpgs but some of his points are just wrong wait so do you think the game is good or bad im kinda confused jrpg voice actors for english are always so terrible its like the irritating girl you knew back in school and she loved anime and all they talked about is being a voice actor yet they have the most annoying voice and yet now they are actually doing it and they still sound just as bad and cringy i got my persona guy a few days ago and im halfway done already 10good yeah xenoblade chronicles 2 is cringy and all its worth is the story value that reveals further details about xc 1 but this one is made just to be that old school classic rpg and it is merely a first step i usually do like your reviews but youre being a bit biased due to your dislike of slow paced games i didnt even play it yet but i would like to give it a go even though it is expensive as in you cant expect people to pay 5999 for a old school styled game no matter how recently it was made then again thats just japanese prices for you wait wait wait correct me if im wrong but did she say excellency really enjoying the game but all of these is true if bookworm adventures is so good why isnt it in the despacito 2 trailer note if you actually like jrpgs this game is gr8 dunkey doesnt so take that for what you will p fallout 3 has lots of random encounters wonder why they dont suck ass dunkey what about darkest dungeon thoughts minecraft mods with shaders has come a long way first comment i get that the game isnt for everyone but i love the game in chapter 2 of each characters story the characters will begin to interact more it takes a while to get going but once it does its amazing when you get more characters skills sub jobs and passive skills managing all that is really fun the bp system can be so much fun if you manage everything correctly but i know some people dont have that patience for these types of games that are pretty slow at the start still its a fantastic game for those who like these types of games i expected an octodad reference your dunkeylency lol i still havent got that far in the game to hear the same shit over and over well today i learned that dunkey doesnt like traditional jrpgs im enjoying it so far but the randos are still annoying honestly i wait for dunkeys reviews of most of these games until i go out and buy them lmao the dunk speaks the troooof eight dunkos confirmed its why he went after the fucking bird what donkey kong hates octopath travellers ofcourse he will he has never gotten a standalone rpg for himself fuckin hater reggie doesnt have the time to make octopath traveler a good game he is just busy meeting all of us in fortnite now we learn that dunkey hates fun i was about to go watch the next newest gaming video then i was like naaahhh im gonna just watch this 50 more times cheers dunko we need a bookworm adventure rpg but where is the rating been playing this game for about 8 hours have a full party now its actually pretty fun to me yknow that mechanic in earthbound that allows you to instakill and skip annoying random encounters whenever youre overleveled thats fucking genius why dont we see that anymore videogameexcellency brought a new video oh wow im so excited the knight sounds a lot like garen i enjoy turn based games so ive been enjoying my time through the game still you bring up some good points on the game on how dull the character interaction is still ive been having a blast playing through the game d i respect your shit taste buddy except knack 2 thats some good shit have you ever played golden sun 1 and 2 i like your reviews but i like the gameplay and funny shenanigans you do even more bring back that classic dunkey content my excellency damn i thought this might be an exception to your jrpg hatred lol sorry dunkey that was a terrible review xenoblade chronicles 2 and octopath traveler are one of my favourite games on the switch and they both sold really well dont play a jrpg if you dont enjoy most of them great video your excellency that 30 year old boomer who has an attention span of a pigeon and cant into a story so he plays nintendo games like a manchild first insightful video i see from this guy the rest if just hilarious good job buddy the thrill of the fight jrpgs combat system is usually garbage but the story is great not in this case here its 55 hot pile of garbage wheres the toe dipping sauce pause everything octodunk uploaded its not an excellent game 8 whole characters fuccing sold whys everyone picking on poor ophelia shes just trying to be polite now hannit on the other hand that fauxmedieval garbage she and her village use is what really annoyed me oh helloen me goode ser have you seenen ye chamberen potte i must taketh the moste fierceomen dumpeth who is this mrmeatman clone fun fact dc has only had electoral votes since the 1964 election and has never once voted for a republican despite everything elsethe graphics are cool asf im honestly surprised that dunkey cares about story this much maybe you shouldve actually played beyond chapter 1 of any character i mean you still probably wouldnt have liked it but that way you couldve shitted more deeply instead of just at the surface level stuff you find on the first chapters dunkey the guy whos said he doesnt like most turn based rpgs didnt like the turn based rpg holy shit dunkey youre the worst reviewer ive seen how dare you disagree with me unfollowed unsubbed dont expect me to reblog any of your tumblr posts again but is knack in it inb4 the reggie didnt make this comments normally your videos are often pleasant and funny with well timed humour and clever criticism this this felt like it lacked all of that i feel like you just made this out of pure hatred for jrpgs and turnbased combat which doesnt make it funny it just makes me sad at least the gramphix is unique what anime is the one at 27 seconds im glad i was given a different perspective of the game through dunks eyes also glad you avoided that ligma disease going around this game is 910 imo and i am only 20 hours in they call it octopath travaler because you can think of 8 other games youd rather play come on give xc2 another chance i know the game is bad at first impressions but it gets better the more you play i swear youre excellency this is not bookworm adventures man i was waiting for that moment where dunkey would reveal the game had something cool up its sleeve incredibly dissapointed by octopath you know what i like about this game tho it makes you feel like your excellency i definitely prefer more interesting turn based combat like in paper mario and even games like xcom and by extension mario rabbids but octopath just struck a chord with me i really enjoy the combat with how satisfying the strategy is but i will always prefer real time gameplay but random encounters really do suck damn thought this was that new octodad lame i really want to know why dunky plays jrpgs like its no surprise to anyone he hates them hell is there even one in his channel with a good viewing like does he do it just to joke about them and his dislike or why you know when you hear a word so many times that it doesnt even sound like a real word anymore did you know octopath is a sequel to octodad holy shit you went in on this lmaoooo thot most honest review ever everyone is freaking out of their mind and its a good game but not the greatest one this is dunkeys last octopath video perhaps it was localised lazily or perhaps it was localised with consideration to snesera localisations inoffensive often censored sometimes poorly translated because that your excellency clip was craaap jajajaja nice i was about to choose ophilia to start the game man thanks dunkey psycho mantis youre that excellency thank you so much praise for this game i just dont understand i dont think it is terrible but it is okay at best and paper mario still reigns supreme in turn based combat shoulda picked best boy alfyn inb4 ophelia has a tragic traumatic incident which leaves her only able to say the word yourexcellency and that becomes her name whos worse the person that invented random turn based encounters or the retards that still think its a good idea to do i trust u dunk plz dont let me down i aint buying this anymore this video is excellency just call me pa my deearrest yes dunkey i have so much respect for you know calling out that game should be necessary since it shows that players still can be very naive today and buy or even preorder passable just barely good games with a full price tag on them this game shouldnt cost 60 rather half of it if you want to play a real jrpg grab bravely default so bookworm traveler pilots licence what for at least the art style looks really interesting but i fully understand the issues with the gameplay can just make it unplayable for some for once a bad game not made for playstation why are you reviewing a turn based rpg dunk we know you dont like that them thank you dunky i thought you were a nintendo fanboy where nintendo and associated games can do nothing wrong kind of guy but thank you for calling this out i spent the weekend with it after all the hype and wasted at least 15 hours before i realized there is just blandness here best rpg in years my ass im a diehard fan of pokmon and persona but i feel dunkey on rpgs good ones are but exceptions to the rule of tediousness i played the demo last october and i thought it was terrible i cant believe im not the only one was anyone considering buying this game and had their mind changed after watching this but when bookworm remember guys dunkey even said himself he doesnt like jrpgs so if you do like jrpgs just ignore this entire video ive tried a lot of jrpgs but i just cant ever seem to get into any of them so while i like the combat in this game i can say if youre not into jrpgs ignore this game instead of the video doublus good top 1 fan nevar stop sad to hear people arent enjoying this game im still having a great time with it maybe my standards are too low to notice i really like this game this is the first time ive completely disagreed with dunkey guess it was bound to happen eventually the best character in this game is majestic marmot hey its not for everyone its really hard to have serious reviews when they arent holistic in nature and read like a grocery list of bad features i appreciate your comedy but this type of review just waters down our already poor ways to get legitimate game reviews we know you dont like turn based rpgs we know you dont like anime writing we know how this videos going to go before we click on it i know this video was done to get laughs or whatever but when you have issues with game critics arent you supposed to do a better job of it the benefits of your reviews is that we know your preferences and youre not being paid but the content we get is a quick montage of cuts of dialogue or bad features to remove it from its context and emphasize it to a degree that doesnt exist in game and before anybody accuses me of anything stupid yes ive played this game no i dont like it was it a good game i dont think so but im not a game reviewer thats just my opinion the difference is i personally really like this game but as someone who isnt a big fan of turn based jrpgs this must have been a nightmare for you octopath youre that ninja dunkey uploads a video me your excellency at least the art style is beautiful thanks dun your excellency now i dont have to waste any time with a game like this is exellency even a real word also for the life of me i cant pronounce it correctly can you do legend of zelda majoras mask if this comment gets 420 likes i will change my name to your excellency good game bad review id still let you have my babies though so its bravely default but bad yeah but bookworm adventures i bow to you your excellency you read the comments of your videos and you think theyd rather have a jokey joke video octopath traveler makes you truly feel like your excellency is the excellency prozd ophilia is by herself the entire reason i turned on japanese voice acting make a new vid on no mans sky next please how many of you guys would consider buying this game after this review your excellency psycho mantis edit im rewriting this whole comment it needs some fixing dunkey doesnt like jrpgs essentially 8090s styled games so yeah no shit he isnt going to like the game and its mechanics i love it i dont hate him because we disagree we dont have to see eye to eye but his opinions arent be all end all he hadnt even shown off a lot of the game only small snippets of the first chapter literally not even a portion of the game its like the tinniest crumb so to people acting like this game is shit because of one video go play the demo and see if you like it if you dont then fine if you do fine i personally really love jrpgs really anything from japan as long as it isnt stupid shit like idols and fucking whatever nonsense persona 4 is octopath is a love letter to me i swear to fuck its live a live and bravely defaults bastard child and thats apparently something i needed even though i never thought i would i love the gameplay music and of co this game is a goddamn masterpiece you leave it alone yeah thats cool but when is the bookworm game vid coming aww thats sad i was looking forward to this game but now it just looks boring thanks dunk for opening my eyes did you even play through the game some of these things sounds like assumptions and a lot of them are just wrong also why did you start the video praising snes jrpgs but then hate octopath for being literally that more like octollency when you e x c e l l e n c y and she keep on s u c k i n g but dunkey you forgot the best parts like when the chef tries to turn you into sushi and you have to escape and how they leave it open to interpretation of how octodad had kids with a human i personally think the wife slept with the mailman yesssssss more donkey donkey happyhappy sucky sucky time dumpster hates jrpgs because they are jrpgs dislike but it makes sense with pokemans your excellency youre that ninja who didnt know about this game b4 donk mentioned it why even make a video about a jrpg when youve explicitly repeatedly talked about how biased you are on the subject we get it you dont like rpgs obvious rip off of knack your dunkeyllency is this on the steam winners collection great video your excellency still looks great to me and im still going to get it all these complaints are generic and can be said about literally any of the old and good final fantasy games so when you say you hate turnbased combat and random encounters youre basically saying that you hate all rpgs in general thats not fair dude if you want my opinion the combat works beautifully with the boost system which it seems you neglected to mention at all this felt rushed dunkey all you talked about was how annoying ophilias story was and how you dislike rpgs in general im very disappointed there are many other aspects to the game that are terrific in my opinion i wish you had seen them i would prefer lego star wars rpg sky is not gonna be happy about this i get that this is meant to be somewhat semi seriously but that point about how long the battles take is super weak like duh no shit battles will take forever if you dont exploit enemy weakness funny that you would shit on xenoblades 2 lackluster presentation but not even mention xenoblade 1 and its masterful storytelling this is a great review your excellency the game looks like shit too people eat this up when they shortcut pixel art by mashing it into 3d while covering up bland colors and designs with visual effects and overlays love ya dunks but you made a couple mistakes 1 switch to japanese va then skip that shit anyway cause you can read 2 switch to japanese va then skip that shit cause you can read this is actually really sad alexa play despacito the game is actually great however i respect dunkeys opinion to not like the genre its not everyones cup of tea and thats okay if you like jrpgs id recommend giving it a go as its definitely worth switch off the english va though guys dont let dunkey skew this game yes the stories are disjointed and repetitive on the first chapter but after that the game its an absolute marvel they have unique boss fights fun mechanics really solid voice acting plot twists its not weird that it became the third most sold digital game on the switch eshop and its actually getting more demand on japan i disagree with dunkey here im dissapointed the end card didnt have more excellency every time dunkey talks about persona i immediately gain interest to the video your knackcellency the constant barrage of twitter spam and obsession has effectively destroyed any interest ive had in playing this seemingly generic game every time a good game drops twitter and youtube will just destroy it into hell with the hype and it happens every time without fail persona 5 ruined undertale obliterated sonic mania annoying at best mario odyssey the next citizen kane meme all amazing games but ruined by this obsessive treatment and their shitty fanbases what strikes me as odd about octopath though is that aside from the visuals this game looks fucking basic and boring more so than bravely default why is it that everyone is going nuts over this i was about to buy this game todaythank you dunk for talking me out of a mistake and saving my money your excellency what if im in the back of the class with meh meh meh and i like it how many people knew about this game b4 donk mentioned it so has he pretty much confirmed that he doesnt like pokemon or what grinding 8 characters that dont even talk to each other man and i thought the demo seemed promising excellency intensifies im usually on the same page as you but i feel like you completely missed the mark on this one yeah some stories are weak but some are fantastic the eight characters range from the completely mundane to the most fantastic of fantasy and in that you find the beauty of relating to the mundane characters and enjoying watching them play out their story and you also enjoy playing as the fantastic characters with the sharp wit the unmatched charisma or the tragic backstory i think it all boils down to you either coming in with the wrong mindset or just not liking the genre im guessing its the latter considering that half the video was about jrpgs in general thank you dunkey weve reserved yet another gift from god what is dialogue when you have excellency dunkey is my excellency i lost my shit at the ff7 to pokemon random battle encounter so its xenoblade all over again glad i saw this before buying ya blew it i thought you said your next video would be on bookworm adventures deluxe play earthworm jim but it looks pretty so wait whats that its a mastahpiece but seriously it really does seem like your enjoyment of the game hinges on how much you enjoy classic rpg mechanics as well as whether or not you can deal with octopath travelers inexplicably separating each of the characters story im enjoying it so far but i get where the detractors are coming from lots of legitimate criticism except the script woahbut i thought this game was amastapiece hey donkster you should play minesweeper i cant decide whos the better waifu should i go for ophilia or haanit i mean i like xenoblade 2 lol the joke was funny though just like the entire video and there is degenerates who actually like grinding we have compact rpgs with sharp humor yes we have that we also have lisa which is neither of those things wait wasnt this supposed to be good you know because i have never of this game b4 probably never would i cant decide whether or not from a game developers perspective if is this a good thing or a bad thing while donk may jave gave it a bad score he still gave the game publicity that it probably wouldnt have gotten without this review yurexelency sounds like its own word now ya but it looks good so 1010 hi dunkey good points but i disagree i love this game though i have different gaming preferences than you do your excellency i disagree with a lot of this but its still a good video hes really wrong about the battle system though its not that easy at all its actually very complex oh wow i was expecting dunkey to love this game why didnt you bring up how much the hunter girl said eth everth damn word i will hunteth the spaghetteth and meatballeth for youeth mastereth i wanted to shoot myself during her first houreth psycho mantis your excellency gets comedy award turn base rpgs in general are garbage not even sure what i expected lol yeahyou can tell he didnt play the whole game lol dunkey will you be my excellency still waiting for that bookworm adventures review you cant play octopath traveler without playing seventhpath traveler yer crazy for this one dunk cant wait for my friends to get upset combat encounters arent mindless you literally cherry picked a fight where you intentionally just used basic attacks and didnt exploit weaknesses so you could make it look boring every fight is different you dont basic attack your way through them mindlessly ever this review is true for the first chapters after that every battle is very strategic there is party dialogue and the plots have interesting turns god dammit reggie youre hard to love but youre harder to hate this is why you should do bookworm adventures deluxe give yourself a break that snail is so killedest i enjoyed this game so much splatoon octopath travspansion very good review overrated game so it a 55 game well thats too bad if anyone has a urge to play this game go and play the demo or buy the game its so much more then what he describes wait a minute dunkey didnt like this turned based jrpg surprising count how many times ophilia says your excellency felt like i was hearing that every 30 seconds anyway octopath is fun imo and tressa is full of energy which helps get through some grinding sections i may be a bit biased though since im a pretty big rpgjrpg fan tdlr dunkey doesnt like jrpgs its turnbased he doesnt like that he doesnt like the dialogue he doesnt like the flow etc basically if you like turnbased jrpgs youll probably enjoy it and dunkey doesnt really enjoy either of those very often we share the same taste in terms of random encounters turnbased combat and anime shit im not a fan of any of those this game looks like the same sort of deal but i will say the art style of this game is one of the most gorgeous things ive ever seen in a game 2 bits game of thrones joreks elency octopath is just like dark souls i get that dunkeys videos are all for laughs but this is really selling the game short fair points are made the story is very archetypical and doing the chapter 1s for everyone can get tedious but the combat system is pretty interesting letting you stun enemies with weapons theyre weak to makes battles something you have to think for at least a little bit and im well over 20 hours in and have found no need for grinding fucks sake dunkey why are you level 22 with only one party member seems dunkey just isnt a fan of some jrpg mechanics which is fine but why would you complain about random encounters in jrpgs theyre to be expected with a few exceptions tldr if you like jrpgs dont let this video fool you octopath traveler is worth checking out as long as youre a fan of its genre octodad expansion dadliest traveler i love the game but damn is ophilia boring ngl i expected splatoon 2 octo expansion well this game is definitely not for me am i the only one who just goes through and thumbs up every bookword adventures deluxe comment review advanced gungeon u savior dunky i might have fallen for the pixel art i thought this game looked like butt extremely relieved to hear dunkey confirm for me bookworm adventures your excellency actual octopus rpg when thank you dark souls m e h m e h m e h your excellency only good story is primroses you sure like cherrypicking dunkey octopath is the new excellency literally goty tho bill teds your excellency adventure octopath expansion dunkiest catch now thats a review bookworms adventure yet oh boy i can already hear the fanboys cry out in agony and defend this crappy game to the death dunky youre giving xenoblade 2 way to much shit man its story was actually decentgood at times and characters like morag and zeke were imo entertaining and likeable every jrpg ever dunkview its clear and to the point dunky going against the main stream reviewers lets see if this pays off fuuuuuck man the game looks so good though someone in the splatfest put octoling traveler damn dunkey id thought youd like this game not one of dunkeys best videos you can tell he managed to get to the first chapters of some characters before he stopped playing enough to get a cursory glance of the game but like most jrpgs not enough to get into the depth of the mechanics and story how do i know all of the boss battle footage was from chapter 1 and some moments he only had one character so sad alexaplay your excellency by ophilia your excellency can you please review bookworm adventures deluxe this review was good your excellency psycho mantis dunkey pronouncing reggie is whats keeping me alive atm this might be the first dunkey video i just 200 disagree with how much disagreeing even is that no clue still an enjoyable video but your excellency this is an excellent piece of art love it how everybody asks for bookworm adventures while 2 months ago he threw away the game i know about the comment guy finally a real review im playing it right now and got most of my guys to level 20 but yeaits a grind and i thought there was a main plot but nothing yet its just level this guy to level 2124 to unlock the next chapter of his story and then you need to do the same for your 7 other characters to continue their story im slowly starting to get uninterested if you want less encounters get cyrus after you learn 4 of his skills he will get his first support skill named evasive maneuvers which reduces the rate of random encounters helps a lot its disappointing seeing a game with such innovative and creative animation end up so shitty another fantastic video your excellency you have my like your dunkcellency i get that dunkey doesnt like rpgs especially anime ones but i dont feel like xenoblade 2 should be in last place for writing of all things if you dont like a lot of dialogue then sure the game isnt for you but xenoblade 2 tells a great story loved the video though still deciding on whether to actually get octopath blacker than ever this isnt bookworm adventures deluxe great octoboye tubular review donker play bookworm adventures deluxe your excellency im sorry to say it dunk but this review is a piece of shit first you werent even bothering to show the break mechanic with enough strategy and planning you can beat any random encounter without taking a single hit which makes them all thrilling and fascinating you dont even bother trying any of your other weapons on that snail secondly i adore the writing in this game ophilia is a scared girl who was taken in and slowly left her shell her leaving to strike out on her own was heartwarming and fascinating thirdly so far i have never had to grind a single time did you even play the game finally i would encourage you to remember your video about game critics you said that you didnt like jrpgs and praised games that do them differently from that context are you a good judge of rpgs that embrace the classic desigb philosophy while subtly injecting new and fascinating mechanics into them should we listen to you then octopath traveler is legitimately the best gam damn im early better make a redundant videogamedunkey quote from the video that everyone has heard were going to aruba dunkey your excellency play bookworm adventures your excellency what grinding im wrapping up every characters 3rd chapter and i havent had to grind a bit and not a single companion was an octopus some jrpg 210 dunkey i agree completely why everybody givin scores to bookworm adventures deluxe this reminds me of that time donkey beat ski in smash its not the best game out there for sure but the music and art are beautiful and i give it the credit it deserves for that it is a clich after clich of course it is but its a game that old jrpg fans could really love its not meant for everyone reggie doesnt have the shine he used to have i mean dunkey i love ya but this game has everything youve said you dont like gameplaywise said yourself in your game critics video why even review this yes a review from you saying persona 5 is good definitely shows its appeal but a review from you saying an rpg doesnt fit your tastes honestly doesnt mean a great deal and you yourself basically admitted that and that battle example youre supposed to abuse weaknesses in order to beat the enemies quickly you specifically took olberic all the way to the riverlands a route which would have you recruit at least one party member primrose or cyrus that can dominate that slug and break its shield unless you a decided to not put them in your party or b purposely skipped them its kind of deceptive its no knack 2 though octoexcellency traveller your excellency youre that ninja review hyper light drifter reggie was too busy on the battlebus to focus on octopath octopath more like octodissapointment finally ok but the art style looks great tho stop it with the fucking mario in everything dunkey is this game really that bad or is he being sarcastic due to bubbas trick dont you fucking do that to xenoblade 4 seconds in let me stop right here to note dunkey doesnt like jrpgs alright lets watch the rest of the video yeah thats pretty much what i expected dunkey shits on the genre i grew up with and love whats new dunkey i mean your excellency with all do respect your excellency this game is just another bookworm adventures clone you of all people should know that no rpg can surpass bookworm adventures its like comparing pancakes to waffles one of those will hold the butter and syrup the other wont dunkey u r the best i will never become tierd of ur videos u r the best videogame reviewer on youtube pls do more videos octopath the pathiest travel this isnt bookworm adventures i still dont understand how to this day there is not a single rpg that i know of that has taken earthbounds amazing solution to random encounters if your over leveled they just disintegrate before the fight and if you can outrun enemies you dont have to fight them the second one isnt that uncommon its just another good mechanic yeah but does this game really make you feel like youre ice knack i think not man if only this was as good as bookworm adventure your excellency you dislike turn based combat and random encounters i think i like you more now your excellency i 34216th beat that dont drop your exel and sea where is our dunkey jrpg your excellency e having to hear your excellency must be some form of torture i definitely agree with some of the complaints about this game mainly the dialogue and the fact that we have to maintain several stories at the same time that areso far im only on chapter 2 not connected but i still really enjoy this game ive always been a fan of turn based rpgs and random encounters but it isnt a game type that im always looking to play games like this are something i use as a casual getaway from fps and other types of games that i play on a regular basis fire emblem meets your excellency octopath is played by people who never been to chuckecheez i respect your opinions dunkey even though i love this game i like turn based combat though so the grind isnt as bad to me the story elements are a bit disappointing but the music environments and rpg elements really sell this game for me you gave it a chance knowing you hate turn based combat and random encounters and i respect that i have 5 hours in this game so far ive encountered tressa cyrus and ophillia and honestly i think its a shame that dunko didnt mention the amazing visuals and music on the gameplay i mean most jrpgs are with random encounters and sometimes cheesy voice acting so its kind of something you would sign up for when you buy the game however i do agree it is a little awkward going through all the chapter 1 stories for all the characters disjointed like this is just a cover up for the knacks true form knack rpg baby your excellency bookworm adventures octoknack traveller babyyyyy finally someone had the balls to say it dunkey have you played divinity original sin 2 its great maybe a game you will finally enjoy this game will never get into ikon clan shit phew saved me 60 edit cheers for that new dunkey video anddddd click your excellency is the new desu i cant believe you copy gameranx who copied someone else unbelievable everything that haves bookworm adventure on it 100000000000 likes you should play bookworm adventures your excellency should have had more knack this is a rip off of bookwork adventures i was actually into the octopath demo but i cant tell if octopath traveler is a good game if dunkey said so everyone else says its great help a way better game to play would be bookworm adventures soild game also great video dunkey your excellency i trust your opinion on this game ive been thinking about buying this game since pretty much all reviews have been giving it amazing scores but i trust you most out of all reviewers i dont like this game either lacks something to me in every department oh no i was looking forward to this game this game really makes you feel like octodad i prefer hexapath traveller hmm short and sweet visually though looks awesome awww really had high hopes for this game i really loved octopath i thought each character was neat and interesting enough and i like rpgs just because you hate turn based combat and stuff doesnt mean that your opinion should be standard for everyone if you said at the beginning that you just dont like that would be fine but you act like its bad just because its not for you octoworm traveler adventures man splatoon 3 came out already this must be that fah harbah hospitality and why the fuuuk does every friggin jrpg with voice acting still sound like a bad anime dub its like jrpg devs are stuck in 1995 and still employs the same shitty actors year after year after year even the lowest budget indie titles manages to have better dialogue and voice acting ffs are they getting scammed by a bunch of shitty actors and dubbing firms with large cvsof shitty anime and jrpgs how the hell does this keep happening add subtitles pls dunkey called it and thats why you play japanese games in japanese voice your excellency i hope to see a chrono trigger review form you s soon yeah this game looked super bland yay another video d your excellency your excellency your excellency shadow moses hind d octopath sure but the real question is where is bookworm adventures deluxe dunkey you obviously dont like jrpgs like lmfao all your critics could be made about any of the games you first mentioned and disliking random encounters alone obviously means you dont like jrpgs think ill save my money and buy bubsy 3d instead anime for gays your excellency this video really shows dunkeys excellency need to rename channel to nintendunkey incoming salty weebs have you ever played bowsers inside story gotta be the best turn based rpg ive ever played the royal penis is clean your excellency this is the dark souls of excellency octopath failure the new fire emblem looks great always hurts when dunkey proves a game that i love is trash last time i was this early mario was a new game gasp super mario odyssey dlc oh what the fu im really glad im not the only one who thinks these random encounter grind rpgs are shit i thought it was gonna be about bubsy 4d the chipwrecked squeakuel well looks like i wont be buying the game after all thank you random encounters are terrible basically first comment this video reminds me of that time octopath traveller beat knack 2 at bookworms adventuresdeluxe waluigi edition octoknack traveler 1000th or something idk it was a minute ago its nice to hear legitimate gripes with this game since all ive heard about it that it is this masterpiece of an rpg we need more dunkviews my man come back in 10 years youve already said youre not a big fan of jrpgs this games a tribute to the snes era of games while i dont agree with you i can still respect your opinion this reminds me of the time that his excellency beat sky in smash huh the game looked pretty promising actually unsure what i expected horrible game ive enjoyed my fair share of some tropey turn based games but your right the story telling in them is mostly horrendous and a lot of forum nerds lose their minds over the so called character progression and writing its embarrassing the game even looks like its made out of cardboard to match the writing is this a promotion or a dunkey video danm i dont agree with dunkey about turn based but that is not a good review reggie aint getting any of my spaghetti as a huge fan of jrpgs i can safely say that it really hasnt grabbed me yet combat isnt fun enough to grind constantlyprobably gonna force my way through it excellency doesnt sound like a word any more knack 2 game of the year babyy whats the pokmon meets inception game dunkey this game was advertised as something you literally stated that you would not enjoy why would you bother even playing it 010 not enough of octodad i mean 8 characters are pretty cool now having 9 characters would have been a completely different fucking story regigigas really fucked this one up great video your excellency octopath traveler really makes you feel like an excellency random encounters and turn based combat with 8 characters and your excellency basically octopath traveler yes but whatabout octoknack dunkeythe number one excellency doesnt really make sensejust roll with itd the game seemed interesting tbh but then i realized its a turn based rpg with pixel graphics from square enix based from a medieval era of course its gonna be bland fair points i personally enjoy the return to form with turn based rpgs with wide stories and find some of the characters genuinely interesting but everyone is allowed there opinion and not enjoying the time for the game to pick up the pace is a completely fair criticism to have and the video presents your criticisms in a fun way another great video mr dunkey of the video games welp was thinking about trying to get into jrpgs through this glad the dunk saved me the trouble your exceldunkey but hey it looks nice welp a video in which i dont agree with dunkey i cant say i saw that coming i love the knights story and the dancers do mars bars i did get this game and although i havent played much of it im not sure i like it i got captain toad on the same day and i think it says something that i always play that instead another great video from my main man dunk its so crazy to be caught in this war of games between reggie and tom clancy damn i was hoping for something like bravely default and bravley second btw if you do see this dunkey could you check those 2 games out psycho mantis your excellency yay i stop listening to dunkey after he said octopath traveler was bad this game also has nothing to do with octopusses holy shit that looks pretty though m e h m e h m e h videogamedunkey you are seriously the best channel on youtube videogamedunkey my excellency edit my excellency but your excellency wonder what dunkey will say about the new kindom of heart thats an unreasonably pretty game tho blewit5 thats a new one dunkey if youre reading this please do the same thing i immediately did when the game let me pause it turn the voices to japanese then turn the voice volume down to 0 all cringe is forever buried now honestly this should be common knowledge with any jrpg the english voice acting will always be garbage at the absolute best this is what happens when people who made the game tenchu attempt to make an rpg square enix needs to stop making rpgs squaresoft is dead sad that this game cant even come close to rivaling anything squaresoft has made in the past yeah reggie what the heck dunkey should play deaths gambit it seems interesting enough to look like terraria youre first mistake was not using the japanese voices and also its pretty easy to just escape from wild encounters so true these old ff titels just get ruined by the aweful combat you have to sit trough in order to get to the interesting bits yall mind if i hit that e x c e l l e n c y i played it for 9 hours and after all of that i just realised i could have bought 4 games thatd be so much better rather than a turn based game full of random shit im really hoping nintendo can pull some new mario shit or zelda shit or even whip out metroid prime 4 soon or im gonna lose hope the only title im excited for apart from smash is the king of cards dlc for shovel knight id give octopath a 25 the voice acting is good and the graphics are decent for a game like this but when it comes to gameplay boss fights and the stories it just flops i would not recommend this game something like stardew or shovel knight or even wizard of legend is much cheaper and 5 times as fun at least you could say this is a good video almost as good as bookworm adventures deluxe your excellency i was personally really excited to play this game your excellency but your excellency despite his excellencys criticisms ill still likely get it your excellency play bookworm adventures please thank you for the information your excellency turnbased combat is doodie this doesnt even compare to a masterpiece such as knack bookworm adventures deluxe your excellency edition your excellency where is bookworms adventure deluxe dunkey i love you but you insulted xenoblade chronicles 2 that is a crime deserving of the death penalty this game is so fucking good octo how many times will they use why is nintendo so obsessed with the number 8 i cant wait for the sequel squidpath traveler donkey whyd you have to go and break my heart coming from someone who said he didnt enjoy turnbased games what the fuck were you expecting octopath more like octotrash now since i made a funny comment give me likes i cant figure out if this video was full of sarcasm or not your excellency this is a great video your excellency but your excellency when will you talk about bookworm adventures first off put voice to japanese much better and less annoying second this game isnt for everyone but i respek that opinonion but the japanese seem to love it kicked into a pit of spikes and shot with a bazooka i havent heard bazooka in years so i guess this game is meh meh meh meh ive been disappointed that this game isnt that good it had everything going for it ya gettin close to 5m subs dinkle why anyone would need that many sandwiches is beyond me dunkey can you make a vdeo of a hat in time i mean youre right about the interactions between the characters but the combat is fast enough to make it fun enough to go along with and the music is really good thanks dunkey youve just literally stopped me from buying it visuals are very nice and kinda reminds me of chrono trigger style but i was afraid about exactly everything youve mentioned i enjoyed the theme of the art anyone elses mom call you you say yeah then she dont say anything it infuriates me to no end i guess dunkeys not too big on jrpgs hmmmmmmm thats alot of damage i wonder how you would feel about tales of berseria octopath backwards is spaghetti and meatballs you should try ara fall yeah i agree i feel like games trying to emulate older styles of games should only use the stuff that was good about them and insert new ideas while throwing away the stuff nobody likedthis is why imo shovel knight is the most successful of these type of games i love this game thank you for another great review videgameexcellency the most cutting part of this review is that its 3m long dunkey dident even have that much to say about itits just eh i think ill just stick with bookworm adventure octo dunk does that mean octo expansion is confirmed for a dunkey review take a shot everytime she says your excellency man jrpg lovers are going to be so mad at this video i bet this will be a donkey top 10 game of the year in 2023 first review i really disagree with if you know what youre doing leveling up is quick and easy the stories seem interesting to me as well except ophilia hers is boring af im having fun with the game would recommend to those with jrpg experience was thinking of getting this game glad you did a video just giving a general gist of what its like its not for everybody its a beautiful piece of nostalgia beautiful to look at that is aww and ive been wanting to play it but i guess its not worth it they really made the bookworm adventures deluxe of jrpgs imma be real i love this game but he right the story is written by the bubsy 3d writers octoworm adventures delux dammit the spoog r the woog kno wut im saying dunkey you are my excellency legit thought i was the only one who felt this way about octopath i poisoned my neighbors cat first you roast splatoon then you roast xenoblade now octopath dunky i cant let you get away with this these games are sacred if this guy is a youtuber im batman god damn i was excited to play this since there was a lot of hype but i hate everything about what you just showed just lie to me next time haha good shit mang i love random encounters fight me thank you for the different opinion i personally find it great but its nice to hear a different opinion about this game dunky is never critical of ninten oh i feel like the random encounters are a nice touch in the fallout series a dvd copy of shark tale at it again you blew it reggie what next your excellency this is a baby game this game is made for babies if knack 2 is a good sequal why isnt there a knack 2 2 youre not dunkey dunkey hates 1 turnbased combat 2 anime 3 rpgs i love this game but this video is hilarious the nintendo bots will love this xd dunkey is my excellency as a fan of classical mythology and jungian psychology it would be awesome if dunkey reviews persona 5 turn based combat random encounters dumb dialog boring storytelling ugly pixel look boring characters seems like we have the game of the year 2018 folks gotta disagree loving this game man im surprised this game got loads of positive feedback i thought oh well the demo was fun i used the knowledgeable book guy pretty game although i only played the demo we know u dont like jrpgs so youre judging it on story but i guess this is a nintendo game you had to review it eksdee god she said your excellency so much it sounded like his name favorite moment of e3 by far reggie and finallya certain title i know youve been waiting for octopath traveler is a this makes me sad this game is great i wanna get this game but most the time i hate turn based combat honestly pokmon is the only random encounter i can withstand because you can actually choose to catch them and use them later or in some cases avoid it in general with a repel or super repel another thing is the fact that in octopath when i played the mansion mission with therion it felt so wrong its supposed to be a sneak mission yet theres no guards to sneak past the turn based combat does feel good and honestly i dont mind the cheesy story because thats what i like in my jrpg its the random encounter system that honestly turned me off from it shame i thought it was gonna be another final fantasy crystal chronicles ring of fate will always be my favorite final fantasy game your excellency is this dis aint bookworm ur excellency dunkey wouldnt understand this game because he is black thank you i heard everybody raving about this game and my first thought was wait until dunkeys video if anybody is going to be critical about an rpg it would be you bruuuh im all for the jokes but you cant take points away from a game because they make you think if you are having trouble with that snail this game isnt for you hordes of enemies can be dispatched in a minute if you know what you are doing people are going mad for this game but to me it is exactly like the other hundred or so jrpgs just with a 3d background to it why would people be tricked into buying this turd no thanks dunkey is my excellency hey they actually do interact with each other during certain events if you have certain people in your party at a certain time im sorry dunkey i love you but every viewer knows that you are not the best guy at judging rpg because you hate turn based combat even if your opinion is valid on the story we already know that you hate turn based combat so that the chances that you like the game are low can u pls go back to doing league videos pls inb4 he gets cruscified for having an opinion this game is a knack 2 out of 5 knack 2 5 good vid dunkey honestly everyone was saying this was good idea reggie should make knack but its bookworm adventure on the switch octodad the jrpg its about his now fully grown children your exceldunkey i so this has nothing to do with splatoon your excellencyyoure that ninja why dont they just do an option to turn off random encounters like in their previous game bravely default damn dunkey really doesnt like jrpgs huh do the dab they should have done it knack 2 style keep in mind hes not the biggest fan of rpgs or grinding i still found the game enjoyable and i thought the usage of the tropes were well done because while the stories are generic there are plenty of moments where they are aware of this and subvert it also the characters do interact but its optional and the notifications are not very obvious and only happens at certain events an rpg where knack meets wreck it ralph get on it reggie up until this video i thought octopath traveler was the name of the dlc for splatoon damn dunk made an entire video just to trash this one game usually it takes the dunk a week or two to put out a video i thought this time around he would actually say nice things since its been a couple of days since the last video just damnn dunkey your excellency great humor as always bookworm adventures when get them outta here as someone who loves the game its completely obvious that you took a very negative approach when going into the story you didnt even talk about the combat and its ability to make every battle different literally when showing a level 1 enemy which is actually along the lines of a level 11 enemy in regards to your level and the area you showed nothing that actually shines in the combat despite the fact that you could have easily done so i love you dunko but this video was too onesided to be engaging its stupid to have jrpg as a label of its own they are rpgs nothing quite sets them apart besides where they come from especially when most rpgs come from japan ya blew it reggy itd be great if they either cut every enemies hp by like 1520 andor increased the expmoney yielded from fights by a similar percentage way too grindy for a game with so many characters to level up and fully equip i was gonna buy for nostalgias sake but dunk just saved me some money and im sure hours of disappointment i didnt like this game as much as everyone elseso im glad someone shares my opinions but tha graphics your dunkcellency my favorite persona 5 character is ryuji cob i am genuinely sorry that you had to play this game totally agree everyone and his mom is going crazy for this game which is just a nostalgia piece without a cohesive narrative and everything is padded with tons and tons of stupid grinding did you enjoy fight this enemy please do it 20 more times nintendo cant no wrong this video has a lot of excellency thank you for this video your excellency also the price tag is this the prequel to bubber ducky octodad killing shrimp so weird seeing only 81 views on a dunkey video 547th comment no tiddies or nuthin i am no knight ima man who kills for revenge octopath traveller more like hentai journey your opinion is wrong your excellency dunkey we need more pokmon pokmon go was a good video but we want something about the actual games reggie voice the game is not fun if its fun why bother if you dont like random encounters and turn based combat dont play a turn based rpg with random encounters lmao is this game still worth it or no finley please address your hugely deformed scrotumthanks this reminds me of that one time your excellency beat sky in smash but your excellency this video was excellency so the copy of shark tales made an octopus game strangely fitting jrpgs take a very special kind of person i am just not that type of person anymore xenoblade 2 showed me that i havent dropped a game so hard or fast in a long time i think they are for a younger crowd that can get lost in the world or are more susceptible to that special type of japanese melodrama or the older types who get a strong sense of nostalgia from them ill probably still check it out but this is interesting to see but dunk have you heard of the ban on bofa but is it better than spiderman 3 honestly the only game review i watch but for my money i think that fantastic mr fox was the real bad guy all along take a shot everytime you hear your excellency xd this game pales in comparison to bookworm adventures deluxe i guess dunkey didnt get far enough the characters do interact with each other haha i love octopath traveler i should had expected that critic love you dunkey stay as you are dunkey said bad things about game i like grrr i kinda knew what to expect with this one since dunkey hates most turn based rpgs but i mean hey to each their own completely agree about the storycharacters nowadays the only thing thatll willingly make me sit through turn based combat is great narrative which this game seems to lack rip dunkey he died of sugma today shit im early looks great though thats right dungus super mario bros 2 stays game of the year once again baybeeee i like this game so im kind of upset graphics so good they could be a minecraft shader mod cant wait for octodad to be in smash 5 wheres your add medication dunko damn i really tought you were going to say i was joking at the end or something ive been enjoying the hell out of this game it may be the first time i disagree with you and that splatoon one too now that i think about it dunkey your excellency but we all know duckeys stance on turn based combat in general so its still an exellent game i like the idea that reggie is behind every single switch game octopath traveler is my favorite video on hentaifoundry well this sounds bad and allbut you gotta admit the game looks amazing just wait for kh3 like an anime fan on prom night really surprised you didnt touch on the visuals thanks for the upload your excellency look i know you always troll in your reviews blah blah blah but is it actually garbage i never played so idk but can anyone give an answer im still waiting for knack 3 baybee who forced my man jason to play this shit i really wanted to like this game but it wasnt that good i love when we first saw this game octopath traveler was a placeholder name but they never got around to changing it in the final release this was an amazing video your excellency make i hate mars bars great video your excellency but dunkey mabey some people like this but seriously it looks fucking amazing it was one of the reasons i wanted to get it but i never had the time to therell be bookworm comments for at least another month knack 2 aint got shit on this game i give this video an 8 this is a weird sequel to octodad hey dunko theres a really cool roguelite kinda like enter the gungeon called streets of rogue check it out plz only took 2 seconds of persona 5 being on screen to make me wanna play it again i was hoping someone who has taste would come out and say how absolute horse shit this game is nintendo should instead focus on a port of knack 2 baby to the switch pilots license what for thought this video was excellency want to play a good rpg on switch get west of loathing no random encounters either come on nintendo your excellency psycho mantis dunkeys my excellency i really liked random encounter games where they autokill things that are obviously way too easy for your level wow this seems like a truly awful game unlike bookworm adventures deluxe however now that is a masterpiece regie is scared once again octoknack traveler so its basically bookworm adventures octopaaaaath nobody expects a thing first the game got hyped a lot its just another rpg that cant surpass older rpgs mmmm finally more dunkaroos octodeath rpgstory 210 not enough excellency i dont know about you guys but i dont think the dunkster likes jrpgs not a single game you showed was an rpg at least the music and visuals are nice sad that the game isnt as good as i thought it would be 8 anyway great video your dunkcellency anything that includes daffy duck ill play bookworms adventure deluxe edition looks amazing damn i really thought this would be a good game wow the first bad review of octopath ive seen i can certainly see why it wouldnt be someones cup of tea though really i know its annoying when ophilia talks like that but shes not bad you see she does finally call him father but i admit i wished they interacted more but ive only seen the first few chapters you probably didnt finish any second chapters they do interact get to their second chapters

thank you dunkey very cool here since 188th comment cuz im a god damn jabroni i was actually really excited about this game at first cause i read it as ocotpus traveller and thought it was about

game and i get the notification its 5am jason please let me sleep i love persona 5 as its the only rpg that ive been able to play through twice putting hundreds of hours into the game but the rest of them are so boring and bogged down by unneeded content that it kills them for me reminds me about the time where smash beat sky in dunkey dunkey basically owns knack by now octopass traveler and

loving the more frequent uploads my dunk psycho mantis bear do a pokemon review pls i thought octopath was an octodad rpg finally your excellency this isnt book worm adventure deluxe notice me dunkey cucked first mane first hey bois where hell u can see the enemy hp 2045 when the switchs battery dies in goes into a forced powersave sleep mode so you dont lose your data it just suspends it until you charge it lasts a while too so its not a big deal to have it die on you in the middle of something ahahah its pretty funny that ophelias voice actress is the same as yings in paladins both characters are healers the world map is ridiculous seriously fingers crossed for a ps4 release will all these games support cloud saves once the onlineservice hits all this is is a merger of two great classics zelda link to the past and final fantasy 7 with a few tweaks not impressed at all surprised to see dan on this still but i think the goof ball did a great job 3 this is the game thatll make me go down to the store tomorrow to pick up a switch game seems good i think the unique graphical style might be what puts some people off so when is dan playing persona 5 now that he has surrendered his soul to anime he has no excuses left im not impressed with this kind of 16 bits graphic quick look nice job with the quicklook dan definitely will pick this up after watching this can we turn off voice acting please bring this to ps4 squeenix dan ryckert is the kind of lovable idiot that needs to be in qa for video games o philia c yrus t ressa o lberic p rimrose a lfyn t herion h aanit travelers this looks so complicated i feel stressed already maybe ill wait until fallwinter to get this so im not locked in my house for the rest of summer in between work so hows the voice acting well im pretty sure colonel campbells in it so its aaaaaaaalright i love you dan man i had heard the thing about no overarching story stuff and very little intercharacter dialogue but i had hoped that the standalone stories of each character would be good enough to eclipse that i sure hope thats the case because mechanically this game is checking off every box for me i dont mind a bunch of short stories as long as theyre solid its still weird to me seeing people say this game looks good visually im not a jrpg person so i cant speak to the gameplay the pixel sprites mixed with plugandplay unity asset store shaders looks so ugly when did capture a monster and use them in battle become pokemon and not blue mages i love the look of this game this is a game that i though we would get more of by now there have been a lot of pixel art games that looked 8 or 16bit this is one of the few games that looks 32bit like it belonged on a playstation 1 if only dan could think this strategically when playing xcom i started with therion and then haanit was my second pickup in the demo and i had to switch the audio to japanese because between therions smugness and haanits olde tyme talkeing i couldnt take listening to them 1101 guess they never played grandia 1 man thats a good game i mean aside from the voice acting and some cheesy dialogue but the battle system and character progression systems more than make up for it anyway shame octopath traveler isnt on pc amazon will be bringing this to me tomorrow looks awesome i still love turn based rpgs a whole lot and if this one have an interesting story and good mechanics then its for me ill buy it for sure once i get my switch later this year this game has great art i meanfrom what ive played the characters can steal lead blindly seduce set wild animals on randomly beat up interrogatevinny might be right in that they are the bad guys dan totally lucked out on octo originating from greek theres no way he really knew actual ot thoughts even if this is a really good one of those no chance im paying 60 for a 16bit style jrpg many other games of similar style and quality have been released at a 30 price point for years now day one loved the demo if you say no i dont want to see this other characters prologue i assume you can go through it in the future still on the same save any chance for a ps4 port dans answer to most the questions umm im not to sure about that i liked the gameplay in the demo but i thought the story was terrible cannot will not play new games with random encounters leave it in the past speaking as someone who misses those old school final fantasy games this looks perfect for me definitely a day 1 buy no overarching story that ties everyone together is a bit of a disappointment sure but not a deal breaker for me side note dug out my psp to download final fantasy vii and ix and play those on the go download speeds on it is abysmal downloading spyro 3 while its out its 340mb says its gonna take 20 minutes the fuck meanwhile my ps4 and xbox one can download well over a gig in that time im hearing disparate things about this gamebad story is sort of a killing blow for any rpg to me but holy shit this game looks so good and i want to love it been there done that a thousand times before as i started the video i was about to say do i even need to watch this to know dan hates this and then he said he liked it dan did an awesome job on this ql that dog fucking lifts lol a surprise to see dan being the one playing this but a welcome one anyone else not able to reach the main site no overarching story is a huge turn off why not just make a classic jrpg instead of this almost gimmicky setup daaaaave the website this games going to be a classic cant decide whether or not to pick this up 11727 kinda had me choked up a bit there so wholesome its a 1100336666 chance to succeed a 3 steal on the 36th try 3238 does this still work on switch cuz it doesnt for me see he mentioned this game was sort of a spiritual successor to bravely default but not that bravely default was a spiritual successor to 4 heroes of light the og 2312 hashtag octothorpe ie got a good laugh out of that love the speedrun also inspired me to also do my own thank you d that 3 percent steal doe i wonder what hes doing to never get encountered losing 5 minutes and 20 sconds to the 3 almost at the end of the game ah a wonderful game to speedrun just saying mattias is the hardest chapter 4 boss in the game i was 15 levels over leveled screwed up for one turn and almost died why all the alfyn hate they are playing for doctors without borders that is literally what he is trying to do for his story how is he hitting 5400 without a doubt the best sgdq run i have seen in recent memory this was simply a joy to watch that first try 3 was my favorite thanks for doing this it was a treat kirbopher did a voice in this game come a long way since tome haha never would have guessed beautiful ending good job guys it was far from perfect in speed but 1010 fpr entertainment yo so is there a speedrun reason why alfyn is so disliked or do they personally just not like him hes my fav character so im just curious its so weird hearing the characters speak i turned voices off the second i started the game this man tried to steal from me over 50 times but he has good reputation in town so i guess i will trust him this game is probably my favorite game of all time so its amazing to see a speedrun of it finally also tressa is the best character change my mind not the 3 we want but the 3 we dont need good dog a happy mutt with not a care in the world he is a good dogbut to be fair all dogs are good dogs and a pox upon he who dares to say otherwise can someone explain to me the storymeme about altabiscuit and the whole pizza roll vs bagel bites debate i personally am a bagel bites type of guy for its texture and semblance to real pizza but i love pizza rolls for the shear quantity that they put in the 90 piece bag and how much i could eat in one sitting lol awesome run by a very likable runner with great commentary it doesnt get much better than this great run makes me want to try running it i love how in all the ot runs at gdq so far theres been someone in the background shouting out quotes that was such a great memorable run where do you pet the dog 4830 the best moment in the speedrun this run was a treat to watch from the first try optional 3 to the crowd shouting out lines this run was a blast from start to finish also screw darius runner introduction starts at 0045 run starts at 0122 couch commentary is provided by mamgar ouro and archariat sgrunt is host this is an octopath traveler spinoff that is set to release in japan first i wanted to talk more about the octopath traveler ip appearing on something other than the switch and why square would be doing it and how they could adapt the gameplay to be a free to play game on phones ill talk more about the actual game in a news wave later on thanks when does this release is it still worth to buy octopath traveler dayum was hoping for a full game and a decent port games like octopath is what android needs its sp game means best mobile game genre judging by the trailer and screenshots they had to remove bokeh depth of field in order to port it to smartphones which its a shame as in my opinion its one of the main reasons the game looks so beautiful but makes sense considering ue4 doesnt support that feature on smartphones they need to make the mobile version global i loved the main game i hope the next game at least comes to steam square has been good at no leaving other platforms out lately would hate to see the next game only on switch again only newbs and posers hate mobile gaming real gamers play games everywhere they can pc console mobile it doesnt matter ive literally 100 this game and got the secret ending probably one of the best games on switch and well worth the purchase there is also the very likely chance that their next console game is a version of bravery default for consoles either a port or a sequel but that still seems to eye their pet franchise and i doubt they will let it go yet hd sprite remake for final fantasy vi andor chrono trigger on the switch and ps4 please bust a critical nut enough with the microtransactions i wish they would just port the game to the ps4 and or pc i am not surprised a squareenix ip is heading towards mobile japan seems to have a very onthego type of culture and space comes at a premium for people living in its urban environments thats interesting a lot of people are already saying that its a prequel but its also worth mentioning the octopath traveller switch game is published by nintendo making it a switch exclusive the ip isnt exclusive but that particular game is lol yall sound disappointed seems like click bait here telling people that octopath its coming to mobile phones why it should be nintendo game like fe or others on mobile theyll sell characters some of those arent from the original game you didnt play the game on switch did you i say that because you wouldve notice that the characters are not the same lol this is a spin off the nintendo switch game is an exclusive and cant be legaly ported to cell phone use bewildering grace for rng grinding i told people that it was going to another platform lol id like to see octopath traveler become a multiplatform franchise nintendo has plenty of draw to the switch without needing this as an exclusive and frankly the worlds a better place when more people can play this beautiful gem of a game dmc5 is censored on ps4 so just know that when choosing where to buy if this is a prequel then i have to be frank here they could have made it as a dlc or just put it on switch then again square enix has been pretty glued to mobile games for a while why cant they just leave off i know its business totally but somethings are just best off not being ftp ot was a big deal for me personally classic gameplay with modern aesthetics the intro music took me back to my childhood its beautiful the whole experience just was so emotive for me enjoy every single minute of op and will instantly buy the sequel i dont mind ftp stuff love pso2sega mobile stuff for example but this to me is a step too far prequel or not squeenix think it through ftp something else anything else except ffvii lol but ot is not loved its beloved so if you ftp you risk triggering those deep feelings or something console switch oh god i was so scarred now i see that it will be f2p i would regret buying switch if that would come to android so this will be shitty version of masterpiece d first game im buying when i decide to get a switch cool video tech talk spawn wave damn japan only i wouldnt buy it on switch but i will get it on mobile i remember when the sequel to epic mickey went multi platform failed and shut the company down exclusive that can run on a phonecorrection timed exclusivelol if this comes out in english and its microtransactions arent absolutely necessary i would totally get this the ps5 will probably be out before another octopath game is ready they are going the final fantasy brave exvius route unfortunately they do a bad lazy job at optimizing the game for mobile i hope they get a better development team for octopath i love brave exvius though and i will always support square but they should optimize their games i want octopath on pc please square enix i am excited to hear the ip is coming to the mobile market i would have loved the port as you suggested unfortunately well have to settle with a f2p prequel i guess hi jon could you please fix the title to new ot game or something this video is going to continue to confuse people late 2020 just before the next gen consoles comes out i willing to be my hat that playstation 5 comes out early next year xbox i got no idea but tbh i wouldnt be surprised if it comes out this year you dont need to release holiday its just stupid you can never meet demand anyway if youre sony so its better to just release it a bit before and then have it in stock for the holidays its basically like a 2nd launch for free i think you should change the title add in annotations or replace this video to avoid the spread of misinformation that the switchs octopath traveler is heading to cell phones since your title octopath traveler heads to cell phones and a new game for consoles confirmed and content does make it sound like switchs octopath traveler is heading to cell phones when its a new game prequel i have played octopath for 120hrs the gate of finis change the title john it is confusing the viewers just look at a few comments i know the click bait is better but this might trigger people when they hear its a free to play octopath when in reality is a new game specifically made for phones typical move just wanting to move a franchise to mobile to make money off of micro transactions from casuals who love to be nickel n dimed fix your title it was pretty clickbaiting and disgusting not only is it a spinoff and not a port but you can definitely tell the massive downgrade on visuals some scenery looks almost flat like a wall seems like they tried to replicate what they achieved on ue4 on unity yo this is kinda disrespectful i thought square had a switch exclusive team what game would they be working on if its not another octopath traveller style game a little off topic but its interesting i tried to find that game bravely archive even though it was released late last year theres no sign of it just months later was it that unsuccessful or did squeenix just pull it down for seemingly unknown reasons your idea of cell phone games is so stuck back in the candy crush days lol it will be a gacha focus game the way it has 8 characters in a screen means you get to draw a lot of characters whether it will be like fgo which each artwork represents one specific character or cosmetic focus like azurlane is left to question i would assume its more fgo like though you spend money on new characters bringing new dynamics to the composition of your team with events and collaborations bringing in new limited characters every one or two months i wont hold up any hope for any se mobile games anyway most of them dont last more than a year especially for octopath traveler the combat screen combined with new characters dynamic would not be much different from other titles that are so done to death already in mobile market and i doubt it can attract attention anywhere near games like princess connect not to mention fgo free to play is garbage i assume the microtransactions will be like the final fantasy brave exvius where you buy chances to unlock characters which i hated so much that i ended up quiting it 40 attempts to get 2b and didnt get 2b and 40 attempts to get sepiroth and didnt get so yeah i gave up with that game ah yes a gacha game still waiting for fire emblem heroes global release i want this game so bad switch version you start with one character and need to buy the others why not the official game and premium tag instead of gambling mtx shit it was pretty clear to me that you meant the octopath traveler ip is going to mobile not the actual octopath traveler game not sure where all the confusion is coming from you should probably change the title of your video what if they use this 2d hd method to remake older sprite based rpgs instead of the polygonal remakes of ff3 ff4 on the ds man this is awesome spin off or not itll be great to play octopath on my ipad which has a much larger and better screen than the switch im pretty sure the ipad 11 inch pro is much more powerful than the switch even i already have octopath on my switch so i wont get it on my phone for once woah really square enix one of the largest video game developers and publishers have another game in development for consoles colour me not surprised in the slightest octopus travelerofficial troll account whoa microtransactions i will definitely not be playing it then moves like this makes you wonder why even own the exclusive console to play this games i know is not the switch game port is a new game but if this game gona have the same gameplay as the switch version and is free to play then why even bother to own a switch to play a game that was exclusive to the console i didnt get on the switch so i may give it a try is free play anyway and spend no money on it lol thks hm hope this prequel is on consoles too not huge into phone games i regret buying octopath on the switch i finished chapter 3 on most of the characters but i just didnt like the story an how they are layer out for each character its so repetitive go to this town talk to that person an enemy appears find that enemy etc it was way too predictable they used the same formula on all the characters so yeah i didnt end up finishing the game cuz i just didnt care anymore i went back to ps1 jrpgs an others on pc the only thing thats good is the graphics for octopath traveler i wouldve preferred a traditional jrpg too i didnt like u just pick up the characters theres no story on how they became a group which is terrible here comes the bullshit from spawn wave you can tell hes butthurt that this didnt remain a nintendo exclusive nintendo is banking now lets be honest gosh i wish they would return to chrono only in my wildest dreams octopath traveler sucks can this game just fck off the writing is terrible and its just more jrpg trash octopath traveller mobile great another game i wont touch i hope this new phone game comes to the switch at some point new octopath game yes playstation and nintendo sure wouldnt count xbox in as of yet lots of jrpgs skip the platform due to low sales of japanese games and a small install base if anything id say pc before xbox not because ps4 has a higher install base doesnt mean it would sell more ive seen the same games on all platforms sell more on the switch the fact is some people like to play some games on a specific platform thats just how it is if they make another octopath i think they should make the graphics better i didnt like the blurry art style backgrounds bonus news wave lets hope it isnt as much of a disaster as khux make sense i buy game becomes free to play on the phone octopath travelers 2 with futuristic theme for switch damn was hoping it would be the switch version really good video jonsw putting octopath traveller on mobiles is a good move cuz it will generate more money for the studio i think the sequel or next game coming will probably stay on the switch cuz i think its the route they are happy too go down but i also dont mind if its a multiplat aswell cuz again that will get more eyes on the franchise and generate more funds too go towards more projects in the future i wonder if this spinoff will contribute to the lore considerably if so then ill just have to watch a summary of it also as for the new octopath 2 game i kinda hope it stays exclusive on switch it was a big deal when it released broke over 1 million units in a very short time and did a big job in filling in one of the dryer months of switchs 2018 library i would love for the title to remain exclusive to the switch we could really use some more exclusive 3rd party titles for the system just my hope though even if it doesnt stay on switch i get the feeling itll be like some of the most popular indigames and sell the best on switch for the love of god just finish a new bravely default i think i like that series more than even octopath having the ability to lower your encounter rate triumphs over any pretty 2d sprites it seems like you made this video without reading the article you have opened up on the screen this game is not octopath traveler this is a new game its a free to play mobile game spinoff prequel it is not a port of octopath traveler as for the 8 people in battle its not going to damage the balance in the game because it literally isnt the same game didnt you see that those arent the characters from the game in your screenshots chrono trigger remake to pull the other system users in eh the fact that every chacter was as cliche as you could get kinda hurt the game i hope this spin off has better writing and they dont bog the game too bad with micro transactions i know youve said its a port but its not its a prequel hey maybe this is a sign that this will be a new major squenix franchise at least i got the limited edition to be fair square does make some of the better mobile games im actually happy ppl other than switch owners will get to play it this game needs more exposure i dont really like mobile games but ill probably play this hopefully when the sequel comes out more ppl will be encouraged to buy it as a result i dont understand how people can grind in octopath traveler i was often overleveled without it what are you doing to be behind the curve unless you pick the scholar i honestly dont see how you can be missing so much xp and even then i think youd probably get enough as for the next hd2d game i would scream if we saw a livealive remake or sequel i kinda think this is dumb you spend 300 on a switch and 60 for the game i spend 100 for the collectors edition to play this exclusively just to have it ported to phones with more features like its dumb that they rather go off micro transactions on phones instead of actually making quality dlc for the switch i can tell you one thing they wont get a penny out of me i already bought the game games just keep going downhill with this phone shit rip octopath 20182018 i just dont want this situation to end up like diablo please dont abandon the console platform like diablo did for pc in favour of another where all you do is tap its okay if its a spinoff but not as a true successor spawn you have to correct yourself the game thats coming to phones is not the same game as the one thats on the switch its a prequel called octopath traveler champions of the continent oh come on only on phones they could have released ot on he switch too get your facts right even for this day i dont understand why people was so obsessed with octopath travelers in one point its became ridiculous yeah plot of the game was interesting and fresh compare to some final fantasy games same goes for gameplay its actually an enhance version of bravery default hd rumble was good sounds and music felt just fine but those blurred vision and corner shading were ridiculous and no one seems to notice it another important thing to mention is grind this game is hard like hell not really but sometimes its actually grab your ass offguard you will notice this on a first boss especially if you start with no combat class another time you will head to near town to buy new equipment and you head will explode seeing those unreal 30k for one piece of weapon yeah so its not that bad cause your probably already prepared for that grinding shit but those stunning unreal engine 4 144p visuals really blow my mind after seeing those reviews with 1010 c on one hand im very happy we get more octopath in general and a new game in the works sounds amazing on the other that just means we wont be getting bravely default news for quite a while if at all hope that octopath game comes to switch because if it doesnt itll end up like every other cell phone game i have downloaded but ignored im still trying to figure out who playes mobile games let alone pays actual money i mean non of my friends do and i havent dropped even one penny on any one of them and all the young people i know from the generation who should be playing them arent like theyre playing like minecraft maybeor doing things in real life not playing octopath traveller thats for sure what a waste octopath is an amazing game and now its being squandered i imagine theyll want to keep it switch exclusive nintendo helped a lot with the marketing of the game squares marketing and management isnt the best so i dont know how well it would go for them if they tried to put a sequel out without a bigger publisher backing the push so this just means the regular version of octopath is bound to come to pc and consoles meaning octopath isnt a switch exclusive anymore i always knew octopath was just a timed switch exclusive well i havent bought a cellphone game in years look like i will be im ok with ot goin multiplat as long as bravely 3 is exclusive to switch d the original final fantasy remakes in the octopath traveler style take my money woah i can finally play it i sincerely hope this wont ruin the young legacy of this wonderful franchise lets see where it goes this is actually really exciting i loved octopath for switch and its great to see them continuing the series really hoping it comes to us im not sure where you got the misinformation but the octopath game coming to phones is a prequel not the switch game just wanted to make sure people werent confused watch playeressence copy this video soon lol another beloved game getting butchered for an addicts cash its a new title the name of your video is extremely confusing and misleading honesty they did the same with bravely default so im not surprised a lesser game is coming to mobile for me personally octopath traveler is one of the best jrpgs ever up there with dragon quest etrian odyssey shin megami tensei and chrono trigger so much for the exclusive you all have phones right i thought this was coming to pc first but hey i knew this was bound to happen astral chain is next its coming to japan it says so why would we care its coming out i still want final fantasy tactics on switch dang dude what is it with my luck i buy assassins creed odyssey for 50 week after it goes down to 20 i buy octopath traveler a week later its on cellphones for free lol wtf lol i doubt the game is coming to any other platforms original ot simply because se could have put it on everything since the beginning like they did with i am setsuna this game might have some connection to nintendo with freedom to publish on phones like bravely default i had a feeling square enix was going to put out a mobile game or two to meet their operating income target im not bothered by this if they still plan to release a sequel for octopath traveler on console this video makes it sound like this is the same game as the switch version im not the biggest an of them going to mobile i like the switch having exclusives but it perfectly makes sence on why there doing it okay spawnjonbonjovi this isnt actually octopath traveler for switch this is a spinoff game apparently cover all the info please i dont think you mentioned that in this video let me do more work while im waiting to do more work swmedia 2019 not the same game it is a spin off very excited for the idea of more octopath traveler dont care about the mobile version but having another full console version sounds beautiful octopath traveler is easily my favorite jprg do you buy your games digital or physical well this was mildly surprising for me i hope that octopath mobile will live up to the quality that octopath 1 has but yeah i do agree that octopath 2 will come out on all platforms probably even phone again because of its remaining allure for investors h having to constantly switch out characters to share exp is bloody tedious its why im not super keen on ffx how much is sqeenix bleeding for money cool i wasted my money on the switch release fk you squareenix and fk cellphone freemium games this is pretty cool wtf octopath on phones i already have it with over 100 hours played on my switch woa thats cool i bet your excellency is excited i want to pick up octopath traveler but it wont be on a phone i feel a whale abusing system will be at play imma skip i learned my lesson on their other mobile games hey spawn i hope you cover the dmc v denuvo material in tomorrows newswave the difference in performance between the steam denuvo free version and the one with denuvo is pretty noticeable i think im more surprised that only 15 million units shipped with so many shortages upon release i expected a lot more but im assuming that doesnt include digital sales either i want them to do a new final fantasy tactics in the 2dhd wargroove confirmed for ios and android lol i think i must stress that this is not a port of the original game but a spin off i dont thinks is the same game the bravely default games on smartphones were spin off maybe the exclusive is still a exclusive but the franchise is gonna be is multiplatform ey hopefully for the people who play this octopath prequal on mobile enjoy it its a really good game amazing music and amazing art style im not really surprised with microtransactions either if im honest i cant wait to play the sequel i like these kind of games very much great i just bought octopath and spent eight hours grinding just to get to level 12 i cant get past the second city in the game cuz im so freaking weak and ive been doing this for about a month and a half now its coming to cell phone and i could have just gotten it for free oboy oh i might have to delete the game cuz its taking up too much space on my 37 gb memory card this reminds me of something but i cant tell what it is hmm final fantasy all the bravest to cell phone is this weird that i feel its degrading for that game to go on cellphone im not surprised that octopath traveller might be coming to phones because it looks very similar to final fantasy brave exvius i wonder what the price model will be like apparently im in the no views club haha 2nd comment boys man nintendrones would buy anything again very excited for the sequel got octopath for christmas and enjoying it a lot that was unexpected guess it not switch exclusive for long edit whoops it a new title lol ooh new octopath game first i didnt make the music it was done by tatertot tunes like i said in the description link to his channel httpswwwyoutubecomchanneluc77b6u7etrhadrgcn5mga i easily have over 350 between all the demos the actual game and on my second account also having a 3k giveaway once everyone receives their items from the last one thanks everyone great now beat it with only one character holy moly im only 4 hours in trying to beat my second boss blotted viper the first one was the guy in the mansion cause i started with theroin the thief i mean i figured he would be the most interesting as far as situations being the thief we ll see how it goes that is some insane octopath madness on screen omg im so sad i thought i was doing good job since i have almost 50hrs gametime while on chapter 1 struggling on leveling up but when i saw this video wtf those damage is 99999 btw i only recently buy ns soo dnt be so hard on me just gonna say i love your videos in general but this one was bad it was just you doing what is basically the same thing in content over and over again stole all sorts of things im amazed and laughing at the same time 2700 on the cait wow i already beat this game and loaned it to my brother thank you for uploading that moment you realize you used your best weapon for nightmare chemera internally cries i just dealt 5 damage to a rat soldier so i think were actually on the same level i want this game so so much wait wildfire can effect more then one enemy im gonna buy this on steam i usually just pirate stuff but i will support the devs for creating such a masterpiece how do you kill tjat which has no life 152 well that isnt that impress oh wait nevermind nightmare chimera uses battle tested blade damn bro just finished the final boss ready to have some fun with this i liked the part where there were 9s on screen played the demo and purchased the game gotta say for the record ive played almost every ff this is another glorified ff type srpg having fun but i just dont see myself dumping 300hrs into this game and after watching im thinking to my self whats the point maybe i should cut my losses and just toss it on ebay before the bottom falls out not impressed by the switch and the only two reasons i bought it was zelda and metroid metroid turned out to be a proverbial carrot before the horse and any games that perked my interest are for download only and only with an account nintendo really jumped the shark with the switch seems most games are polished rerelease or polished 8 bit feels like nintendo pulled a huge bait n switch im gonna stick with my pc and ps4 at least i know what to expect and im seldom disappointed once i beat this game im gonna try out all the broken techniques ive learned about how much free time do you have therionbest traveler basically gets you free stuff woah how are those moves hitting all the enemys at once im only 40 hours in when youre still at 64 damage i have put 215 hours or more on octopath traveler i only put like 5 hours in the 1st demo i chose not to play the 2nd demo because the game was going to be out so soon what level are your characters how how do you have the time to poor into this game to get this far what should i play octopath or xenoblade 2 reminds me of my old final fantasy x savefile back in the days after complete all of the story and side quest then what to do why is this video making me want to grind octopath traveller 404 easy as taking candies from childrenswait a second so what youre saying is everyone need to have that limit break ability so they can do over 9999 damage got it p what about 9999 hp and 999mp haha another 500 hours on it the grind we now interrupt your scheduled programming to steal candy from children sorry i have a life i cant justify playing it that long especially since its only has maybe a 100 hrs of content bro what are you doing playing a three hour demo for 125 hours holy fcking shit where do you grinde those levels stole all sort of things the hell no justin y comment how weird nice i have 250 hours on xenoblade chronicles 2 and havent really grind for endgame yeton top of that i havent even started the new game and challenge mode literally playtowin how do you steal from all over 100 hours on a demo and over 200 on a game that came out last month people have too much free time what is this a george sink commercial soits basically 350 hours of grinding and 2 hours of story thats been my experience with the game so far ive finished the game at 80 hours noticed that i would have to level up remaining 4 characters for the world boss and decided its not worth the grind i wonder what would make you invest 4 times as much time just numbers i would love this game if the boss fights where so boring and the story was told properly cloud ff7 classic introduced from movie your weapon broke stole all sorts of things yup that sums 350 hours quite nicely lol can you beat the hidden final boss with all that damage how do you do the battlecry some men just want to watch the world burn how do you steal multiple characters bruh the first 2 min was dope af but i just had to stop watching it cuz i havent got that far yet and theirs simply too many spoilers lol well one thomas clear and that us that u love the game my favorite character fro a bideo game is lucia from octopath traveler im from the giveaway id like to maybe win the octopath traveler cardsticker set and code of princess ex3ds its just to fucking beautiful for words equip surpassing power on cyrus lucky fuck xd how do you have so much free time how the every lasting hell do you already have 350 hours in this game enemies bulky enough to survive multiple cap damage hits this is the bravely default series we know and love how do you have over 100 hours on the demo when u can only play for 3 i did 9999 damage around chapter 3 is that good skips in to 20 secs 99999 damage ok then welp time to go back to grinding wait a minute your weapon broke ate 211 weapons can break i havent encountered that yet its almost scary how good i am oh wait hold up wrong game cyrus is 100 balanced favorite game character of all time would be roxas from kh my favorit character is pyra from xenoblathe chronicels 2 she is so adorebel and beautifuel and on top you have her second persoaliry mytrha d my favorite character from videogames is joshua from the trail of the sky series where did he get those powers that u never seen and how is he attacking multiple foes with an single 1x1 attack wasss happeniiinn my favourite game character is probably haanit from octopath i fucking love this game hey man i really like your octopath vids keep up the good work and content favorite video game character is willbell from the atelier dusk trilogy my favorite character is james heller from prototype 2 revan knights of the old republic also thats my bday sora from kingdom hearts favorite game character ever is probably slimes from dragon quest my favorite is haanit but its a close race with alfyn haanit is clever and super strong so as a role playing character shes great alfyn is definitely more like myself but he isnt as fun to play as p i absolutely love cyrus and primrose btw your op dude op i am so fucking envious right now 125 hours for the prologue demo o what but dont only 3 hours carry over or is that per character you do not even need close to 350 hours to do this kind of damage its all in the skill setup and to a lower margin the equipment really depending on your playstyle id say you can start doing this at around 50 hours into the game maybe even sooner it looks like you need a social life how can you steal from multiple enemies during a fight me hehe i have the secret jobs they are so great i feel invincible final boss nope rekt this video my selfesteem rekt u sure this isnt hacked because there is no way that you do 99999 damage ur tellin me olberic can get the bartz multi hit double slash cheese from ff5 are the different nuts that give permanent stats farmable one word to describe this entire video oof how do you know one that has no life stole all sorts of things how in gods name are you hitting for that much damage as i only have about 30ish hours in the game i feel weak poor with no money im just ending some of the chapter 2s in the game i dont want to rush the game but is there any suggestions on leveling how to gear yourself ect what are the best subclasses for everyone just give the character the warmasters fortitude passive and keep that characters hp down shreds enemies apart sorry about another question but how did you get 4 battletested blades i thought there was only one purchased from olberics old partner nice to show how much dmg you do but we want to know how awesome keep it just got another sub i feel off because my left joycon was ghosting baddddddd but it should be back on sat i had to send it in but now i can study your famring guide and be ready why did you made therion a sorcerer maybe i can ask you this question because after searching its still not clear to me how this game works from what i understand is you pick one character and can have 3 others in your party by playing the game but you can also play ever story line in one single playthrough do you then first play four characters and on the second playthrough the other 4 characters do you have to level every character in hisher chapter or do they all play in other characters chapters im really confused and this is what keeps me from buying the game right now 220 that cait is pissing itself can we please take a moment to appreciate the 8 bit music transition that was done so well do you have a life party build im at hour 198 and im getting to that level can you help me out this is god like well shit my mains are therion ophilia haanit and cyrus lv 38 35 32 34 and im only 25 hrs and im already completed like 14 chapters why would you put this much time in this game so when using nightmare chimera is the weapon removed from your inventory just for clarification for when i get that far is there a ng in this game this entire video fuck yo shield you made the music 8bit its so good you stole all sorts of things now come on its just unnecessary to be that op this is all done using the passive that makes your character do more damage the lower their hp is its not practical but can make for impressive looking videos if you edit them all in the way you did but realistically it doesnt take even 50 hours of gameplay to do this you can steal from all mobs at once how god i wish there were high level superbosses in this game besides the true final boss it would be so fun to test out builds on them and then respawn them hopefully for more fights a la xenoblade chrobicles 2 how do u manage 125 hours on a 3 hour demo idk if that passion or what for some reason alfyn screaming in japanese is hilarious to me what jobs do you use on characters how can you multitarget with skills that only target one enemy for example therions steal how did you multi target im at 160 hours am i close daddy also ventus saltere best what levels are you characters 350 hours why though i mean the game is good but its not that good after 350 hrs what are the top passive skills in your opinion or anyones i know the game really boils down to personal play style but at first glance i wrote off saving grace if you have a vid point me in the direction im not really minmaxing unless i get jp x5 or x100 a few times but do plan to cycle characters out here and there when i fight those mobs they have like 20k hp i see you hitting them with multiple 99999 before they die how okay guys hands down i need help ive played 90 hours finished all stories completed every sidequest besides 2 into thin air scaredy sheep got to kill 4 secret jobbosses and the final dungeon is still open ive got from level 50 70 everything where do i grind the best ive read forest of purgation a lot is this the final solution to level 99 or did i miss something thank you very much can the nut items be droppedstolen if so can we farm them holyfuck whats your favorite party setup how did you get more than 3 hours in the prolouge demo just finished beating the true final boss i was only lvl 77 with therion my protagonist with 78 hours in total dont know how you can keep playing for this long geezus is there a level cap for the game or can you go beyond lvl 100 i have to say thats a lotta damage i hope they add some new dungeons with danger level around 7090 what is surpassing power like taking candy from children lol take a shot for every 9 damn shame what to the enemy poor bastards never saw it coming all dem hours and still dont have all 8 at level 99 lmao ive only played the game for a total of 90 hours and i hit these numbers using the same methods you use in the vid casting armor corrosive on all the enemies breaking them using divine skills to make steal hit everyone or to make things get busted i assume youre level 99 nice updates great game my response to the gameplay was just this word holy how can you listen 8 bit music go back home hey do you know which sub jobs go well with some characters my party right now is haanit therion ophilia and cyrus hey what levels are your characters to be that op 4 of them are level around level 80 each and im nowhere near that powerful v did you make that intro yourself liked the tressa part of the intro what is your setup to make winnehelds battle cry to do so much frick im having trouble on the true final boss no spoilers here for others i wish i had some tips phase 1 cleric primrose dancer therion scorc cyrus and alfyn hunter phase 2 warmaster hannit apothecary olberic starseer ophelia and runelord tressa my team 047 olberic the unbendable its beautiful does hp thief overheal you if you got saving grace equipped what are the best second jobs for each character thanks just finished all 8 chapter 4s today and was feeling pretty proud of my self then i see your video much respect but grrrrrr awesome innovative ideas its a shame ffxv effectively killed the jrpg genre i think it could be cool if if you leveled up your hero they grew bigger in size some of the bosses are like 10 times the size of the player so it would be cool to eventually see your player get that big as you progress i know the game is already finished just thinkin out loud ive always wanted a nice simple final fantasy 1 style rpg i just dont to be bogged down by stats like my 9 sword doesnt really hurt this boss because the swords burn damage isnt the same as a burn chance or burn duration stat xenoblade chronicles x was notorious for that all i want is just that my iron sword is stronger than the copper sword but not as strong as the steel sword etc switch shit guys what about the recent nvidia driver with the integer scaling capability does it solve the textures blurriness on higher resolutions 30fps isnt a deal breaker uh hell yes it is and that horrible character sprite lines and blurriness theres no excuse for it game uses close to nothing on a dell g3 laptop 1050ti 4gb intel i5 8th gen 8rb ram i wouldve returned the game right away the quality looks like when you try to emulate a ps2 game with bad graphics settings i dont even like nintendo but i know they can do better than that anyone remake legend of the dragon please that terrible sprite scaling is fixed i was decided to not get it again but now im reconsidering what is the purpose of this video exactly anyone with a brain knows that its going to look nicer and perform better on pc its like saying a mclaren is faster than a mini vanits stating the obvious switch isnt for best performance its for convenience of having a mix of console and on the go gaming i mean im not hating on the work you put into the video for the sake of stating technical comparisons i just feel like the way it comes off is as if your trying to say its better on pc when its likewell duhh thats sorta common sense pc and switch each have pros and cons poor switch users nice cant wait to get it d this game is snes qaulity with shadow and lighting mod selling for premium price i love the switch but despite its portability as a 56 130lb male its still to cumbersome it practically requires a backpack or a large jacket pocket if you remove the joy cons in order to transport it im shocked no one mentions steam link in these comparisons for things like visual novels and a turn based rpg like this steam link is indispensable and all it requires is a pc to run steam good internet connection for streaming and a phone capable of using the steam link app from the play store while its plenty possible to use this strictly via wifi with unlimited 4g data and soon 5g youd have very little issues playing this on the go as well steam controllers supposedly work as well though i cant say i have tested it my old moga pro seems to work fine though just make sure your mobile provider doesnt have a crazy low bottleneck on data streaming games certainly does use a lot of data maybe just maybe we be able to get a remake of final fantasy 3 6 in japan in this style which would make it insane imo ff3 is ranked 2 and that is a hard place to put it since i had to juggle its position with ff7 holy crap didnt know it came out on pc it took me 70 hrs to complete the whole game i think i can play another 70 hrs on pc praise team tressa olberic cyrus primrose im officially insane cause i think the switch looks a bit nicer specially that unfocused effect is it just me or is this game really expensive on steam is this normal at least compare at the same resolution like 1080 in docked mode vs 1080 on pc and 720p in handheld mode and 720p on pc comparing 720p footage to 4k footage is pretty unfair really just make it in 2d and go on with your life this game is just lame square made a right decision porting this game to pc it can easily get emulated at 4k 60fps literally looks the same as the switch version lol im glad gameplay didnt change nothing is worse than owning the original copy of the game then finding out the new game has more than you have every aspect of this game is exceptional apart from the story that really kills jrpgs like this i have poured over 40 hours into octopath traveler and its gotten extremely boring without a solid plot to move it forward i feel this game is a very 810 experience for me a good plot would have instantly made it a 1010 it would be a waste if there wasnt a sequel to what could have been an amazing game still octopath is 30fps on switch hhhh so weird how much they say step down when they can say step up who really cares about the nitty gritty i love this game and its soundtrack 60 on steam a bit pricey but the moment it gets on sale i will buy it enjoy 2 chapters in 4k60 then experience the highest quality boredom as you grind grind grind grind grind in 4k60 until you stop playing does the switch version have physx as well this game is incredible cant wait for mods and console commands great video may have to try this out on pc doesnt look too different from switch so ill probably get there since its cheaper and being stuck to a pc is a huge limitation does anyone experience lag when in main menu settings they just updated the switch version to look better 252 what was that voice crack hahahahah loved the video though great work but what about hdrumble octopath was the game that convinced me of its possibilities on switch is it in the pc version why is this video presented as if octopath is a pc game that was ported to the switch when the switch version came first still you are talking as if the game was downgraded from pc to switch instead of upgraded for the other way around switch plays in 1080p come on se im not going to pay full price for a two year old switch port with fancier graphics and better quality sound whats that oh its finished downloading already damn it brain work with me here man i cant wait for that yoshi game on switch the only thing cool on pc is you do not have to pay for this 4k to playing a 2d 16 bit game lolll resume i dont see any different thing looking at cpu percent usage isnt a good indication of whether there is a bottleneck or not especially as number of threads go up the best part japanese voice language i really want to play this game but to me its not worth 60 id gladly pay 20 and enjoy it for what it is but i cant convince myself to pay 60 for many games anymore the gameplay looks better than the ff7 remake buy this game people it was an amazing experience for me on the switch not much difference none of the graphical improvements matter to me but the framerate ooohhh how people can say the human eye only see 30 fps they are bliiiind lower shadow quality frame rate res less particle effects sounds like a lot but doesnt look too different i can live with the differences tbh i do prefer the higher blurry effects on switch on edges i forgot what it was called like an idiot but i remember it being a simple term either way i hope that both pc and switch users can get along and celebrate the game because truly it is amazing underrated in my opinion but now with pc the fanbase can grow bigger so lets all be friends won some money playing the slots and then i purchased the game with said winnings for my husband he was talking about it since it came out and his eyes lit up like a christmas tree when i got it turn based games are his favorite simple switch doesnt have enough nuts i love octopath i hate most games very few speak to me every story had something that made me reflect only change id have added some legit romance would be okay just beyond the level of zeph but not too much more then that the storys are awesome this is ridiculous no one plays octopath traveler looking for great graphics look at this 4k game vs this 1080p game both are just pixel art so it looks basically the same pc is slightly better but switch looks still gorgeous well duh so as expected annihilates the weak switch version ah good at least this time the japanese developer ddint f up the pc version could i play this on my surface go tablet how about controller support cool minor differences i would say i personally wont double dip especially because i play it lying in my bed but it is good that other people can play it i really thought this was done on yuzu for a moment the switch emulator octopath released on pc the last remnant released on the switch everybodys happy plz square enix make a rpg maker fron this we need this on mobile overall the loss is not being able to use it in cramped areas on the go yoshi dlc accidentally leaked lol all the complaints and yet when i played all the way through on switch i never noticed or cared because the game is just so damn good plus playing portable is a huge reason i prefer the switch version honestly 4k is a little overkill for this game lol i massively enjoyed this game on the switch for pc users only i highly recommend this its an amazing game beautiful game gameplay is cool but the story ruins the whole game and amazing art stylemusic wouldnt recommend it coming from an owner really didnt enjoy this game but they should have remade secret of mana in this style ok ill just play my pc on the train today oh wait but can you sit your pc on your knee when taking a dump so for me ill stick to switch imagine if yoshis crafted world had this treatmentthe thing i hate about nintendo is their focus n handhelds holding the beauty of their games back i want this game does anyone know how to reduce the depth of field but not disable it will you make a benchmark with integrated gpus eg intel hd 520 on this i know its unusual for the channel but in this case its clear that everything else can run it no problem and it would be interesting considering the switch clearly is more powerful than intels apus i would love to play this on the oculus quest seems like a no brainier to me make it happen square who cares about 4k how does it work on ultrawide doesnt every unreal game from pretty much ue3 and up have physx libraries just as part of the engine pretty sure thats just how it is what is the space game 327 are you completely lost for material df tiresome all these switch titles but yeah maybe is it me that has misunderstood that your primary viewer base perhaps is a peloton of openmouth soyboys anyway will take a look at some of the other channels and see if they perhaps handle modern titles and e3 news and not these repetitive generic old games that was fun when you were like 7 years old wow i cant believe that a game runs better on a top of the line pc than it does on the switch so informative and i would have never know this without this comparison next can you race a chevy cobalt against ferrari just so we can see what we already know i really dont understand the 60 fps fixation i cant see the difference for a game like this also definitive edition sorry but can you play the game anywhere on pc i didnt think so welp there goes this months bonus whens this coming ps4 random encounters in 2019 game almost looks in par with rpg maker games you do know can has an a in it not cen dont you mean brought to by nintendo you guys just cant stop sucking off nintendo 10 dollar pc tax earned one of my most anticipated games a add to wishlist for sale badge shame square you need a 1080ti to play this at 4k60 ive heard of this game but never looked into it it looks pretty great and since the pc port looks nice i might end up getting it when its on sale on steam ill get it already have it on switch but i would love to see it in 4k on my tv 901 what about surface go also some gaming pocket tabletlaptop thingys the switch is probably greatly outperformed by current gen phones already the technical details really bothered me in the switch version this looks great but 60 is a bit much why would i want to play a 2d game at 60fps lol i dunno this seems like the type of game that would be weird to play on pc the conversion looks great though this was my favourite game of 2018 does this game need to be in 4k no by the way this game is off 25 with the promotion code e3 at green man gaming this game feels like someone maxed up all sliders in reshade over final fantasy 6 two ads and the headphone sponsorship before the video starts awesome youtube really is going downhill now that its out on pc im more interested in how it runs on a mobile pc chip i have an hp envy 360 with the ryzen7 2700u apu which is much more powerful than a switch and by playing on my laptop it gives me the ability to play on the go just like the switch please review how the game plays on different laptops with different resolution and settings especially after having played dragon quest 11 around the same time last year i really cant understand why this game has received so much praise its completely hollow has 8 very superficial rather uninteresting stories that dont really intertwine most of the time the characters dont even interact and just kinda happen to be at the same spot fighting the same monsters the only thing worth praising is the soundtrack graphics and the solid combat system armed with a full settings menu yeah as it should be why is that adressed in the description i was going to buy this game but then i bought a car instead was almost the same price im quite shocked this video presented it as though the switch version was the latest release and that the pc version isnt an upgraded release but rather switch is a downgraded one still there isnt much point to the switch version existing if this video is anything to go by its presented as largely negative question is why only release on pc this is a clear money maker i played and enjoyed it on the switch and its a game that would do well on all remaining platforms strange why sqe didnt i hope this hd2d thing takes off itd be cool to see more games like this why do gamers buy such rubbish like the nintendo console it is awful but mario buys the gamers not the nintendo console the frame pacing in the switch version is a nightmare i wish theyd have patched that i cant believe they released the game knowing it suffered from frame pacing whether on switch or pc if you love oldschool jrpgs you should give octopath traveler a go an additional comparison would be nice octopath traveler on switch undocked vs pc handhelds gpd win 2 smach z this is definitely a nice improvement but having a physical copy and being able to play it handheld is still dope to me can definitely hold out plus i put in like 80hrs on the switch version not sure if im ready to start over lol good on square though for putting it on pc just watching this to see what im missing out on with the switch version before i make my decision brilliant game but the framepacing on switch did my head in it stutters all over the place still looked great though looks better for sure shame they cant really fix the story digital fopundry and eurogamer are fascists another manipulation from digital mothefuckers foundry where is quake 2 rtx analysis it has random encounters to trash with it it would be a scandal if it didnt run on a potato nothing visually impressive in this game no problem playing this game at 4k with a 1070 hahaha if you need to play or maybe even care for this game to be running in 4k what are you even talking about everything is quare at its base just play the game its about the story 2d graphics and sick atmosphere graphic settings are pure ovverrated something for notsalgia or pixel art based games this game has one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard random but e3 2006 microsoft lol you guys did sony lets see that halo3 revival 159 texture improved filtering do you mean improved texture filtering it might be an unpopular oppinion but i actually feel more pleasant the lower res version of the game this 4k rendering reminds me somehow to increase the resolution in old psx games by emulation and i dont think the result is as harmonious as in the switch version headsets are sponsoring videos now the robot masters are coming this game looks like it can run on ipod picking up a switch in the next few weeks and octopath traveler is one of the games on my must buy list been wanting to play it for some time square enix unleashed their abhorrent regional pricing with this game it costs more than three times the standard regional pricing for 60 price tag games this game cost 60usd on steam they are on drugs i have a switch and a pc now i am conflicted with this game should i buy it for portability or performance i wonder how it will workperform with proton probably not gonna buy it twice though unless it goes on a good sale if 4k runs that easily might as well bump it up to 8k lol will eventually check this game out in the future still better in switch dont know many people who would sit on pc for the entire game when you play anywhere in handheld and play game was designed for switch and looks better on switch 515 you can notice how shitty it looks on pc thats the case where lower res looking better can you please do a comparison between the switch and pc via emulator versions of breath of the wild i would to hear about your opinions on the graphical enhancements that are available on the pc so what about 219 and 60 fps so wait for switch 5 and we can all enjoy it at 4k60 on the move i have a friend working on the title he mentioned once that the team was able to push the frame rate on switch up to north 50fps before decided to put a cap on it maybe its not stable enough one benefit of using ue4 is that it uses truetype fonts with opentype features with that its able to render text correctly and beautifully across multiple resolution i think it also uses distant field font sprite as well i would love the play this on the xbox i hope it comes to ps4 an xbox one in the future i have it on my switch but theres nothing like unlocking achievements and trophies for such a good game i hope more people can agree with me on that i dont have a pc but if i did i will get it on there too because this game is amazing i love it on the switch the prequel is coming to android and ios reshade w hqx4 works good on smoothing out the characters too i would definitely buy it if it was on ps4 334 upcoming wasnt yoshis crafted world already released on switch since march did he just call the gtx 1080 a mid range card i thought that was like one of the best graphics cards i am very confused this game could easily run on the playstation 2 yes japanese full supported language i love it 4k 60fps on pc vs 720p dynamic 30fps lol 9x the resolution and 2x the framerate honestly i bet the swtch pro could run the game at 60fps if it has double cpu gpu and ram or have an option of 1080p 30fps or 720p 60fps in docked mode i bet ps4 can handle 1080p 60fps great video could you make a new video wih yuzus version aswell regards upcoming yoshi game its been out for 4 months can you get rid of the vignette effect next video octopath traveler with ray tracing not much of a difference and that is ok even tho i usually buy multiplats on pc i still wanna get the switch version so i can play laid in bed this game is perfect for that matter thank god i sold my switch octo then wait to pirate the pc version calling it the definitive version thats not also portable nah game was like a lite saga game and i mean it none positive the greatest advantage of pc is cheat engine these rpgs will take forever to grind on mobile or consoles gotta wonder if analysing the pc version of this game is the best use of digital foundry resources pretty gud dont partically care about the performance in octopath traveler though just nice for the pc players to enjoy the game god it took almost 4 minutes for you to do a direct graphics comparison thats all we wanted instead of getting straight to the point though you had to pad the video to be over 10 minutes to get those monetization bucks i guess while not portable to the level where you could leave your house at least as far as latency is concerned you can easily run your pc games on a tablet or phone in your homes 5g wifi network with no real noticeable latency issues rather there is latency because its an encoded video but its low enough to be almost indistinguishable from say running on a high end tv i know a lot of people like to play switch laying down on a couch or in a bed that was my primary use of portable mode sometimes ill plop on the couch and play something like sekiro on my galaxy s8 active and a ds4 phone clip feels good i really need to play this i bought it when it came out and only played one of the intro stories i wish switch had an achievement system with the online prpgram there is no reason for the lack of an incentive like that one reason i prefer my vita a bit more thank god the game is great but utterly painful to look at on switch better physics are never overkill my friend refreshing when companies strive for excellence not just the minimum viable product as usual the comments are unbearably stupid all this time i thought that the weird sprite scaling was on purpose guess not loved this game on my switch glad more people get a chance to play it a fair comparison saying that i never thought about performance when i played the game he talks faster then my brain kill me but other than frame rate i think the switch version looks better im glad i was able to trade in octopath switch for almost what i paid for it 33 gamestop credit paid about 42 brand new at best buy can just get this on pc for free now is the rumble feature from switch there when using a controller that was pretty neat is this canipaeffect i was sold just seeing this at 60 fps pc master race wins again any ultrawide support honestly im so used to how the game looks on the switch it actually just feels weird with 60 fps i prefer the switch version looks more retro d how could a game with this kind of graphics not run at 60 fps on switch must be really underpowered please pc modders use the engine to give us the secret of mana remake we deserve sounds like a good port wondering howv this runs on a gpd win2 many of the comparisons in this video are presented in a somewhat misleading way when discussing the particles wouldnt it be more accurate to say that the pc version has more particles added than saying the switch version has particles reduced the switch version isnt a port its the original version and shouldnt be portrayed as a step backward from the pc version the pc version is enhanced over the switch version now i just need to wait for price drop 10 the sweet spot it looks like a comparison between 2 consoles what about control customization mk ultrawide resolutions 144hz highly recommend this game to everyone my number 1 game i have 2 copies hey df could you please consider covering the mobile port for ios when that drops pc is and always will be the best place to play games oh loooook its unreal engine 4 game graphics its a pixels not full 3d i was put off a little on switch demo by the weird dof implimentation or perhaps it was a resolution issue was playing on a 4k tv most games look fine btw this one had a weird blur it looks less of an issue here so will probably pick it up they should make this on ps4 on disc keep up the good work tom im really excited to play the game in 4k i hope pc players enjoy the game damn the 60fps feels so good compared to the 30 on switch basically a game designed around limited console ported to pc and you can tell it like a sore thumb can we please get rid of console please and let dev go wild on games without limitation this crap is better left in the past the bosses hit you without any accompanying animation and with only a strobe effect ugh im loving this game so far i held off on the switch version im glad it was released on the pc i decided to take the plunge makes me feel like im a kid again playing us ff3 on the snes again playskool console vs pc master race comparing a pc game to a hand held system is the height of stupidity game is beatifull but too expensive damn too bad its still full 60 i played the game for about 30 hours on a switch last year but i stopped because i just dont feel like playing on a separate device from my pc if they offered it for 30 for people who already bought the game theyd get my money my 2 biggest dislikes for this game is the focal bluring i understand depth but its to strong a slider to adjust it would be great the other dislike is that constant darkness around the corners filter on the entire game something like this should work like a scanline setting in percentage for transparency the depthoffield is much more easy on the eyes on pc i want this game but i am short on cash ill wait for a sale i cant believe how good 4k looks on a 1080p screen somebody gonna ray tracing this game put some texture mods lol do journey next was going to buy on switch but it was a full price game at 80cad and i said hell no im tired of ninties console prices for things that couldnt be priced so otherwise so i skipped heard itll be on steam and added to my wishlist see its finally preorderable and what do i see 8399cad lool steam versions even more than the switch version lol skipping this unless i get from humble bundle or something now seriously journey pc vs ps4 video when damn this game looks amazing so glad i waited for the pc version this looks superb much better than the shitty switch version honestly other than the resolution bump the switch version doesnt really look much worse even the highlow comparison i could barely tell the difference other then the shadow popin octopaths price on the brazilian steam store is outrageously high though if it wasnt for the price i woulda picked it instantly of course this constant double dip will she wont she crap for console games coming to pc f gamers over constantly and it finally got me i got this for switch a few months ago havent gotten through it yet but woulda like to have played on pc maybe if i dont play it and its on sale physx is used as default middleware for all physics in unrealengine i dont think the devs went for overkill so much as it was just the tool that came in the box no big suprise personally i would play octo always on the switch playing on a handheld is much better then playing on desktop so can you play with dsr at 8k and downscale to 4k if you have that much overhead final fantasy vi in this style would be absolutely amazing god rpg games look so wanky all those numbers and taking it in turns to attack i can visualise the players playing them everything is better at 60fps upgrade the switch version it cant be that difficult theres no reason to buy a switch what new game are those faggots on the ps4 playing this week whats a switch everyone expected the game to look better on pc even if only marginally on this case since its a pixel game but the fact it costs 60 and the fact that its not as portable as the switch and on top of it uses denuvo no this is not the definitive version at all ps1 graphics with a 1080 ti meh portable play on the switch still makes it the definitive version this game has its own style but for the graphic no matter nspcthey both looks awful updated just cause 4 video please jesus man reading these comments god you pc players think your so much better than everybody chill the fuck out hella toxic and no insane bloom and flares best version hands down well im definitely getting this on pc they should put this game on the switch hopefully the stories are intertwined in the next iteration honestly it looks the same dual audio and 4k is good this is pretty af holy crapi had no clue ot was coming to pc day made so theres a 60fps cap god the switch is so pathetic watching this has made me never want to go back to octopath on there i was just about to start this on switch now that i see the pc port is great im really thinking about selling it and getting it on pc instead to try and play at 4k on my gtx1070 frame pacing issues need to die in a fire there is no difference goddamn i love how decadent octopath running at 4k60fps a game intentionally designed to look snes rpgs while using modern features running at an obscene resolution and framerate compared to those snes rpgs this is the stuff of dreams this game is the saga frontier succesor i never knew i needed even the combat has the same feel still better on switch graphics are basically the same and framerate doesnt affect gameplay in a turnbased rpg so the most important difference here is portability something switch offers and pc not grinding is more fun in a portable console i would totally but this today for 30 but at 60 its just too much is it possible to turn off the bloom entirely looks amazing really highlights how much it sucks to play anything on switch if you enjoy visual fidelity and performance at all df in your latest rdr2 analysis how in the could you guys miss that they actually have downgraded the graphics in the game please answer this question if you remove graphical details in a game is this or isnt this the definition of a graphical downgrade take the intro cutscene from the on disc version v1001 and compare that to the latest patch then tell me your results spoiler they have removed all the snow on the wagons wheels so it isnt just the ambient occlusion that have been downgraded but also many other bigsmall graphical details and for all you fanboys out there please prove me wrong on this or are you going to label this as an conspiracy theory as well lol octopath one of two switch exclusives to be ported to pc i wonder if other switch games are getting ported to other consoles or pc wow wouldve imagined it would use a little more cpu than that nice port good analysis tom oh yes im sure the difference is gonna be massive in such a graphically intensive game while pc might be the definitive version from atechnical point of view switch is preferable here because long rpgs are just naturally better suited to portable machines that having been said i hope you pc guys enjoy this game its great already put in to many hours on the switch to start all over on pc sure compare gtx 1080ti to switch which is more like gtx 460 lol anyhow great game but i think 60 for it is little expensive it would be suitable for like 50 to 40 at least we have more jrpgs in steam also today theres some leaks about tales game while the pictures leaks hints to ue4 i do wish square would have the menus on the switch run at a native 1080p though pc games are portable too if you have a laptop nobodys putting a switch in their pocket moral of the story even retro games look like shit on switch wow a pc port that actually noticeably improves the graphics besides framerate and resolution its kinda expensive for what it is though im gonna wait for a sale seeing as the physics engine in unreal engine 4 is physx 33x it makes sense you really cant do any form of physics without that it can be everything from simple gravity on objects to gpu accelerated particles also note it isnt the same shitty physx of the past locked to nvidia gpus only last seen in batman unoptimized knight but a newer and open version that runs well on everything i am happy that pc boys got this game it is a must play title for gamers and it is beautiful no 219 information unfortunately i wonder how itll run on an mx150 never you can take your pc in a bus atleast you want be loot please do a video on flower and journey pc versions and compare them to ps3 and ps4 i wonder if this would run well on a surface tablet definitely interested in this game now that it is on pc looks fun portable play overrated switch outdated long have we waited pc version activated porting the game was likely very straightforward thanks to unreal and that pc version sure looks really nice i wont double dip due to the pretty steep pricing but id still recommend playing it dissapointed no ray tracing this game would be great for pc if the regional pricing for this game wasnt so absurdly high in some countries you have to pay more than double what they would normally pay for a standard 60 usd game on top of that it also has denuvo drm the main menu background will be fairly easy to fix with just recording a 4k footage of the same nature and replacing the video i suppose in other words get the pc version now port this to playstation consoles great but how well does the pc version run in portable mode it looks great but its 50 fucking dollars on steam not like i can afford that right now on a game i dont know but ill keep it on the back burner for a while upcoming yoshi game ummmits been out for like 4 months well looks like ill rebuy it then overrated and boring octopath traveler was awesome on the switch im glad its on pc as well now upcoming yoshi for switch that game already came out in march glad i didnt see any walkthrough of this game i can play this myself then and people want to say that garbage can run red dead redemption at 4k and some shit even though it struggles with octopath traveler switch cant even get real fifa lol best advantage of pc version over switch being able to turn off the godawful depth of field 50 on steam how about no for now anyway guess thats why the switch version ran at 30 pfs then lots of effects used were actually paired back to make it run on the machine better game still looks good on both platforms though yoshi already released best mobile version switch version we can now mod octopath i repeat we can now mod octopath this is the best timeline it is a great game grinding on a portable system though makes it a great switch game im a pc gamer with a nintendo switch but seeing the background in 4k takes away from the classic look they were trying to achieve with this game im still going to buy the switch version i want to collect the physical card and play while im on the toilet still looks stunning whatever youre playing it on shows how certain art styles can somewhat transcend resolution an excellent title which im glad can now be enjoyed by pc players these kind of games more fun on handhelds switch pc 60fps hand move all day long oh good this in steam switch version fps drops made me laugh when i played it sadly i never finished it cuz i got too bored toward the end this is one game that would look amazing with full ray tracing support so watch the video and i still do see the changes ive never been able to tell the difference in graphics but this to me looks identical what about 144fps wait when did octopath get the xbox treatment 335 yoshi has already released in the upcoming yoshi for switch what thats already out for a long time d 335 the switch is such an underpowered pathetic attempt at a console if nintendo arent going togive consumers a decent console maybe they should just publish their games for actual platforms cheap game devs are too lazy too use better graphics yes hand move looks like a great game but too expensive will wait for sale the best and the worst head to head this aint gonna be pretty looks great pick up for sure now that its coming to pc since when did this happen what do you expect the switch isnt much bigger than a beer mat and a pc is a big tower when i saw the title i was like zidjskfkzbd octopath traveler on pc i wonder if anybody would be willing to make a demake of this game on snes im here john notice me senpai pc vs switch gone wrong first download amino and join me in the octopath traveler community ios and google play httpsaminoappsonelinkme4ertohrichard search octopath traveler once you sign up follow me ohrichard if haanit wins the poll i will do a special giveaway on amino it will consist of a 50 eshop card and a 12 month online subscription or a wayfarers edition of octopath not sure which one yet i will also have a easy text based guide on amino about maximizing damage thanks i would like to see this 99999 damage on one of the advanced class bosses what is the difference between the starseer crit rate up and the hunter crit rate up i think that once my characters reach a specific level i shall at last fight the final boss and attempt 1 shotting how can u change ur mc different save or u need to finish each story oh my my just discovered you from amino and im super shocked to see my ophilia art here lol grinding endless hours just to do this doesnt seem too fun but atleast you won the game do you think a glass cannon build like this can work with the final boss galdera im currently leveling up and finding equipments thanks i now know how to built my characters brilliant this is seriously my favorite game of all time i literally like it more than red dead redemption ii by far love your videos on it at what level did you start getting the 99999 622 how is crit rng when you can just set the guaranteed crit status with starseer inadequate preparation is not the fault of rng nintendo should release octopath amiibo this is possible 036 you sure aflyn needs a defense squad last i checked only the absolute final boss has even a ghost of a chance against him why do you have so many nuts just fill up bp to 3 points increase the strength of your character with stat boost and use an op skill like brands thunder or these latin magic spells or my stragedy use aelfrics auspices and if you have a mage alephans enlightenment to increase thier strength heya its some random idiotic nerd from the ota i just wanted to say thanks for the shout out we really appreciate it by 455 where is he thanks for all your videos i was able to have so much fun in this game sees best girl poll in the amino bit olberic isnt an option you uncultured swines why does olberic and ophilia look like proud parents in the thumbnail good job on hitting 99999 my daughter definitely voting for hannit since i won a free 12 month subscription on your last video enjoy sees tressa deal 99999 with scorceror me hey only cyrus can be threee ultimate mage stop stealing so since youre a god at this game then id like to ask if theres another way of getting the nuts that boost stats the only way that i think getting them is from the quests and stealing but ive stolen everything and beat all the quests so so you know if only there was a way to go even further beyond 99999 i got here and the video was still on private lol both tressa and therion are my fav characters tho tressa with her ability to lower price on items and therion who can just straight up steal them this is my first time watching u and first time seeing gameplay of octopath traveler and u are funny and and the game is great and now my new favorite rpg keep up the good work i just started this series of yours i know about octopath from my uncle me i dont have a nintendo switch yet so im here and im gonna watch every episode all the at through your very entertaining im really enjoying your commentary 1 video down 99 more to go i liked the wisconsin woman joke the style of the game reminds me of solatorobo with its 2d3d pixel art pretty game i dont understand why people like this game so much i tried it and found it difficult to level up wasting a lot of time and the game play is also so limited it took me pretty long time just to get to level 10 you have limited items the attributes dont matter much on each level increase beating enemy when im on level 10 is as hard as level 5 in the same location i really dont get it do i get any attributes increased at all when you did the mom i actually died seriously this was so funny i love it is this a 100 completion walkthrough liking the pt so far cannot wait to see who you go for after this intro chapter i believe that special thing people see in tressa is called insanity i mean check her age does she seem old enough to be fighting a group of pirates i love this game i am somewhere between 12 and 23s of the way through my own playthrough and love all the characters even primrose the delicate character thats effective on to many monsters and has no power to back it all i can say about your opening choice is tressa may tressa may oo la la stealing the enemy blind and using wind magic she is one of my trusted main 4 characters this warning is to any that read this and did not know already purchase is not the best because some stuff is sold at above market value so use with caution when moneys tight do you really think us wisconsinites sound like that only the canadian and minnesotians sound like that this kind of game seems like a game in the 1980s this commentary is so good the currency in octopath is called leaves i think the same as the bravely games just wanted to say the voices you do in this series is amazing i can hardly even tell the difference between your voice and the professional voice actors it makes watching the lp even more enjoyable because you basically turned the game from a partial dub into a full dub 1203 a deal so good it was practically a steal is it me or is this guy fucking boss at doing voices this game looks and sounds utterly beautiful ill be picking up a switch later on this year and this will be my first software purchase the games seems interesting but i dont agree with everyone saying it looks great the scenery looks decent but the characters looks awful it shouldnt be a high priced game i hate voice acting in these types of games its so unnecessary and ends up sounding forced and stilted wtf i took the exact same path with every character everyone chooses the fucking merchant even me w i want to like this game but i cant get behind that they are seperate stories where the teammates have no interactions it would give it a great dnd feeling he protek he atak most importantly he octopath just wait until he finds therion why pay for items when you can steal them aie im offended im so excited to watch it you got a new sub i love how you put an effort into reading the dialogue like an actual story instead of sounding monotone the whole time it makes this so much better as someone who picked tressa as their starting character youll appreciate this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcfdlcbcppfe the music reminds me of the professor layton music this style reminds me of illusion of gaia so much tmg i trusted you and yet you chose tressa the in my opinion worst character oh yes the goddess of commerce you chose the only protaganist you can choose if you choose the other ones you dont have a soul i really appreciate that you noticed the moms accent it was killing me that nobody else seemed to comment on it its just so out of place and bizarre love this lets play i just found your channel and youve hooked me in who are you and why am i just discovering you that voiceeee gamer what do i do with sleep weed me you light it as an incense as you go to bed and dream of snopp dog 26 hours in and i must say cyrus is the best character by far his wide access to multiple elements and analysis skill for scanning weaknesses are just so versatile dude i wanted someone to start off with the merchant you just got a new subscriber ill be sure to check out your other stuff supposedly this game is sold out in a lot of areas what a likable character best game in the entire fcking world this looks great i really enjoy it and people think switch is dead i wonder if you can use boost to enhance coin collect lol ironic because tressa ended up being the last character i recruited was searching this up for someone to play as a merchant and you came through for me once again holy shit that water physics effect is insane look its really easy to determine who the pirate captain is its the guy with the fancy hat what neither of you have a fancy hat guess well just have to seize your ship then gotta say this ost is amazing so far music usually goes a long way for me and this one does not disappoint i really enjoy the voice acting as well probably helps that they dont need to worry about lipsyncing im excited to see you playing more of this tip pressing and holding b will cause you to sprint but as you noticed it also causes the mini map to turn red this means enemy encounter rates are increased i wish i could play the full game myself but until i can buy a physical copy watching you play this game is far more than good enough never even seen tressas story either so its a win win by which i mean a double win for me yay or special because your the protagonist final fantasy 16 ah i took tressa first too and im siriously not regretting it is tressa secretly a humanoid nopon im real excited to see how ya play this and who you decide to go for i went with the apothecary whos name i keep mishearing as alvin as my first choice since im a big fan of tanky healer types and thats what he seemed like he ended up being a combo of two of my favorite archetypes the snarky bastard and the overly caring sweetheart im not sure if i should go for the thief next or make a bline for tressa cause i really wanna combine the merchant and apothecary classes i never played the demo before getting this game and my first two characters ended up being the two characters you could have played in the demo lol im having loads of fun with this game so far im already 10 hours in when i read her discretion i though she was gonna get kid napped by pirates fyi the money in this game is called leaf my dude i hope make more parts of this game and its awesome im starting to think about buying the game myself yay octopath awesome start to a game that looks fantastic cant wait for you to get to therion hes voiced by one of my favorite youtubers kirbopher yes i picked tressa too i have no money huff anna is the best cute merchant change my mind its everyday bro with that octopath traveler flow im really excited to watch this playthrough sweet an octopath traveler lp with musical gamer at the helm and hes playing as a cute merchant dude sign me up tressa first i see you are a man of culture awwww tressa my girl i see you are also a man of culture musicalgamer live a live 2 is looking great i should stop saying this over and over only thing i dislike about octopath is how much grinding i have to do you can probably buy insta death on the bosses through microtransactions lol okay help me out what is the intro song of this video by the waylove your content nice the second game in the ot franchise is going to use inferior hardware and gameplay developed by a different team for the sake of a cashgrab glad to see theyre modeling their business model off the kingdom hearts series that franchise has only benefited from this practice in due time ot will get its own diehard fanbase to defend bad gameplay innovations shunning fans of the originals you lot have a lot to look forward to i do look forward to another game but the combat was way to long like one goat at your level can take like 20 min and i feel like that they didnt integrate the character story interaction well enough i would like it if the characters actually affected the other stories but this is just wishful thinking to beat the game you complete your characters journey to beat the game you complete all chapters to master the game you beat the ultimate boss p mobile games arent that bad i just hope that the game releasing to mobile is like another eden fair and possible to play the whole game for f2p players i killed all the bosses pretty quickly i dont think they had that much hp boss only took forever if your cyrus only did 700 damage a hit vs 10k or more if someone put the damage cap break on him id be much more excited for a bravely default 3 instead dude everything will be chinese gacha and microtransactions these are the fastest cashgrabs and lately squareenix is no different than those lazy aaa developers 006 octoplath im mostly excited for the potential characters and how they could relate to the characters from the original game i heard this is a prequel of sorts so the 3 characters im hoping for are primroses dad graham crossford and the butler from therions story fuck mobile games but even more fuck all you pieces of shit that buy that garbage also about your comments on the bosses for the extra classes while they are a pain if you get the sorcerer first buff cyrus to the teeth and give him every buff two actions in one turn regular magic buff skills bp damage enemy magic debuff no joke the boss takes a few turns at most or maybe i just enjoy cheesing the crap outa games i dont know where is this info on the new octopath traveler i am of course referring to the supposed new console one i am so excited if this is true octopath is my favorite game of all time i beat galdera after like two months of strategizing one thing id like to see in a true sequel of octopath is more classes maybe when you take a class to a certain level or acquire skills for them you can advance them into a higher tier yknow i love fire emblem heroes and i could live with another gatcha i can passively enjoy yo i just want more character interaction among the party fuck and i still havent gotten a chance to buy it subbed for the intro kek wait so this is fking legit i thought that its some octopath bootleg or something comparable i thought that was a joke eww i kinda wish that octopath was more of a normal jrpg like you picked one character and that was its own story theres enough characters in each story that it would work but they would have to re work a few things im so ready for an octopath sequel i just hope the eight previous main characters can make some kind of cameo can we stop with the mobile games my phone literally cannot handle them without nuking my battery in the process dude something that takes forever is only forever if you believe it to be absolute best example of this is the adamantoise in final fantasy 15 a boss fight that is said to take 72 hours to kill and so begun the challenge then people trying worlds records at it last time i saw this was a few years ago when the game first came out the fastest time was under 8 minutes so yeah its all about doing it right get to the point ffs a small teaser httpsyoutubecb0ecpgcob8 i dont play gacha games o was hoping it to be a spin of solo rpg here is an interesting idea octopath traveler tactics loved the game at first until i realized you use the same strategy for pretty much every boss then i lost interest its actually more like a spinoff developed by another team so everybody chill out the director of switch game said there will be a new console gamenot sure if its ot2 developed by the original team but its still gonna take a while well at least they confirmed a sequel along with the phone game wait its a new game i thought they were just porting octopath to mobile a movile game the same happened to bravely default c from the same videogame develop studio c octopath traveler has the worst graphics ever i cant get past the retro graphics it drives me nuts and keeps me from dropping 60 on it also somehow regret buying smash bros on the switch botw is rather boring too now xenoblade chronicles 2 words cant express the masterpiece it is so good the bad side of being a mobile game is that it has a really small chance to come to this side of the world c give me golden sun 4 switch andmaybe bravely default but first golden sun im happy its not coming to the switch obviously switch fanboys didnt care enough for the first game square gonna make the moneys on mobile stay hating random youtuber lets just hope this game is written much better than the first wait true end boss i didnt there was one putting the gay in mobile game i absolutely loved octopath traveler the music should have won an award music was good but but im still not happy it got nominated over xenoblade 2 for music guys if you didnt know square enix said that they are working on a sequel for the switch the mobile game was just something to play while we wait why do fucking companies do that release a good game like say fantasy life for the 3ds announce that they are working on a 2nd title and put it out on mobile devices instead its just soo fucking annoying new i thought it was just a port with additions the octopath traveler game that is coming to mobile is just a prequel we are getting an actual sequel on switch as well lots of articles about it so you gonna play some raw music but not leave the sauce damn to get shitted on for a game i supported i stay gettin played make a switch exclusive game does pretty well and people wanted more announce a new octo game its just a dumb down prequal for mobile with microtransaction fucking genius well at least were keeping octopath alive and relevant hope theres more updates to this sales manager hey people liked octopath because its like a good old school jrpg and it sold well square cool now make it into a mobile game with waifus and take out everything that people liked fans you know you could make more money just by putting them into one of your other mobile phone gatcha games like a valkyrie profilestar oceannieroctopathfinal fantasykingdom hearts crossover square quiet you you will like what we want you to like now leave me to draw tear drops on cloud did not play octopath traveler because its not worth buying a switch to play it thus coming out on something else might get me slightly interested in it for real no interest at all in mobile games but it is great news that a new ot for consoles is in development might actually get octopath traveler if it comes out on mobile well maybe the next game will be on everthing not everyone has a switch well im not excited for this mobile game but oh wait for octopath traveler 2 if this comes to the uk at least i will have something to do during my work break if i remember they tweet about doing 3 projectsor multiple projects anyway more than 2 xd bravely 3 octopath 2 and now this mobile oh thank god they are still making console games thought theyre becoming metal slug or some other franchise forever doomed on mobile gacha huh not really a fan of it sure its kinda exciting but rngwalling the players to get what they want and potentially having them spend hundredsthousands only to get a specific something from the gacha is just too predatory yes i want a mobile jrpg of this game i would be nonetooexcited like you but another eden showed me it is possible to make full fledged jrpg play another eden its written by masato kato chrono trigger chrono cross xenogears and you can tell i love it it reminds me fantasy life just hope itll not end the same way there is a tweet on the official octopath traveler twitter in japanese that says the sequel for the switch is in production but is taking longer than expected so in the meantime they will release a mobile game to give something to fans while the sequel is being worked on i know its in japanese but from a translation from gematsu says everyones waiting for a new game on console were sorry but production will take a little while longer so in the meantime we hope you can enjoy the smartphone game just here to spread the news but everyone is so focused on the next game being on mobile link to gematsu article httpsgematsucom201903octopathtravelerchampionsofthecontinentannouncedforsmartphones link to tweet httpstwittercomoctopathprstatus1103901434242686977 that chick shoving the scroll into her tits is so fucking hot scheherazade mmm as a western gamer i stand by fuckmobilegaming save that shit for the east who loves the micro transactions you pack them with will it actually be good this time but switch is an android tablet lol looking at it optimistically i want to hope that they will take the revenue made on this mobile game to further make a proper sequel that will receive all the resources that it deserves i love the 2d hd look the story was good for the characters i really like to use cyrus and primrose have the best stories by a landslide in my opinion i also liked the music oh my god the music to this game kissing your fingers sound manifique example song used i thought youre only here to play games usually id be bummedhowever if theyre working on a sequel too then i think its okay theres nothing wrong with them saying hey youre going to get another game but were also giving you a mobile game in the meantime cause its faster were getting more not having stuff taken away and just put out as cheap mobile stuff do you guys not have phones this is the one time i didnt wish for them to copy the bravely series the only smartphone game i need is girls frontline hold on gatcha gotcha got cha how did i not see this before thats why gatcha games have microtransactions if its on mobile then its nothing for me i fear hehe that diablo immortal reference as long as they dont release it on steam one day with the mobile interface like their older ff dude your french is tray ben oui i have no issue with it especially considering that best rpg out right now is a phone game another eden remember stripper assassin is the best girl ive lain the gauntlet waifu wars in the comments not one for mobile games but i may try the octopath sequal if it is good enough hey shadowelite who is the character that apears in your intro at 0036 i cannot wait for more lore nah fam they can keep that mobile trash not bout that mobile game life honestly trying to get a share of the mobile market is not a bad way to go money wise it generates probably much more than the console market however what annoys me is not the mobile games but how they get their money back very few free to play are designed in a good way and by that i mean no ads no gameplay made in a way that it is easy with money but extremely hard when playing freely no premium exclusive content and so on an example of that can be shadoverse of fire emblem heroes they have theit share of randomness but they are quite generous with rewards and you can be somewhat competitive whitout paying anything sorry for the promo like that meanwhile paid games on mobile arent much either mostly not because of content but because of their price most have a price set too high for the average mobile player thats why im quite fearful that they decide to go mobile so soon because octopath traveler was quite the breath of fresh air in the rpg world man i just hope a bravely third game is in development do you not have phones im very disappointed in the fact that its going to be on mobile that is just disgusting they shouldve done a dlc so we play it on the switch i havent got time to be playing games on my phone or on my tablet that is pointless octopath for pc when square i wont touch the mobile game much like anything else squeenix has put on mobile im bummed too ill definitely check it out but smartphone games arent real games at least we got the news that theyre working on a sequel its good that a new octopath game is coming out but the mobile side ismeh like i only dislike the fact that they are using their new ip in a mobile game so soon but oh well mobile is were the money at sadly luckily android is being ported to the nintendo switch want more games like this on switch many of the same things you were saying you liked about octopath are exactly how i felt about divinity original sin 2 the soundtrack is amazing it has a lot of similar graphical effects the voice acting is superb the style of it reminds me of turn based strategies back from back in the 90s and early 2000s whenever it comes to switch i highly recommend checking it out yup i like octopath bro not often games come out like this anymore i really appreciate how knowledgeable you are youre constantly cross referencing titles and giving examples that support your opinion keep up your good work i will admit i nolifed the game beat it a few days ago will not spoil anything because i am not a loser but just as a heads up for everyone there is a secret area you can go to by completing certain sidequests post beating every characters story that can very e a s i l y be missed out on and trust me you dont want that and with that being said continue to enjoy the game everyone i love this game theres a misconception grinding is optional gear is where all the upgrades are for your character leveling helps with hp and jp do what you can to buy gear cheaper with tressa or steal gear with therion you can level up by just doing side quest and moving to next area there is a reason to grind to keep your other characters even level and in late chapters 30 hours in and i absolutely love it when you guys are done playing it i recommend battle chasers nightwar which i think was underrated great turn based jrpg with amazing artwork 50hrs in since launch and im trying to find the wayfarers edition i did the same with xenoblade 2 a digital for launch and collectors for these breathtaking jrpgs a bit later down the road it was my most anticipated game of 2018 and i am loving every minute of it few games have me constantly thinking about them when im away and not playing cant wait to see what else square brings with the success of octopath dang only 35 hrs i guess im just playing non stop im already 80 hrs in and i beat the game lolol octopath is goty i have now fully completed the game and while it may not be my favorite game i have on my switch the charm it has with its overall presentation and its simple but engaging combat pretty much made me play the game extensively the random encounter does wear you down a bit when you just want to explore for those purple chests but you can mitigate that somewhat it would have also been nice to have a big overarching narrative but what they do have serves it purpose without giving the writers a big headache about character interactions and overlapping plot elements i also wish the sidequests were not so vague the npc just says something and you gotta play detective with most of them there is no tracker for them to guide you to a general area unless the npc tells you it is a wild goose chase most of the time and i do not regret using a guide to find out what i even needed to do for those aside from that everything else is minor like enemies having bit too much hp sometimes and haanit been playing this game mostly if time since i got the game on monday havent touch zelda since then dont know how much hours i put into it i at least played 3 hours or more of this game since i got it played splatoon 2 paladins and nba 2k18 this week for a little bit but the rest of my time i played the switch was on octo path im on chapter 2 in everyone besides primrose beat her chapter 2 but on alphyins chapter 2 but put that on hold to go the route right before his town trying to grind my squad at least lvl 25 min and most of my squad is 25 or higher gotta get olberic and theiron their cause they are the only two not at lvl 20 yet great ass game to play already listen to all the soundtrack in octopath traveler its music is pretty damn amazing especially the final boss theme even though i have not played the game yet this is what i wanted final fantasy 7 to be but we got blocky chunky shitty 3d polygons instead it is not one of the best it it the best game ever d 40 hours i finished all ch 3s rip got it since last eek friday at first didnt play that much because of splatoon 2 well beginning this week i start my marathon oh my almost 30h not even done getting all the characters 2 more left so i can start grinding to start ch2 for all character there are just too many good games on the switch ocotpath is a top 5 for me too one thing i recommened is playing multiple playthroughs with different groups playing with all eight is fun but for me i feel you can create unique playthroughs for yourself and use your imagination for some great ships groups or duos that would be fun to pair imagine playing with just olberic primrose for an entire playthrough that sounds fun challenging too edit i find when you go from place to place you never really have to go somewhere else to grind you can just grind wherever you go youll not get wrecked unless you literally avoid fighting enemies entirely stray off the path you kind of are supposed to go on this game starts slow but its amazing 25 or so hours still on chapter 1 game is amazing not trying to rush i picked alfyn first i love this game xenoblade chronicles 2 or octopath traveler for best soundtrack of 2018 personally i cant decide who are your first four mine is hannittherionophilia and thresa im having a hard time getting into this game im about 10 hours in and finished all the chapter ones but now am i just suppose to randomly pick a chapter two to start doing i feel theres no direction in this game maybe i just need to play more therion is the best character hp thief sp thief his op move is crazy he wants to just drink n steal stuff my wayfarers edition is literally en route to my house right now really nice vid pe ninja master octopath traveler has the complete package gameplay graphics n sound plus depth strategy n replayability all in a more than worth it price the only thing im not too keen n goes way back for me is the random pop up battles which i feel should start being fazed out in big rpg games smaller ones i dont mind cuz they need too pack out the game but in bigger rpg titles that should not be a thing but overall the game is dope and need too play more of it cuz havent had a chance im 35 hours in too but only 28ths done with chapter 2 love this game the battle mechanics the graphics the music what a game im 56h in and just go the sorcerer job and omg this is op 2nd battle theme is epic for me 63 hours in im at primroses 3rd chapter if ff6 is jesus octopath traveler is his 2nd coming 70 hours in and my goodness is it good the strategy in this game is insane and the challenge is greatthe stories are awesome too ive never played a classic rpg before and i must say this game is freaking insane i have alfyn as the leader i actually like how he fights in battle oj please avoid my comment upgraded exclusive 3ds content is better than the ports switch has been getting i know you heard me tell you this before it happened and i know you are now trying to hide from me it is ok like nintendo prime and potentially ruleof2review your inability to admit i was correct has lost you a fan my wife has joked with me that when valentines day rolls around shes going to make me a card saying leten my arrow flyen true octopath is selling ff7 is still not coming spawnwave is cool and so are you excellent review i bought the game and havent opened it yet ad im going through other games but man you are tempting me to tear it open and play i been on a retro revival trip lately with the games i been playing on and this game will be the icing on that cake alfyn is basically this games sharla from xenoblade chronicles why because ophilia much like melia is a much better healer im roughly at about the same point as you with several chapter 2s completed average level 3035 i agree with everything youve said i love love love the music i really want them to remake ffvi in this engine with rerecorded music and maybe even some voice acting i love how you can capture certain bosses you find randomly in caves its amazing op too octopath traveler review scores digitally downloaded perfect 5

second of it waiting to get the wayfares edition but it is getting hard im 12 hours in on my wayfarers edition i just recently got into turn based jrpgs about 6 years ago im 40 so far this is one of the best ive played i absolutely love the music voice acting graphics story so far great game for summer time i hope everyone enjoys the game that venom shirt is siiiiick 211 thot cop ive got near zero care for 4k 60fps games im more interested in sophisticated games mainly folklore fantasy rpgs to me imo this game may become top 20 in best game of all time what i miss is the battle formation like putting your characters in the frontline or behind also ot seems a bit railed as in travel is pretty stuck to a path and restricted once a drama starts ive only played about 8 hours so far another point is why isnt each character got their own collection of items i think the player characters should also carry their past battle detriments and bonuses to the next battle or wear off during travel example if you get poisoned then it simply shouldnt disappear if you win the battle i now understand what you mean in reference to ophelia shes on my main team haanit cyrus primrose ophelia 35 hours in without a chapter 2 nani im 35 hours in myself and ive done all chapter 1s 7 chapter 2s and 4 chapter 3s lol ill definitely have to start doing more sidequests soon and some grinding really enjoying octopath myself and i agree its definitely one of the best thats subjective but its definitely great well at least one of my favorite games on switch i love the art style and boss fights are tense however dialogue has me a bit bored at times i hope we see similar games from se moving forward which we definitely will as its nice to have some quality turn based games alongside these action jrpgs your awesome join the octopath amino at httpsaminoappsonelinkme4ertohrichard just curious the subclasss are the order you went still have to finish this game lol 155 impeccable timing i hope that for the sequel they give us a bunch of new classes like bravely second shit had so much class customization i have a question if i want to use a run on my caster and it has an elemental boosting weapon do i need that weapon for the attack to get the elemental bonus or can i use my strongest elemental atk weapon and still get the bonus ok olberic with max evasionmax defense is pretty funny to watch i have to try that now hello everyone im fairly news to this game and i wonder dont i need surpassing power passive from warrior to do over 9999 damage i see this amazing vid but i am a little confused now a little help in this would be very much appreciated thank u in andvance runelord tressa has the power of ultra instinct what levs way too late but if anyone feels generouswhat was that max defenseevasion build on olberic particularly asking about equipment but it looks like hes a dancer just found you on octopath traveler fb group love the content bro subbed really hoping to win that wayfarer edition i feel like some characters are more useful for their starting primary jobs and some are more useful for their path actions therions path action is great but primroses primary job makes her almost necessary in any team composition i guess his steal sp skill is decent though haanit is probably one of the best characters in the game with her summons but olberics path action has no penalties or restrictions ophilia has both a decent primary job and path action tressas path action is something i rarely ever use but she has some nice skills and abilities for late gamealso free money cyrus is just all around good damage with a decent path action and alfyn out of all the characters feels like a leftover for me 610 oleric gets in the way of the attack so they miss logic too bad the game ends as soon as it gets good i hope this game makes square enix realise that if they ever want to remake final fantasy at least ff1 through 6 they should consider doing them in this style or better yet let the studio behind octopath traveler make them as they did such a great job on this game 058 tressa 203 ophilia 325 alfyn 414 primrose 528 olberic 643 therion 746 cyrus 842 haanit can anyone explain this video to me like is everyone level 99 with perfect gear and stuff godly as hell lol why isnt there a spoiler warning some people like me probably didnt even finish and it showed a boss i never seen now im dissapointed 127 nice vid but the mic work basstreble is extra and background music need tweaked also the lack of info on whywho is overpowered really makes this video pointless its a twitch stream and not information with background i fail to understand how ophilia is overpowered i saw nothing in there that she can do that another traveler cant do better tressa makes sense no one else can do what she does i must be doing something wrong because my tressa has poor elemental attack thank you for mentioning just about the only thing good about tressa her stats are too middling for most jobs to be good but transfer rune sidestep and transfer rune rest are both reasons my brother beat mnagarmr so easily how long did you grind to get those levels alfyn went from pharmacist to harmacist real fast this is why i love this game i played this game for 7 minutes the other day and picked the scholar bro because he can see enemy weaknesses or whatever thought that was a good idea now im not so sure i use sorcerer cyrus runelord therionyes tressa is better but i like therion more starseer ophilia warmaster haanit only around 70 but no where close to those damage outputs oh shiet octopath aminoi think ive seen you there im the one whos got a super long name about cyrus being the best boy haha insert many many many its over 9000 memes here man i just started this game for the first time today are there any strats for getting leveled up fast early on i started with primrose and have alf and tressa so far yup thats cool but have u seen the damage count in disgaea games its massive even more if u count with some team work attack how the rereleases of 2d final fantasies shouldve been instead of the mobile ports we got yes you made another octopath video yassss queen i stopped playing because i got tired of the grinding is there an easy way to level how can you steal steal hp sp to all foes thanks how to describe the travellers tressa untouchable ophilia the doctor alfyn potions master or just spam last stand primrose the cheerleader olberic the unbending blade i dont think olberic needs a name change therion the allrounder cyrus op magician haanit aoe destroyer please find some better names i cant think of some names for some the bigger sprites look amazing and i love the simple breakdowns for simpletons like myself love your octo vids and look forward to whats next i feel bad because some people think you cheated or something which is 1000 not the case at all think next time you could show off some of hannits captured beasts but given the op treatment damn 99999999 damage thats a lot of damage whoa oh yeah i forgot this game exists i really want to start a new file after having beaten it has anyone been able to enjoy the game a second time or is it a play once type of thing im currently farming the battle tested weapons that i need jeez 2 sure is low tay another octopath video thanks richard 402 berserk clang all the travellers are badass in their own special ways thats what i like about this game a lot i still have no idea how youre doing 99 999 with the staff attack on battle cry my boy alfyn sounds like a mad man in jp might have to switch over and give it a try that x2 battle tested blade nightmare chimera by ophilia was badass man good seeing another octopath video from you wtf how do you deal 3 times 99999 damage with the sorcerer skills my primrose is level 78 and i pushed her elemental attack so much and i just deal 3 times 6k damage equipping all sorcerer support skills how can i achieve this i need a step by step process can anyone help me out also what the name of the song at the end i know its from octopath thanks for doing this bro runelord tressa starseer ophelia sorceror cyrus warmaster olberic great video showing these build potentials it really helps thank you i dont usually read yt comments past the first hour or so crap i need to be fast i still love this game i just find it amazing i chose olberic and i tried to get every character by skipping cutscenes i got olberic primrose alfyn therion haanit and tressa thats how far i got within 3 hours hey ive started playing the demo and started with olberic because i thought i can make him my main character now i have to play the prologue for another character does this continue for all 8 character im not rly interested in the other characters if this game turns out amazing i cant wait for the remaster years from now i have to say my only complaint with this game is the sound mixing i cant hear the characters dialogue over the music just a fyi the enemys name changes colors depending on how much health they have left white is close to max yellow is getting closer red means it is almost dead will you be continuing with the other characters 519 when youre ready to looken after yer master because he cant looken after himself does anyone know if you star a new saves data in the demo will that also carry over so essentially you can play all 8 characters and have their data transferred when the game comes out wow graphics music voiceacting all so excellent where in all of heaven did this game come from behooven would only exist with a plural how do you switch characters starting a new game every time ive really enjoyed therion so far his battle style feels nice ive gotten hannit as well with him therion feels like he has good damage evasion and utility still trying to figure out whats the point of this game if i didnt already have a switch this would be the game to make me buy it is there more so both octopath and captain toad are coming out on the same day who is getting both on the same day i know i am the music that english is painful for nonnative speakers i played as therion the thief objective is to go to flatlands how do i go there im currently at frostllands with ophilia sighyou had no idea how to use the axe did you skip how to its easy use the side to side directional buttons on the left joy con i played ophilias and hannits story so far i know half the teams stories if you include olbrec and primroses story from the demo which i did everything in that version as of right now primroses story is my fave lets see if any of the remaining four travelers could top that 3 just a little under a month to go is this full voice did alfyn and tressa for save data spent sometime leveling them up a little is there only one save data i did two other people but had to save on the same file so i lost my first two people i love the old rpgs like ff5 for somehow i cant quite get into this gamexplain i really hope someone has explained to you how to break enemies by now but if not the shield icon next to the name and weaknesses that has a number in it you have to hit it with whatever it is weak to that many times to break the enemy the amount of damage does not effect how many it removes from that counter when you hit their weakness when it at 1 it goes to 0 and they are broken hope this helps far into this demo and im hooked on the game played a lot more than 3 hours starting and restarting different paths think the optimal path is starting with the scholar since he can reveal an enemy weakness at the start of every battle add others to party and that comes in quite handy ive loved everything about this game but the story anyone else got the feeling youve seen all of their motivations way too many times before and that theres like no real reason they would be motivated to travel together holdup so you get 3 hours to do the prologues for all of them or each of themim stupid pls help p this game and hollow knight have me hooked to my switch and mario tennis aces is only a week away game on i played cyrus first in this demo and holy crap im in love with this cinnamon bun hes like botw zelda meets phoenix wright but extremely adorable and clueless i have a feeling he and primrose are going to be the first stories i focus on finishing i still have to play the others to see who else grabs me unfortunately olberic still feels too generic for my taste why is the handheld mode so blurry is anyone experience this i just picked up this demoi still have yet to complete the original demo howeverp ps i love the aesthetics of this game it looks great i went with tressa she was the one i was most interested and then also finished primroses story and squeezed in a bit of olberic story id give anything if chrono trigger could get a remake in this style hell final fantasy 6 too expecting a full load from you mario tennis aces icon leak i have two hours on haanits story and i can say that this is one of my favorite games on the nintendo switch and its only a demo right now hopefully i can get this when it releases i chose cyrus as my first traveler and he is a good character the ability of know the enemys weakness at start of each battle is great and having fire ice and lightning magic is also good also i already recruted tressa with her bow lance and acess to wind magic i am also planning to recrute primrose and olberic before continue to the other side of osterra all four characters i cited are located in the east part of the land this game is amazing jon youre doing a great job as the man back at the base i found an octo expansion easter egg in the bus in the music theres calamari inknation and the telephone is found in maries place on the side and thats it can you guys please do a discussion with roger about nintendo e3 theres an enemy i found on primroses path that can give you 1000 exp points if you beat it i was lucky to recruit a strong npc named drunken bartender and defeated it first turn with him now im level 14 wow does he not realize he has an axe love the attention to detail little things like the flowers in the breeze and the bar sign swinging a little bit theres little bits all over the place i played through therions prologue and it was fantastic i really love story and the gameplay is really good too music is great too im a little worried that the heroes wont interact to each other so just so you guys know gamestop still has 11 sku set aside for nintendo skus are only set aside close to announcements so within the next month 11 things will be anounced now these are listed as game skus so they are not amiibos most are 5999 but a few 3999 my gusse is 2 are for the next pokemon but the rest i dont know ps4 has 7 meanwhile xbox has only 4 3ds has 5 vita ps3 360 wii u all have zero and 3 video game systemsmost likly just different versions of ones we already have so nintendo has the most coming by far so expect another big nintendo direct eurogamer forgot to interview shigeru miyamoto for pikmin 4 i played the other demo for octopath and it was already on my list of games to acquire as i have personal issues with squareenix so they dont get my cash this is a fricking long demo just gonna put my thoughts on the 6 additional characters here ophilia was not expecting her to have my favorite first chapter but it sure was there is a grand religous tone while still having a bittersweet family thing going on whenever i got then sacred flame in her sisters stead i actually felt really bad about taking away such a major role from her but she didnt seem to mind too much ophilia feels like one of the most fleshed out characters so far and they accomplished a lot in less than an hour into her story her group healing skill was a huge help too cyrus this guy is literally the anime protagonist of octopath because he is so dense at times yet extremely sharp otherwise i didnt enjoy his chapter too much it felt really unreasonable at times for example his students rumor spreading for attention felt so unrealistic as well as him having to leave town because of it chasing down the thief was fun though in battle he is a monster with 3 different types this game this soundtrack perfection the more i play this game the more i love it im extremely worried about the story and i fear that it will feel like 8 mini stories with no main plot but right now we dont know enough to conclude whats sure is that recruiting the 7 other characters feels goofy and jarring at the very least the 8 characters have absolutely no reason to team up together and in some cases are actually against each others philosophy for example having ophilia helping therion is just the most impossible thing to think of i do love the game so far but im really scared about the ambition of having 8 stories maybe its just a facade and the 8 stories very quickly all converge to the main point and then the game begins or it will be a hot mess the job system is also neat but so far we can see extremly few skills and if theres not more to unlock i have a feeling that battles will feel very repetitive after 10 hours that being said the treehouse moment they shown was the start of chapter ive played both demos and enjoyed them a lotexcept for the bosses they take too long to defeat are some prologues more difficult than others or am i just bad ah this is such a beautiful game in every aspect im doing cyruss route first honestly this makes me want the game even more and since it releases on my birthday ill be picking up as a birthday gift to myself john has a wonderful story telling voice that determination theme at the end is sooo good longest 1 month wait in my life the visuals stunning and unique the music hype and beautiful the combat hopefully not repetitive 2411 do we still get experience for that gets experience mmm no so hyped about this game though next month look at ye ol english so when you beat one characters story line do you have to start a new save file to play as another character the shield tells you whn its about to break also you have a axe you didnt use it at all lol i fell in love with bravely default so this one is definitely right up my alley playing therion will probably eventually play the others just added hannit to my party do you have 3 hours for each character or total after the three hours can you delete your file and start with another character what is this complicated english fakey ye olde english dialogue is terrible oh i also played the hunters story and i loved it this game is a loveletter to oldschool rpgs preordered immediately this is tough i wanna watch but i dont wanna spoil stuff im gonna go through anyway isnt octopath traveler just like live a live but without time travel did ophilia and cyrus already but ophilias route was hardddd because of the boss i think i wont play this demo because i dont want to be spoiled i honestly wasnt expecting anything with this game but i downloaded the prologue this morning and played the entire 3 hours in one sitting i love primrose and olberic game is beautiful but that colour palette played the thief guy awesome built up i need this game i decided to go with therion i really like his character hes cute too wow is no one going to say anything about that beautiful music absolutely stunning can get lost with the ost tressas the best character dont me after having played this demo im definitely more excited about octopaths gameplay i shrugged my shoulders when they announced dual classing but now that ive seen that warriormerchant can effectively be an evasion tank im pumped about all the combinations loving the game and since your progress carries over im just using this short time to grind a bit as i want to get into the story and not have it cut off after 3hrs roll on july i managed to finish cyrus tressa olberic again primrose again and alfyns prologues all in three hours i feel accomplished btw haanit can use axes too i might just download the demo i heard the first demo was good ive fallen in love with this game i cannot wait for july boxart looks awesome too so im definitely getting this physically octopath is so big they say it will take you like 100 hours to complete everything that will keep me busy until smash comes out in december is this a storyfocused game like final fantasy 6 or chromo trigger thats the only thing i care about ive been wanting to know if this game has an easy mode or not because i enjoyed the early demo but it was pretty difficult ive also heard that the whole game is tough is there one video isnt working for me so like you get 3 hour to play and thats it no matter how far you reach so hyped for this gameand went with obleric day one is this demo avaliable yet im honestly surprised that square enix uses unreal i figured theyd have their own engines the shield with the number shows how many hits it takes to break them i need this game like yesterday most hyped game of the year how do you do a review on a game without finishing it or am i mistaken in assuming this is actually a review as opposed to a preview so much complaining this game has great reviews just check out metacritic i dont get why youre determined to hate the game other than twice in chapter 1 this game never scales levels of enemies dont lie to your audience you talentless hacks from what ive played so far this game is great and the visuals are stunning ive never seen or played a game that looks like this i love the parts of the world ive seen thus far even if its not exactly full of people in some areas the fact that the other characters you find and take with you have little to no bearing on any of the stories kind of blows it for me apparently my suspension of disbelief cant let that fact go shame i wanted to play it but the fact that im this hesitant about it plus the fact that it costs 5040 means im gonna have to say no to it and yes ive played the demo starting to regret i picked the thief as my main character he seems to be the only characters who doesnt have an attack that can hit multiple enemies also five minutes after having collected all eight travelers i stumbled upon the thief job shrine meaning anyone in my party could now do his job for him alas the main character cannot be switched out yhea the game should have been finnished before reviewed but how he reviews still gives a full image of the game best game channel reviews thank youu the story missions are so bad why couldnt they be more like the sidequests im struggling to finish it because of the 8 stories only about 5 of them are interesting to me and even in the interesting ones the missions are just awful but hot damn the game looks good sounds good and the combat is spot on a great review detailed and unbiased this game was a huge dissapointment to me im really pissed off about the disgraceful almost absolute lack of illustrations for the characters they gave us one miserable illustration for each main character and nothing more really how im supposed to be invested in this shit i wanna see the characters up close when they talk to each other i wanna see hot chicks i wanna see the warriors with details i wanna see how the npcs look whoever came with the idea of a game of pure chibi sprites talking and running around needs to be flayed ill probably never finish this fraud of a game i just played the demo is it me or the enemies dont even move its just a visuak that they attack you id like to see a modern rpg try 3d characters on 2d prerendered backgrounds they could probably create some amazing looking prerendered environments with modern graphics engines it feels like more and more less than positive reviews are being put out for octopath i dont really see why to be honest im enjoying almost every moment of it i guess its just a difference of opinion though i quite want to play this game but i honestly think that it looks so bad graphically that it isnt worth full price so i must wait for a price cut even if it takes years to happen theres a final dungeon that ties them together so theres that i bought it liked a lot at first but do to the repetition and subpar stories that are cliche as they come it got old fast i really got into it a first i just couldnt stay in it so away it went to a purchase of a different game if they made a sequel with a really amazing storyline involving relations between characters i would definitely give it another shot but i will have to wait and see if there is a sequel and how good it is before i pony up another 60 dollars this game really tricked me i really wanted it to be on par with the final fantasies6 especially chrono trigger secret of mana super nintendo style story wise i suggest everyone really play the demo and think hard before you make the purchase so can i complete all 8 stories in one game the party looks like it can only have 4 in it at one time do the 4 not chosen level up too or do they get left behind and it means hours of grinding lastly as i play other characters stories how much of them reuse the same areas and monsters you say you did 2 complete stories so far in your 45 hours or so were they totally different gameplaywise this isnt the first time ive heard about individual stories in a game and then what that really meant was the banter and talk was different for each character but you are really running them all through the same areas with the same combat same monsters etc just from a different perspective is that the case here final score a lot 10 this seems like a spiritual love child of final fantasy tactics and radiata stories id love to play it spoiler when you complete all 8 stories there are some quests that lead to the true final chapter however even the true final chapter doesnt have the 8 characters interact they appear together but they still dont interact its more so like an explanation for the players its revealed that each story had small bits or huge bits involved with the others and their own stories but not even in the final chapter does it show them connecting at all its more so a bunch of refights to previous bosses followed by walls of text explaining what was really going on its really only in the sudden surprise dialogues that come up with the key throughout the entire game that show any interaction at all i got an ad for something i hate with all my geek passion before this video best and most complete review so far in my opinion how does this game compare to xenoblade chronicles 2 my switch has been collecting dust but after seeing this i have a reason to use it now seems like this game might be like xenoblade chronicles 2 where it has a pretty slow and rocky start its looks beautiful though i think im sold i heard all the hype and stayed skeptical but im starting to see it now i think i suffered from octoaddiction after doing the first chapter for the first 4 characters i picked the knight as my starter then went after the dancer then the doctor and now the merchant my favorite boss so far was the boss of the merchants story where you fight the pirate brothers it was actually the first boss the made me use olives of life revival item mostly because i did not know that the remaining pirate would have a special attack maybe i should kill them both at the same time so this would not happen oh wait i dont know how much health they have other then their names turning red to show that they are near death cant wait for chapter 2 best freaking game in the last couple of years was anyone else seriously irritated by how little interaction there will be between the characters its honestly one of the main reasons i play rpgs this reminds me a lot of saga frontier series and unlimited saga those were my favorite series from squaresoft back then bruh doesnt this gameplay remind you of bravely default maybe even better great stuff you know im not much for turn based jrpgs i mostly play action style jrpgs like the tales of series but i always respected the old style of turnbased games like chrono trigger and the oldschool final fantasy but i got to say ive only played about four hours so far but it has already captivated me and im enjoying seeing all the characters backstory and the world itself is just gorgeous as with the combat im actually glad its simple with a twist that aimple typw of gameplay is honestly the best instead of a complicated one pick this game up if you havent especially those that like oldschool final fantasy and you wont be dissapointed when i get the game i think im gonna start with haanit she seems cool i want it now octopath traveler is like british tv shows versus american tv shows and i am american by the way british shows depend on story first and special effects come second so even though it might look cheesy you are so engrossed in the story you dont care how good or real it looks american shows are all about special effects and visuals over story and the story is so bland and forgettable so when the show is over you are mostly talking about how great that one special move the flash did versus how good the story was you watch an entire episode of stupidness and only get hyped when they show that one special scene where he moves faster than a bullet or runs around the world so with the switch octopath will hold more memories and value in our minds than a final fantasy 15 or any other gorgeous heavy on the graphics 4k rpg with more visuals than story i really dont understand the whole everyones story in one playthrough if anything it seems like its not very replayable i just am so incredibly confused how if you level up characters or gain items how it wouldnt either make you op screw up the later chapters or just not straight up make sense which is why im really hesitant to buy the game it looks fun i just am worried that ill seriously not like the whole premise of not just one big grand story great review i felt the demo was a little drawn out and boring i still bought the game and now i know that it picks up ill stick with it a post game dungeon has been confirmed that ties the lore together havent gotten there yet this game just keeps on blowing my mind when you think youve discovered most of the game by getting all the characters the secondary job mechanic is introduced and suddenly the game mechanics are essentially doubled once youve made the first complete round around the bay you suddenly realize youve only discovered less than half the world when you think youve got a good moveset that works you suddenly realize how much more there is to the game and how different each character is in combat other things to note is how absolutely amazing some sites are how expansive the world feels at times how beautifully the music is composed and how well the dialogue is made the voice acting in both japanese and english is preformed and the stories are written all i really miss is a final plotarch that includes all the characters other than that the game is fantastic i absolutely love this game i will get the switch at black friday collectors is on its way i do plan to get this game but not now i still need to finish wolfenstein 2 south park mario tennis kirby and almost done with doom and mario odyssey when im done with at least two or three of them ill pick it up but i still need to pick up captain toad hyrule warriors and donkey kong as well man so many games to play so little time especially when you combine time for family friends work girlfriend gym pets etc i wont explain the rest what i do lol but playing video games is at a premium for me bought it can confirm is worth the money 1102 master go pleasure yourself best line im iffy on the game i love jrpgs like persona or xenoblade but final fantasybravely type stuff doesnt really catch my interest for too long ill probably pick this game up way down the line like in a few months as a birthday gift or something if the story is good enough to keep me interested then ill give it a shot but i really worry i will do what i did with bravely default or any ff where i would start it but just stop playing a few hours in cuz nothing caught my interest i got to the motorcycle section in ff7 months ago and i honestly havent even glanced back at it since i need a switch i cant believe how amazing this game is i cant put it down i have 21 ours and still love it and want more actually one of the best games since long another indie looking nintendo game thats cock is over sucked a few small things makes me not want to buy the game i want this on steam i am in love it with it 18hours later the weekend is over and my first reaction awesome demo oh not so cool but collectorsedi is nice but oh boy it is so good this game is complex and really beautifuli also fell in love with this one at the first time i saw it really wished they added a last chapterscenario adding all characters together on a big worldcountry ending event imagine if they make the most of this engine and remake a bunch of the older games was anybody else surprised that the game is 60 i just hope people play long enough to get their second party member combat is absolutely miserable and unfun until you get more party members goty candidate art direction at least honestly the problem i have with this game is that while im certain its a good game maybe even great and absolutely worth playing i cant convince myself its worth its current price its priced waaaaay too high guess ill have to wait a sale but sales on switch have proven to be nothing like sales on other platforms just curious which character is the black mage lite and fluffy beats this is a truly good literally just found out how to grind with olberic lmao for those complaining about this being an incomplete review you do realize theyre given this game maybe 2 weeks before launch and they have an embargo deadline to put up these reviews for some games its possible to beat in a small time frame but not an rpg especially on this scale just to clarify ign is good gamesplain is good stop the comparison and just watch more than one review people complaining about the no interactions between the characters i just dont get it its octopath traveler its a game of eight different stories a complete story for each character they only let you pick up the other characters to help fill out your party and then can do their stories as you do the first one you picked hell you can even not recruit any of the others and just do the story you like best its different i know but its fun in my opinion best 60 bucks i spent in a long time i havent completed all 8 stories yet only completed 1 myself but man im having a blast if you dont like the idea thats fine but please understand what the game was meant to be before complaining about something it never was supposed to be who knows maybe they might even do a dlc where all 8 are put together in one story as of now though do yourself a favor and enjoy the 8 you have this is like someone trying to sell me on reading war peace and trying to tell me its not boring its fun lol kinda reminds me of saga frontier from the 90snostalgiabut the music is freaking amazing the background drawing is stunning and just brings a lot of memories from old rpgsoverall love it to make the game brighter you can go into settings and turn off the dark corners setting its on by default ostara spring equinox terra earth so the name orsterra comes from the combination of these words this is a fantastically wellwritten and wellpresented review but my favourite thing about it is how the reviewer pronounces on as awn its seriously lovely nintendo switch hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the old final fantasy games need to be remade with this engine but 60 worthhhh my only complaint about this game is the fact that the characters dont interact much at all i feel like theyre just there and not really making a difference storywise i appreciate that they wanted to take a different approach to way their stories are told but i feel like it couldve been executed a little differently its just a personal gripe of mine but the rest of the game is outstanding if you have any sort of decent reading skills this game sucks the text comes up sooo fucking slowwwww is it worth 60 the presentation in this game is wonderful fantastic visuals and sounds its really a game you want to explore gonna purchase a switch just for this game when you choose a character do you have to go through the story of the 3 others in your party or can you just stick with one story and keep going leaving those other stories say for another play through remember the true final boss is rather hard to find so can you get all the game has to offer on one file or do i need to start as another character to get the full story just got home popping it in now loved how you can transfer your demo saved data are there summons good game worth 40 at most 60 is too much this game is a bit similar to live a live in concept 1051 uummmm this guy really wants the succ can anyone tell me gamexplains scales is liked a lot like an 8 i get numbers arent too accurate sometimes but i like to have a frame of reference along with the very well done detailed review how difficult would this game be for a newcomer to the jrpg style im an older gamer but leaned towards action rpg all of my days ill pass i hope the next one has a better story plot and more connection between the characters it has a final boss and a final dungeon that ties in all the stories gate of finis its a real shame not a single reviewer has got to that point and yet claiming it isnt in there i think you should have finished it first before reviewing maybe something interesting happens or opens up when all 8 characters have their stories finished like in live a live where a new chapter unlocks after all the characters have been experienced repetition in a game you dont say why must they strike the air when they attack i swear thats one thing i cant stand lol but the real question is there an endgame if you go into the setting you can turn off those dark corners im still not sure what it changes besides the darkness of course but its a good option if you dont like it being so dark ups been out for delivery since since 545 am with my game it needs to hurry up thanks for the review im still confused how you can play characters separately but meet up with the others along the way because like arent their levels going to be mismatched i guess there was kind of this issue with ff6 too if you spent too much time with the same party members but for octopath traveler do you need to switch to the other characters from time to time in order to keep their levels more or less matched is it possible to play the full game with 4 characters only or does it gets to hard than because so i could play the game twice once with female once with male characters how long did a boss fight usually take looks more like romancing saga 3 especially with that battle ui than ff6 also there are two other games from square that come to my mind which have several unrelated heroes that team up livealive and treasures of rudra both for the super famicom dammit now im feeling sold on this game my wallet nooooooooo wait so each play through is different if you choose a different starting character im really confused about that we need chinese language pls ive always had an obsessive personality so grinding andor repetition have never been a problem for me sounds like im going to love this then since the short comings mean nothing to me while im here whats the best way to get bluetooth audio for the switch so i can close my eyes and listen to this games sound track its so beautiful ironic that this game which draws some heavy influence from bravely default would also end up sharing that amazing games biggest flaw repetition still im supper stoked for this so much so that im still picking up the wayfarer edition i preordered so this repetitive thing is really turning me offbut it is just always the first chapter of each character or is it always like that is the game exclusive for the switch or will it eventually come to ps4xbox this review was so boring to watch i cant believe the day came where ign review was better than gx wait so you didnt finish the game i hate the lack of interaction chose olberic went to tressa shes just like oh youll help then theyre in the cave olberics just gone and she gets saved by random merchant guy even though olberics likea super knight he could easily deal with pirates so they just make him vanish for that part i value story over gameplay in an rpg so im disappointed dx gamexplain and arlo make the best reviews question can you rewatch story cutscenes this game pissed me off when i played the demo because i fought a bat that went first and put me to sleep and i died before i woke up gamexplain reviews ign reviews you guys rock derek completely sold me when he said ffvi complete the game before review the combat and everything looks so awesome about this game i loved the demo but i feel like im working towards nothing 8 stories and thats it lame i expected to kill god like you do in most jrpgs or to be working as a group towards one main objective combat is important to me and thats mainly what this review focuses on so thats great but all reviewers are stating that the stories arent even that great just average combine that with the fact that you dont really feel connected to your party that kills it for me character chemistry is extremely important to me when playing any rpg i was super hyped for this game but thanks to these reviewers who took the time to play it im now informed hope everyone who buys it enjoys the game c so the stories never really connect at all i feel like barely seeing half of a games content makes for a better first impression rather than a full review but hey i get it reviews get the views ready or not gotta strike while the irons hot right great review i cant wait to get the game tomorrow you need to do a discussion about this game with someone once you finish all the stories id love to hear some final impressions once ive finished it myself this guys voice though so you can swap between secondary jobs as you like once they become available or are you locked into a secondary once you set it on someone just wanted to comment to say this was a very well done review the music in this game is amazing but i have to admit i cant go back to 2d game anymore i prefer 3d its dont have to be like god of war2018 just like dragon quest 9 is enough this is the final fantasy game i have been waiting for since ffx when playing in docked mode i started to notice characts have verticalhorizontal lines moving in battles if you see it you cant unsee it this is good news to hear it seems like everyone likes this game what happened was i saw this one and then decided to read on online i beleive it was kotaku and they called it a botched experiment like really harsh they also said earlier that the game wasnt like ff 6 because it was bad then i read everyone elses reviews and they seemed to like it therefore im inclined to believe you i find it really intriguing that the heroes are sprites but the enemies arent during the battle system another great and informative review by derrick soooo every opening story is a prolouge doesnt sound like a problem would of been nice to have a reason to recruit all these people like building a dreamteam of heroes canterbury tales the game cant believe its been since last september ive been looking forward to this man what is up with all these negative nancies didnt derick get the game to review like a week before release assuming the game is 100ish hours theres not enough time to finish the game in that time unless derrick actually sacrificed sleep and day to day life things woof good thing i only watch review to get an idea and not let it define my decision i mean yeah its important to do your job but dont let kill ya either for an rpg review im comfortable with this besides that just means i get to learn about everyone elses story my way good job derrick is there any reason to get all 8 in a single playthrough or would 2 playthrough with 4 characters each do the same job i played the 1st demo and the 1hr demo i gotta say i knew from the 1st one day one for me dancer girl is best this game is so pretty just wanted to know can you do all the character endings on a single playthrough honestly i dont have a problem with derrick not finishing the game but it bothers me more than it probably should that derrick keeps calling boost points bonus points better than ign review thank you cant wait for tomorrow 60 bucks for an rpgmaker game fuck outta here would you be open to a mini addon to this review once you complete all the stories also do you think the fact that you had to power through the game for the review rather than play it in small bursts affected your perception of it 4060 hours into game qnd still no overarching plot to tie characters together is a big weakness for this game whatever that comes after woild simply feel rushed and forced httpswwwengadgetcomamp20180712octopathtravelerreviewswitchrpg considering that he put 40 hrs into a game in a bout a weeks time and is not finished with it says to me that theres a crap ton to do like let that sink in in 40 hours hes not in even a full 30 done with the game 40 hours ppl the avg game these days is finished in an entirety in 20 hrs this looks great i wish the pc version of the trails in the sky games would come out on switch too thats a massively underrated epic jrpg series that i recommend to anyone its more story heavy in a traditional way but also full of nostalgia for jrpg fans preorder switched to divinity original sins ii the fact there isnt a huge plot that brings all the characters together is really making me not want to get it i like gamexplain but not finishing the game and putting out a review just to make it in time for release and video hits is the beginning of a slippery slopewhats next where are the spiders lol arachnophobia sucks i honestly thought this would be rubbish i played the demo and now i love it to point of buying it when it comes out tomorrow and despite the wonderful first impression the game provides its actually the beginning thats the weakest holy shit so just to make sure i understand this since i finished the first chapter of primrose then got busy if i want to go to another characters story i just go to where it shows the character on the map amazing review im gonna get this but man i just wish i could find a good rpg with more complex dungeon crawling i feel like a lot rpgs recently have taken the linear route more often than getting truly lost in a dungeon to explore and survive in yeahi think ill pass on this one the demo just felt really boring to me and if the different chapters dont even converge together in the end its not even worth it man this looks very intriguing may make me actually take the plunge and purchase a switch saw a few screens of octopath this morning and was instantly blown away by the style colorization everything made me wonder if its all style over substance but that does not seem to be the case excellent review here youre a very good speaker awesome video upload thank you as an aside im a bit of an obsessive when it comes to shining force the turnbased strategy rpg iterations and this style in particular makes me dream what a freaking style this would be to express shining force iv should something so miraculous ever come to fruition i know refrain came out recently but im just not that interested need that turnbased grid action of sf1 sf2 sf3 this sliiiiightly disappoints me i was hoping for more interconnected bits to the story like i was hoping therions target would coincide with primroses at some point or something but it still sounds excellent this or xenoblade chronicles 2 going to go pick this up now cant wait i really like it but i wish the characters would interact with eachother more you mention the characters feeling a bit disjointed from each other and a minor issue with pacing due to the game encouraging you to do multiple chapter 1s in a row do you think these issues would have been present if it was structured more like livealive with each story being separate and playable in any order until they come together in a final chapter you unlock when you complete them all with maybe each having a party of side characters for their chapter and then the final chapter being two parties of the four protagonists i cant wait to get this game tomorrow it seems like a more forgiving and exciting final fantasy vi about character stories converging tressas mother talks about the region ophelia lives in the fallen kingdom that cyrus teaches to his pupils at the beginning of his story is the kingdom that olberic once served hornburg also the dragonstone that therion is sent to search after could relate to the sacred flames of ophelias story im not sure how primrose and haanit could intertwine with the other stories but so far i firmly believe that the stories will gradually connect thirdparties and indies really have been carrying the switch this year how many chapters are there did mention the size of the play area is the map too small i feel like with this game they are really putting out feelers for a possible ffvi remakes im not saying its confirmed wayminute are they talking about what i think they are 1040 im sure ill really enjoy it but in the back of my head im going to be thinking id be enjoying a bravely third more boosting and the job mechanics just sound like a step down from their counterparts in bravely only choice i dont understand is forcing you to keep the first character you choose in the party why not let me switch that guy out to everyone complaining that he didnt finish the game before giving a review honestly it really depends on the rpg and how much crunch time he has i could beat a game like tales of the abyss in around 4550 hours but that would require me skipping practically every sidequest derek said he spent 48 hours and finished 28 with the rest at about the halfway point thats a pretty long game length regardless if there happens to be a final chapter or even quests and events he may have missed there should be a final chapter after you beat the other 8 stories bravely default and second have amazing endgames im still not feeling this game for one the graphics big imo look ugly it has the same problem i have with the ds pokemon games 2d sprites in a 3d world make akl the 2d things look like paper cutouts the combat looks generic the world looks generic the stories look generic even the title of the game is uncreative nothing sticks out to me gonna pick my copy next week damn the pixel art is gorgeous you spoil a way to much oof i was really excited for this game major disappointment can you even complain about a turn based rpg being repetitive its the same thing the entire game lol i started with hannit in the demo i like her ability to capture animals and use them later and the way the story is told is very reminiscent of saga frontier for psone the characters cross paths but rarely meet up if ever the chapters are too short i wish thered be at least 6 chapters per character isnt repetition that greatest enemy of every jrpg i totally get the want for an over arching story but i think its pretty cool theyre trying a new structure out cool cant wait till tomorrow this review feels a bit rushed just to meet the time slot right before game launch i think you should have finished the game before doing this review because all this does is give me an incomplete view on how this game holds up is it worth completing everyones story with this review i have no real idea octo path traveler endless eight i cant wait for this games release tomorrow its going to keep me busy summer long glad i wasnt expecting somthing goty worthy like persona 5 or divinity original sin 2 when i preordered that was a really well done and in depth review derrick that also doesnt spoil anything anyone who thinks you need to sit down and finish a game you already put 40 hours in that also doesnt have one single narrative behind it in any meaningful way to truly know how you feel about a game clearly dont know how reviews work and are lying to themselves when i played persona 5 i already knew 40 hours in that i absolutely loved the game and seeing the story through to the end didnt change that yeah there are some plot bumps here and there but it would have had to completely jump off a cliff with its story and completely change game play styles for me to change my feelings on it and thats a game where its overarching story is the most important thing good on you btw for explaining where you were at when you started to write this review it really helps with review honesty if i understood correctly if you want to recruit all of the characters in one of their paths you have to go through their prologues in the others path like if i want to recruit tressa when i started as ophilia i have to go through her prologue story even though im playing ophilias story and id have to do this with everyone in every path if i want to have all options available how many side quest are there how good is end game content how much replay value is there is there a new game plus or anything that boosts replay value oh wait you cant tell me any of this because you didnt play the entire game 749 octopath has dd style multiclassing darn i already bought mario tennis and it sucks lol off 612 you really didnt like ophilia damn 900 hp whene every one is at 2000 she most be quite underlvl tho may be it just her hp that dosent scale whit lvl afterall her hp was never her best thing so it may be that but still seem odd to have 700 hp dif over 900 hp unite thank you for the review i think xenoblade chronicle 2 is better by the sound of it but i will get this game eventually good review cant wait to play it tomorrow im not mad just disappointed they didnt need to post the review immediately but they did he must have gotten the game with enough time to finish it before embargo but he didnt post game and the general finale are still incredibly important aspects that can affect someones opinion i expected a little more from derrick a real shame the music kills for suuuuure but this is coming from someone who likes english dubs i thought the voicework clashed heavily against the games structure this is one weird case where i was it was only textbased i wouldve taken way more of the stories seriously if id read them in my head which also fits with the era theyre trying to recreate one improvement that wouldve greatly mitigated the clash for me is the feature fire emblem echoes used where there was an autoplay button demo was fun but the amount of grinding is brutal and i dont have the patience in my old age to play these types of games anymore captain toad is what i am going to buy the wii u version was a blast ive just not seen enough from this game to buy it i may pass on it tomorrow to be honest very good review i dont have the game but it looks amazing thanks for doing a indepth review you are the best expected from the xplaining god i dont understand why there are so many people bitching like children about this game just because theres little character interaction whether theres an overarching story or not means very little the entire point of this game is eight different stories that you experience bravely third awesome review way better and packed with content than others about the two issues you found 1this is an old style jrpg the problem dungeon boss loop is the essence of old jrpgs 2 almost anybody is going to finish a jrpg in one sitting any jrpg will feel repetitive after a while it is something that you take on bursts 3 boost points not bonus points after this video you are doing on purpose this sounds like a first impression and not a final review he should have waited and completed the game before doing the final review thank you for the deep review its good to see someone have a realistic take on it this game is phenomenal and in my opinion game of the year i know some people will not enjoy it but growing up with turnbased rpgs this game scratches an itch long forgotten i cant stop talking about this game ive posted three videos even with two more to come i think this game is worth picking up if you dont usually play jrpgs at least give the demo a try what can that hurt who knows you might discover a genre you didnt know you enjoyed looks boring sad to say cancelling preorder thanks for the review derek the bonus points remind me of the brave attacks in bravely deafault one of the best rpgs ive ever played and thats why im hyped for this one ign review was very shallow compared to this you took the time to explain the systems in depth a great thing for nonjrpg connoisseurs like me good job as octopath and the bravely series are made by the same studio and have very similar gameplay i gotta honesty say bravely default and especially bravely second are a lot more enjoyable when it comes to story and characters wish we woulda got bravely third for the switch instead of this ps everyone over exaggerates bravely defaults end game as being tedious as that whole segment of repetition lasts no more than two hours and has completely new events and dialogue i might just start off with 4 and beat their stories and do the other 4 who cares if you didnt finish it i will this game reminds me of dragon quest 4 but without a final chapter at least the repetition doesnt seem to be as bad as in bravely default this battle system sounds like an even deeper version of what was in bravely default which was already one of my favorite battle systems in an rpg this game sounds amazing turning off corner shadows lets you enjoy the sights more btw was introduced in 2nd demo and i love it just commented because he said world looks dark and you can see corner shadows are on other reviews confirm that later in the game that the stories converge friends an analysis is done in depth do not do it if you really did not play it well not because you judge a game by the title of the game i have been saving for a switch and would be able to get it soon but the number of games i wanna play would kill me slowly splatoon mario kart pokemon fire emblem legend of zelda monster hunter smash bros xenoblade and now this help on a more serious note though no matter how many times people told me to move on to a better console my stand will always be the same nintendo games just suits me more im sad to hear the stories and characters dont weave together in a interesting way i can understand being bothered by him not fully completing the game but the reactions seem kinda uncalled the review wasnt even negative he showered the game with praise and the few complaints seemed minimal and more related to how he had to plow through the game due to having a schedule to follow im actually wondering if the ones complaining watched the full of video or rushed to comment after his first complaint during the first chapters thank you for this honest review character interactions and grand narratives are 1 on my list of things i want in an rpg and you saved me from buying a game that isnt for me the demo really made it seem like it would feature those but your review cleared up my assumptions i would have been livid had i gotten 10 hours in only to realize the game didnt have these things think i just gonna stick with 4 characters on first playthrough and then 2nd one with the other ones or is this not possible or a bad idea great review btw this is the review i have send that says the story gets better after all the initial chapters are out of the way maybe ill wait for a sale on this there are secret jobs omg im so excited i wish they didnt add the vignette style i thought that was dumb im pretty sure after completing 2 full stories and being at the end of the others is good enough to know whether or not a game is good heck id be uninterested if the game only got good after you beat the whole game like whats even the point you dont need to complete a whole jrpg to know its quality you might miss something here or there but overall after 45 hours you should know whether or not you like the game and how you feel about it plus if there is anything special gamexplain will probably do a post review theyve done it before would you recommend playing through the game with 4 characters but only focusing on one story then focusing on another story when you finish one picking up a new party member and so on ive had mine pre ordered for a while demo sold me on it will be perfect to play on the go sad you didnt finish the game before reviewing it i choose haniit first i didnt regret it is it possible to turn off random encounters getting my switch in august and this is one of the two games i am getting for it id rather try this myself when i get a switch its one ive been looking forward to also it looks great please do a light spoilers review or something after you finish would be nice to get info on if theres a final chapter what to expect from postgame etc i mean there are only a few issues with this game the fact that there is no sort of larger story to the game is an issue and honestly makes the world you are in feel less meaningful as you are only focusing on individual characters with shorter stories but dont get me wrong this is a long game if you wish to fully play each characters story which the game clearly recommends then there is a lack of interaction between party members it just makes it feel like the characters are not connected in any way or dont care for one another more interaction between them would of really helped to make them seem more involved but apart from those things this is a pretty flawless game im sick and tired of people nitpicking about stuff like the 16 bit art style as it looks incredible while also focusing too much on the games shortcomings the best way to play this game is to take your time and really take in the world and characters within it too bad the nature of getting reviews out qui finally time to use my 3 hour demo i hope this eventually makes its way to steam out of 10 derrick like it a lot i swear the number of people complaining that a reviewer hasnt finished every story is insane this was still a wonderfully deep review that i really think fleshed out the nuances of the game and the experience one had playing it it was never stated that this was the definitive opinion on the game just the overall feel and experience also if youve never seen gamexplains reviews before there are almost always follow up discussions with the other people that help flesh out things missed in the reviews so dont sweat it people are acting like just because only a couple of the stories were fully completed that all the rest were completely ignored for all we know he could be on the final chapters of the others but wanted to make sure that those who were interested in the game knew the pluses and minuses on day 1 imagine a new golden sun game in this art style mouth waters isnt the bonus point system not 11 from bravely default i personally never thought the 2d and 3d meshed well one more day lets go boys is it friday yet sounds like following all 8 character arcs in one playthrough is not the way to go about it if i ever purchase this ill only be following 12 characters arcs at a time per playthrough i wont be able to play it for me than 1 or 2 hours a day so im sold now i just need the money p my first thought about this game is saga frontier 1 remember that game start as any character and travel to find t260g any characters story will be a breeze to go through glad you made the review and played the game hope that you make a followup review to get the full picture the long dialog scenes are killing me i just want to play the game i play about one jrpg a year this is easily my favorite 2018 jrpg very excited for it next time just lie about finishing the game so theres less bitching in the comment section 1103 best pg way to say go fuck yourself please do another video after finishing the game i love the demo and i instapre purchase the game already i cant to play the full game folks in the comments complaining about him not completely finishing the game i would normally agree but in a game like this without a larger narrative tying them all together it doesnt really matter youd effectively get the same review whether he completed 2 characters or 8 youre going to like some stories more than others the party scarcely interacts with one another theres no overall narrative the enemies get trickier as you go along with the final boss being the pinnacle the game is best enjoyed in small bursts etc etc these are all things that hold true regardless unless you want derrick to start giving spoilers the review is about as informative as its gonna get good to have a great third party exlusive for nintendo doesnt happen very often its an rpg repetition is in its dna also if your rushing through it to get all characters of course itll feel bland i enjoyed meeting each character one by one starting from ophelia going clock wise every time i meet a new member i take my time with that characters chapter and mechanics setting a goal to reach like dont complete this chapter until reaching 10 lvl higher or be even with my party can you change your secondary job at any time why does the wait for friday feel so long right now lol the way i see it if youve played a game for 45 hours still havent finished it and think its worth a buy its worth a buy maybe the other 50 hours of the game arent fun but at least you got 45 hours of fun out of it and thats more fun then i get out of a lot of games ps ive never had a game where the first half was fun and the second half wasnt an equal or better experience thanks for the review as a fan of bravley default ill be sure to pick this one up remake ff6 in this engine its 85 on metacritic get ready people the game of the summer is here thanks for the review picking it up tomorrow i dont mind that you havent 100 the game yet you have clearly put enough hours into the game to give a fair analysis of whether the game is worth picking up or not i find myself agreeing with you guys on most games so im glad i got your thoughts prior to purchasing it thanks for all you guys hard work i know you were already told this in a previous video but its boost points not bonus points the grand tale will be save for the sequel path action scrutinize its 1200 its the 13th today the game is released thanks for the update crescendo is pronounced creshendo not cresendo if you havent beat the game then this isnt even a review its an early impression cant wait cant wait sounds like i made the right decision and ys viii and shining resonance are the better summer rpgs because this one has a ton of solid ideas but manages to fall completely flat in others like having nothing to tie the stories and characters together it wouldnt even have to be anything cliche or elaborate maybe one of them catches wind of a legendary treasure in a hidden dungeon and a lot of party members also want to investigate and the others are just going to support their friends or maybe there is a bad guy who is behind several characters problems so they want to take him down and the unaffected characters are just going to support their new friends just make it so it feels like the characters have all formed a deep bond and connection with each other was finally going to get splatoon 2 today guess im putting it on hold again for this give me this right freaking now thats a shame i was very excited for the games way of story telling as it is similar to dragon quest 4s intro chapters to each party member however octo doesnt seem to have the same structure to the story so all their stories dont overlap and its lacking in the character banter and those were the things i was most looking forward to seeing i hope this game does well btw i been wondering for awhile now how come you guys sometimes use the animatednonanimated rating smiles wait it came out today and i preorderred it to kotaku claiming they completed all 8 stories in 36 hours at least you guys didnt rush it in order to get max views its coming home pre purchased it to avoid wasting money on food the anticipation is killing me say if you start as therion can you change your head character or will that always be therion how viable would a pure evil run be characters whose abilitys decrease trust and a pure good run it looks good and all but no enemy hp gauge ill play banner saga until fire emblem arrives 1052 you can actually turn up the brightness in the games settings please give final thoughts when you finish it stopped watching at i only got halfway through 68 of the characters stories and i dont know of there is a final chapter look i look forward to these reviews but dont rush one out for a game you havent finished that sounds like final fantasy 13 ive seen reviews from people who have at least completed the game and honestly im very disappointed ill pass is it better than bravely default if yes its a buy if not i consider bravely default a failure so if octopath traveller is worse then its a nonbuy 9310 from ign so that fear i mentioned in the preview is at least half true the freedom does dissuade the connectivity of each story but each story is good enough to make that point almost irrelevant anyway glad to know this really is that good im so looking forward to picking it up tomorrow along with captain toad i wish you explained how you can tackle sidequests in different ways with an example or two or even showed an example of the voicework you praised the review was kinda lacking for me not just due to lack of completion oh how many chapters for each character so its kinda like bravely default when it comes to the battle system yeah i knew the 8 protagonist with different storys could be messy in the beginning this games combat system to me looks like a more boring version of bravely defaults combat for those complaining about the fact that theres no main storythe name is octopath traveler its impliedi see octopath as a market ressearch for the gaming industry epic games will come if this sells well one of my favorite games to bring up to switch owners at work gamestop respect for being honest that the game isnt complete but hope youll look at it again after youve finished i was keen to at least know how it was holding up as the demo did make me a little concerned about the story structure but it sounds like it should be just fine really sounds a bit like livealive or ffiv the after years both of which i think are great games definitely something ill keep my eye on unfortunately ill have to hold this off for awhile thank you tires ive been waiting weeks for these reviews i didnt want to buy a switch for just odyssey and botw this may be the game that finally gets me to cave not that this is a system seller but what finally makes me purchase the console this game could have been made by an indie dev with a price of 20 instead its from a big dev and they charge 80 thanks but no thanks thanks for the good review as much as i love the art style and music the battle system just doesnt click so its on hold for now also derrick could you add a part 2 to this review after you complete it already preordered i will pick it up tomorrow at lunch something to make note of some people who data mined some info found a song called final battle you can find it on youtube sounds amazing that many people that have finished a few individual storylines havent encountered yet so there is still hope for a final chapter of sorts but best to keep expectations low and be excited for what we know is in the game for sure just preorder so then i can pick up tomorrow just a few hours to play it yay i would be very surprised if theres no global arc at the end of the game at all i mean otherwise the game would essentially have no ending of its own and please if for whatever reason like people getting the game early you know the answer please dont spoil it here i dont want to know and most likely most people dont want either very excited about the unlockables jobs and how secondary jobs are handled im afraid the game isnt using all its potential because of the 8 stories structure and the lack of jobs and skills overall but it still looks super super good i cant wait the part that tells that this game doesnt have major character interactions and one grand interwoven story killed my hype it seems like the bravely dev isnt really competent at making epic stories oh well i better save my octopath money for fe three houses next year i dont like how all of you reviewers have beaten like 4 characters half of the game and calling it good like what thats not a review thats an impression oh well im still hyyyyyyype for this so everyone buy octopath traveler waiting for your new analysis on the new lets go trailer guys reviewing a game you havent yet finished is not ok it goes against the very point of a review what if everyone else did this the developers put a lot of time and effort into creating this story the least you can do is finish it a quick follow up video describing how the last few chapters compare would be at least a start if you go down that road the metacritic scores will mean nothing now octopath traveller avg score 85 with only 30 of reviewers actually finishing it huh thats interesting next time complete it before u review it if theres no overall plot to unite all the stories then i see no point in this game the games this is based on mainly ff6 had great stories and a feeling of a party forming around their journey it this game has none of these its just a big miss wait the enemies are on the left and player on the right thats weird right boy am i glad i already have 4 of the characters in the demo that i can transfer over so it suffers from the classic jrpg problem of having a slowpaced beginning i guess this just comes with the territory octopath traveler review scores digitally downloaded perfect 5 stars famitsu 3640 gamexplain likesalot ign 93 out of 10 nintendolife 9 out of 10 excellent nintendoworldreport 9 out of 10 eurogamer recommended gamespot 8 out of 10 the games machine 87 out of 10 im definitely getting this game this game looks great so excited for this game skajskssk it would be better if you waited to review until you actually beat it sacrifice views to get a complete opinion inspired a bit by final fantasy 6 as johnny loves meeting bravely default which i love what i really dislike is the level difference for chapter 2 i just want to continue cyrus story kinda bummed it doesnt have an overworld loved that in the old jrpg classics still looks like the best jrpg in a long time huge improvement over what we have had for many years dont have a switch yet but this will be the first game i buy when i do if this sells well enough i think it will it bodes well for the future of turn based jrpgs so happy i preordered octopath traveler as a huge golden sun fan i got all the right vibes from the first demo and even more so with the second demo this game with the story graphics replayability and stunning soundtrack will satisfy me in the jrpg genre for this year and my desire for a long awaited new golden sun title cant wait to play it this weekend i feel a vibe from bravely default so strong on this isnt it boost points and not bonus points 26th everyone remember this review is technically incomplete as he has not finished the game nor knows if there are additional features and such after the main game is over personally i hope there is new game plus at some point the battle system seems like itll get old quick i think bravely default is significantly better in this regard im conflicted im disappointed that you put out a review for a game that you didnt finish on the other hand i dont think rushing through a game to get the review out is the way to do it either i have a bad taste in my mouth but i cant present a solution either kind of hypocritical i guess but i cant help feeling that way edit actually im happy that you made it clear that you didnt finish the game and making a separate review once you finish all 8 stories would kind of fix this give it some thought okay thanks hell yeah for the studios first game it seems really awesome and gives me slight golden sun vibes with the visual style i hope that they continue with tacticslike game and action rpgs as well my copy arrives tomorrow cant wait still playing through shining resonance refrain though so as you recommend derrick ill play a chapter or two in octopath then play some srr and repeat good way to play two jrpgs simultaneously lol picking this up tonight no question starting with ophillia a dedicated healer is usually really helpful in games like this especially if i cant take them off my team gameexplain reviews games way more in depth than ign i cant wait to pick this up tomorrow so hyped does it get censored in anyway i really cant wait for this game good job on the review derrick and i look forward to hearing your final thoughts once you finish the game octopath traveler easily my own goty so is it better than 3ds rpg orily i thought it was splatoon 2 update xd old school rpg the best square wants 60 bucks for this mind you is the whole game in japanese is it worth playing cause i have played both bravely default and 2 chrono trigger and ffvi remake with octopath graphics would be the dream i sub just found your channel lol your 2 favorite stories were my two least favorite primroses theme was wholesale plagiarized from the anime madoka magica so im coming back to this video after trying to get into octopath a 3rd time am i a bad person if i say i love this game but i always get like 30 hours into the game and get annoyed by how damage spongey the bosses are i just accepted even though i love this game it may not be for me i am not a fan of saga frontier style gameplay so essentially they merged a saga game with a bravely game never been too much into depth of field but it looks like with this game its essential i love the graphical style and art direction looking forward to playing it when it comes out on pc thanks for the review why are there always like 5 ads that play during your videos they arent even that long your videos but so many ads they changed bp from battle points to boost points nope im out as a big fan of saga series and saga frontier this game makes me ache for a switch its actually the only reason im looking for one one day ur gonna poke ur eye out with that thumb buddy im 70 hours into this and im still absolutely in love with this game great review a side note i absolutely love that tales of destiny 2 box in the background d ive been playing it lately so it was exciting to see i was disappointed by this game i got bored half way through graphics and battle system is over the top but bad story no hidden characters or puzzles the world felt too small ff6 still the best and i hope to see a remake with this graphics or at least a similar game that close to ff6 or maybe a lunar remake or just remaster looks like a psp game hope the gameplay is better than bravely cause it looks dated this is probably my game of the year the gameplay is so good the true final boss was a very satisfying fight character zero interaction even when their party member meet with life and death situation is really unnatural and stupid there is a scene when a character got stab what are other party members doing let her bleed to death then appear some banter scene come on banter is just a cheap shot at giving false illusion of interaction but doesnt has any impact on the overall story and at the end all 8 characters plot doesnt have direct connection then what brings them together might as well let random villager woman looking for her son into the party why these specifically 8 characters makes no differencetheir plot and life are not link anyway every chapter is mindless and repetitive jus go to some spot mark on map then follow cutscene sucks one of the best rpgs i had played in many years great review 1258 cringe i want this game now on ps4 which is better octopath o ys viii i want final fantasy vi to be remade using a graphical mixture of bravely default octopath traveler and those 3d final fantasy iii and iv remakes this game has the most painful characters and story also the world is one of the most uninteresting worlds ive ever had the misfortune of wasting time on only redeeming feature is the combat most overhyped game i have ever seen just wanted to drop a comment to say that your reviews presentation and execution were exceedingly pleasing to watch and listen looking forward to watching your other videos subbed i hope they stick with this formula and improve on it for like 5 or 6 games this game felt like work no fun at all ive stopped after 25 hours and started xenoblade chronicles 2 this game rocks would you say this game is worth buying a switch for three ads interrupted the video i have to unsubscribe sorry octopath traveler is one of the best rpgs ive ever played i put 120 hours into it and now that i have fully completed it i still want to go back and play it again i will do so after playing zelda the stories could have been more intertwined sure but i felt that it was pretty cool having 8 individual stories to complete in one game you have the best voice for these reviews derek at least games like this show that square somewhat cares about old school jrpgs as well as the bravely series this is exciting can you imagine ffvl and chrono trigger remake in this style how many hours did it take you to finish to bad the story sucked ass not convinced about this game from what ive both seen and heard it lacks personality which is the worst offender and rpg can do imo especially if its turn based primroses story made least sense to me lets become a prostitute for years because there might be a small chance that one of my fathers killers comes by so i can then start following distant storys about them to take my revenge oh sorry master ill but my mouth back where it belongs the other thing about the dark abilities is they dont need a level they are based on probabilities so as a lvl 1 character you can get an item from an npc that would need level 60 from a light ability so yeah they lower reputation but gives you an enormous advantage if you get those items little late to the party huh this game dropped 3 months ago you and alfyn look alike is that why hes one of you fav story you capture the essence of this wonderful gem so well m8 team synergy and combat was beyond thrilling only complaint i had was the grinding equired to beat the optional dungeon boss had to draw the line there sadly solid video as always keep up the great work superderek i know what you mean derek a big reason i bought this game is because it embodies what the 90s rpg felt like very moody and atmospheric i dont have a switch but my mom does so i talked my dad into getting this for her for their 50th wedding anniversary she had gotten more than half way through the game when she accidentally erased her whole file i dont know why but the cheeseball thumbs up makes me smile every time also glad to see this review out i know stuffs been crazy i may be the only person who thinks this but i actually think an ff6 in this style wouldnt do much for the game not much would really be changing about the game at all i would much prefer a ff4 ds style of remake just my opinion though side note its so funny how everybody connects with different characters in this game very unique i say about time but also worth the wait well done man well done 1300 you almost cracked the air with that hand whip this game may honestly be my favorite of all time during my initial playthrough i couldnt put it down the characters music visuals and battle system all combine into a complete gem of a game i found the storytelling to be refreshing and when it all comes together at the endgame it was so worth it also tressa is the best char free nice new game room good to see you get your stuff back and on the shelf even if they broke your good shelves and lost things that are irreplaceable documenting your bad experience will hopefully help many people in the future during their travels keep up the good rpg work also of note is the way each story is broken up into chapters each taking an hour or so to accomplish this made a big difference to me rpgs can often feel overwhelming with the amount of things that need to be done or where to go i liked being able to pick up and put down this game an hour or two at a time great video i cant help but compare this game and dqxi it is hard to believe both games were published by the same company the music art and gameplay are so focused in octoand so all over the place in dq i cant believe i prefer octopath but i do a lot i wanted to play octo all the way through halfway into dq and i wanted to just get it over with and never hear the soundtrack again great review derek im thoroughly enjoying the game myself ive gotten a little distracted with the wealth of switch content im just meagerly making my way through the game savoring and enjoying much the same as others nice to see the game collection im glad the nightmare is over this channel is of my favorites keep up the great work ill play it when it comes to pc because i am never getting a switch after the wiiu fiasco i need to get a switch fantastic review i have the exact same preference of character stories with alfyn and primrose at ththe top and hannit at the bottom im super glad to hear you enjoyed this game as much as i did great to have you back my dood i feel like this was the perfect game for your comeback hey mate review ys origin great work unfortunately i cant play it hope that it makes its way to ps4 that box of tales of eternia uwu in the next jrpg news dont forget to talk about the fan translation of shin megami tensei if was released yesterday well ive gone almost 20 hrs past octopath traveler so far and i am amazed and constantly looking forward to unveiling the next chapters the game is so addictive its finally here i wish i had started with alfyn because i relate to him so much too bad my love of archers got me to pick haanit instead good to see you back in fighting form derek yay normal review vids are back you have come a long way with your game reviews well written and spoken with good points i loved octopaths town segments so much it just felt so cool to run about interacting with the world and characters and being truly rewarded for it just so cool great review derek youre so classy with your conversation about games i know youd never explain the game under false pretences and then claim it as a negative wont name any names superderek for rpg king hey man glad to see the game collection back ive missed it glad you finally got most of your stuff back great to see you back and making review videos super derek im looking to get a switch soon and octopath traveler is top of my list im just glad the gaming community overwhelmingly showed developers that there is still a hunger for games like this hey derek i was really excited for this game sadly i got bored by the lack an interesting story after the first parts for each of the characters i was really craving an old school rpg luckily i got dq11 shortly after i just loved that game game was mediocre at best love letter to octopath traveler glad to see you doing reviews again derek im glad you enjoyed this game derek so good to hear your game collection theme its been too long my friend great review derek i love this game its my game of the year keep up the good work its been said before but ill keep saying it until se listensan ffvi remake in this style would be amazing i was like 40 hours into this game when my switch broke still havent restarted it yet hope things are getting back to normal for you derek waiting for the inevitable ps4 port i would be shocked if this remains a switch exclusive edit sounds like nintendo published the game in the americas so a ps4 port seems very unlikely thats ok cant win them all ive got other jrpgs to play anyway d great review we share many similar thoughts about this game even now im kinda itching to play it again with a new lead character why is it so beautiful greatly appreciated wish i could still donate on your streams but ive fallen into hard times nice ive been waiting for this one for a while now excited to see what you have to say about it thanks for letting us share this experience with you so glad to see you back at it derek welcome back to my favorite series the game collection d awesome video even with all the games that came out this year including dq11 octopath traveller is my goty for 2018 beside from the lack of interaction with characters and the final dungeon being stupidly hard to find the music graphics battle system and the individual stories are amazing well most of the stories the bravely team is the only team i care about right now in square this game has amazing water graphics imo nice review its nice to see you getting back into the swing of things after the move review wise i do absolutely love this game but there are a few things that ive thought would be nice to add looking back at when i first played it one such thing would be making the minimap a bit more useful as its more of just a waypoint pointer in a black space which just feels a bit offputting having a proper little map there of the area wouldve been so nice the stories all being their own separate thing is also sliiightly disappointing the stories themselves were all great and tressas was so heartwarming but it doesnt feel right having your party go through this ordeal a huge boss fight only for the game to then act like the main character of that story just did it on their own lastly the final area put me off from finishing the game as i took it on while debatable being underprepared and under leveled for some of my party members this meant that after i went through the whole boss rush and then got wiped out by the final boss id have to reload a save from before i another fantastic review the game looks amazing and i cannot wait to play it i need to finish a few other games persona 5 mostly before picking this up keep up the great reviews and other content awesome video dude keep it coming discovered you through happy console gamer huge fan of you both is adding a new resource innovation really i feel octopath traveler does a brilliant job at leaving the stories to your imagination for example these individuals are only adventurerstravelers tackling at their own needs and coincidentally coming across others doing the same while one is doing their quest in a villagetown the others are doing their own thing therion snagging a few items tressa bargaining so on and so forth theyre really only helping each other when they really need it as they do in boss fights im absolutely not saying that there are no flaws what so ever but im only implying that if you really think about it there isnt so much imo this is a game thatll stay finished the game and its definitely not a 9 voice acting is very inconsistent and sometimes even annoying altho the music is very good the mediocre story of most characters goes from being boring to being ok the pacing in the game is a problem too and difficulty spikes in some dungeons dont help it either most of the secrets and routes are hidden with objects blocking your view so youll have to hug every wall and walking into the background makes it even worse because of the camera its by no means a bad game its a pretty ok jrpg but not a 9 by far a 710 would be more fitting as im being slightly generous shittiest review ive ever seen in my fucking life octopath is fucking great fucking just shut the fuck up tbh the style reminds me of paper mario in terms of depth etc my only few disappointments of the game is that the narrative for each characters are kept seperate sure you have the option to speak to your own party members here in there but it hinders the structure of a good plot and the dungeons or caves leading up to the boss fights all pretty much look the same incredible game though this is imo a love letter to the fans of old turn based jrpgs hope they continue with these games in the future as theres still a strong fan base of these type of games guys this game has a secret final boss that is worth 60 by itself just saying the sharp point of focus with exaggerated focus blur is known as a tilt shift lens effect i just started this game and its absolutely incredible i want to see a golden sun next game that looks like this game i love alfyn and tressa but their stories are pointless the worse for me one of the more under appreciated part of this game is the ui god i love this games ui i did thief in the game it feels like i am playing pokemon but i must steal it all that background lore that connects the 8 almost completely separate stories at the end isnt really worth it to me well the over the top stories of snes and such era games arent that interesting in respect it is fun to play though im 30 hours in this is the 2nd best game on the switch followed closely behind zelda breath of the wild its the perfect game to pick up and play at either short or long intervals game pacing and difficulty is perfect and the longer you play and upgrade your characters the more you feel the progress youre making 8 char 8 basic classes plus 4 secret class completed all classes for all 8 char time for side quests then for secret boss what a shame they cant get it right they make super boring storys for a jrpg bravely default was bad second was bad and this has a lame story too can we get this game on the mobile so everyone can enjoy it imo the absolute best part is the bosses and i dont usually say this ive done 24 of them so far and only 1 has disappointed purely just for being out of nowhere each and every other one has put a big goofy grin on my face either because theres genuine stakes interesting story beats kickass music or a genuinely enjoyable mechanic game looks amazing on my hdr set its not 4k but the lighting is awesome graphics wise the the blurr filter used is too tense its jarring imo ive only been really addicted to playing 5 games in my life and they were all action game ie re4 never liked an rpg until octopath i have become addicted dont know why but cant sleep so far this is my goty 2018 such a masterpiece i know ill be humming the music in the game for years so memorable and polished my recommendations gave me a trashy reviewer of this game he was a hater this video has restored the feeling toward this game again and my heart overall why is 59 dollars the witcher 3 and zelda was the same price did the same work and cost when into this game the success of games like this always make me chuckle at the adderall addicted kids who keep claiming that turn based combat has no place in rpgs anymore quit saying that the stories do not connect and that there is no overarching narrative factually its wrong and its been proven why do reviewers simply put get this wrong do they not finish games before they review great colors and the storys are beautiful and perfect written i really love them they went into the feels the character do interact and the storys combine at the end but i really prefer having different storys i just wish square would make a direct sequel to chrono trigger i dont understand how everyone can praise this game as something unique among even its own kind while simultaneously describing without stating the games core appeal as a shallow and contentlacking retread of bravely default its actually maddening to see so many outlets heap praise on this game and hold it above others for doing what those games its specifically held above do markably better im loving this game 9 out of 10 excellent review but imo i believe and 8 out of 10 is better whats killing it for me is the repetitive dungeons and plot layout what i mean is you start a tale talk to a few people later in the game you use that characters special ability to progress go to a boring dungeon and kill the boss what i enjoyed most was exploring to new areas and challenging my team with monsters way above my level characters only earn bp at the end of turns in which they havent been used i really like the story structure it feels unique too bad this isnt on 3ds i wonder if it even can nice review great game thanks guys i really want to try this game but i am not sure if i am ready for a jrpg i have to be completely in the mood for one my tolerance for them are 1 for every few years lol i wish konami does suikoden 6 with a suikoden 2 style of graphics w 3d background i just drank 44oz of coffee snorted an 8 ball of crack cocaine and took a shot of adrenaline straight to the jugular and this review still put me to sleep the game has a bonus level that unites the stories and also has a part in where you learn by talking to the people a lot about the characters and the world so you all saying it doesnt have any story are wrong plus each character has its own journeystory it not having a single epic story is a deal breaker for me to be honest i didnt think i would enjoy this game before i played the demo i was never this wrong about a video game in my life the story and the fact therere no puzzles switches levers block pushing etc in dungeons or paths are the only aspects of the game im not fond of it makes me wish there was more than only just small dead ends with chests then again im still less than 10 hours in so who knows everything else is phenomenal the music the art and the combat i hope that final fantasy 7 comes as octopath traveler i want to play all characters story square enix as of now dont have the narrative as cool or great as they had i dont even think ff7 remake will be here by 2025 they should just make octopath travelers version stories interact and solves a problem this is worth it first time ive ever heard them make something this positive halfway through and not a single negative thing incredible game back to the golden age of the jrpg genre i love the game besides not having a story its kinda refreshing and the game pretty much guarantees a second play through so you can focuse on 4 characters instead of trying to train all 8 sorry bravery default and second had a way better story making it better xd turn based ftw cute game how can you mention bravely default and not tell us fans its the same dev team working on octopath try a little harder next time p just kidding but seriously big miss to drop that info in but lastly this game is amazing well no proper story no game for me i expected more 107 kinda like what i would imagine maruf alis father would look like those stars really have me worry its going to be pay to win game 059 isnt him ashlan is this real is this one going to be for nintendo switch to i subscribe looks like a mobile game i have to play it will be more accessible than the original what stopped me from finishing the game initially made it about 30 hours was the amount of grinding so hopefully this isnt too expensive to pay past a grind lol 041 phili is that you if this is also released on the switch ill buy it that dude from 036 reminds me of cyrus chapter 1 boss the new art direction sucks anyone translate this source these are great characters but 051 is my favorite a fan as a weapon getting kitana vibes here are these new characters officially announced by square enix i did not saw any screenshots of them on official websites where did you found them 346 its merric 503 lass on the far left is olivia if this is a gacha game im gonna tilt makes me curious who these 8 are heck one of them could be primroses mum for all i know and that would set up prims story in regular octo make more octopath ckntent square thats all you need to do to get me to buy everything this is so cool where did you find these pictures 035 the boss of the 2nd chapter of therion and the other one i dont remember their names yo this male dancer looks so cool smartphone did i just saw a medieval phantom thief what is this another octopath traveler game yo im hype af square enix take my money already but pls put this on switch i have my hopes up that this octopath gacha game will be as f2p as azur laneetc because that the devs of the this game chose not to include dlcmicrotransactions in the original switch octopath gameand i know that because the mobile game is free so it will have microtransactions unlike the switch game which is pay once get it allso i am hoping that this game is going to be f2p friendly even if its a gacha game i want this for switch too huh i never heard of this before octopath traveler is a great game even though i cant beat the final boss this looks cool oooh im interested 3 as much as i enjoyed octopath id rather have bravely third than a gatcha mobile game dont get me wrong i realize multiple projects can be in the works at the same time but yeah as good as octopath was bravely is so much better holy hell they all look lovely ok when does this come out for america i need this now please i love how this looks and i really like all the new character designs im still working my way through octopath traveler on the switch but the game really stole my heart so im excited to see it continue as a sort of series so characters have rarities i wonder if itll be possible to do that rune blade merchant combo if not id still rock that rune blade what type of game is this mutliplayer gacha take my fucking money is this legit i should get back to this game stopped when i got anew game and havent gone back but i know its such a good game already going through olberics first chapter my 5th character that im getting so i kinda need this game now im excited as long as it isnt pay to win square enix is shit this game wasnt even good enough to warrant a mobile cash grab what the fuck is wrong with this piece of shit company there is some serious waifu material in here why are there so many of them and why are all of them cute fuck all of you supporting this mobile cash grab and mobile games in general fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you is this official these look incredible so is someone gonna fill me in on what this game is cant believe theyd waste this on mobile after how good it did on switch pretty bogus the main thing ive noticed is mle dancer i hope they make an other octopath traveler game but on the nintendo switch i dont mind mobile 112 isnt that graham crossford i prefer they port the original to pc or mobile instead of making an online spinoff why cuz i hate salty gacha music in octopath never fails more best girls than i can handle how many there are none of these chars are in the current game im lost wuts going on here more characters mean more stories to follow and to learn more about these travelers hopefully theyll be as good as the ones in the first game wait how many character can we play as okaytheres 2 things that i need to confirm for the game 1this takes place before the events of octopath traveler 2this is a gacha gamemeaning theres a chance of huge salt in the future did i get everything right or is there errorsim still confused 330 a scholar whose name is noelle interesting i hope this game will be released in europe im dying to play it i dont know about thi 015 so it is getting an english release right will this have an english translation basically they recycled all the art and music of a game that is ultra repetitive to make a new game out of it well done se the second girl 006 is very beautiful the looks happy and cheerful too cant wait to play this game just started pkaying last week love my nintendo switch and love octopath traveler such a great game i just got cyrus when the game characters have a job and you are jobless is there a english version of it will this be in us they all look really nice but i dont know how i feel about this being on mobile what made octopath special to me was the heavily unique stories and characterizations of all 8 travelers there just seems to be so many characters here how will each one have an individual and unique story oh my gosh there are so many daddies in this game now mmmmmm can we get some spicy fan art going please 045 is that primroses mom is this going to be a gacha game if so i cry still anal about the fact this thing is mobile and even more simplified than the first game what the fuck were they fucking thinking so many characters cool on one hand but kinda beats the title of the game im suspicious thay this will be a system like that of fire emblem heroes where you get new heroes through rng but hopeful that itll just be like chrono cross where theres just a whole bunch of different party members to choose from nothing more 111 is this graham love it already i dont think octopath is fit for mobile but im still gonna play the hell out of this hype will this game come to switch i hope it comes to the usa i loved octopath traveller i just got so attached to the characters i miss them im excited to play this game maybe come out eventi on swich one day look inique mix in anyway im doing a list of the names i am not repeating names and please tell me if i am wrong i will change it also i will put my interpretation of the english if it sounds like english i will be only doing those that have the introduction screen rs in japanese are a mix between r and l so ya penii penny viora viola fuan mameiru pia ruusetta azuraito haintsu heinz kamira camilla meretto perutoran ashiran irisu iris taahiru perediiru sherubii teo miina it is not minna which means everyone mairuzu miles miroodo harii harry

helped with some of the english names such as conny heinz and helga hey where can you get this i love so much the desing of the 3 male hunter with white hair looks like gatcha game cash grabber i prefer buy a full priced game than free game but expensive in game transaction oh fuck its going to have micro transactions the stars mean what they max level will be thats the mobile one right so not for thr switch is this gacha this even though its a mobile game i will play it octopath was too good and i need more so like will it be possible to move the app the a desktop dont get me wrong mobile is cool but i prefer a larger screen more please respond anyone reminds me of brave frontier is this a sequel to the one of the switch but why mobile game im gonna be so fucking sad if this turns out to be a gacha game tbh if it is ill sadly wait for the octopath traveler sequel instead holy fucking shit theres so many i cant wait ahh what do the stars mean waifupath traveler is this music actually the game the music is amaizing is this coming to the switch as well when is this gods gift to the world coming out so how many there are 240 one punch man does it gave a releas date definitely a gacha it looks extremely unique though 113 could that be graham crossford also all of the travellers look so good fuck mobile so disappointing this isnt on the switch very cool thanks for sharing i just wish they didnt have star rankings it basically makes it impossible to use any cool looking 3 stars this game still on switch or on mobile everyone why they are so many omg i just want to play it to know more guy with headband and sword is about as classic jrpg as you can get and i love it kind of bummed its a mobile thing though do we know if this will be making its way to the us i feel like this takes place before octopath traveler thanks for this some awesome artwork of the characters let me know who your favorite character is with a timestamp a few of my favorites 225 ill be cool if im around him 315 female therion 335 boy or girl some of them look like they could be ancestors of the original 8 travellers theres one that looks extremely similar to cyrus ooh we have a name for the game now i have ys viii and xenoblade chronicles 2 maybe ill give octopath a go when i finish those games does this guy age watched him on tv many years ago dont be telling people to port beg this needs to stay on nintendo you know since everyone is saying us nintendo fans are port beggers and such octopathtravellerforswitchonly man those voiceovers in the game seemed really annoying not only is it immersionbreaking and out of style to have voiceovers for those older games but the voice acting doesnt even sound good from what i heard not much thats at least my opinion that point about the dialogue being disjointed seems to be very immersionbreaking as well like vic said that said obviously none of that is gameruining though this game is absolutely beautiful and fantastic 2am and i cant put it down lol need this rpg really hoping this gets ported to ps4 im not really in the market for a switch but would love to play this if not then maybe there is hope for octopath traveler 2 vic you didnt answer the most important question what the heck is an octopath is this game worth a try even for someone who really isnt into rpgs never played a jrpg unless the pokemon games count haha can you do the versus like you used too i remember loving watching the nba 2k vs nba live you did zelda vs horizon which was great as well will we see octopath on the 3ds final fantasy vibe am i the only person on the planet who has played a saga game great video vick its quite a feather in nintendos cap that they secured this as an exclusive someone at playstation was really asleep at the wheel for not getting us this game as a ps4 pro owner i can only dream that well have this one day too i think itll happen eventually sigh this might be my favorite game on the switch so far speaking of art design i heard someone alas i dont remember who on their yt channel suggest that se update and rerelease ff vi using this engine octopath traveler review scores digitally downloaded perfect 5

i dont see it going to any other platform because i believe it was published by nintendo i dont know where i know you from but i fucking love you and your reviews and all your content keep it up early g4 days maybe i absolutely love jrpgs but im having a hard time getting into this one the story isnt up to snuff for me but im overly picky about jrpg stories excellent review victor why grind though i am using evasive manuevers to avoid leveling up cause all my characters are overleveled just by doing the story quests of each character the fact that you played for 545 hours and are level 28 is weird to me i played 12 hours and my highest character is lvl 21 im at mid 20s after chapter 2 and then i went for the lowest level chapter 3 and got immediately one shot by a poisonous panther thank you cool video currently using tomb of kings to bring my non party units up to lv 20ish another interesting way to do this is to make your merchant also a cleric so youre not wasting healrevive items and use arrow storm instead of rain of arrows generally one arrow storm will guard break an enemy great video and very helpful just some additions i found made it quickereasier i altered this approach a bit put dancer as cyruss second job on his first action cast peacock strut on himself it will add power to his elemental attack thats why cyrus is my main he is super good for finishing enemies and his skills are really versatile love him he is currently level 31 but the rest of my party are about 20ish atm will do this trick i have three main teams hunter cleric and mage the fourth one i swap depending on the chapter im doing im about halfway through the chapter 4s and ive barely needed to grind at all so far maybe an hour or two total once you reach level 35 if you want to do some leveling for your characters go to the marslim area before you hit the marslim city there are is an enemy fight of a monster hound three scorpions the scorpions weakness is ice the javelin the monster hound has a of weaknesses mostly the axe once you kill these enemies you will gain 700xp you can go from level 35 to level 4550 in no time i also chose the warrior job for haanit as well i like the way she looks as the warrior she just totally kicks ass why are you attacking them with lightning when they are vulnerable to wind thanks for the tips but please talk a little slower next time the king fishers look like all might lol you must not be reading any story and skipping all beginning stories omg youre truly the best so happy to hear you again i used to watch religiously your fire emblem heroes videos you truly had the most helpful and best explained videos i could find and now that im playing octopath i found you again thank you for this tip im already there grinding and almost hitting lvl 40 with my main ophilia and cyrus i truly love you and your videos thank you so much for all your help ill keep watching your other videos and see what i can learn everytimes i play an rpg chrono trigger bravely default skyrim dragon quest 8 xenoblade chronicles 1 my mind said do not grind it makes the game too damn easy but seeing these amazing skills not unlock yet make me feel sooo itchy i dont care about the level or stats of the character i just want to unlock their most useful skills as soon as possible what a bad habit dx level 12 is exponential so basically just discover everything possible before attempting chapter 2 lol my method for my level 20 team was to have alfyn and someone else with apothocary job use empoison on the kingfishers for at most seven turns i would then just keep on healing and reviving until they die you talk too fast where do i grind past level 40 chapter 3 and chapter 4 grinding spots i fought a chubby cait in this area giving me a whooping 2k xp and 55k gold as well as 1k of jp it had like 80 hp i thought it gonna ran away thank you for showing this guide also here is another tip for haanithunter arrowstorm hit rate is to give them as much accuracy as you can here is a tip if you have 5800 leaves spare for unerring bracelet which gives you 50 accuracy per bracelet since you can equip two accessories that equal 100 i also have a heavy bow on my hannit i did not do any of the job trials which gives me an extra 44 accuracy plus on base stats at level 24 which gives me a total of 254 accuracy and with this amount of accuracy i have been able to break the kingfishers with one arrowstorm although only once due to rng due to being surprised hannit not being first hope this helps what about the other 4 characters that are low leveled and die in one hit the only reason i dont play this game more is how much grinding there is it purposefully gates you and it got annoying im not 12 anymore in the 90s so i cant bring myself to grind anymore i got through everyones 2nd chapters but now id have to grind and grind to best some of these chapter 3 areas and bosses steal from a old mangood for you nn li with this exact same setup you can grind in maw of the ice dragon cave and get 700 xp per battle although theres no fast way to get to an inn nearby i use 99 plums and with a healer i heal my whole team after battles what kind of secondary job does cyrus have how and where do i get the knowledge staff spoil alert did everyone knows that dance bonus from dancer job are stackable i mean 1st time u get the bonus x2 exp or x2 pc or both and 2nd time on the same fight u will get x5 bonus on those birds i received 2500 exp for a fight enjoy guys i just found out that if you manage to kill one of those theif cats they give you a lot of exp it should be noted that if you kill a kingfisher that also has a cait with it you net 2277 xp give or take some trying to remember off the top of my head i had a hard time fighting tressas chapter 2 boss with a bunch of level 20s and tressa was level 26 i guess i just need to get their levels up or should i be shrine hunting before i move up to ch 2 i wish there was a generic gameplay guide like complete all ch 1 shrine hunt complete all ch2 etc so i know what the gameplay flow is supposed to be what about jp the only thing i dont get is why cyrus lightning ability makes that much damage to each monster when lightning isnt their weakness is it bc of the knowledge staff step one take off work for a week step 2 play at least 20 hours a day for one weak who do u think i should start as you have no idea how much ive needed this oh ok then does the secondary class affect the characters stat growth while leveling up i beat the dude infront of the house used cyrus ability to find out her secret and uped the steal rate for the whole city and this city has awesome weapons and armor to steal that is how i dealt with the kingfishers deadass my main team is ophilia cyrus primrose and alfyn they were about level 46ish with cyrus being the lowest w 42 i dont remember what i got but there was an enemy while going to everhold and prim got a x100 exp in her bewildering dance and they all went to above level 58 it was wild i was completing my last tale and prim got another x100 exp and tressa went from 38 to 56 in other words primroses thing is ridiculous because cyrus can do upwards of 12k damage with sorcerer on boost so yeet you can also get death cleaver best non end game axe in the same dungeon that you get the knowledge staff if anybody is having issues getting the knowledge staff for whatever reason i use tressa forever and ignore therion you can get a comparable weapon by using tressa to purchase a rune glaive in grandport its a little expensive but youll have extra money from farming anyway still has 300 something elemental attack and also increases evasion its rather useful for equipping to cyrus or your magic user what i did was i at the time regrettably focus all my time on 4 characters ophilia hannit cyrus and tressa got them to about 13 and then switched hannit for olberic i really fell in love with their characters and kept them in the party all the way till i finished all their chapter 4s got all 4 advanced job classes and got them each to 78 when i decided it was time to level the others and see their stories my cyrus the sorcerer would stay while i change out the other three i used the more experience skill hard worker and passed the friendship and captains badge between the three of them i brought them all to the level 50 advanced class dungeons and in about 25 hours got them all to 50 compared to the 40 hours it took me to get my first 4 thanks for video very helpful option for leveling my second team i currently very reluctantlazy to level olberic alfyn primrose and tressa so this is a great option to get them up to snuff any good spot for leveling above 40 thanks all my chap 1 are cleared and im to underleveled to continue the the chap 2s dont actually grind guys it makes the game insanely easier than it already is which is always no fun only grind for the final boss because thats really the only time there is going to be a spike in difficulty besides that if you do the optional dungeons and or just simply go through everyones story cleverly you can easily get everyone leveled up without grinding even once thats what i did and even then i ended up overleveled is this game worth it or should i spend it on mhgu so ive been watching you since your uploads for xenoblade and dude you saved me so much time thanks a lot and keep up the good work you could have killed them so much faster but your team setup is poo but thanks for the grinding spot thx i really needed help with grinding especially for the true fin boss yes nn li i needed this hmmm ive been enjoying the switch version and finally got around to getting all the characters at the 25hour mark im still working my way through all the starting quests for each character the game gets pretty easy once you have 4 characters but if you want extra challenge you can hang out in zones 10 levels above you its kinda disappointing when you are high level and head back into lowlevel zones battles arent really worth it but i can easily see how someone could put 60 hours into this game im not sure if i would pay full price for this game on steam though but for a 60hour game its not bad the art at first i thought was annoying but really grew on me after a while still there are minor issues with lightning and blur effect i find annoying id say if you enjoyed gameboy games and turnbased stuff you would enjoy this old school style game get real its a money grab at that price wtf im out it seems the final fantasy 7 im super curious is this game really worth 50 pound i mean the content im not gonna say it worth if the game end in 8 hours like it name even if it super enjoyable it wont be worth the price like seriously 50 pound is a price i will expect atleast a story or game play as much as witcher 3 not every square enix title should cost 60usd i think you need to go back to the drawing board look the current pc games market value from the competition octopath traveler feels like a indie game that should cost no more then 3999usd this looks amazing the sound on the other hand is there an option to turn off the goofy voices and just have text bubbles i would pay up to 40 for a digital game like this one certainly not 60 this is not a nintendo platform in pc we dont put up with anything ill wait for the sales wtf is with the stupid english voices hopefully they have an option for japanese voices with undertitling in english omg 84 just for porting game to pc i would understand if they plan to go for pc from the start and that would be the development costs im done with squareenix they think only about money dont think i can get through this a second time feels way to dated now i can buy ityes i can buy i just wont until they reduce the price to 15 not even aaa i worth 60 why would anyone pay an almost 2d game with plain rpg mechanics and 10years old loot system for 60 dear square enix dont be like that we r waiting for ffvii not this trash as much as i love rpgs this is not getting 60 out of me ill pass until it reduces 60 a year after release for an indie title that had a little help from se no fucking thank you ill wait for it to go on sale whos bright idea was this lol i am down voting this for the awful price on steam84 canadian remake xenogears using the same engine please is there any chance to release a ps 4 version i hate sd character why human ennemy have real appearance and our character not it feels like snes romancing saga anyway cant wait to play this how much are we paying for a game that my 9 year old daughter could code in an afternoon just saying waiting for ps4 version finally hell yeah now the 15k pc is even more worth it x3 i bought switch for this and now on pc dislike sorry great game recomended limited edition physical for pc please oh another reason for life this is one of my favorite rpgs of all time im glad more people will get to experience it yakuza kiwami 2 is 2999 so please price smartly i was waiting for this why two uloads finally the definitive edition saga frontier is a masterpiece breath of fire 12 chrono trigger secret of mana secret of evermore ff6 ff2 lufia 12 dan i have played all of them i hear a lot of people have issues with the disconnecting story but idk if its just me but i dont really mind it that much am i alone with this find shining force 0 1 2 for the sega emulator guys thank me later blue dragon is my personal favorite maple story d i would put bravely default above every other title in this video imagine octopath traveler with an even better soundtrack much more loveable characters similiar battle system and a hell of a memorable story a must buy for every 3ds owner how is octopath traveler a spiritual successor to the saga games legend of the legacy and alliance alive are far more like the saga games than octopath traveler octopath traveler actually has character level ups saga games dontthey were created by final fantasy 2s director the bravely games are actually a spiritual successor to final fantasy the four heroes of light heres the list for quick reference 052 bravely 1 2 140 romancing saga 2 219 saga frontier 240 legend of dragon 338 chrono trigger 458 earthbound 541 dragon quest viii 631 persona 5 722 terranigma saga frontier is crap saga frontier 2 on the other hand personally i believe dragon quest 8 is better than 11 11 was fun but i like 8 more actually bravely default was a successor to a final fantasy spin off called 4 heroes of light which used a concept similar to bravely default tbh when i 1st saw octopath traveller it reminded me of saga frontier 2 ffviii is underrated lol the legend of heroes is another great place to start really solid writing and world building in those games btw lufia 2 rise of the sinistrals that was even better man i had the best childhood ever holy never thought that i would hear someone mention teranigma in an youtube video played it when i was a kid and still have it so damn good i am getting goosepumps just thinking about it thank you man golden sun gba is worth the money want to play it badly but wont buy a switch came here to find an option and already played everything you suggested its time to find another genre i guess suikoden breath of fire especially 3 4 and cross code has been blowing my mind hit undertale too if earthbound quirkiness grabs you great video tell him to go play final fantasy tactics if i miss a game let me know and i will added it too the

world trailer httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0yllnolrwks cosmic star heroin first of all thanks for suggesting saga frontier too many times has that game been imo unnecessarily shit on but i also dont think any action rpgs are good suggestions for people breaking into jrpgs just yet also i tried to enjoy terranigma but im sorry that game sucked illusion of gaia is one of my favorite games of all time but i just couldnt get into terranigma i kept playing hoping that i would eventually see what its fans see and instead i just got more frustrated with the unintuitive gameplay and snailpaced story sorry but for me it cant hold a candle to its predecessor in illusion of gaiatime star ocean 2 on playstation is my fav jrpg lufia ii should be in the list having the best puzzle in a rpg game bravely switch would be nuts edit and a new ogre battle the obvious xenogears and or chrono cross would be my reccomendation and the phantasy star games which are better than the final fantasy counterparts from there time imo so basically you put octopath in the title cause its the hot game buzzword to get hits this couldve easily been called 9 great but random rpgs to play phantsay star 4 is something id recommend its really easy to get into doesnt require past game knowledge to enjoy and it has a really nice system of macros and combinations final fantasy 9 is always a very easy recommendation to people getting into jrpgs but dont want to go toooo far back in my experience chrono trigger is the better recommendation than final fantasy 6 as well most new gamers dont really get into final fantasy 6 i personally dont think it has aged so well and am i the only one that actually enjoyed unlimited saga more than the rest in the saga series i did love saga frontier and saga frontier 2 at first but their heavy reliance on sparking to learn abilities got really boring and lacked a certain customization that i look for i also got bored with minstrel song very quickly unlimited saga may have had an awakardslightly ugly interface in some respects but once you got used to it the system was actually really fun star ocean second evolutionstory breath of fire iii golden sunlost age bravely default chrono trigger dragon quest viii if you can get ahold of snes classic you can get at least 3 must plays earthbound final fantasy vi super mario rpg wow youve got guts recommending the saga series i love this video but i have gotten so tired of hearing the words octopath traveler after having watched this i need an help my favourite games ever are xenoblade chronicles bravely default and smash bros for 3ds a few months ago i bought a nintendo switch and after finishing zelda breath of the wild i want to play a new game of course but i have to choose do i play xenoblade chronicles 2 octopath traveller or i wait for smash bros ultimate or i try to research a nintendods version of chrono trigger hoping of finding an italian version if it exists thanks ps sorry for my bad english but as you should have understood by my comment im italian i just finished the main story of dragon quest vi on my ds not sure if im going to tackle the leftovers got so much to play thinking of trying 7th dragon on 3ds for old stuff definitely try soul blazer illusion of gaia and definitely terrinigma like sd mentioned they are all by the same company just played terrinigma a couple years would love to see a whole play through though i thought you never finished earthbound i will watch the next one closely to see earthbound is available as a virtual console game for the new 3ds line up of handhelds as well as the wii u dragon quest monsters is the best in the series man what a list id also recommend super mario rpg paper mario the thousand year door and final fantasy 4 you can get earthbound for the new 3ds on the virtual console it is a dream to play portably is that utawarerumono music about half way through the video i havent checked in awhile but earthbound is in the shop for 3ds i have to say shin megami tensei 4 and apocalypse are good fresh yet still have that turn base mechanic with also exploration and even in a way monster catching elements i would say lunar silver star story preferably the ps1 version since i think its the only one to have the working designs localization and i enjoy the writing style it really has the classic 16 bit rpg golden era feel to it the psp remake is a secondary option too the ps1 in particular has tons of amazing rpgs available in the ps store for dirt cheap from 599 to 999 and you can play them on your ps3 ps4 psp or vita and they go on sale every couple months too im a physical collector primarily but getting games like suikoden 2 breath of fire 3 and 4 and the final fantasies for as cheap as 299 sometimes is a nobrainer earthbound is great nooo legend of dragoon one of the best ever that system was awesome and now i think legend of legaia uses something like that but not exactly at least it is decent wish bravely defaults towns had more scenarios and meat to em the game winds up feeling rather repetitive due to the downtimes within them being so short and lacking anything to do in em beyond stumbling into another dungeonboss or to view some cutscenes shadow hearts would be great wild arms i beat saga frontier with only one of the characters back in the day i might go back and beat it with all seven after i finish octopath traveler shadow hearts for the ps2 has one of my favorite battle systems i would definitely recommend that too you are getting me in the mood to play terranigma myself lol i have the reproduction cart but i havent played it yet cant believe you didnt mention star ocean 2nd story or breath of fire 3 at least grandia got an honorable mention good list none the less great video i think a lot of us have caught the jrpg bug after octopath traveler i was hoping youd mention golden sun though terranigma insta like to this video story and side quest based xenoblade chronicles turn based breath of fire 4 personal favourite horror based shadow hearts modern persona 5 old school with no random encounter chrono trigger old school with random encounters final fantasy 6 action tales of symphonia musical eternal sonata after that twitter tease it looks like either a new bravely game is coming to switch because of the success of octopath or maybe a collectionremasterremake of the first two or possibly a collection and a new one oh god though saga frontier is so ugly it does not look good graphically and i thought that back in the day when it came out chrono trigger is a game that any gamer should play at least once in their lifetime lost odyssey and blue dragon are my top picks for jrpgs both made by mistwalker made up by the devs who were from the original square soft company before they became square enix i really wished these games would be released on steam or remade or ported to present consoles good list thankfully im in upstate ny and yet im one of the rare owners of a physical copy of terranigma on snes its a repro by timewalk games who sadly closed up shop but there are other repros out there too timewalks repro boxes and maps are almost better than the official release timewalk also released secret of mana 2 seiken densetsu 3 for snes and sweet home for nes among others not a bad list still missing the great gaias hands down best jrpg of all time so i would recommend the golden sun games on the gameboy advance xenoblade chronicles 1 and 2 wii and switch as well as the legend of heroes trails games all of them are great jrpgs legend of dragoon you say you just earned yourself a new subscriber if you love chrono trigger then play cosmic star heroine you wont be disappointed skies of arcadia great game overall grandia ii loved its battle system lunar silver star story great story and musicost and of course final fantasy vi needs no explanation lol here take my subscription good sir i need this i recommend valkyrie profile very rare ps1 era the octopath traveler battle system sounds like something thats around my alley im not a big fan of the bravely series battle system is just too all over the place for my liking mentioning p5 and no an smt is a lil dissapointing but i got it something new even if smtiv is still new imo octopath traveler actually got me out of a slump and back into rpgs so i like the topic portable rpgs in particular get me hyped i know you mentioned some portable games but you didnt specifically mention this category dq8 was mentioned for the 3ds and i have also heard good things about dq 4 5 and 6 chrono trigger and final fantasy 4 are both on the ds as well and theres radiant historia for either the ds or the 3ds for people with a vita theres persona 4 golden and persona 3 portable playable on psp or vita the bravely default games were mentioned but i would recommend holding off on them square enix keeps teasing the bravely series for the switch and i wouldnt be surprised if they both came to the platform i cant wait for future switch rpgs whaaaaat i didnt know octopath was a successor to final fantasy legend thats one of my favorites also thanks for the romancing saga 2 mention i really was not aware that it was on switch the dating sim is why i wont touch persona 5 i dont like how flashy it is but dating sims is an instant no go for me dragon quest 8 was my first and last game in that series i love turn based games but there are some things that will stop me from playing a game in dragon quest the stats didnt line up with the actions for example i told a the character with the fastest movement speed i had access to heal a person but that person would frequently go last or close to last so many characters died because of this alone personally if i was going suggest jrpgs to newcomers i would narrow down what theyre interested in a bit more before making suggestions half of these suggestions were for older turnbased games the other half were for more modern style turnbased games both groups have plenty of other good options to look into but what about realtime action or realtime stage jrpgs tales of star ocean ni no kuni xenoblade chronicles kingdom hearts etc all have different appeals their own tropes and various pros and cons now i know thats difficult to cover in one video i mean you could make a longer one than this to talk about all them but itd probably get boring but thats why i think this topic is better covered in a personal conversation rather than just making a list that being said i think most of your suggestions are good ones so its not a bad start while this is a good list in terms of listing quality rpgs this list almost completely ignores accessibility for instance if a person watching this video only owned a switch the list might as well be 9 great games you cant play after octopath traveler to not include even one other switch rpg is pretty lame trails in the sky and trails of cold steel series those games ruined my ability to enjoy talking to npcs in other jrpgs ever again dragon quest v is the best dragon quest i would say either shin megami tensei apocalypse for the 3ds if you want a unique story with tight gameplay or if you prefer full 3d shin megami tensei nocturne for the ps2 if you like tight gameplay with more of an emphasis on atmosphere than characters it also features dante from the devil may cry series i like you mentioned terranigma an extraordinary game but your information abour needing to spend hundreds of dollars for a copy is pretty inaccurate unboxed cartridges of terranigma are viable on ebay for 30 you need to pay far more 200500 only if you want a sealed brand new copy random encounters are the single worst thing about octopath hurl the phantasy star shining series are also great rpgs that should never be forgotten i picked up earthbound on the 3ds eshop not too long ago it was actually on sale regular price 999 which still a good deal for such classic also chrono trigger was ported to the nintendo ds which plays on the 3ds but it will cost you about 50 what happen to secret of mana 3 funny thing is your video is a response to another and your vdeo has more views than jkb vdeos im gonna check it great work as always thanks for this video i dont have a switch so i will try some of these to get over my sadness of not playing octopath traveler i am currently playing dq8 my top 7 recommendations for new jrpg fans would be 1 xenogears 2 xenosaga episode 1 3 xenosaga episode 2 4 xenosaga episode 3 5 xenoblade chronicles 6 xenoblade chronicles x 7 xenoblade chronicles 2 yes you might have guessed it i am a huge xeno fan in all seriousness though some other amazing jrpgs i would suggest are grandia 123 breath of fire 3 and 4 suikoden 15 valkyrie profile final fantasy tactics final fantasy 4679 and 13 vagrant story and star ocean 12 and 4 i would say romancing saga minstrel song for the ps2 8 different stories interwined with some of the others in little ways great battle mechanics somewhat open explration it is so good haha or maybe im the only one who enjoyed it one rpg i really want to share is scar of sky this game is the chrono trigger ff 6 for me the only obstacle is its only in chinese octopath definitely makes me want to play chrono trigger which would be my first time through and i wish theyd port dragon quest 8 3ds on switch i dont find it comfortable to play but i do like what they added anyways love the recommendations havent played all these great snes rpgs except earthbound but id happily play that again ill throw tokyo xanadu ex in here my favourite action rpg in a long time and i personally prefer i over the amazing ys viii my long sort of review for that game httpswwwredditcomrjrpgcomments7fh34itokyoxanadumaybeoneofthebestjrpgsthis i think the list should be final fantasy 69 xenogears grandia suikoden chrono cross dragon quest 48 nds3ds why is it that seiken densetsu3 never gets a mention that game is amazing and just tops terranigma in my opinion terranigma is easily one of the most undervalued gems in all of gaming dude awesome list heres mine games like octopath traveler valkyrie profile ps1 the characters motives reminded me of octopath so much plus the design tone and music as well something like final fantasy vii lost odyssey a forgotten jrpg something classic chrono trigger or ffvi snes ps1 mobile something quirky super mario rpg hands down the best mario rpg imo something traditional breath of fire 3 or 4 ps1 or even blue dragon 360 something new ni nu kuni ii ps4 i havent played the first one but that could be a runnerup as well something actionoriented front mission 3 4 or 5 ps1 ps2 mechbased strategy rpg with customization action character development and dystopian worlds also my favorite rpg series of all time holy balls yes i think terranigma is a often overlooked game i would love to have a remake of this one chrono trigger is available cheaper on nintendo ds systems then an snes cart although i believe snes classic has it preinstalled breath of fire 3 these are 9 great rpgs thats a great list but oh manhow could you leave out final fantasy 6 i think the multiple character arcs would would make it a natch for octopath fans final fantasy iv legend of heroes trails of cold steels ys origins lost odyssey cosmic star heroine phantasy star iv tales of berseria chrono cross dargon quest v lost sphear suikoden 2 final fantasy v so many more just what comes to mind of what ive played and had great experiences with not really like octopath but trails of cold steel was a game i put over 100 hrs in to luckily a ton of these games are pretty easily available legend of dragoon is a mere 599 digitally on ps3 and chrono trigger is only 999 on the same platform both of these are available on vita as well earthbound is actually now available on the new nintendo 3ds of course if you want more classics for the system breath of fire 1 and 2 are both easily available and dont forget every final fantasy game from 1 to 10 are all available on vita digitally 12 as a single purchase 5678 and 9 are ps one classics 3 and 4 have special psp remakes which are compatible with vita and an hd remaster of 10 is available on the system great list i would add super mario rpg since its simple has familiar characters and a fun battle system awesome video as always treasure of the rudra and live a live worthit nine rpgs to play after octopath final fantasy iv ds final fantasy vi snes chrono trigger snes radiant historia perfect chronology 3ds breath of fire iv psx lufia ii snes secret of mana snes final fantasy ix psx breath of fire iii psx im from the future and man dragon quest 14 and 17 were both better than dragon quest 8 where have you been i wish there was a convenient way to play terrenigma still havent got to it after octopath in august cosmic star heroine is coming to the switch i cant wait some damn great recommendations here im itching for some classics now terranigma terranigma is soooo great the character sprites in octopath remind me a bit of final fantasy vi which i would absolutely recommend to anyone who loves turnbased rpgs wanting to experience an amazing story the other one i would throw out there for what to possibly check out if they enjoyed their time with octopath would be valkyrie profile on the ps1 new camera picture looks so crisp nevermind a video that recommends chrono trigger and terranigma is a good video one of my favorite series of jrpgs is the tales of series very action packed most characters are full of charm also both baten kaitos and arc rise fantasia hidden gems for the gamecube and wii respectively id say breath of fire 3 or 4 my personal opinion would be 3 but both are good that bravedefault system sounds like the pier solar battle system 218 this music sounds like a chaos rings 3 music who played cr3 for android will know w i am talking about it makes me feel old to think that octopath traveler is likely going to be so many peoples first foray into a traditional jrpg but at the same time it is a really cool thing i think that all of your choices are great i love all of those games im a longtime viewer of the channel and always enjoy the content i dont usually engage much but i hope you keep fighting the good fight and showing off jrpgs that dont get a ton of attention elsewhere hope to see you play through and review the shadow hearts series on the ps2 someday time permitting skies of arcadia as well this list for me is more like 9 rpgs to play before octopath traveler i dont have a switch chrono trigger and ff 6 is the best rpg of all time in my opinion those two were the one who dragged me to rpg world final fantasy the 4 heroes of light on the nintendo ds is the precursor of the bravely and octopath games all 4 are made by square enix and use an action point system no mention of final fantasy vi its a dead ringer for fans of the octopath art style golf story awesome list man i like your style but for some strange reason i keep getting double vision in your videos im beginning to have health concerns just kidding i like that fade effect between cuts it gives your videos a dreamlike quality like lapsing in and out of consciousness makes me feel like your videos provide a bit of a meta scenario like ive awoken in a random chamber full of video games and some random charming fellow named derek and i cant remember anything about my life or why im here i just know that derek seems to be really excited about rpgs yes quite enchanting your lighting even emulates some kind of tower like theres sunlight from one side and candlelight from a chandelier up above ive received a quest line to go play other games like octopath traveler ah autoplay a random encounter lets not forget lost odyssey lunar silver star harmony and the shadow hearts games hey derek i havent gotten to play octopath traveler as i dont have a switch but im surprised you didnt reccomend live a live not a complaint just surprising cause it has the multiple protagonist thing going on like octopath also terranigma is up there in my top ten i damn near cried when i beat the game a couple years ago get the word out there man terranigma needs more love not saying its better than final fantasy 6 thats okay ill do it for you it is vastly superior to final fantasy 6 chrono trigger 4lyfe isnt earthbound also available on 3ds would any of the grandia games count xenoblade chronicles remaster in switch please great list mate worthit sadly emuparadise one of the better rom sites is about to take down its entire rom collection fucknintendomafia i dont know whats going on but i feel 238 is a spoiler lol i think im gonna make my own video response to this great list worthit finally someone mentioned saga frontier i play rpgs whenever i can but im absurdly picky time has to be 100 stopped when im making my decisions and i dont like grid based strategy rpgs so im gonna try romancing saga 2 frontier at least great video derek chrono trigger is now fixed on steam its a no brainer guys if you havent played that yet i would also recommend ffix dragon quest viii persona 5 xenogears radiant historia cosmic star heroine strange thing we europeans never got many great rpgs like final fantasy 1 4 and 6 tales of destiny and im pretty sure i havent seen star ocean 2 in any store when it was released but we did get terranigma which is great i prefer illusion of gaia though actually because it isnt an rpg terranigma requires you to grind for some bosses and all players know exactly what im talking about luckily because of its action combat even grinding is fun i recommend dragon quest 8 3ds version over the ps2 version 3ds version has more side quests more voiced cutscenes redubbed jessica voice which i prefer more on 3ds 3ds version has no random encounters while the ps2 has them 3ds version has a item collection feature where you can get new weapons or upgrade items to help with your leveling up faster alternate ending if you complete the post game campaign there is tons more post game content compared to the ps2 version each character has more costumes that you can unlock by dedicating to side quests and collecting medals the alchemy pot is easier to use and you dont have to wait for items to be created my original xenoblade chronicles never gets any love but chrono trigger is a must for any rpg player no matter the the reason im currently sitting on a cib copy of saga frontier 1 and 2 and its killing me i know were not allowed to mention it but for 80 of the games named you can use an emulator i was actually in the middle of terranigma before i started playing botw and more recently octopath traveler all such great games that it is hard for me to choose between the three excellent video as usual sir octopath traveler is quite amazing indeed especially since the story is basically what happens when japanese game devs attempt to make something like game of thrones on coke and shrooms mang as for great jrpgs to play after youve got your octopath fill saga frontier very highly underrated jrpg series and the main influence of said potential game of the year recipient final fantasy vi one of if not the best game in the final fantasy series especially with the whole ensemble cast and what not legend of dragoon a must play jrpg for those who enjoy dark fantasy storytelling ala elric of melnibone mixed in with a little super sentai by way of ronin warriors wild arms great jrpg series to play if you want your rpgs to have some of that wild wild west twang mixed with some scifi steampunk bravely default second the guys who made octopath traveler made these particular games so thats reason enough dragon quest viii my favorite dragon q i think saga frontier ii is more beginner friendly than saga frontier i perfer saga frontier over saga frontier ii but saga frontier is too non linear and cryptic it makes the legend of zelda and castlevania ii simons quest look like a hand holder also the remake of saga ii on ds is fantastic but japanese only but a fan translation does exist i loved legend of dragoon they need to do a remake and sequel to that game youre really improving lately you seemed more natural and confident here than ever keep it up hope to see your craft continue to grow thought id see ffv for sure how do you feel about battle crashers nightwar or lost sphear pretty solid recommendations there and yes dragon quest viii was such a better game than the ps2 version i stopped playing the ps2 version back in the days and finished last year the 3ds version and i cant wait for the dqxi whats the song that plays while hes talking about terranigma the last game great list the legend of heroes trails in the sky trilogy on steam another action rpg for me is dark cloud 2 but you know that bravely default and bravely second are some of my favorite 3ds rpgs octopath and bravely were actually developed by the same team im also playing romancingsaga 2 and im looking forward to the remake of rs3 and romancingsaga scarlet grace if i ever finish octopath traveler sieken densetsu 3 is one that ones to mind definitely one of my favorite action rpgs of all time i always thought the golden sun series was very good on the gba really awesome video derek you have some really high quality super accessible recommendations for new fans dragon quest viii was amazing im really hoping that the release for the 3ds with the additional content will get released on playstation or switch or even the pc one day i dont mind the 3ds but i hate playing such a giant game on such a small screen tt chrono cross ff6 and suikoden 2 i think that most people that enjoy chrono trigger should consider the magic of scheherazade on nes it uses both action and turnbased attacking time travel and attack combinations depending on whos in the party it can be hesitant getting into nes rpgs but i think it holds up quite well if those games are physical im buying two thumbs way up great list saga frontier was my third rpg on psone after ff7 and ff8 then i got lucky and loved ff9 ill pass this video along my friends thanks for this dragon quest 7 now to see what made the list lol if terraria minecraft and star dew valley had graphics like octopath traveler they would be good examples of current generation aaa retroindie games i hope developers consider this when creating a pixel art game this pixel standerd should be a update for all the games ive mentioned im totally stuck i cannot work out how to get into the colosseum in one of the characters main story parts it will not let me go into it why is everybody attending this game has anything special going on mediocre stories and antiquated graphics masquerading as retro put down the kool aid people brilliant review im a little bit late but the individual stories arent that bad i was skeptical and disapointed at first that there was no main story persay but the game is just so damn fun i dont even care i find the stories charming and entertaining especially alfyns chapyer 3 and tressas chapter 2 overall gameplay 55 story 355 graphics 45 soundtrack 115 that gives us a crisp average of 65 rounded the actual average with soundtrack as just a 55 would be 455 rounded haanit has an annoying voice in english uhhh sure 8 like kirby star allies i still like kirby a lot though reminds me so much of golden sun i played this game and except for what i think is what i think are some of the cheapest enemies in gaming history i really like this game ive played this game for at least 150 hours and im still going because one of the hardest bosses ive ever faced in a long time i personally have an odd nitpick with the blend of realistic settings with the spritebased characters as i think its a little odd i dont know if the contrast works in this games benefit or the opposite buuuuttt if they ever made a sequel i would love to see where they go from here because i think there is so much potential with this game although i sometimes hate the enemies at times beating them to progress is so much satisfying i love the characters and the stories and found myself crying laughing and getting angry not enough games give me that emotional involvement and i thank octopath traveler for existing and the music is topnotch its like some xc stuff up in there pff the whole point of this game is that youre playing 8 different stories the fact that they dont intertwine much is no problem for me serious question ive not played a turn based rpg since final fantasy 7 and then advance wars on gba ive tried the recent ff game and didnt stick with it beyond two hours so is this seriously worth a buy for someone who hasnt been hooked on this type of game for years great video as usual great in depth chat i dont see a weak story as being bad ff8 had an incredible storyline but gameplay was so freaking boring i think a lot of modern rpgs and videogames in general focus way too much on cgi cutscenes insanely detailed backstories for npcs and trying to make us cry with character killoffs the best nes rpgs had very basic stories hell sometimes the characters didnt even have names octopaths gameplay visuals and music is just way too good to focus on petty complaints on how the eight storylines didnt intertwine enough cool points to anyone that can tell me how to play through the stories should i finish each character one by one or do all the stories together chapter by chapter im lost haha sounded like topher grace was narrating lol sorry gamespot but your review of this game blows its definitely a 9 out of 10 game this review is so much better than ign one lol highly vulnerable taking a little bit more damage i just realised enemies dont even move when they attack you they just flash pass bc of that shitty full price tag does not look like its worth it at all if its true that nintendo does not put discounts or does not lower the prices of their game then might not ever buy this anymore too bad i happen to love the 8 stories reminds me of alundra the graphics remind me of fft and xenogears on the playstation looking forward to playing this eventually good story is what makes a good rpg so ya i know im going to get calledout for even suggesting this but how cool would it have been to play a remake of ff6 in this style im still going get this game it just sounds like it falls short on so many of of the finer things earlier final fantasy games did so well which is all the more disappointing when you consider those are the games that octopath teaveller draws its main inspiration from octopaths story is amazing imo this game is amazing ive been playing it and i cant put it down it has so much content i only would have bought this for the story to be honestso its a skip the fact that you said each individual story is lackluster is in my eyes is invalidated because thats a sign that you either had no interest in the story or didnt care to dissect the other qualities or intricacies of the lore and narrative not to mention that 1 faulty element wont substitute for a significant drop in quality of a product andor a divide in the community half assed review in my opinion stupid question like really stupid but can you complete 1 characters story without switching the character this brown doing the review not a good person for reviews his review of mad max is the bests he said he didnt understand how mad max could carry parts around cars like mad max should not been able to do because its not realistic lol matt maharashtra wouldve been better picked this game up yesterday based on multiple reviews and gameplay videos i watched and boy am i glad i did i knew within the first hour or two of gameplay this game was right up my alley if youre even the slightest rpg fan you owe it to yourself to add this game to your collection never clicked off a video this fast before the font is a big mistake in overall nice art style although in rpgs ive never cared for the story jrpgs on the other hand i believe that story is as important at least for me although the art style is gorgeous and gameplay looks really good will give a tried so the game did end up having a final dungeon overarching and tieing all the stories i think people nowadays have too high expectations on the story of an rpg when we played secret of mana secret of evermore or lufia on the snes we enjoyed it for its gameplay and not the story i really reall like octopath traveler and that will not change because of anything storyrelated this game replenishes the jrpg style they could just improve the overall story if theyre going to release sequels hey on a serious note should i get octopath traveler or ys viii lod thanks ill get this when its half off complaining about story in jrpg lawl already started playing my copy but you know since the ground work is already done how about a final fantasy 6 remaster using the octopath traveler engine i totally agree about how poorly they integrated each of the characters stories as all you do is meet them in a townlocation and speak to them and magically end up as partners its also awkward how during cutscenes and such all your party members disappear and it only focuses on that specific character this game looks plays and sounds great but the story couldve been sooo much better imagine all the possibilities that could happen if each character influenced what happens to your team next or alter enemy encounters a solid 9 from me i love it so far almost goty rpg even this would have been so much better as an ff6 remake love the art style octopath travelers 8 paths traveling i get it i started as the thief but whos good for supporting him in combat so do i need to play through the game 8 times to see all the stories will this come to other consoles and pc this game looks ugly to me and i dont see the big deal with this tried the demo and played several characters didnt care for the characters the writing just felt weak with some characters just seeming a bit unbelievable in how they acted the pacing of how conversations are broken up seemed awkwardly slow i dont care that there is no big boss but it does bug me to hear the characters rarely interact outside of battle whats the point of having the other characters if they arent going to get to know one another and bond overall i love the art style and the battle seemed solid but without a solid story and likable characters im going to have to pass i didnt really like the game world being so linear either its odd to hear the reviewer didnt like the story in xenoblade chronicles 2 thats one of the many things i love about that game but hey people like what they like i have a feeling i wont like the bravely default games when i finally get around to playing them i think gamespot are one of the harsher critic gaming sites around they seem to hammer every game they review and nitpick every little minor problem that the rest of us find negligible while the battle system in any game is very important and is usually the bulk of gameplay snes rpgs are really know for story telling and thats definitely what i remember most about them when thinking back square enix is nowhere closed to what they used to be do you think this game is for oldschool rpg fans this looks cool but only if i am an rpg fan started playing as olberic and omg its a beautiful gamecant wait ti see how much time i spend after work just blowing hours on this game why do games these days have such a hard time with story telling i was wary this is how the story would pan out more short separate stories for each character and its sadly not what i would be interested in why no one can make an rpg like ffvii for the switch im fine with the story as long as the gameplay exp is great and btw its hard to top gigantic scale story like xenoblade chronicles 2 boy the game story realy make us cry laugh even chills i have to say those graphics are spectacular also whilst i am disappointed that the story is lacklustre i cant help but remember that i have spent approximately one billion hours playing pokmon which doesnt exactly feature oscar worthy writing this game deserves a 9 gamespot always gives a lower score than the game deserves love gamespot but why all the reviews are made by the same person and the score is always 8 8 is a good number get it octogon 8 too much traveling isnt the reason we loved the snes classic rpgs is for the story i hope it comes to mobile appstore or googleplay ill pass looks bland af and prob plays the same 8 sounds fair im hearing almost everywhere the story isnt motivating much and thats an essential element to most if not all rpg fans this game deserve more like a 910 now this is a review not that ign bullshit that doesnt explain anything about the game itself and they made bravely second and bravely default ign gave this game an 93 which is a very high score and it is higher than nintendo life and nintendo world report then i asked them in the comment section if they were paid by nintendo andor square enix guess what my comment was censored the games is 60 hahahahaha hell no i can get better rpg on my cellphone for 99 cent dont have enough good boy points to buy this no its not a great look so tired of stupid retro jrpgs if youre going to make a new game make it look great not like a washed out blurry pixely mess yeah id say 8 is about right i kinda wish their stories intertwined or at least acknowledged each other a little bit but its still a fine jrpg with a nice combat system cant wait to continue the story when i pick mine up amazon broke the street date and i got my copy like 11 hours ago biggest grip is theres no way to speed up the animations there cool at first but after the 100th time i just want it to hurry up am i the only one that doesnt like turn based games like these idk not my thing but im sure any turn based fan would love this where are the disgaea like supers these comments in the comment section about the price for the game and story being the only thing these people care is beyond funny and dumb to read wow i cant believe the low point was the story it was so strong in the demo you can immediately tell when a game has no soul same score as ffxv and i really hated that game hard skip great gameplay and amazing graphics but weak story ruins all of it before i watch the videolet me guess another 8 from gamespot im glad topher grace likes it 8path traveler got an 8 from 8spot decent i really want to purchase but im afraid of not having as much opportunity to play as i would like imagine super metroid made in the same graphical fashion i dig the art style a modernized snes throwback 60 bucks for rpgmaker game rofl and this weaboo playing with japanese language on like he can actually speak it lmfao fuck outta here if its 20 or 30 ill buy it but if its higher nope edit 60 helll to the nooo not buying this also got an 8 so you can not watch the video edit and me saying indie game is an joke on the art style sounds battle style and the fact the switch is full of them not me saying i dislike the art style because i like the art style i say looks not necessarily meaning to see or the visualsgraphics of the game its self but of the game in its entirety ive seen that each ending actually builds up a larger threat did any reviewer finished the 8 stories and datamine include a final boss theme and dungeon that doesnt seems to be the one of that is used during the final chapter of each character interesting that watching so many reviews come out today the divide seems to be between people who thought that an rpg must have an overarching largescale story for the party to partake in and those who were okay with this reimagining of the rpg story experience where you really do just have a bunch of companions all with their own smallscale stories im still going to buy this game despite naysayers about the story like gamespot because i have confidence that the individual stories will be endearing after playing the demo and i dont need every rpg i play to involve saving the universe i really want to get this game but im currently playing xenoblade chronicles 2 and hollow knightmaybe when i finish those games ill hop on this one should be higher modern classic jrpg with a shitty story is not a jrpg worth playing id rather play shining resonance refrain im soo excited to buy this game turn based ftw will there be voice over in english or is japanese unavoidable looks so sterile and bland theres almost no animation in the enemies kinda looks like an rpg maker game disappointed cant wait octopath is the best game ive played in years i absolutely agree with the character interactions dont get me wrong i love this game to bits but sometimes i wonder why another character doesnt do x like take tressas chp 1 for example therion couldve infiltrated in the pirates camp and stolen whatever he needed much better than tressa could olberic couldve stopped and challenged spoiler character name in cyrus chapter 2 and 3 alphyn couldve healed olphilias parents way back in chp 1 and chp 2 and avoided a huge conflict the characters as you say feel static though there is one thing i do disagree the characters stories do tie together that being the gate of finnis and graham another thing you didnt mention that sort of bothered me was what to do once i finished the story the 4 special classes are a blast but you only get to use them by the time you get through everyones chp 4 because thats how the leveling system intended to work the only time i did get to use them was against th i have to disagree i think this game is amazing i view octopath as an experiment in its visual design i think that people coined the look as hidef pixel or something the fragmented story really did not catch my interest when i played it and i just felt that the choice to make all of the enemies in battle appear as static images more than a little lazy my personal favorite therion i dont trust anybody anymore and only work alone the other 7 travelers whom hed only known for 5 minutes before joining them helping him on his quest waves my biggest gameplay problem other than the bad grind is that despite using a class system there is no incentive to change jobs once you unlock that ability you use the same pool of points to level up all of them even if you never use the job normally you only level the jobs youre using which helps add variety since youll switch around to mix and match like ff5 and bravely default this is why i still love ffxiii even the gameplay suck lack of any lvl scalinggrading in ch 4 also curtails the flow quite obvious the reviewer didnt finish the game or he would know that there is a main villain in the game the 8 traveler quest give you just the outline of the biger picture but to see it you need to put a bit of effort to find the final boss dungeon the failure to handle 8 different stories well is laughable when square already has an entire franchise based around the concept with the saga series i find it very interesting that you critize almost everything that i love about this game lets begin with the cities to you the lack of context between each story in the same town seems dissapointing i guess its about seeing a connection between the characters to me this was also very surprigins but i was happy about it it fleshed out different aspects of the world it didnt feel out of touch to me to be honest i would say that this particular choice of storytelling was a great step to build a deeper world it gives one place not just one niche now for the storystructure i loved it i think it was a very smart choice the go for that this game is not your typical jrpg usually the story goes on very stale and at one point explodes suddenly you arent the little farmer of your village but the redeemer of the holyspacedragonegg which is the key to open a portal where magic is infinite and could destroy the world if bad people get hands on it octopath trav sorry design doc in 616 you say something that is bull you only expose that you havent finish the game there is a story that joins them all so you are ignorant and a lier review something else if you dont want to finish the game 100 i agree with you for most things but i think you dont have the true end cause the stories intertwine im really late but after many tests therion warrior or hunter ophillia starseer tressa runeblade primrose sorcerer shes better than cyrus due to elem atk mechanics she has more speed etc the narrative structure you posted was the thing that prevents me from playing this game which is a shame months late but just wanted to point out haanit does speak proper old english what most people commonly misidentify as old english ie that used in the middle ages is actually middle english and was a transitional language that bridges old and modern english more over this can be frustrating at times to listen to but it is imo the best choice when it comes to localization when japanese games use certain dialects or older versions of their language localization teams often have to find an english equivalent now i know what it means to wince its kinda upsetting how many people think octopath isnt a great game just because the story is handled more like a novella than a traditional story which theyre not used to again and i can back this up with a thirty page essay that ive already written octopath traveler is my favorite game of all time there actually is something that links all the characters stories together and you only gain that knowledge at the very end of the game also spoilers for the end of octopath traveler proceed with caution opheliamattias mentions galdera the dark god the dark god is the true final boss of the game who appears at the gate of finis cyrus the tome this has rituals and information about the dark god this information is used to get crossfords blood and use it in a ritual to open the gate of finis tressa the journal of an old adventurer is given to her by the captain the adventurer is graham crossford olberic hornburg the location where the gate of finis is located primrose i actually forgot why she had links to the dark god because its been a full year since i completed the game sorry alfyn the man who he looks up to and saved his life as a child is graham crossford therion the orbs he collects are used to open the gate of finis haanit the bea i finally finished the game and i had been waiting until then to watch this ive been reading up a lot on this and i think the final point is dead on the reviews and concepts in this game can be recycled with a more focused and nuanced main story for all the characters to be involved with the town cohesiveness was a huge thing for me i had to play on japanese because it really bugged me how 5 characters whove grown up and lived in the same town their whole life had 5 different accents 621 thats the point of the game its a collection of separate stories like a book of fairy tales hell one of them at the end of the game is straight up revealed to be a girl rereading someone elses adventure the game is very upfront about it being a collection of separate stories in case the name octopath traveler wasnt enough of a hint for you if you didnt catch the hint and were disappointed by this thats your own fault i personally love haanits voice actually its unique imo and her midbattle dialogue is as hype as the other characters man this channel is great well good thing it sold well cuz then that means a sequel could contain the critiques you and dozens of others provided im surprised he didnt mention olberics voice line that says something like the battle is truly bdhdgshk i never could figure out what the last line was or the advanced classes that you have to find totally on accident and are practically a requirement to advance the game i totally agree with everything else you said though despite loving octopath anyways i downloaded the demo and stopped playing when i got to the second story and the characters parents dont even acknowledge you when you recruited the character not having alternate dialogue for all characters is just lazy and defeats the purpose of this story the combat is also a significant downgrade from bravely default so so boring all 8 stories do tie into each other and its super cool when they do 930 does it have japanese vocals this is like live a live all over again but with 2000 more dialogue this seems more like a review why is it called design doc it would be so great for ps4 to get this game also spoilers each persons final chapter overlaps with another persons the characters arent connected but the lure ties in with the everyones individual goals deeper spoilers without the true final boss here are the characters that over lap olbric therion haanet ophilia tressa alfin cyrus primrose all of them connect to what brings them to why the corruption of their world exists without saying much there are 2 other people that makes the catalyst of the story complete if you havent figured it out already ill let you solve it yourself in this game the characters arent really all that important but the lure of the world was what octopath traveler was trying to accomplish oh man i feel you just ruined the game for me im finishing chapter 1 and the only reason i kept pushing through the tedium of linear campaigns and repetitive combat was the curiosity to see how the different storylines built up towards a cohesive story i thought the different problems the characters were facing were caused by the same underlying threat eg the tome you have to find for cyrus would explain something about an old evil the creature haanit fights on ch 1 was fleeing from something even worst that killed his teacher the men that killed primrose parents were part of an evil organization etc now you tell me this im only witnessing 8 independent stories with horrible pacing caused by the fact that well im watching 8 different stories at the same time i bought this game and spent 15 hours because it was supposed to be so great i hate gamer communities theres actually a few things you cant steal only buy and viceversa and the same goes for most of the path actions ive studied old english old high german old norse protogermanic and protoindoeuropean i really liked haanits accent can anyone tell me what that music playing at the end is from its hauntingly familiar i originally expected the game to play more like seiken densetsu 3 where the characters have seemingly unrelated goals that turn out to all intertwine throughout the storytelling into one ultimate goal of the party agreed totally on your proposed solutions i would have loved if 4 characters each came together on opposite sides of a warring conflict a la ff tactics its a shame because the presentation and my god the sound track and battle system are amazing but whoever wrote the story and designed the plot should be shot i still havent beaten the game for this reason the structure is weird nothing feels connected so its fun in bursts and then i lose interest cool idea but problems with execution that was also my one issue they should have had all 8 characters arcs combine by the end for the purpose of defeating one big baddie lovely game overall i loved this game prob my favorite of 2018 and probably favorite overall i thought the main villain was set up fine and made sense it was hinted at in every chapter and its existence was made known the boss itself feels a little bad though and could have been done better the stories were all good and felt like their own i personally didnt mind everyone being separate the banter was enough to connect them and while i would want a bit more of course making each character change the story a bit would be a nightmare pairing characters up sounds like a nice idea though the combat is what really drew me in and it was some of the best combat ive ever had some bosses were long but none ever felt bad the longer fights overall were extremely positive and the bosses being as long as they were made the game even better cant wait for the sequel my biggest gripe or problem is how repetitive and structural it gets it could have really benefited from the ocasional minigame that most rpgs tend to have to light things up and give more life to the world it occasionally has a few moments that drive from its linearity but they might be in near the end game if you simply werent playing the chapters that have them and even then they are very scares and short lived and again because of the linearity of the story i reach a point where dont feel like im interacting with the world or in a journey i feel like im watching a very typical to sometimes good story and i dont feel any stakes are at hand for me or my characters who will always be availabl as it stands its a 710 to a 810 at times but i agree this game could have been an instant classic a perfect 1010 and i have really high hopes that they make a sequel that fulfill this becouse it would be a tragedy to see this conceptip and team go to waste sorry bud but i refuse your ideas as i want to have freedom in my play rather than forcing me to play it your way for the same of combining stories that dont need to combine despite how many flaws this game has the pros vastly outweigh the cons in my opinion and those pros are what make octopath something very special to me and what i consider to be my favorite game of all time at least for now this game was super overrated for the disconnected plots like you mentioned if they didnt go for a fake 16 bit art style this game would have been mostly ignored video sums up perfectly why i couldnt truly like this game especially being a tales fan where a jrpg franchise is absolutely rich with party member character interactions and individual branch narratives tieing to its main plot the game may not tie all of the characters together but the post game dungeon fills in all the holes and connects the enemies and friends of the 8 characters together so i wouldnt say all the characters are an island unto themselves all 8 stories are connected you commented on the marathon style boss fights not even mentioning the secret bosses at the end of the game i wont spoil it but if you lose the fight it blows really hard id have vastly preferred it if you had to choose one character as the main one and follow their story and they would provide the perspective from which you see the main story which seems to be missing from the actual game for the most part then have the opportunity to recruit some or all of the others and help them with their personal quests and help is the key word here instead of going through the whole thing they would do a large part of their own quests behind the scenes and you would only aid them in a side quest or a few they would also do their own thing when you havent yet met them so that they would actually move around the map from chapter to chapter some of them might not get along with each other some might kill each other if you hadnt recruited them or fall in love after getting to know each other if you had that would have encouraged people who really like the game to play through the whole thing 8 times from different perspectives to see everything i enjoyed me some octopath but then i realized that it basically only has sub plots and i wasnt even interested in how one single story ended oh you hated the game way more than i thought you would thats too bad its my new favorite of all time you did a video on my favorite game this video captured my opinions on this game completely and entirely gameplay was great but it needed way more characterization and a better overall narrative i turned off the voice acting after the first cutscene octopath traveler looks like took inspiration from the old saga series romancingfrontier for its mechanicstory so i understand most of its pitfall and advantage at least it will be released on pc will definitely play it until squareenix released another saga games they need to make a sequel and call it quadrupath traveler with only 4 characters but with intertwined story lines octopath traveler would have been even more of a masterpiece if they polished the stories ahh but you see why not have a thief and a merchant thats why i have tressa as my leader haha i find the mechanics to be worse than bravely defaultstill pretty greatand the plot is weird the overall story is interconnectedbut the plot just kindaisnt the game has two ways to play it storywise one char alone or multiple chars alonethe game gets insanely grindyi actually didnt finish because i wanted to do it like that as the game sold me on choosing who of the 8 to take and togetherthe game just falls apart because they have less than 0 reason to cooperate some of the classes and motivations really contradict a cooperation directly honestly the stories are heavily interconnected but i dislike how they dont begin connecting until the 3rd and 4th chapters if you are truly honest about making a nostalgia pandering game dont splatter it with water gloss depth of field vignette bokeh and chromatic aberration dont intentionally do lowres sprites and tiled texturing for the environment only to mix them with infinitely higher resolution world map frame character artworks and particle effects dont go with another sterile lifeless user interface that looks just like any smartphone app when you were able to cook up spectacular decorative graphics like that world map frame earlier and while were at it tooltips should not obscure half of the option below your selection im looking at a game that tries to juggle at least three visual styles at the same time and its a complete eyesore and disservice to rpgs of the olden days its so painful to watch these videos of people that didnt even finish the game most of you dont even know all paths tell a single larger story seiken densetsu 3 does it better it has different characters and the combo of characters affects the story along with combat i loved how the thief told his friend he cant come steal a jewel because hed get him caught but finds you with 3 other people and is fine with 4 others following but not 1 extra unlimited saga on the ps2 that is what this game could have been in terms of narrative the mechanics in us was difficult and the learning curve was ridiculous but the storyline was great even with 7 different character storylines i like how you can always see your whole party i never understood the logistical reasons why most rpgs only shows the lead it always seemed lazy to me not to mention immersion breaking but im not a programmer sure theres a good reason i agree with a lot youve said here also these mechanics just scream to be perfected 1020 you pretty much made a ff6 clone by that point i watched studio ponocs short film festival and honestly ive warmed up to the idea of 8 independent story islands i wish you would have mentioned how path actions especially stealing actually bring the game down theres always a savepoint nearby so youre just going to spend a tedious half hour with slow load times to scum a 5 chance tressas passive actually makes more than enough money to just buy everything so theres little reason to choose between them though there are some items only therion can steal and items sold for gold are best stolen since they wont resell for a profit if you keep tressa with you she can also buy a lot of those 5 odds items that therion struggles with and those items are ludicrously powerful and help to oneshot many of those bosses you called damage sponges also haanits middle english is mostly accurate it only sounds weird because you dont actually know what middle english sounds like also also there is an interwoven plot that becomes pretty damn clear once you hit everyones chapter 3s and 4s with only tressa being the odd duck who doesnt quite connect her final boss does connect to the larger plotbut tressa doesnt connect to her final boss a lot of people miss the final chapter however because theres a mandatory side quest chain that requires all mild midgame spoilers i really really wish the travelers wouldve interacted more cyrus and olberic talking about hornburg haanit and primrose have an amazing chemistry given their history ophilia making apple bunnies for therion tressa and alfyn goofing around alfyn and therion working through each others issues some of the travel banters felt weird and forced like therion the most mistrusting out of all eight in alfyns chapter 3 not even worried about miguel and they felt like the other travelers are just watching the chapter play out on a stage or a screen idk for the english voice acting you mentioned but the japanese voice over is well suited for the characters and really satisfying and feel free to join the weaboo club the largest point that goes unmentioned in any review of this game is how most of everything is optional im fairly certain that this game wasnt designed to be played in a way in which people would feel burnout or notice its limitations instead its meant to be played a few hours at a time put down and then returned to the devs are okay if you forget about it for a little while thats why they put the plot summaries in the pub most of the reviews ive read on this game clearly did not consider this and just plowed through the game like it was fucking re4 or something sall good nice review all the same amen to the issue with bosses being damage sponges i also have a lot of issue with some of the later optional bosses getting way too many turns hitall attacks its the only way to make them hard given the games systems but it makes them feel unfair instead as far as interweaving plot linesi have to point out there is a connected conclusion with the gate of finisbut its a sidequest which was probably the wrong move i set the character voices to japanese i think its because of the english translation but the names of the towns in french arent that straightforward honestly even time i hear hannit i keep expect some kid to run in yelling miss thou miss thou i could never get over how drab and monotone everything is most areas seem to be various shades of brown like a quake stage or something i havent played this game but im glad to hear that despite how much it fumbled with execution it had an interesting concept that hopefully will be executed better in a sequel so whens the design of piccolos daily dose doc ok ok last thing i got to say totally agreed whit how to improve the story force ppl to pick every one also dont make terrion or make him but force him into trusting your partie else wtf you recute him any way 2 sec before you recrute him he was there saying no too 2 other ppl wanting to partie whit him so why would he trust you make 0 sence it weird and it not great i kinda dont like terrion story just because of that oh just sorry i just want to say there really no cartoonest character in this game who you call cartoonish any way tressa the marchant seaking adventure tresure ophilia the cleric that is so nice to ppl that she will actualy stop and help kid whit a freaking broche it that is cartoonest i dont know what you mean by that chapter 2 of ophilia is there you let you know exactly what she all about she not as nave as alfyn she kind more so than anything kindess is to be prize and it not cliche is it what drive your character more than anything i guess the sure they all got 1 big quality and 1 big weakness tho i wouldnt say they are not all kind and why wouldnt you fallow someone not kind any way the closest to someone not being kind we get is primrose and terrion but i would say they are kind any way terrion is just broken by a friend he had that why he have hard time trusting ppl but he still kind to them there more than just his pride sure it help him keep him fighting tressa geting you that sweet 300 000 into the mid game where you can buy kof kof give you the option to buy op stuff like good old forbidden staff being op as fuck makeing your cyrus crazy crazy good stealing and buy is actually pretty balence in my opinion you alwas want the steal because of chess to open up but you also alwas want tressa because of that sweet 2000 she make every every time you go into a new map area helping you buy 70 000 items like said op staff you could get it whit stealing pll and selling stuff but it pretty long and boring to do and overall will make you less money finally tressa give bp is crazy op compare to anything terrion got i guess debuffing the atk damage is good tho that really much all that good whit terrion he dosent work well in a team he a solo player also wtf you recrute him in the frist place he dosent trust anyone but yah try tressa next time you can get some crazy good stuff whit her any way most of the good item will cost y perso i like the story quit alot tho i fell at the mid point the story should come into one end game story i dont know how they would do that but i like how each story fell personal and growth the character they are use for the only real weakness being again the lack of driveing main quest about 60 into the game no interweaving plotlines eh someone didnt finish the entire game methinks i disagree with a few of the points you mentioned above especially tressa but overall i can see what you mean and where youre coming from and respect that and it is far from a perfect game and many of the suggestions you posited i also agree with to some extent i think thats why i couldnt get through this game i gathered everyone and after that my brain just fell asleep whenever i tried playing it i started as olberic yes yes im a noble piece of shit but here me out and i was really disappointed when he didnt even argue against theron cause he didnt even exist during his path same goes for many of the others heck i dont mind in the beginning cause they have that as flashbacks but the part where they meet up doesnt even do anything major missed opportunity all because there wasnt anything to tie the eight stories together and have them interplay into themselves hp sponges really sounds like someone didnt stack buffs and debuffs each boss also has 3 phases one from 100 to 50 hp second from 50 to 25 hp and finally from 25 to 0 thats the usual structure anyway lets hope square sees your video and makes a sequel that really makes history the art is goregeus the ost is magnificent the gameplay is incrediblethe only thing left is the story and if they fix that like the example you gave of the 1244villain the next octopath traveler will be definetly a masterpiece great video the final song is a spoiler a big spoiler better i shut up xd oh also have a main villain but it does have a and not one that shows up optionally out of nowhere okay fair enough super duper endgame massive story spoiler dont click read more they made it a postgame optional sidequest why would you make the boss fight against the ultimate destroyer of worlds optional also its hidden the game never tells you where to go to fight galdera you just have to have completed certain side quests and go to west swarkii trail for some reason cool fight though kinda wish they would let you save before engaging in a severalhour bossfight preceded by a twohour boss rush but whatever just to quibble haanits olde english isnt made up its the type of english used in the canterbury tales i believe a major pet peeves is how boring the cut scenes are the sprites barely move or emote they just stand there or walk back and forth no creativity to those moments i disagree your preferred design made it like a normal rpg system that we have already what you lack is the skill to read octopath is like a book and a game you read and imagine how they are connected and you play the game how it is intended to play octopath is awesome fun and adictive as hell god the music is phenominal love this game i heard they added an octopath character from ilikechurchsylvania to smash he has a couple of minor decent suggestions but a lot of what is great about this game went over the author of this videos head its as if he couldnt see the forest for the trees this game was so disappointing i absolutely loved the first maybe 20 hours of it before it became clear that these stories were never going to intersect in a meaningful way great battle system amazing visuals garbage cardboardcutout anime characters and melodramatic storylines where no plot beat has any weight behind it very sad stuff i think you might be being a little too hard on the structure sure what you said is correct but you didnt talk about the pros of the storyline structure having the disconnected and individual storylines offers a unique and fresh feel some characters clearly have better stories with some being downright boring while others being greatly rewarding this might be a case of looking at it from the wrong perspective the structure could be improved but i dont think the concept is wrong nor do i think the answer is to make it all connected even if i do like that kind of structure doing so would make octopath traveler lose some of its charm the haanit part really annoyed me too im german but i played the game in english with japanese dub and reading that all the time just made me hope the character arc finally ends soon your proposal of having the characters form progressively larger preset parties reminds me a lot of golden sun or the scenario segment in ff6 that game would be so damn good i mostly agree with your suggestion of fixing the plot but i dont agree with having a main villain one thing i like about octopath traveler is that the world does not revolve around the heroes and it shows the world in a state other jrpgs will pass off as the peaceful unevental era having an ancient evil coming back from the earth or some evil mastermind behind most or all of these plots would undermine that its unconventional but i dont think its wrong for each character to have their own smaller scale and more personal antagonist but i do agree the party should interact with each other more and be involved with each others development the characters are travelers not heroes one way they could have fixed the interaction problem without drastically changing the story would be to simply add dialogue from other party members in story cutscenes at least to fix plotholes that could be caused with certain combinations of characters minor spoilers when yusufa primroses friend is stabbed and dying if alfyn is in the party have him explain that shes too fatally wounded to be healed when lucia lures cyrus into a building alone then knocks him unconscious and imprisons him alone have her first explain to the other party members that she has to speak to cyrus in private so they wait outside without inexplicably getting trapped alongside him semimajor spoilers and please please have characters react to hearing about peopleevents in one story that are mentioned in another the revelation that the guy who wrote tressas journal is the same guy who healed alfyn as a child should elicit some kind of reaction hey doc ive got a question what makes an rpg an rpg and what games did it right before i watch is there spoilers like end gameish stuff also a bit more on the personal side of thingsbut how do you manage to play a video game gather accurate details about the game and its design and still have the time to create these beautiful videos in particular i struggle with 100ing games and all the filler contentwhich of course is not conducive to understanding the systems at play and more akin to fixating on the irrelevantextra content let me know if you have any tips my friend great video as always design doc but this one felt more like a review slightly focused on the design of the 3 ss rather than an analysis on the design and its intended purpose and possible alternative to achieve a particular designmeaningfeeling in the player just my two cents looking forward to your next video the more of this game i see the less i want it haha thanks for the insights lad ps this is a completely superfluous nitpick but miss haanit is butchering early modern english as in bill shakespeares work and the most popular english translation of the bible easy mistake but middle english is like chaucer a little more obtuse and archaic and true old english well fder re e eart on heofonum father of ours thou who art in heavens s

thou us into temptation but alese releasedeliver us recently found this channel and it looks like it has great content just one question have you ever done a review on little big planet if dont boi ur losing sooooo much that game is sooooo creative literally and figuratively it made my younger self love it so much and it made 10years old on the past past week ok the main villain didnt exactly come out of nowhere almost every story hinted at it but having it be gated behind sidequests was definitely a bad idea i liked the unconventional story structure my biggest complaint was the uneven difficulty the combat is so fun sometimes but some chapters were ruined for me in terms of challenge at least because i was overleveled i didnt grind at all i just leveled too high by exploring the optional dungeons and playing the stories in a certain order squareenix is updating the feel of a 16bit jrpg for a modern context since final fantasy 4 heroes of light on ds no shit this is like the 5th game on the series i was really excited for octopath but i just couldnt take haanit i never returned to it after her chapter i already had issues though because of the structure if stories intertwined it would be cool but getting interested in what was going on with one character only to have to pick up someone else and then probably grind a bit too was just too much of a barrier for me to get invested i somewhat disagree and think that there doesnt need to be a cohesive story between all characters im ok with doing things differently and having separate stories for each character what i do wish for though is better integration of party members in each characters own story there was a moment in one of tressas chapters where she has to acquire a map that is crazy expensive therion tells her that he could just steal it and she denies his help that would have been a cool choice between doing things the noble way and having to use more resources or doing it the rogue way and risking getting caught and alienated by the town each character has such strong notable traits that i think this kind of structure could have worked really well need to get some info from a guy maybe have the option to have primrose seduce him and gain it that way need to track someone down hannit can have her animals sniff out the trail rather than you needing to bother everyone in town with question wow a fair octopath review ive never seen that before seriously this might be the only guy who completed the game and is worthy of calling his video a real review its actually kinda fun to just explore orsterra and seeing how the world works than having to save it from the big evil for the millionth time i wouldnt mind there being more interpath interactions but dont make it a quest to save the world yetafuckinggain i agree with some of this personally i feel the eight characters stories would had been much better if they werent restricted to four chapters each i found that most of the characters chapter 2 for example didnt really add much to each of their stories imo ophilia ch 2 being the biggest offender if they maybe had one or more chapter added to each story the stories pacing would had been much better that and if they only reworked certain issues in each stories such as the outofnowhere villain from tressas chapter 4 or the little developed villains from primrose or olberic of course it could backfire making an already long game even longer and yes the characters should had interacted more but the issue with that i can see is that it would had taken forever for the developers to make up eight storylines that weave together especially considering that you can recruit the other 7 characters of your group in any order if you were to make exclusive cutscenes i think the path actions are more problematic than you lead on cyruss and alfyns are literally the same things but cyruss can fail like what its not like you get extra info with cyrus they are just the same same with ophelias and primroses literally the same but one can fail for the olberichaanit pair haanits path sucked ass but well at least it was different than olberics the only pair that was decently designed at least in intention was buyingstealing either take a risk for a free item or buy a riskfree item sounds good right well too bad its horribly balanced there are tons of items that you can steal at 100 rate and a lot at a negligible risk like 80 meanwhile buying those 100 steal rate items cost a considerable amount of money for the amount the game throws at you i would have 10k saved up and an armor would cost 3k but have a 95 steal rate then add the fact that you can savescum and then using tressa is literally useless eve great work i was entranced with the aesthetic for the first few hours but really got tired of the script if you listen to the original japanese track you can see how a much more straightforward tone was undermined by the translators need for flowery incredibly corny prose when i realized about 40 hours in that there wasnt going to be any overarching plot i grudgingly finished the game just for the sake of it so much promise but a real disappointment im actually surprised how well the characters can pair up from your idea of a better chapter 1 especially since theyre just pairs that happen to start off next to each other alfyntherion and primolberic in particular also funny story having started with tressa i noticed that her chapter 2 area is also cyruss to be honest i halfexpected their 2nd chapters to be connected when i started playing too bad though play till the actual ending and youll see that all 8 storylines are connected to one story arc that played in the background all game long saying the game could have done more to intertwine the 8 storylines during the main game play is certainly true saying there is nothing that ties these eight threads together 618 is not that said if there were to come an octopath traveller 2 id love duomissions ie storylines that do not stand on their own but need interaction with other characters storylines in order to be completed and to have a bigger drive towards a final boss that combines the stories currently this video proves people miss the final boss because it is not prominently put within the narrative structure of the core gameplay i think the idea that every story needs a traditional structure is flawed and restrictive i love how op separates the story the game delivers on the concept of a world made up of smaller stories there shouldnt always be one big thing everyone has to solve the world is full of millions of small menaces that all need dealing with id much rather have 8 smaller stories tham one big one again its different and interesting thats why live a live is better at least they can excuse lack of character interaction with the fact that the main cast is seperated by time and geography and even then have more engaging recruitment dialogue than octopath heck they even fought against the same boss throughout the game also akiras pathaction octopaths travellers path action even with its flaws octopath traveler is one of the best rpgs ive played if not one of my favorite games of all time i really hope we get a sequel to it i really liked octopath traveler but i had some problems with it as well i was disapointed that the stories of the eight travelers were completely disconnected but after some time playing the game i got over it and started apreciating it for what it was although i cant say the same about the lack of interaction between the characters but my main problem with this game is how basic are the dungeons there is nothing to them the only thing you will thing you will find are some enemies and some chests that sometimes require some thinking on how to get to them i was kinda expecting some puzzles in the middle or something like that anyways i still love this game and i hope that soon they will make sequel that improves on those aspects if that happens its a 1010 for me i think some of the reason you feel let down by the narrative structure is in your expectation of a main villain you came in to this game with the assumption that all 8 stories were actually one worldspanning epic and yeah thats normal for a jrpg youre always starting from humble beginnings to save the world in these kind of games but thats not a hard rule i guess im just more accepting of the idea that a game about 8 tales can be just that not every game has to be about the same thing also octopaths structure makes it feel more like a game of dnd which i like oh yeah i forgot this game had voiceacting i turned that off when i started the game still this seems pretty accurate to my experience so far too midgame to be fair i havent played octopath traveler but from what i understood from this video about its story structure it could have benefited from something like what they did for valkyrie profile where there were individual character plots and a core plot that united them especially if there was some pervading element that lingered in the individual character plots that encouraged an evolution of the core plot re your comment on storytelling in octopath being weak i think this is from approaching this game like standard jrpgs that railroad you through a story that its trying to tell octopath on the other hand briefly sets up a world with a series of vignettes it tells just enough to know what the atmosphere of the world is like how laws money people generally operate the idea here is to create a certain amount of narrative space to let players put the rp into rpg by telling us little about how the characters interact the game purposefully leaves this narrative space up to the imagination of the player this theme of telling ones story and growing from ones journey is echoed throughout the plot especially in the paths of haanit and tressa along with the prevalence of side stories i think a prevailing thing that the game is attempting to do is to inspire creativity and ask the player what is your story the overarching threat is galdera didnt you do the final quest where you face galdera and his daughter i would have cut primrose alfyn tressa and haanit from the game what does this leave us octo olberic cyrus therion and ophelia the four most important plot lines they also cover the standard team of warrior mage thief and cleric they also have the unique path actions the other half have the same or similar ones making them redundant the game also suffers from where are the characters when shits goong down syndrome specifically where are my party members they were clearly written to be single stories and this upsets me greatly therion ophelia and cyrus suffer the most from this if we include the redundant characters alfyn and primrose also face this greatly thats more than half the cast of course we cant forget the formula of path action dont need to use path action then do it again side note i dont like how haanits story ended happily was a cop out her bosses were also underwhelming except the first one im afraid i disagree on the story aspect and partly and on the part about the cities while i get the criticism ill say that it all works at the end frankly by the end of the fourth chpater 4 you are able to pretty much understand whats really going on behind the scene yes the story are separated on the surface but that is what was sold to us in the first place yes indeed octopath traveler is not perfect and its flawed but nonetheless its a beautiful game the offhand idea of using fire emblem supports sounds like it would do a whole lot for this game another idea would be to use a system like the vignettes in the tales of games yknow the way you proposed restructering the game was how i thought the game was gonna be structered on my first playthrough i started as therion in my first playthrough and hes told to seek out a scholar who is studying the dragonstones my automatic assumption was that it meant for me to go to atlasdam and recruit cyrus and was really surprised when that did nothing and the game actually wanted me to go to noblecourt all of that to say that you wouldnt need to adjust the narratives of the stories too drastically in order for the stories to be interconnected have the mystery of cyruss investigation be the dragonstones instead of a missing book things like that granted the really bad stories would need a total rewrite like tressa and ophilias but who really minds that i actually still love this game and dont mind how its structered too much my biggest gripe is the writing of some of these stories you have amazing stories like primroses and therions but th a game that did that kind of structure right was dragon quest 4 you play every character individually and see where they come from and what their motivations are but in the last chapter you play the real hero go on your adventure jrpg style and meet up with every character along the way this method of storytelling can be improved upon sure but that basis was very unique and its a shame octopath didnt borrow more from it than the surface element of multiple characters that initially have nothing to do with one another octopath did half the job here tressas waaaayyy better than therion anything really good is like 10 steal chances and even his chests arent really worth it but with tressa you make so much money its crazy you can buy all the best gear and buy unlimited amounts of the best items with therion youll maybe get a couple good items yes you could save scum but that just makes you a cheater and a fool easy to consume but lacking substance thats my assessment of the game the funny thing about it though thats also my assessment of mario odyssey and breath of the wild so maybe thats just nintendos design philosophy for the switch making games easy to consume on the go and polish the experience for that target regardless of overall drops in quality of the structure once you take a step back and look at it as a whole something bothers me way more than that in the game though did they really need that much sparkle and other effects the game looks shiny for sure but it also looks ridiculous to me especially that ice biome god the sparkles were killing me ive seen this kind of video before personally i think this game could take notes from odin sphere you should also totally do a video on that one where its 5 characters have very intertwining stories and villains that add to eachother and you find out more about their world and npcs not to mention each character have theyre own arcs both in their stories and in other character stories i dont think the core of jrpgs is the story but instead the mechanics since without them we would have a visual novel i would even say the characters and setting are more important than the plot i also think modern visual effects dont blend well with pixel art and the voice acting doesnt really fit in a jrpg that only uses abstract pixel art without lip syncing it doesnt even have character portraits adding in the problems with the narrative structure i cant really agree that other modern pixel art jrpgs should follow octopath travelers example haanits dialog is actually pretty cool she conjugates modern english vocabulary using several middle english grammar conventions note shakespeare modern english chaucer middle english beowulf old english the strange en ending that she puts on so many verbs is an ending used for plural verbs a thing modern english doesnt have so i sing thou singest and haanit singeth but her party singen if you had to memorize any of the canterbury tales you might remember the line and smale foweles maken melodye which is and small fowls make melody but fowls is plural so make becomes maken this isnt to say it isnt super awkward but if something was the opposite of making up old english on the fly this is it actual old english is pretty inscrutable by the way hwt we gardena in geardagum eodcyninga rym gefrunon hu a elingas ellen fremedon i feel that you really cant analyze octopaths story structure without contrasting to its older titles to saga squeenix used to be all about the interweaving characters and their individual stories and i can tell you that the one i personally played saga frontier 2 already mostly followed your suggestion on how they should structure it so they already have a good idea about the way things should be done why did they pick this way did the other way not seem financially successful enough what did they gain from this format localization plays a huge part in the suspect scripts in jrpgs not necessarily the story structure but the moment to moment writing for sure i really wish you had talked about the beautiful yet lifeless dungeons which is my greatest disappointment with the game you dont even need a story if the dungeons feel exciting but instead theyre mechanically more cookie cutter than the towns edit in octopaths defense though this is the first game ive found that properly uses thee thou eth and est correctly but combining early modern english with their own anglolike conjugal structure which was also well done really hurts the effect i cant believe how often i have to tell you guys this thats not old english its early modern english old english was spoken at the 400s and sounds more like dutch than anything else i found myself getting pretty tired by the time i finished everyones chapter 3 stories and feel like having a set party of only 4 quadropath traveler anyone would alleviate that fatigue plus the stories could come together instead of being separate the whole time but i like your proposed tweaks for how the characters couldve interacted better theres so much potential i really hope they make a new game that fixes that stuff i disagree with your proposed solution i love the games sense of freedom and think the game would be lesser for taking that away weariness from having played so many jrpgs which take themselves so seriously also has made me appreciate the simple no nonsense nature of the stories and not mind the isolated structure at all i do however miss there being a common plot besides the excellent endgame stuff my own proposal would have been to have a 9th story that is only unlocked if you have all 8 party members and can progress along the other storylines that way the open nature of the game would still be intact but you still get the satisfaction of all characters coming together just my two cents another problem octopath has is that you have to grind between chapters if you finished all the first chapters for all the characters you are left with an almost 10 level gap of pure grinding before you can really get on with the story i mean yea you could go into the next parts of the storys with lower level but that would make the boss battles even longer without making them more interesting when i first saw octopath traveler i expected it to be similar to dragon quest iv but modernized and improved instead we got this fancy looking mess the final optional boss and the stories you read before hand illustrated how these eight people were not a random group instead it showed that the major inciting incidents of their lives were all interconnected they had a shared past that made traveling together make sense and even that wasnt acknowledge by the characters the hinted at interconnected story just wasnt raised to the level it could have beenshould have been i loved this game but i really had hoped that the stories would have merged somewhat at some point you get a sense that they tried to figure out how to make the party feel like a party but got too deep into the eight paths eight stories idea and couldnt work their way back i really hope they make a follow up game id buy it in a heartbeat i also should say i loved how easy this game was to pick up and put down compared to a lot of other rpgs if i only had 15 minutes on a bus to play a game octopath was an option where a lot of rpgs require a i absolutely agree with you also my issue is that i skipped the intros of the other characters i invited into my party because i thought i get to their story when i restart the game just like the trailers promised eight completely different stories the way i understood it was that you follow one characters journey and the other ones are just party members but by actively skipping their story i feel like im missing out on something the developers intended the player to do of course its my fault for skipping but its kind of odd game design to spoil each characters story when you meet them i assumed you would get introduced to everything over time btw i love the idea you proposed at the end i feel like a story structure like this is really needed if theres no structure there is no hierarchy to rank important things also the narrative gets very messy and loses focus the devs totally need to see this video great nuanced critique 236 very nice play bravely default instead the gameplay and music was great and i got a taste of a traditional rpg but other then that its was very meh the way the story and characters was handled made it hard to care what was going on i dont like saying this but i do believe it was overhyped much prefer xenoblade 2 and persona 5 but octopath traveler was still fun overall i dont mind each character having a personal final ending but i absolutely agree the characters should have more interaction than the banter i literally started to play this game yesterday wow so your fix is make it into final fantasy dimensions which is fine dimensions was really good play it 217 i will agree with you at with some of the early game bosses being damage sponges but i felt during mid to late game that cyrus literally just nuked the bosses within 1011 turns and sometimes even earlier if the boss was weak to bows granted cyrus doing 5000 damage 2 or even 4 times during the midgame with the right buffsdebuffs of course is absolutely absurd this game needs a sequel there is so much potential for this game to be a masterpiece my plot is unfocused i know most people didnt like that the main villain was locked behind a strange side quest but that allowed it to be an actually difficult fight so i enjoyed it easily my favorite part of the game was getting ruined by the fight and having to train and work out a strategy until i finally beat it i very much hope that there will be a sequel with all new characters and refined story structure the soundtrack is beautiful the art especially bosses are phenomenal to see and the battle system is highly enjoyable especially with the diversity of jobs the little tidbits that are easy to miss such as scrutinizingtalking to a dog to gain information about a hidden item are some of my favourite so much so that this is the only game ive played in which i went out of my way to use all the path actions on every npc that i could octopath is definitely one of my favourite games to date and if they make a sequel i really am hoping that theyll take your idea of the smaller parties eventually meeting up come into play that said it would be great if you could make the parties up of characters that you want to instead of being forced to meet specific characters the whole fun of octopaths world exploration and character gathering is that you can do things with whoever you my favorite part was the story structure that was way more satisfying than just the usual single story so i definitely dont want the story to be fixed by just making it like any other game since the difference is exactly why its my favorite jrpg so probably also my favorite game ever i just wish the interactions were easier to get like in fire emblem but having them take place at a specific time made it excusable and helped the party feel just as close as it needed since it was like a cutscene that you get after the main one but isnt mandatory tough i think being able to view them and the ones you missed in your diary after the chapter 4 would be cool that way you can get the context by the placement in your diary i just wish there was a cutscene for having your party with you since while it didnt bother me that much i agree it can be weird but it should be locked to a story mode that locks the chapter twos until you recruit everyone so youre guaranteed to have t the structure while i do get the criticism of it and on paper i prefer the more in depth exploration of a single dungeon that you get in say persona 5 actually helped propel me through the game with a traditional jrpg structure i find it very easy to fall out of the habbit of playing i dont have 5 hours to dig into the game over a couple of days well guess i wont play for a few days then because thats the sort of length of time it feels like it takes to get anything significant done that continues for a couple of weeks and ive forgotten where i was and probably arent going to finish the game octopaths structure these 32 2 hour or so chapters in 8 stories that recap you because it might be 12 chapters since you last did something with this character i just needed to be able to paly for 2 hours over 1 maybe 2 days to feel like it was worth me booting up the game and even if i had have fallen off the wagon for a couple of weeks or a month the recaps and len if there is a sequel i hope they bring about 8 new characters that come together as a true party and not just a group of people who are just around because otherwise i found this game to the perfect rpg for with its pickupandcontinue style thats perfect on the switch to its just complex enough job and battle systems that make you engaged at least a little bit in every fight to its gorgeous soundtrack and visuals like you said the only thing really holding this game and hopefully is fixed next time is its narrative structure problems an overarching plot that interweaves everyone somehow while also allowing for the characters to actually interact with each other i love the idea of something like fire emblems system or maybe something like persona 45s confidant system so that they at least feel more like a party to me the game in every other aspect was about 8 9 or 10 but the store and its structure really bogged the game down for me to the point of where i just sta over hyped game that was average at best the best thing about it is its music by god is it amazing its graphics is great and so is its combat the worst thing about octopath the party never felt like a group of comrades little to no character growth and interactions the world is also pretty small and filled with hallways and most of the stories are so boring bar 24 characters the mage is a bitch that makes you feel self concious im starting to be able to tell when youre editing vs when andrew is editing ophilia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion haanit primroses story and cyrus story are just impactful 812 hold on thats a mosswine thats straight up a mosswine from monster hunter xd 655 thank god im not the only one who found this and got addicteed to it thats literally how i moved around in the game for over 30 hours thats it im buying a switch thanks a lot i suggest you to not start with ophilia me what if i told you that i did and i completed the game with only her also cyrus therion 3 715725 i finished the eight stories and i never see they monster i started therion cuz he looked the coolest is that a troydan reference i recently bought this game and im obsessed with it when i got to primrose story i prayed to god we got to beat the shit outta that weirdo grinding is almost non existant matts review nonbiased and played the whole game now do that 50 more times and you can beat the next bossdunkeys first impression biased and played the first chapter for every character 223 by the way that song is enveloped in kindness i loved this game while i played it but i got stuck on levels i did 5 of the characters chapter 1 stories and now to do chapter 2 for any of them i have to be like level 27 when my strongest guy is level 18 or something i wound up setting it down for awhile ill eventually go back when i have free time and feel like figuring out how to get passed the level barrier or where the hell im missing xp hmmm octopath is nominated for game of the year before i could have the game i would need a nswitch first i and unless i grow rich that aint gonna happen okay after talking about how relatable the 4 days 60 hours thing then he cuts to that link between worlds mat he uses for a mouse pad i also use that same mat for a mouse pad and that and this are my two favorite mobile games good man with good taste put more videos of this game popsicle sucking youtuber instalike the vid for calling therion a sexy son of a bitch wait so the nuts permanently increase stats i didnt want to play this becuz everyone said its grindy then matt said its non exsistant now i have 100h in this shit weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee why is this not on comp your first mistake was to not automatically change the voice acting to japanese i dont even have this game your the first reviewer to have the same fave as me tressa is just so darn adorable you gotta do monster hunter there is an item the blastnut different review when compared to dunkeys who do i listen to wtf its gammoth 237 is that the shadow of a bong lmao cyrus is a fucking madman that kills everything d i never played games like this before but im very interested do any of you guys know some games like these for pc maybe some demos or free games dunkey is dissapointed nice quality content good job character design is like similar to ragnarok online im sorry matt i had to stop 207 i just had a sudden rush of nostalgia and with that came the feeling of imma play this till i die and idc when it comes how is your cacadu doinh i remember the first time an npc gave me a slippery nut for helping him feels good song gratitudeoctopath traveler ost tip you can to use the dancer ult the cleric reflect to beat any boss that even thinks about casting a spell really easy wow bfa is going to win game of the year ff6 is better cyrus is best boi 4 5 you mean 8 10 hahaha i get it octopath oct 8 are you alright matt didddddd something actually happen with b are you sure thats not darkkmane saying my focus is unparalleled i started with the hunter her voice acting in japanese is so much better makes me think of the village music in legend of zelda tp wait the hunter has the strongest early game what are you talking about does anyone know the name of the uplifting song this game is perfect l u havent saids single downside and entire video is praise so how is it only 45 to you fuck i thought this was a ryze spotlight people mock reggie on fortnite but the switch actually changed my mind about fortnite played on pc once and i was like fuck that i could be playing any other way better game but just another day i was stuck in an annoying nephew birthday party and i had jack shit to do i dont own a lot of switch games only breath of the wild odyssey and some other indies but i 100 all of them so fortnite kinda saved my sanity that day since it was just a fun little timesink and it was free you sold me on this gonna get it rn warframe next please for me the biggest disappointment keeping the game back this is not up for discussion cause everyones rabid for this game and i refuse any interaction since it always leads to conflict you can leave your opinions and ill read them but wont respond is the lack of proper story telling now before you cry whaddafuq fam theres 8 stories theres 8 half baked stories and thats okay i dont expect 8 full feature length stories cause imo thatd be unreasonable however i cant help but feel uncomfortable when character dont even comment on each others immediate circumstances exactly as the games name implies you travel along 8 paths 8 stories but thats it for me the biggest thing about an rpg is the story gameplay is important in a game yes but story is what ultimately drives me to keep going its a shame cause this game is actually so fun but the disjointed nature of the story turns me off so much i love these kinds of games the art looks so good in a weird way those 171 faithful people watched donkeys video first i choose this over botw anytime fucking hate the stamina bar id rather farm in pokemon yellow 60 hours straight than play this game for 60 hours 1005 fucking murder the innocent you should try lilitales you obviously cannot make a video out of it but youd enjoy it no joke this game is literally my favorite on the switch when the demo came out i played like 9hrs of it alfyns first chapter actually made me sad though so powerful tressa had the best storyline imo i knew from the trailer that tressa was going to be my favorite character and i wasnt disappointed cyrus was a close second alfyn ophilia and therion were all around the same i hated primroses fourth chapter it seemed extremely out of place compared to the other three hannit had a decent story but i hated the speech of her and her village it was overdone methinks this would probably be fourthish otherwise olberics story just seemed lacking but had a great 4th chapter ey another octo lover coverage pursue within shadow intellectual enjoy evil

thank you so much for spotlighting this game i fucking love it and gonna try it 3 barely an hour into the game and i was crying best game cyrus is daddy i like how this review is a lot more in depth and seems a little bit more reliable than the dunkmaster you cover both bad and good aspects and i really appreciate that this gave me a whole new view of the game and took away a lot of the negative thoughts i had for it really good review matt pretty sure ligma nuts were intentionally named that how you gon not even say anything after taking so long s i need you uplifting game music very good content hey matt you probably wont even see this but i just wanted to say thank you as cheesy and cliche me saying this is these videos are really helping me through a rough stretch coming home to this video really put a smile on my face every video you do is so well put together and most of them give me a good laugh as well just wanted to say thanks for another amazing video and i cant wait for the next one reminds me of 3d rpg tbs type of terraria with better graphics jokes on you matt i never have to decide what to eat because i have nothing to eat 235 youve realized youre alone in the world even though youre surrounded by millions of people too real matt too real i feel bad for bringing this to light but i noticed your medication and know what its for i hope everything is alright matt your videos always bring me joy whether its league a different game or even your mini vlogs that you did for the wedding and stuff youve even inspired me to try and learn how to edit you definitely work hard on your videos compared to a lot of other content creators and your sub count definitely shows that you deserve every single one of these subs and millions more keep up the great work were all proud of you did you guys see that the first letter of the main characters names ophilia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion and haanit spell out the word octopath magikarp suffers with ligma i fucking love it i want it on pc primrose is a murder hobo confirmed for anyone looking for the uplifting guitar song its called gratitude in the ost primrose is aatrox 20 confirmed primroses story is unawaited dark i can only say one thing fuck jrpgs octopath traveler vs chrono trigger who wins the graphics are fucking beautif 811 is that a mafuckin mosswine hunters take its head finally somebody giving this game some spotlight magikarp senpaiiiii im kind of wondering how you would do in lobotomy corporation though it seems like typical fallout shelter x scp foundation it does have certain charm to the story that you see after merely two weeks of getting used to it and abnormalities backstories too and knowing you already had touch with vn aspect of the gaming world you may find it oddly addicting what about monster hunter world you ask your friend what ligma is uplifting music ligma nuts seriously square enix are bloody geniuses that really reminds me of dragon quest this spotlight spoiled me half of my quests but whatever matt uploaded something this is your daily reminder that tressa is best girl 555 noblesse side story reference or am i crazy i love the graphics it got a ogre battle 64 and tactical ogreluct donkey copy thanks for the heads up matt se been letting me down lately this look like a good time nice man magikarp i love this game dunkey shitty game guess matt has shitty taste oh shit 2 conflicting view points from dunkey and mr karp whatever shall i do theres no way i can form my own opinion it just has to be one or the other welp might as well kill myself since i cant decide farewell world you were terrible new silverscrapes edit the uplifting song boctobath braveler from buare benix ummm i would start with ophiliaher story has the closest link to the endgame her story gets great at the end as well what is happening to your eyes tressa literally asked prim what a brothel is im veeery sure that the demon like voice comes from the snowman behind primrose xd hoyshit he is alive and proberly skipping this game it dos not look that good octopath is so good great video im as hype as you are how can you tell that karp really enjoyed the game he barely memed at all wheres the into the life of a streamer series at 450 rhaast is that you honestly id recommend starting with ophelia since before you get the cleric as a secondary job shes the only reliable healer so youll never taker her out of your party anyway hey matt boi you should play for honor if you want to or if you have the funds matt you should play hollow knight aside from botw its my favorite game on the switch amazing action platformer i think you would really enjoy id love to see a video from you about it its the modern saga frontier which i like since saga frontier is criminally underrated oh god i feel matt i poured so much time into the game and i got it recently send help you tried really hard to make this game look exciting hmmm videogamedunkey says it sucks magikarpusedfly says its good who should i believe that snowman on 443 dunkey said the game was bad and since i cant think for myself this game is bad dunkey said its bad though what the fuck is this i look up the reviews of people playibg octopath traveler and legit 50 says its great while the other 50 says its trash so what is it now in the part when he said my pussy is for the lord you should have put fuck me in the ass cause i love jesus that would have been perfect 315 dat ligma nuts threw me off so hard quite funny the only reason that its not a 55 is because the final nut was so slippery that he dropped it pixel tits more anime tiddies and hentai best game of all time might be a good idea to include price with your review i think im gonna buy that game nah bruh have you seen videogamedunkeys review thats the only review you need to see uwu whoops too late i picked ophelia first and then proceeded to get tressa and primrose gotta get them waifus and then the husbandos 1212 this guy sounds waaay to much like darkmane wizard of legend actual spot light plz boy do maplestory m keep up with that genuine content veery nice if you liked this play bravely default the biggest problems i got with the game is that the story feels like its written for kids you can sum up the plot of a 10 min cutscene in 2 words and the skills are way too straight forward and limited and expensive here choose 1 of the 6 skills every 4 hours which are just better or slightly different version of a skil you already got instead of 1 time fire dmg do 2 times fire dmg is matt losing weight very nc video man sad tho that i dont hab a switch either gonna w8 for money or w8 for it to miraculously be available on steam xd on another note most of the comments are either that music theme or the my focus is unparalleled meme xd but i wonder whats ligma honestly the slice of life stories for alfyn and tressa are the ones ive liked the most so far your not saving the world or on a quest for revenge just going from town to town making friends and beating up some jerks you run into i havent even finished any main stories yet but alfyns already made me shed a tear oh no matt and dunkey has different opinions on the game what do then again i dislike turn based combatif not done well and random encounters aint my thing edit hate is too strong of a word it is nice to see this game some recognition i can understand that turn based combat is not everyones cup of tea heck normally i am not interested in it however this game is so gosh darn engaging and fun i honestly have been too busy exploring the different areas getting every chest i can get my hands on and fighting every enemy encounter heck i just started one of the characters 3rd chapters and i am already 92 hours in the game great review man keep it up holy shit you really did this video in response of dunkeys video on the game he despise this game and really showedit in his video therefore all the it might not be a perfect game i loved it you had to insert in the game nothing wrong with it youre allowed to like the game and praiseit of course its just really awkward to watch lol i actually liked ophilias story start maybe it was just whiplash from starting with the thief but it felt simple yet heartwarming to me matts voice sounds so much more mature and different its really cool havent watched u in a time and returning now feels good and lets me forget why i have abandoned this channel the only reason why this couldnt get game of the year is the release of splatoonpath if you dont make league content i will eat your nose think about that a life without a nose is a wasted life omg fucking spoilers since first second on video lmao good thing i finished it who should i believe dunky or matt hmmmm also fuck everything youve sold me i need this game injected directly in to my bloodstream stat matt you better fucking turn that song in to a meme wtf i actually love haanit cuz of her voice acting u offend me tell me the cheating thing isnt realxd yeah but dunkey called it asssooo matt if you really like this kinda gamei have a game that very simular with this gameits call trails in the skythis game also a jrpg gamesand all character also had his very own back story trust me big boi yyo gonna love this shitt l i g m a n u t s biggest troll ive gotten out of bewildering grace encounter one of the caits that give 1k exp kill the cait then drag out the fight to get a 3 point boost on primrose use fully charged bewildering grace first effect primrose gains 50sp second effect 100x exp third effect entire partys hp reduced to 1 fourth effect items drop on the ground and entire party takes damage party wipes ggez ive never heard of nor played this game once in my life but i still like the review and think its funny it doesnt make me want to play the game but the videos still funny so thats something uplifiting 230 caught this man with chinese in the back dunkey said something different about the game thus youre wrong i fucking need a switch now fuck you matt when you put some background music and talk inspirationally you could say ligma nuts and i would clap my hands cant beat golden sun this video is pretty cool and very well made try shadow hearts 3 on a ps2 emulator the story made me cry it has some edgy scenes but the battling is some shit ive never seen before a friend told me to play it but i wasnt even interested in it till i gave it a try now im sitting at 80h gametime and i absolutely love this game im watching this but i dont even know it xd i really wish i have a n switch and this game you should play starbound really good game i almost choked to death due to the surprising ligma meme combat is fun really every single jrpg has exactly the same combat system and fun isnt really the first thing you think of when you see it could you like do a spotlight on transistor please do thank you 558 octopath traveler genocide mode now i gotta get a switch fk spent 3 hours straight jerking off and did not nut once my focus is unparalleled ligma nut sounds like a life threatening disease ligma nuts was totally unexpecter wtf i died there xd with 8 playable characters how does it work do you need to do 8 different playthrough karp if you feel alone think of all the people you make happy and laugh with the stuff you do your videos have become a part in my life i really enjoy keep doing what makes you happy im with you pal 3 you literally sound like me with divinity original sin 2 right now like 100 hours in less than 2 weeks like let me go you addictive fuck ps you should try divinity that music is gonna become a meme i know it your excellency just slam dunked this game think ima go with his opinion on this one this is the reason why ligma nut im completely lost i hate it when games are exclusive for one shitty console magikarp i suggest a game called hollow knight if you were ever looking for a metroidvania i dont know if you have played it before though weak comeback after 3 weeks matt this makes divinity 2 looks like shit kappa sarcasm sarcasm itsfkingsarcasm if you think its impressive with npcs having their own stories you really need to try trails of cold steel havent watched the whole video yet im at 114 and you just said the game has ligma nuts bst gem evrerrr not really but i love the items great now on top of a new pc for mhw i need to buy a switch thanks matt i know it will take you some time but please do more actual game spotlight square enix really amped up that bloom slider god damn rip to the people who havent finished this game the spoilers are crazy octopath traveler ost enveloped in kindness the name of that song just want bravely default series you need to play the witcher 3 dude makes me think of saga frontier you can see clear connections to dragon quest but i likes them so ill give this one a try if you see this matt you should try some dragon quest its simpler but i liked it very much great review man actually probably the best review out there either this game is unfoulable and perfect or complete dogshit depending on if you listen to gamespot or dunkey btw i would like to say your vid is a million times funnier than dunkeys and actual portrays the game itself so glad you mentioned how ridiculous haanit is i was expecting a good five minutes of haanit dialog clipped together in dunkeys vid but i dont think he even went far enough to get her really though man keep this shit up and your views could well match or exceed some of these high sub count lazy youtubers keep putting in the effort my friend seems like a great game now i just need a nintendo switch omg i dont know if youve heard yet but bricky has ended his so you want to main series a few months ago so your champion spotlights have the spotlight d besides your spotlights were always much funnier than brickys was that a mohtafuin darkest dungeon reference wow the new pokemon game seems lit spoiler warning plz dunkey hate the shit out off this game yo fuck the story im in iy for the magnificent fucking background this was a nice balance between your talent and your humor would love to se more in this style nice work karp you did a good an actual review unlike dunkeys now its time to play 80 hours of lol to make up for all the fun you had can someone just lemme know if this is free of story spoilers id appreciate it i love matts content and want to watch it but havent taken the risk yet i doubt he would include that kinda stuff in the video but i wanna make sure ya know how do u do that kind of earrape 221 i have premiere pro and normally just make it loud but would like to be able to do that kind of wholesome earrape i like the 3d pixel art and i normally hate pixel art games this was unexpectedly sincere thanks for the heartfelt review im definitely going to get this game meis this actual champion spotlight kill me guitar sound ear rape sound reminds me of pillars of eternity i knew youd have the best taste in favorite character this video ended before my ranked queue i think riot knows when you arent paying attention to the game wtf who the fuck keeps gatorade in the cupboard im so triggered no matter how often he uploads this channel is always gon be sum good shit thanks for posting it thought shes a bou been thinking about getting this game for about half a week glad to see my favourite flying fish take a look at it before i make any hasty decisions oh man he uploads after 3 weeks and its this underwealming game cool he isnt dead i thought that he was playing on his pc but he was on his switch at least its okay content uplifting music starts dont you wanna kill your enemies to become immortal 1005 f u c k i n g m u r d e r t h e i n n o c e n t this is really good this nigga uploaded i respect you for showcasing prims gamble dance my favorite part of the games battle system i want this game god the en linesva really grates on my ears lol u named that character darius d 755 ive never heard someone pronounce persona persawna yup dont die man i still need for my laugh butt of course l i g m a n u t s this was my most anticipated game of the year since it was first announced played both demos and preordered it as soon as i could worth every fucking penny suck a dick matt 254 those are some nice nuts starts minecraft eating sound honestly good game except for the turn based combat i would rate it a 910 but because it has turn based combat i give it a 610 you know what game is a 1010 and doesnt have boring ass turn based combat knack 2 baybee dunkey would like a word with you 225 heartwarming music i looked through the comments but no one meantions it you look really depprested are you ok man i give it 72 slippery nuts out of 86 i kinda worried about matt did b cheat on him or something new silver scrips i want it tell that to dunkey wow i actually stayed here the entire video there is no chance in hell ligma nut wasnt intentional that kind of gold doesnt just happen only one problem with this game its only on the switch am picking this game up tomorrow super hyped from square enix im sold bruh dunkey said it was bad so youre wrong literally dead channel mine ability to concentrate on the task at hand hath no equal 1103 reminds me a lot of rwby lore and shit 440 that snowman have seen some shit whats this pinoy 755 man i also think its like persauna too watchg this shit is so great when youre drunk is matts relationship kinda in a bad time right now seriously you should play divinity original sin 2 what the fuck happend to the daily uploads wait you hav a girlfriend you should try warcraft dunkey roasted the game so i cant take your review seriously there are diffirent types of ligma to matt have you lost weight or started going to the gym you look better now no joke if you have keep it up i really wanna play this but i cant been a really long time ive seen something this good this game can be good but its not as good a you wink wink that pronunciation of persona just makes me think of kanjis dungeon persauna pls nintendo switch actual console spotlight please that song at the end of the mission reminds me of the one punch man ballad look at the snowman behind primrose hey matt what voice changer app are you using and can you do that on voice chats thanks in advance nintendo switch exclusive meh personally i thought alfyns was really weak storyline xd i mean hes like a guy apothecary to get the poision of a snake to heal a girl and then in the end he decides to travel the world for well no good reason i really like haanit the way she speaks gives some extra flare to the game but that is by the looks of the internet an unpopulair oppinion but yes tressa cyrus and primrose have reaaaally great storylines im glad im not the only person who thought inappropriate things when getting nuts you really hit the nail on the head remember when he said daily uploads dunkey fans be like but dunkey hates it me google search 94 on ign 3640 on famitsu 84 on metacritic etc k shit game where do i get buttfucked by a dragon on a bridge garbage game 910 see 2d turnperturn rpg welp nope im out primrose is the reincarnation of chara tressa is the reincarnation of frisk there is now a clip of matt saying my pussy is for the lord forever on the internet finds another game i want to play but have 8 other games i should beat first insert uplifting music from game why do you do this to me matt insert super memed intense music from video play lisa please i need to see some of your reactions dude magikarp could be a dam demon sitting on my shoulder with that voice and id listen pretty convincing 1010 ign do i trust matts review or dunkeys you made me proud the vid was funny interesting and enjoyable gj magikarp i love when matt is so genuine and interesting awesome video why ur playing old final fantasy do rak sai actual spotlight is that darkk manes voice saying my focus is unparalleled matttwat sarcastic laugh i gotted my selfyou guys know wen i said that thing with gotted im a faggot fcking murder the inocent ahhh just what i needed a new dose of magikarp dont forget about those invigorating nuts i love this game it has that great rpg vibe that has been missing in a long time none of that fanservice stuff just a good game you can really sink into its world and story holy crap the bags under matts eyes he was not lying about the time he spent lol 256 that sounds like imagine dragons its time beat gmy pussy is only for the lord yo plz atleast twice a week i love this shit nice video play hollow knight you faggot the art style of the game is really striking it almost reminds me of a pixelart version of twilight princess style you really sound like a decent youtuber in this video its wierd so hes not dead that song would piss me off if anyone needs help with the game this doc has a ton of useful info httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsde2pacx1vtb8etymokelfld5j16ebbl1gxfi7hc1mb5pftfmzaq70won6zemfn5ce1k8l7oyuokyanvdstzzxpubhtml warframe actual game spothlight my focus is unparalleled sounds like something darkk mane would say actually it sounds just like him magikarp this game is awesome dunkey this game is awful dunkey didnt like it so therefor taking dunkys perspective over yours here m y f o c u s i s u n p a r a l e l l i thought it looked pretty neat stop bringing up dunkey that dude doesnt even like jrpgs to begin with greatnow i gotta go buy a nintendo switchfuck you matt that bofa character seems pretty interesting probably the best octopath review out there i see a new meme plays guitar did you see dunkys review on the game saying its boring nice bong if anyone doesnt know yet the song is called gratitude like 8 fucking boxes of spaghetti noodles jesus so this is what magikarpusedfly has been up to give us your opinions on the new akali i started as cyrus i feel ya lol i though it was champion actual spotlight the story might be bad so many people didnt like this but god daamn i love the graphics l i g m a n u t s my focus is unparalleled so this is the 16 bits version of the witcher with pokemons i watch the kayle actual champion spotlight once a week because it i what made me fall in love with your content why didnt u do a lets play on this game ligma is not something to be made fun of 1022 with the 4 slots and 8 characters alone there are 1680 combinations 8 possibilities for slot 1 7 for slot 2 6 for slot 3 and 6 for slot 4 if you include the 12 subclasses for each character technically 11 and accounting for the fact that each subclass can only be used once you get 13305600 combos why is this not a phone game i like this video its nice when you go looking at steam is this videogamedunkey2 great video btw fuckin hell damn thing sounds like a fuckin alarm like hearin that shit in the morning is just like hell who the fuck puts gatorade in the fucking cabinet looks like a shitty ios game dislike for promoting alfyn storyline winner of blandest story of the year no character developement your focus may be unparalleled but is your blade unbending just leaving a comment to support him cause i love his videos yoo matt and i got the same glasses suffering in pain because this game isnt on pc can you do a vid like this for warframe matt doesnt do league videos anymore insert uplifting music from game anyone else plays with thejapanese dub no ok uplifting theme starts playing i feel like m is replying directly to the dunkster at 808 i like dunkeys vid more since it was shorter this game looks like it plays like bravely default thanks for the video i didnt even know this game existed im definitely looking into it and ill see if i can get it i was thinking about buying a switch just for playing smash but i didnt because thats a lot of money you just gave me another reason so i guess its 21 imma buy a switch thx karp for baiting me into that 532 just thought this was a moist one wow he is not a dunkey copy after all since he liked this piece of garbage divinity original sin 2 is the same shit but 100x better matt uve disappointed me 237 blurred out bong on the bottom right corner you know matts working on something special when he doesnt upload for awhile always worth the wait though i want that mundo shirt you were wearing damn matt thats was a fucking great review i really want to play this game now thank you for showing it to me this was the first game to make me cry in 3 years honestly this game isnt perfect but theres just something special about it i feel like it really had care and passion put into it isnt this just basicly final fantasy this instantly reminded me of wonderland online i never really got into the game due to how difficult it can be to progress without some friends or guild members or something and im a type of person that will rather give up than ask for help as stupid as that may be but that was my one single gripe with it this game seems very similar but without this gripe if it ever comes out on pc im jumping onto that shit right away its been awhile hasnt it mat video game dunky made a video already saying this game sucks the two only gaming youtubers i watch have opposite opinions on this game mat and dunkey why you guys do this i love this game its the first game that feels like a true role playing experience not talking about it being a an rpg but one of the first games to actually feel like youre playing a table top role playing experience im surpised nobody really talks about it like that the sprites look a lot like nippon icchis old sprites for rhapsody a musical adventure idk who to believe matt or dunkey matt you should play pyre i wasnt sure about this game now i do want to play but i dont have a switch 220 it actually doesnt even sound bad distorted lol i want this game now oh okay that looks hm nice for the nintendo switch fk that im out where tf can you byu that game did i miss that in the video its not on steam so i have no options left xd so this is what u were doing this video earned you a subscribe keep it up gotta start addin headphone warnings or somethin man i was like ill buy it and then found it cost like 48 euro bye ooh boy do i love some p e r s a u a n a last time i was this early gripex had a beard 717 its a gammoth i think you would like the devs previous games bravely seconddefault good story good characters party banter fourth wall breaks even more jobs than octopath fun riskreward combat system fourth wall breaks big overworld beautiful art great music fourth wall breaks interesting sidequests fun boss battles really fun base building minigames and also fourth wall breaksyou dont need to play default to play second but both games are fantastic even if second is better if octopath is ff6 bravely is ff3 highly reccomend you play that shit i just watched dunkys video of him tearing this game a new asshole then i come here and its getting praised but videogamedunkey said that the game was trash now im confused who is joking im saying that because they always react to the same games in a funny way and came to the same conclusion but not this time the world is changing is there an option to turn the voices japanese bruh im like 50 hours into this game and just learned you can fast travel dunkey did it already just watched dunkeys review before matts im super confused about this game not that much of a dunkey clone now amirite whatre you doing playing actual good games oo shots fired at dunk lul adventure quest world aq3d game spotlight its old but do it 3 guess who ran out of money and returned to his money maker site just saying that in 1025 theres a folder called yakkocmns nudes what the actual fuck but dunkey said its shit it it good or nah cum with me and i will show you the way of the darkness matt have you heard about fallout series u know i was like oh shit this game looks fun i could spend some money on it and buy it on ste its released on switch ok i guess nvm then i have to buy this omg i love these types of games too bad i do not have any money to buy a switch when u dont have haanit or orberic in your party so they are under leveled and then u try to do the first chapter i didnt realize it was for the switch guess that makes my decision for me since i dont have one and ive heard such polarizing reviews you know who i dont understand how you can say the combat is amazing when its turnbased whats special about it i cant even play pokemon for its combat anymore because i played too many jrpgs when i was younger magikarpusedfly uploads a video uplifting music holly shit kaiba where is crono trigger remastered square enix come on nintendo a different review than dunkey shit now people are going to war because he didnt liked the game even tho he said that his reviews are personal opinions just like mats review you should make a video discussing this with dunkey that would be a great colab lol really enjoyed this video also your crownhoodie is top quality i dont like rpg cause turn based games reminds me of the good old final fantasy days dont start as ophilia donttellmehowtolivemylife soshould i play this game bookworm adventures deluxe video coming soon dont like the game is it just me or did matt lose weight in any case good shit you should play a game called the darkest dungeon its a really fun rpg where you have to go through different rooms and fight different monsters fuck man u always make me waste money on the nintendo store 537 my pussy is for the lord matt 2018 what is the name of that super chill song 2 minutes into the game hes not dead i can give you kindred clips for the kindred spotlight matt doesnt upload daily as he said he would insert uplifting music from game is the ligma nut real hey matt its good to hear from you again last time i saw you was at anime expo i was the guy who gave you sour patch kids i wont say my name but if you remember then ayyye that song is like roundabout from jojos wait so actual actually means actual for your videos now im confused if you like stuff like every npc has interesting story you should try trails in the sky or trails of cold steel i thought this game was a splatoon dlc now i feel stupid and i want to play it how come i feel like everything square enix makes is good boi that mousepad is sick great video as always i dont wanna be this guy but if youre planning on making a kindred actual champion spotlight you should probably do it now because shes fucking busted af rn this this is some quality content im so happy you made this omg who the fuck disliked this video true cool game indeed loll that music and you look like the philippine harry potter in this vid love your channel though therion best waifu 438 rhasst is that you listen if you dont make a kindred actual champion spotlight i fucking will i taste the donkey with this fish i want to die fuck you please do warframe please guy let him see this aatrox actual champion spotlight 20 please id rather play a ps2 game wait only 100 npcs to talk to wtf that little if you liked this you should play bravely default and bravely second they are the square enix team that made this game and the job customization and battle system are right out of those games whats with that mundo tshirt are you selling 3 can you share some of those yakko nudes with us boy watching dunkeys video really turned me off from playing this game but matt bro this review was amazing and you put so much heart in it and effectively showed me all the special and cool things about this game and im definitely gonna give that demo a try hmm watching magikarp vs videogamedunky on this is quite intriguing new league of legends patch i honestly love this game so much the visuals and music are outstanding and while i wish there was more interaction between party members i am still really happy with the stories of the game and also the graphics are orgasmic 445 i thought it was maokai for a second playing the game with japanese audio helped alot with my issues with the english voice acting i have a sudden urge to murder the innocent hmm must be my brain losing brain cells first video in weeks and im already throwing money at the screen my focuses are unparalleled play lol dudeeeee make more champ spotlights my nut is unparalleled enveloped in kindness is the name of the song from opt in case people were wondering a game that bases even its name off of having 8 characters with special stories for each of them has genericsimply bad mainstories man i really wanted to like this game but as someone who loves mainly playing around the story and learning about what happens to my characters that simply hurts have played 15 hours or so hope they stop being so generic says in deep disturbing demon voice tressa you dont know how powerful you could become with the infinity toes in your hands wait is this right it is supossed to go in the hands not the foot right its a gauntlet for fucks sake a game doesnt become a good game because its fun bbut dunk shut different opinions exist are there 8 ways to go or following the path of the octopus anyone else thought this was a yakkos video b cheated on you stay strong brother theres more fish in the sea just after donkey shat on it well done i cant watch the video before im done with the game cause spoilers his not a fucking donkey copy my god yes i want to see more nintendo content from u dude 3 i think this is the next step the one thing this video lacks go pleasure yourself master just because you mentioned it would you place this above persona 5 personally that game was my shit and wondering if this game is comparable to it literally not even 3 minutes in and im hit with a flat reminder of why i love this big boii so much h he makes me laugh if that like wasnt clear to some people i uh i find the duder funny yeah ligma nuts mat p e r s a u n a excuse me what hmm side quest completion song distorted sounded like it had some potential maybe speed it up a little and itd sound pretty metal i love u but ur kind of a sellout lols do attack on titan actual anime spotlight yesterday i was like magikarp didnt posted anything early he is sure up to something big its more than 5 years i dont play a jrpg but ill try that game is a switch esclusive not for pc fuck waiting for yakkos video now i miss jrpg games i wish they made another golden sun this made me click so fast thinking it was a league video well dont get me wrong i like jrpgs i love the saga persona to no end and chrono trigger earthbound and final fantasy tactics are among my favorite games of all time but this game just doesnt draw me in in the slightest it just look so generic i started crying at 542 because i inhaled water 340 you are nothing but a s t u p i d w h o r e love ur vids so what you are saying is that i should go buy a switch and octopath traveler and spend most of the money i got at this moment in time got cha karp why doesnt this bugger get more subs wait a second at 037 is that the desk from the xayah and rakan spotlight as well as the happy pills my focuses are unparalleled lets each give karp a hentai we think he should review i nominate bakemonogatari great vid matt i really enjoy when you put genuine thought and emotion behind your shit see you all next month can u post 2 videos per week did b actually cheat on you man im really sorry man you make the game look better than it is also feelsbadman not everyone has a nintendo switch like me i told ninja ligma was real and he banned me i hope he eats ligma nuts ill take your word for it whats the game at 119 we dont get ff7 for this dog another actual spotlight you can play trails in the sky trilogy if you want the similar experience oh its on the switch rip my slippery nuts are unpararel yo i tot this was hentai but now i feel i have ligma and am able to speak sugondese i thought matt was dead i thought you died happy you are alive where the fuck where yo matt i fricking need yo to prenvent me to finally kill myself sponsored im only up to everyones chapter 2 quests and i love the combat but so far all the characters stories have been really weak also pick therion trihard yoink mine now this game is nuts now i see what matt was doing these four weeks wp dude not going to win goty thats utter bullshit it sold out instantly and is by far the best game ive played in years it has more mechanics than league but without a damn novel as an information for each damn action the reason dunkey didnt like it and filipinokarp did was because they haved i f f e r e n t o p i n i on s actually first positive review of this game in all internet edit nvm im wrong eh best video of the week pornhub included wp is there a pc version only one advert really rolling in all that juicy ad revenue teemo the game ive stolen like everything in the entire game butbutbut dunkey told me this game was bad who am i to believe cool yo matt words going around youre actually sugondese play warframe where is my fuckin aatrox rework actual champion spotlightlazy fat fukl i though you got ligma and not update anymore oof all the stories were really good well maybe some chapter 1s were slightly slow but the game overall was fantastic there were so many options for your characters and tressa is also my fav tied with thierion and also cyrus happy 2 c u played it anyway this is probably my favorite game of all time it looks like its doing really well as well anyway hope if your considering to at least try the demo its a gr8 game thats worth a shot finally a new fucking video number of possibilities of abilities is 12 choose 4 4 124 8 4 12 11 10 94 3 2 4 1188024 4 495 4 1980 combinations rtheydidthemath the ligma nut was so hoping that was legit nice shop though lol bitch i need a pc release of this hearing matt pronounce persona as persauna was almost as painful as hearing ophelia say your excellency 50 times in a row dis game dumb af someone fix the lighting its too fuckin bright in here id give this video a monetize my focus is unparalleled seriously though man awesome review keep up the good work firstsnt i rate this game 35 nuts he is bacm cyrus is the most op max boost any of his 2nd level attacks and you can nuke any enemy party in one attack whens that bookworm adventures deluxe video coming out it looks so pretty is it worth getting a switch by now i already played botw but this game looks pretty fun haanit is best girl fight me you fat fuck holy hell the art director should get an award for this woooooow 1055 care for spoiler ok maybe its my bad yeah the stories are pretty generic nothing really new or something we havent heard before still i love this game not for the story but for the characters the music and the animations i had so much fun running around seeing new mobs fighting them and just explore the world its not a perfect game but is is a great and enjoyable one octopath well me and the game are related lol you know the game is goty when the dog was worked on more than 90 of newer video games mr karp real tall tho this game is amazing my friend got the deluxe package edition of this game and he doesnt even have a switch final fantasy out of 10 pretty sure youll enjoy divinity

should i watch this is there spoilers cuz i wanna support you but no spoilers man hey matt thx for the content this time im fast enough that you may see this p keep going and do what you like to do the every day upload streak continues irs shit i got this one 237382 min late i dont sleep for two days let me sleep dunky said it was poop tho i am happy to say that i am one of the degenaretes that came the quickest to this video 30 to watch heart me because im a pinoy gay my type of game shit ton of nut damn all this time i thought it was some hentai game this game actually look hella juicy great game still missing it man i dont what im doing wrong followed your video to a t and im 21 attempts with 1 time getting to the second phase of this figh and obviously unsuccessful so 21 unsuccessful attempt all my characters are in their 80s i just dont get it i want a number 2 btw my phase 1 was cyrus sorcerer using elemental break and spamming lux while under primroses divine cleric buff therion hunter using his dagger to break the eye and using armor corrosive and his ult for 30k aoe damage primrose cleric spamming aelferics mostly and using peacock on cyrus haniit apothecary spamming dotherys charity and using revitalizing jams on team my second phase was a 1 hp alfyn warmaster waiting paitently for his chance to use his wombo combo oberic thief using incite first turn saving alfyns ass until he gets his turn then breaking galdera on the second turn with the multiple spear attack warrior ability ophelia starseer basically just using pomegranate l and her spear to break galdera tressa runelord also just using pomegranate l and using spear to break galdera in second turn on the third turn it was over gg andddd i finally did it on this try galdera didnt get to go first on the second turn and i broke him and literally handed him his ass with a 70k per hit combo from alfyn the warmaster i had a similar build to yours for the second battle with galdera but after my first turn wombo combo with wilhelms i got hit with a 1 hp 0 bp move as the first move by galdera on the second turn and was completely screwed from there xd i thought i was doing good when i did over 1000 damage but im level 23 so galdera killed everyone in my party on the 1st phase before i could do literally anything ned is that you 1st phase i can deal with easy second phase though i hate it this guide sucks theres no strategy to the second part of the fight youre just hoping that you dont get koed by the boss before han strikes although this game is far from perfect it has a very sumber feeling to it that i frakking love damn that first phase looks annoying as hell wtf optional bosses ive had enough of this game lol very unsatisfying ending the more i got towards the end off all the main stories the more boring this got for so long i was wtf is this ever gonna heal hannit what a cheeky bastard lol 150 when surpasing power is just not enough how the hell do u break the damage capi thought it came from one of the special jobsi have tressa on runealfyn on star therion on warmast etcbut still no support skill that lets me do it umm no offense but you can easily win this without changing characters aelfricalephan combo through every boss thank you so much for these series of videos im not very experienced with rpgs and these builds really helped me with the final bosswhich i attempted like 10 times and not even coming close to the second phase after watching i beat him on the first try subbing to you and looking forward to future videos thanks again brother and keep up the good work my haanit leveled up during in the last fight of the 8 bosses and now she has full hp pls help idk what to do 3 times first haanit was too fast and acted first 2nd i changed some itens and the damage was not good enough 3rd time was the charm just something i choose thief as primrose 2nd job so she was able to lower the armor it can helps the damage as well you can cast the starseers skill who boost critical in every fight before galdera and before the last hit better safe than sorry not sure if you did it but i think bring cover on olberic is also a good idea two tips to make the fight significantly easier and this video made a good example in dealing the following 2 situations in phase 1 try to kill off all souls at once if you kill one of them first the eye will just summon a new one and keep being invincible in the second phase break galdera at all cost right after killing all body parts galderas first move after all minions being removed will be banish souls which reduces partys hp to 1 and removes all bps but if you break it before this move you get 5 free bps for each member this is an all or nothing situation dont waste time buffing or healing while you have the chance to break i have used a lot of slippery nuts took me 5 times to finally beat galdera followed the strategy and i would further recommend grinding hannit until at least level 78 final boss untouched mate 85000 is not a little bit of damage what skills you using on the 2nd party fcking hardcore im currently farming level to 99 just want to win this dungeons boss i had to see how far you lvld up hannit so i went back to the damn maw of the ice dragon i found the caits and after much avail i had to get everyone at good enough lvl my lord dont even step if hannit isnt even near lvl 75 everyone manny thanks you made the eye a cruise but still had to hope the dice were rolled in my favor to beat the second portion just got obliterated first couple times battling ithim how many ppl went in there and realized they didnt equip jobsskillsweapons and armor to your secondary party nothing like spending a solid 45 minutes beating the eye to see hannit in her hunters garb with no weapons equipped in the second halfthanks again and a big shout out to bewildering grace that had half my party at lv 70 at chapter two lol just spent two hours killing all the bosses i went up the stairs to fight the final one and i had to make two parties i had absolutely no idea what to do to kill the 8 bosses i used cyrussorceror haanitwarmaster tressarunelord alfyndancer this team was working amazing because i had cyrus and haanit kill everything alfyn max out everyones bp and heal everyone and i had tressa using all her runes to make us invincible and make haanits physical attacks even stronger i thought i would just do this for the last battle as well however i had to make a 2nd team yay i had absolutely no plan whatsoever for the other 4 i thought i would make olbericprimtherion and ophilia do the easier part then i got completely destroyed i grinded to make my original team amazing and i sort of just left the other 4 im kinda mad but all i can do is laugh i did final boss without the runelord revitalizing jam still went easy enough second phase was hilarious i had olberic as my warmaster 4 battle cries and it was gg and the last dungeon is unfair all rng and how to fuck up a good game whats the benefit of running haanit for this run great help i beat it first time with your guide a more reliable way to farm rev jam that i found was to go to wellspring and repeatedly challenge erhardt i find he drops them pretty liberally there are 19958400 builds using the 8 characters and 12 jobs in a 4 member party if you include the number of support skills the number is astronomical it sucks that you cant save in between the 8 bosses and the final bad cause after losing to the final bad im never going back to fighting all those 8 again just to get to him thank for your tips i wachted all of them i just beated final boss today with haanit 1hp i failed 5 times before anyways good game ps i like your voice xd i never knew the char names were octopath wat do you have to complete all the side quests just wanted to say thank you for this video i got demolished by the final boss about 6 times 1 hp fortitude hannit made me beat the phase 2 boss in 3 turns omg omg omg i was finally able to beat him yeeeeees i have the same built with haanit as warmaster i can go thru the 8 bosses pretty fast but for some reason i cant deal with galdera too hard i do have a similar party setup levels and stats so from all the strategies ive done i think i can use yours to finally defeat this hard boss i still love this game so much tho it just saddens me that i cant finish it properly by defeating this boss i find your accent annoying thanks for this video fully copied your strategy after failing 5 times in a row on the final boss xd am i the only one triggered hes using the best class to spam dohters items runelord while his alf does nothing xd still good strategy i did it similarly dohters is just broken damn i got my a handled so i watched this video and i still dont believe i can take him on time for a break managed to beat son of a b a few minutes ago i know what you mean by ranging from unfair to easy the second form almost instakilled me with a 3hit lightning strike doing about 4k damage if you dont have the right party setup youre gonna have a bad time the spurning ribbonwell it would have been awesome if you could have used it in a new game or something visiting all end game areas with your lvl 5 party without having to worry about random encounters and getting all the loot dang this last part of the boss is all about luck i went in with same strategy and boss attacked me first and one hit my olberic with 6000 hp and killed everyone else but one kept trying to revive my guys with olive of l but he would just one hit me every time just gave this a try for the first time oh boy i think my mistake was actually going for the weaknesses of those adds fought this thing for about 30 mins i maybe did around 300k dmg to it then one of those things exploded and did around 8k dmg killing my entire party then i was like fck u game xd but seriously doing this whole gauntlet over again is very annoying seems the divine skills of cleric and apothecary are a necessity here how the heck do you get that much damage from haanit im level 70 and cant get that much with that job class what am i doing wrong thanks the video would have been perfect if you had shown your equipment id love to see one on the post game diary you get telling how everything is connected i am not going to have time to go through the post game with back to school upon us im starting chapter 3s and that and chapter 4s will be all i can do if i even get the 4s done can u please show your haanit support skill and equipments thank u using some buffing skills and armor corrosive i managed to hit for 99999 on every hit except staff of the warmaster divine skill tried once but failed on 2nd phase then followed this strategy 1hp haanit is too op d is there a way to retry the fight after beating it i screwed up and overwrite my data ahhhh is there a text version of this build anywhere i am leveling and trying to build toward this but some of the builds are hard to follow this dungeons lore dump made me feel bad about killing a dragon like really it just appeared out of nowhere hannit killed it and went about her day but it turns out to be the very person that inspired alfyn and the owner of tressas book and now im like wow now i feel bad wasnt expecting that awesome now do it without spamming items concoct is fine pokemon summons also fine lets go this waaay better than other channel that he claim to have completed this quest first just to brag about it that second fight was a nut for some reason i cant see any comments although it says there are 25 comments at the top tried closing the browser and opening again but no luck also if you want to skip to the build i believe it starts at 1218 everytime i think the amount of damage i did to this boss is absurd you somehow do 5x as much xd never thought about using a danger mario strat for this i just used the transfer runesidetep and scrambled to heal everyone up when he used the heartless angel attack or debuffed my entire party but somehow i managed to beat the second phase on my very first try against it i used this same setup to for the second part of the fight with warmaster hannit the other 3 characters were way under leveled for this 1 was 50 other 2 were in the 30s and just used support items to get her in range for damage i just realize today that the stats on weapons only work on the last one youve used to do basic attack in battle i was happily stacking evasion on every weapon for therion hey i was playing xenoblade chronicles 2 and i got 3 rare blades in a row first one was the doll lady second was godfrey and the dark lance girl literally just beat the final boss just now holy shit galdera kicked my ass 5 times so party setup first phase party hunter olberic cleric primrose merchant therion sorcerer cyrus second phase party warmaster haanit starseer ophilia thief tressa dancer alfyn alfrics auspice on cyrus for first phase for all your breakingdamage needs and also hunter olberic is necessary for breaking top soul keep party up and keep bp and buffs running on cyrus and phase 1 is easy also thunder resist amulets are really good phase 2 i just gave bp to haanit and buffed her for her divine and i spammed it a few times to one shot the adds make sure you get buffsdebuffs off for haanit from alfyntressa then they can probably die although having their bodies to soak meteor storm is nice ophelia and haanit are the main ones that need to be up also fire resistance amulets are ridiculous for the meteor storms fun fight hope to optimize it to make it safer overally nn li out of context 2018 oppression thats fine oppression is okay me seeing the octopath acronym whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat its too early for this man im not ready it is so unnecessary for you to have to beat the 8 bosses again just to fight the boss it is a massive waste of time this would be like losing to wily in a megaman game and having to start back at the boss rush again i still cant beat this boss even at my level the first form did 4k damage with its explosion attack those adds also have way way too much hp you think a boosted magic attack would kill in one shot but nope they start poisoning you crazy magic attacks and then the eye starts buffing them or it uses that orb attack to ohko my party members i need a way to farm some of the bp recovery items congrats on completing post game im still so far away since ive only just completed chapter 1 for everyone xd whats up with the screen borders from watching ohrichard i learned that you can just remove your armor and lose a provoke duel and youll always end up with 1hp ill have to come back to this when ive beaten the game myself im only just now starting the chapter 3s frick yeah ur telling me you already beat this man how poor enemy animations fandom games is the new home of honest game trailers tune in every week for video game content from

three dont go looking for fights four its dangerous to go alone so play nice oh my god seriously no comments on galdera the final boss fight at all did you guys even bother to unlock it before you start making this video worst ht series ever cant do worse than bravely default octopath wishes it was bd huh cyrus is just phoenix wright grinding just grinding the game when someone tells you this is like 16 bit rpg and when you remember 16 bit rpg did not look anywhere near that good bravely default has the best job class system if nothing else what was the first game shown though i like octopath traveler im doing a playthrough on my channel come and watch i do dancer as my first class big fking mistake an uber pool im in tears hi can you please say hi i like pie all i want to know is that epic song at 113 100 hours grinding h of hexagerated god i loved this game so much definitely dumped more than 100 hours i actually loved octopath traveler lol i almost agree with everything in the video and its also why i like the game cutest sprites ever lost it at aerith this is sadly accurate yeah this game was the grindiest and it was still hard impossible to beat the super bosses because of the battle system making sure you cant just muscle your way through i was hoping he was gonna make a saga frontier or seiken densetsu 3 reference but he didnt at least he cracked one about bravely default thats something 039 this is the most accurate thing ive heard all day one thing about the title they really missed out on if they swapped the alchemist and scholers names then not only would you have octopath spelt from each name but the octo would be all the good class actions with path having the unlawful class actions and also that each letter would line up with the two different takes on each class skill to put in simple the first o the cleric can gain temporary party members while primrose the dancer can seduce others to the same role the 2nd o knight and the h hunter both pick fights and the t merchant and t thief both can get items from npcs octopath only has grinding if you suck what were the other nonfinal fantasy character origins like the recettear game i started octopath with haanit and i legit thought the wholeth gameth wath to hath been in language af olde did they seriously just call our boi cyrus phoenix wright we all know hes miles edgeworth you forgot to mention that every single character that isnt in your party is evil like nearly every single story you play has a betrayal in it cyrus yvon his assistant lady who turns out to be the mastermind ophilia mattias primrose simeon therion darius alfyn miguel olberic erhardt kinda should we tell this guy that japanese rpgs are all anime based since final fantasy dragon quest and so on i cant think of a single jrpg without anime style and story 8 travelers who have nothing in common ok i get this is supposed to be sarcastic but you are actually wrong in that statement im not sorry if i want a game review i go to honest game trailers 353 no i never noticed that good eye at least the music and sprite works good say i love you therefore i have to kill you 45 minute bosses lol you must be speedrunning or something as much as i love this game which holy shit i do there are few things that make me want to put down my switch as much as getting wiped about halfway through a bossfight thats already gone on for 3 straight hours do an honest trailer for tetris 99 gaston was a pain in the booty to beat say may the sacred flame shine forth dang now i wanna see octodad on grindr 45 minute boss fights wtf are people doing im about 8090 done with the game and most bosses take 510 minutes just focus on a nice hard attack and you can easily deal 2030k damage every 3 turns or so not counting the smaller hits every turn even with mess ups most final story bosses have around 60100k health still have to experience the extra challenge dungeons im halfway through octopath and i want quite sure howi felt about ituntil i watched this this is exactly how octopath traveler makes me feel lol great video you only have to grind for the end game unless youre awful at rpgs pretty spot on but i do enjoy this game because i love the snes era rpgs it does suck to lose a boss fight after an hour or so while thinking fuck i wish i had that character in my active party absolutely hilarious and true you just gave me the push a i needed do stop playing for good while im still into the first 25hrs lol honest game trailers more like honestly sucks at jrpgs you dont need to grind in this game at all until the post game optional super bosses i cant believe they did octopathtraveler congrats on 74 million subscribers can you subscribe to my channel and pewdiepie the two things the switch can do indis and overblown nostalgia nintendo start using those damn motion controlls the only thing i ground for in octopath was money and that was completely optional lol im just greedy whats up with your voice bro its different do a trailer for dragon quest i love octopath traveler but oh man your video is spot on i love octopath traveler but i also play it in small increments so i dont experience the grinding as much nice d did not notice the octopath character name correlation dont think the game is too grindy though it breaks fast if you know what you are doing and its not too hard to get everyone to 7585 never bother to go higher though you also forgot to mention the secret endgame dungeon and final boss kill a god save the world lol that is pretty harsh and you cant save at any point through countless bosses i loved the game and thought the ce worth every penny everybody keeps calling haanits dialect old english but as far as i know no one ever talked like that why was this so hilarious o i just bought my 7 plus 128gb today but here where i live it cost something arround 1050 dollars wait wait wait was that a reference to the gentleman bastards slow clap this fake old english is killing me fake middle english sir rolls eyes xd he is right that common battles take way too long i love this game the name of the game in the intro please a trailer for sushi striker way of the sushido would be great hey if you dont wanna use the hundred hour grind you could just use bewildering dance and maybe slice those hundred hours down to 75 if your luck is good and bewildering dance doesnt spawn an attack that kills everyone octopath spoiler warning im surprised they didnt even mention galdera i was so expecting them to make the joke that instead of being an amnesiac from a small town that has to kill a god and save the universe you play eight different characters from eight random towns that have to kill a god and save the universe does not mention the pokmon trainer youtubesubtitle 026 auto path traveler xd i genuinely want you to do an honest trailer for legend of dragoon if were looking for nostalgia for the jrpg franchise then thats the one to play wow i dont have any interest in playing this game anymore thanks oh gawd i enjoyed the first 2hrs of playing this game then i felt exactly like this video describes omfg so true why do all jrpgs look like shitty anime characters nowadays nothing staves off the inevitability of the void like watching some numbers go up cyrus is more professor layton than phoenix wright ever the gentleman and an actual professor he even literally says once a puzzle is placed before me i simply cannot rest until ive worked out a solution i love this game and this trailer is 100 accurate of course jrpg is infected by anime it literally means japanese roll playing game hey basch is in there lol hum i expected this review to be fair and objective but i can see now that it isnt the case gotta say this is pretty honest and accurate lol they do travel for a reason finishing the game makes it apparent ovtodad grinder im a 40 yr old dad that had poured 100 hrs into grinding this one enjoyed every minute lol sounds like to me yall just need to git gud im laughing cause its true i already have almost 50 hours of gameplay and legit the same things keep repeating lol until you meet a fruit seller or an old lady that will hand your ass right back to you 125 to 135 what is that music ive been trying to find it for a year now i mean this game does look pretty good but the colors dont make the game really feel like its inspired by romancing saga like alliance alive does do valkyria chronicles im so conflicted about octopath traveller its my favorite game this year but also so very far from perfect characters get stabbed from behind when theyre travelling with a party of 4 and fall into traps as if they didnt have party members wow honest trailer for valkria chronicles please that would be awesome do bravely default honest trailer please 100 hours of grinding man fei fong wong in xenogears lost his memory and that has the most complicated story of them all say glory to the horde please say day terk r jobs haanit should had been the hot girl from horizon zero dawn shit i play this game a ton and i didnt even realize that title joke ophilia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alphen therion haanit i thought it was octo for 8 people but nope meh definitely not your best one dont believe ondores smoshs lies this games a grind but its a fun grind please do an elite dangerous honest game trailer its aeris it was always aeris and still is it even sounds so much better where characters that have nothing in common their storylines do actually these grinds really do be brutal tho stupid complicated earthbound without the absolute insanity family friendly venere never played it but say you need a nintendo switch to play this the first initials of the characters spell octopath blown do a trailer for final fantasy 12 no thats lezard valeth dude got it 120 fuck you im sticking with chrono trigger i was liking the game i must have completed like 12 chapters or so and got bored of it it got too repetitive and the long ass battles eventually wore me down though i really liked the game at first when it comes to leveling up one of primroses skills bewildering grace has the chance of getting an experience and job points multiplier exp or jp x2 exp or jp x5 and you can even get exp or jp x100 and you even have the chance of summoning a cait cultured cait and chubby cait the recettear reference is a 1010 reference top grade reference gold god the bloom so true dem nostalgia gogglessuch a waste of money in the first 15 seconds you have acknowledged neptunia you get props do a bomberman honest trailer say cats will rule the world lol i finished octopath traveler this is incredibely true it hilariouse you should never have to grind in this game maybe post game some for the post game dungeon but seriously dont grind equipment stat nuts levels you must admit if octopath traveler has nothing else it has a beautiful score say this isnt even my final form say im sorry for what i said about bravely default do bravely default how long is this game jw woah woah woah im sorry but did you just make fun of bravely default its either you made fun of the fact that defending is default and attacking multiple times is brave and theres literally a character named braev lee but what come on so its like chrono crusade then repeat it 32 times this is so accurate please do bookworm adventures deluxe this game got worshipped left and right i thought the demo was good for a demo but the whole game being like that lack of a good story lack of overarching story too much grind ughhh sounds like a bore ugh the grinding bravely default is good i just adore this art design mgs v i hear its great truth be told if your doing the optional dungeons switching up your party and willing to do the stories a little underleveled then this game requires basically no grinding you get 1 dislike for the comment about bravely default i dont think action rpgs like xenoblade count as jrpg typically jrpg means turn based at least to me japanesestyle anyone else agree that game is on a video on my channel named top best pixel art games 2018 do an honest thriller for far cry 5 122 indulge yourself spoken before boss battle lost it on reccetear hi there im recettear and i wanna buy some sht can u do the legend of heroes jrpg series cant stand turnbased combat if only it

characters do come together to fight a big bad tho how does this compare to zelda bravely default you guys should reall beat the game before talking a bunch of dumb shit lol actually the stories do intertwine in the post game boss quest this made me a fan of rpg games its one of the best games on the switch a must have and a must play im playing as all the girls and stated with haanit im on her third story and i cant beat the dragon i hate that this game is only for the switch im never gonna get a switch if only they made this game for other consoles too i really dont want to buy a switch since there are really no games there i care for but on the other hand i really want to play this im glad ryan like this steaming pile of horse shit octopath traveler has the worst combat system of any game i have ever played since 1977 i hope it sells well enough thanks for doing this kind of sucks to hear you say lack of customization when you can discover shrines jobs later that any character can use and you can mix and match all support skills i hope you guys revisit this glad to see another mike and ryan video after playing octopath for a few weeks i think your comments are right on point thanks for putting your thoughts out there the volume is too much low in all videos of mike please fix it if it had said slut it would of blown the internet how does it compare to bravely default which i thought was amazing this is going to be the switchs system seller title for me wife gave me the go ahead once we get back from vacations and my botw wii u disc which i never played has rotted and is out of warranty dont assume you wii u discs in your unopened titles are good i love classic style jrpg i dont care about graphics as long as the story is great this game remind me of lunar silver star for ps1 after final fantasy 9 and bravely default i also have to say that this game is somewhat of a disappointment i think if you want to play old style jrps you might be better off with dragon quest games on 3ds square did this in the 90s and all 34 of the main characters stories intertwined the game was called treasure of the rudras i love how it looks and feels like legend of mana and the original ragnarok the fact it is online compatible makes me want to get a switch just for this game alone though i would love to own a skyrim copy for this system and get loz botw the intro should be we talk about game name much smoother than what was attempted here of course its no ffvi did anyone really expect it to be the question is is it as good as or better than bravely default from what ive seen it doesnt look like it im loving it but i have some suggestions mostly small game modifications and tweaks that would be ideal for patching its too bad theyre being closeminded and saying they wont make any additions i think thats bullshit and a dev should be generally open to the idea of improving even minor tweaks to the gameplay from playerbased suggestions i mean i can think of a couple small qualityoflife tweaks that could be easily patched and added and as much as im enjoying this game im thinking the bravely default titles are better overall 3ds same dev octopath traveler is my favorite 70s band xd so many wrong plot points about the characters xd btw there is a big bad boss and a final plot that mix all the stories after you are done with all de main story arcs of every single character and i guess you didnt explore a lot because you didnt find the secondary jobs too many great games to try on the switch so little time so you start with one of the eight characters and you can get up to three of the others by traveling to where they are you completely missed the second jobs thats where the customization comes from you need to find the shrines this game looks so fucking good but im really against buying a nintendo console after what they did to the wii u um this game has a lot of customization i am hooked in the story tbh but yea the stories are separate and dont weave like a ff but why compare this game to every other rpg in existence never played any rpgs before and as this game looks fantastic seems to be pretty hard to the mechanics and stuff is it really great review keep it up cool this game really looks like something else with a familiar feeling cant wait til you guys play dragon quest xi comparing octopath to mystic quest is pretty disgusting there is variety and mix and match for the support skills once you unlock secondary jobs also the signs work perfectly and are always placed at every junction that leads to different cities never change mike never change yes more ryan please i sure missed him the stories dont directly intertwine in a direct way but the later stories have elements that cross over and the final dungeon connects the stories watcha got in 2018 pc we got witcher 3 mankind divided quantum break all that 4k uhd stuff etc nintendo we got 25d and weird cartoon sprites gamers nerds gimme nintendo prims story is so great when she told helgenish to go pleasure yourself i lost it give me one of these games in reverse let me make a party out of all those bad ass monsters and creatures you run into instead of the same generic humanoids im loving the game so far just wish there was more personal interactions with the main characters would be cool to see like a love interest between haanit and alfyn and that effects the story somewhere along the way something like that but thats just me great game amazing old school jrpg tribute i hope this can be something that square sticks with a makes sequels for final fantasy is great but its reputation is pretty much tarnished in the modern day because of xiii and xv square needs this new ip to start over like the early ff games then in later sequels they could expand and do more with it cant wait to buy switch at the day when this game release the bp system came from bravely default i was really anxious to hear mikes opinion of this game but i wont because theres ryan i got a wii wiiu wont be getting a switch but saw this game for a second on the switch commercial thanks for the video letting me check it out play the fucking game before spreading nonsense did you guys even unlock subjobs and the stories do come together sounds like a 2d ff13and i bet they bitched about ff13s combat system saga frontier switch this game is amazing this game gets better and deeper the more you play it the stories and battle systems bloom the more you play the complaint that its eight stories in one game is pretty dumb thats how they advertised it the whole time yay games graphics is beautiful for grinders hopefully this leads to more turn based rpgs from square i think ryan nailed it i noticed that the characters did feel very disconnected from one another and an overarching story is something this game needed but even so ive been enjoying the experience and i would say its definitely worth your time if you already like jrpg games however its not gonna change minds the way ff7 and super mario rpg did i couldnt stand the constant repeating sound bites ummmmmmyou can mix and match passives with secondary classes and everyone needs the clerics saving grace in the endgame ummmmmmthe characters do indeed coming together to fight the big bad i have never played any jrpgs except for chrono trigger which i loved so i bought this on release after playing the 3 hour demo and i was instantly hooked bit over 15 hours played and i cant stop playing i just love it i wish this was on ps4 why you guys continue to believe we want to see and hear ryan is beyond me hard pass at chapter 2 this game really disappointed me suddenly all mobs kill me and i need hours of grinding without sense no fun at all now its on ebay too bad angry video game nerd needs to do a video on the wireless air 60 cool that was a fun indepth look at the game hey can you review the movie birdemic that movies is really shit nice to see ryan back i really miss the mike ryan series of videos you havent done one in a long while talk about shit your guys analysis was really on point in this review i think ryan especially speaks to my tastes as a gamer its such a change for nintendo for them to have a game like octopath traveler use the word whore meanwhile looking on the eshop theres galgun 2 costume dlc nekopara vol1 and the pureelectric love games im not against these game types mind you i just dont find it as shocking when someone utters profanity on a nintendo console not going to check if its been mentioned but the other two jrpgs with the closest combat systems are the bravely games on 3ds the dev team for those games are the ones who did octopath traveler the combat isnt quite the same in the sense if i remember correctly that you have to decide to store an action to gain a charge whereas ot you just have to not use any charges to store them i feel like this was the game se used to test the switch waters they used one of their 3ds teams to develop the game and the shortages of physical copies demonstrates se severely underestimated the demand for the game i missed ryan is ryan married this game doesnt have 8 stories it has hundreds of stories each npc has something to say if mike thinks saying whore in octopath is a big deal hed shit his pants if he played bayonetta 2 i bought a switch just for this its a great game doesnt like the map discovery in a game with traveler in the name ok i need to buy a switch now nearly finished it games worth 60 easily but no other square enix games are literally yesterday i was wondering what happened to ryan and now here he is coo cool video thanks i dont own a switch have too many systems and games as it is but maybe someday no character customization sounds like someone hasnt unlocked secondary jobs yet once you start finding jobs for your characters you get all the customization you could hope for regarding abilities at least any character can get any support skill 4 max at a time any character can master any class with enough investment but can only use one secondary class at a time im guessing these fellas havent gotten there yet i was kinda expecting you guys to complain about it being too hard ever since mike died repeatedly in dkc3 which is the easiest out of the trilogy this is one massively overrated gamepeople shouldnt let their nostalgia control then id love a chrono trigger sequel to be done in this style what a missed opportunity this game is man james let himself go its fun god dammit nintendo start releasing your games for pc you can mix the pssives just need secondary jobs there are 4 special jobs and whats best true end boss is just insane hardd damn i want to buy switch now only for this game octopath sounds like a serial killer in splatoon this game reminds me of saga frontier with the different characters matching up sales and general reception has made it pretty clear theyre going to do a sequel nice to see ryan back on the show ive missed this content takes time to dive into the stories if youre willing to invest that time other than that the combat is satisfying takes time to dive into the stories if youre willing to invest that time other than that the combat is satisfying you guys should google foreskinn docking and see what it is all about what if the stories connect together later on customization increases it is kind of spoilish so i wont explain and likely it either already has been spoiled to you or you figured it out at this point but character customization does increase i dont have a nastalgia for these retro looking games so no matter how good its i just cant get into it because of the weird graphics i got a frog in my gumboot and ill scream while taking a dump if you watch are they releasing this game europe too awesome video ive been skeptical about getting this game but if you two like it then its usually a safe bet ouch comparing it to mystic quest so harsh while theres nothing really new in there i do love how they mix some elements from the greatest of jrpgs welcome back ryan i think this game was spot on it didnt want to be ff6 but it also didnt want to reinvent the wheel they wanted something that feels familiar like youve been there before but also something that hooks you in having 8 main characters ensures that there is always something new happening and if you dont like a character you can kimari himher and ignore their plot i think they set a reasonable bar internally and they hit it perfectly this is a proof of concept that americans dont want our jrpgs to be westernized because that diversity in gaming is what makes these games great they did 9 a stripped back to basics ff game its a national treasure lets do it again every time square puts out a turn based rpg they say well that sold a lot more than we thought well reevaluate our games going forward but they never do it already 20 hours deep still have alfyn tressa and haanit to go saving the hunter for last loved this video thanks the game is completed out of the box but yeah this game is my favourite game this year and i feel its gonna be an instant classic and it made happy for yous to do a review but you can customise a lot when your other characters can switch jobs one of the things i always asked myself and im pretty sure everyone does is that 8 stories for each character do the characters talk between each other well suprisingly yes from chapters 2 u can see conversation between them is like the tales of style you press a button and then go to a screen where they dialogue its pretty cool tbh wow i didnt realize how long its been since the last episode of talk about games anytime i see ryan in a video i know im going to disagree with him i dont think ryan realizes there are shrines for secondary jobs which lets the characters mix and match i didnt like you originally and i hope i wasnt someone who ran you off ryan i think youre good and overlooked i appreciate you and hope to see more of you mike and ryan you totally missed the fact that starting from chapter 2 you get secondary classes for each character more specifically you get each of the 8 characters class as a secondary class which you can put on someone else and you can change these dynamically between battles and it changes the characters stats equipment and skills additionally the passive skills you learn from those other classes are retained when switching classes so you eventually have a lot of passive skills to choose from for each character this is a huge added depth to the gameplay which you ignore additionally from what ive heard im not there yet therere additional special classes to unlock as secondary later on as well as a final boss intertwined story segments after finishing all 8 characters stories the story telling is just disjointed because of the 8 characters id rather have one solid story than 8 ass ones otherwise its pretty good so now that this game is out maybe well finally get a bravely third why do low life virgins hate on ryan i love ryan hes the brains out of the crew this game looks amazing it sounds like persona 5 in terms of battle dynamic ryans back welcome back great review my only flaws with this game are the lack of a good intertwining story between the characters the character customizable system as you guys have said and the lack of puzzles levers crate moving etc during the travels since all there there is between towns and bosses are just diverting paths leading to chests the story is the weakest part of the game sadly between meh to good but thankfully the other aspects can almost make up for it such as the art music and the combat which are phenomenal despite the average story its still a recommendation id say this game is the best game on the switch in my opinion just edging out mario odyssey and xenoblade chronicles 2 i recently bought a switch and the last nintendo system i had before that was the nintendo 64 passed on the gamecube and no way i would have gotten the wii garbage but recently realised that nintendo is still here and its an awesome thing to still have them around the nes was the greatest system to me when i was kid and it is mind blowing to just remember the great moments i had with it look at sega would be nice to still have them around too imagine a world without nintendo what happen to james great game thoughly enjoyed my play through i remember no more heroes on wii was an exclusive and there was swearing in it i disliked cause of the release time wrong time yes you can only have 4 skills equipped at a time but you can grind out all of them and mix and match on all characters primrose is avenging her dad im glad i pre ordered the wayfares edition totally worth it i put 79 hours into it almost 80 i love this game and i hope more people get it glad you guys did a review on this the music the fighting and the storyline is really dark like wow and mike i know nintendo switch was a kids console also adults but we know there is swareing now in switch game i think nintendo finally understood that part im 30 hours into the game imho if octopath was launched for snes or ps1 it would have been a 410 jrpg the lack of good classic jrpgs make we praise games that are not that good what were they thinking this games combat system takes heavy inspiration from the persona series of games im actually pretty surprised that you guys havent covered persona 5 on talk about games yet i know for a fact that you guys would enjoy it especially if you liked this game at all considering it does everything this game does but much better deja vu didnt you already talk about this game or was it just a sneak peak you can mix and match skills seeing that you havent unlocked any subjobs yet youre just at the beginning of the game i have really been enjoying octopath traveler i think it would be nice for the stories to intertwine but for me it doesnt take away from the game because they dont i still enjoy each characters story line and the graphics style and combat is most excellent finally not nes cyrus is a beast once you unlock all his skills hes unstopable he just sucks up sp like a madman gotta keep a crap ton of items on hand to replenish sp primrose does want to avenge her friends death but her original goal is to avenge the fathers death mike you should cosplay as kramer i dont care much for the switch at all but this looks like a damn good rpg turn based being one of my favorite battle mechanics and the last good one i had played was persona 5 im here to read the comments about ryan i do think that ot lack a bit of complexity i mean its nice to have 8 characters but they barely intercat with each others just bought this started as the scholar makes me feel like im playing a retro game with new mechanics and visuals thats disappointing to hear about the story does this game share any similarities to odin sphere in that the stories relate at all but are separate other characters making cameos etc or are the storylines completely separate this makes me wish for a switch mike have you ever played legend of dragoon on ps1 this have some of the same feel to it you guys should look at cosmic star heroin if you havent already i thought it would be bad and was i ever wrong loving this game also by the way this is not a indie game ryan makes a great point at the end dont be too hard on him i will be up this game irregardless because i did enjoy bravely default never played the 2nd for i really like games where you can max out classescharacters for some reason the most annoying part of the game i believe its by the same team is that the story literally makes you go through it twice to beat it and after you find out what is a good combo min maxing just became a chore i absolutely got my moneys worth however so i will buy this thanks for another great video you guys the story gimmick in this game really stinks too bad theres gonna be no dlc unless they change their words but the creators said clearly that the game is complete on launch and theyre not thinking of releasing dlc im loving this game its soooooo good surprised you didnt comment on how good the music is you guys always do that with retro games like dkc but you leave newer games hanging just when i thought ryan couldnt possibly look any more nerdy he goes and ups his nerd game my boyfriend bought me this game and i love it give this game on the ps4 please i agree with a lot of what you guys said the only thing i think you missed please remind me if im wrong is how amazing the musical score is well above average even for a jrpg the passive trait mix and match come when you can get second jobs p nice ryans back its been awhile since they uploaded one of these this and ssb are the only games that would make me buy a switch ah a wild ryan makes a sudden reappearance is this game good dunkey said the game was not very good that probably should be the future of octopath traveler franchise intertwining the stories and giving narrative choices ex one character is on a quest to rescue her mentor however we discover that mentor killed the other characters family which path do we take do we fallow one character on a route to discover why the mentor did that is he under a spell or do we kill him where we stand here maybe this turns a party member into a villain or causes them to leave the group it could be interesting of course it would be best to discover there was a single entity pulling the strings that we can possibly have everyone unite against but it could make very fun game story telling for an rpg and would be more manageable because you are dealing with a finite number of characters and stories to entertwine but besides that xenoblade 2 uses a lot of 4 letter words it kind of feels like people should be use to the wholesome nintendo being something more of a perspective of the past sony and xbox can keep the overhyped ffxv this is a proper jrpg already fanboys from sony xbox and steam are port begging well its published by nintendo so that aint happening this is not a game that i would ever buy or play no rpg for me however this was a good video and i enjoyed seeing and hearing from mike and ryan together again no dlc for it this is 100 percent complete i want a sequel this is the best wii u game ryan bic n beard bic and beard its like gin but heyhatchy anyone below is a peasant dont take this seriously fantastic game my only real gripe is i feel like the momentum of the story is constantly being interrupted since im never sticking to one characters story for very long i love that they dont remember the character stories at all primrose wants to avenge the death of her father by three assassins olberic doesnt want to save his family he wants answers for his friends betrayal etc i honestly laughed that they had absolutely no idea any of the characters story arcs at all which i feel is kind of a big part of the game these guys are always late most that were gonna pick this up have already beaten the game or are well into it great review great video though i think the audio was slightly off looks like final fantasy 2 and 3 snes i have never completed a jrpg before or any rpg for that matter but this game was awesome and i put 80 hours into it does anyone have any other recomendation for other games like this glad to see ryan back good to see a review with him in it you guys keep up the good work you two clearly havent unlocked the second jobs for characters theres a ton of skill customization but you guys havent found the shrines to unlock the jobs yet dude doesnt even remember the name of his character sounds like a memorable game great to see talk about games back fantastic to see ryan and mike doing this fantastic show again maybe they have been around on other websites but i am pleased to see them on youtube wowthe graphics are cool i wish the characters you control were as detailed as the enemies and bosses when youre in a battle hows that 10 inch monster schlong mike mike u r the coolest love this game interested in hearing what the nerd thinks of this game r incredibly y sexy a hung n man im not a huge fan of how the game looks most of the time i have no beef with pixel art i grew up with nes and snes jrpgs and loved a lot of them but the bloom and lightingshading effects look very out of place to me with that kind of art style maybe its just not my kind of artistic vision but it looks like half of the game has a bunch of bloom and contrast filters thrown over it that take away from it for me visually and the depth of field is a little offputting too i would have preferred a more pure 2d pixel art style myself more akin to the classics like ff6 and whatnot regardless im glad to see some companies still trying to breathe new life into older styles of game genres so i hope it does well i just dont think ill be bothering to buy it myself unless it goes on sale mike the map has a ton of villages to visit i sometimes skip the chapters to explore the paths i understand what youre getting at with the map though the yellow marker only follows you to each section move along 20 steps and it wont change ryan ff vi is one of my most favorite games of all time the over customization breaks the game and i like the limitations in this game get the espers learn vanish and doom and then youve conquered the ff vi all other jobs are worthless dont learn those two spells then get everyone to learn ultima either way the game becomes too easy ooh turned based jrpg exits video i think you 2 should make a follow up video when you beat at least 2 or 3 of the stories a ton of complaints you guys have are made invalid when you progress through the story like for example you get more classes for the characters so you can customize to the way you like too bad its on switch its like a new old rpg game not bad cool review thank you and not thank you at the same time because now i have to spend 300 dollars for a switch and this game this is an amazing game great video guys i really like the combat system on this game is turn based but addictive hey guys i saw some comments about the job skill stuff i have been streaming this game throughout the week when we filmed this video i had not yet gotten to the job class customization shrines yet just started chapter two yesterday im pretty addicted to playing this if you want to follow along youll find me here httpswwwtwitchtvmikemateilive cinemassacre there is a big bad but they are well hidden in the shadows and a series of side quests in the post game lead you to the truth as in the later chapers espacaly the last chapters you get hints of conections between each of the 8 charicters journeys through one major plot point or main villian with the bigest being the gate of finis constantly being mentioned by difrent charicters at this point in the game along with people mentioning a traveling apothecary that dissapeared 10 years ago who was descended from a powerfull warlock who sealed away a dark god it isnt a full blown finale but more an epoluge that hints and how much more there is to this world and the direction the next game could take this is an excellent game i started with primrose i finshed all 8 charicters stories and now im grinding for the secret final boss but a warning to everyone you need everyone about lv 70 to 75 as the fight of two phase fight that uses a seprate party for each phase this is an amazing game that i was excited for when it was announced im surprised they never found the job class shrines that give you character customization perfect timing i just got this game yesterday i love both of these guys but i have to admit videogamedunkey review is on point even though its mostly satire fucking enjoy both channels and opinions these boosted turns actually already existed in final fantasy the 4 heroes of light for the ds and the two bravely default games for the 3ds which is probably why many people think that octopath traveler was done by the same people and bravely default 1 and 2 are also worth playing love this game so fun nice to see those oldschool graphics with some new school flash the graphics are beautiful love the retro 3d style good to see ryan in a video again the game is so good i love the battle system my favorite thing is the boost system so you can do like major damage when you lower their defenses idk if anyone notices but its kind of like goku powering in dbz x2 has a red aura like kaioken x3 is yellow like super saiyan and x4 is blue like super saiyan blue its amazing lol i dont like to much jrpgs but this is fucking awesome 3 i love you nerd v best game on the switch now the other game that does the boosting thing is their prior game bravely defaultsecond ive been waiting for another vid of you two i enjoy them my main is primrose thanks a lot now i have to get a nintendo switch and this game i downloaded the free demo and got hooked 3 hours wasnt enough and i dont play jrpgs thanks for the video this is my favorite modern rpg might even be my favorite all time the combat is so unique and the characters are great the older english dialect mashup is tough to read out loud lol i cant wait to pick this game up such a fantastic game i want to play this game so bad def need to get a switch funny i came to this squad naturally on my first run still am on first run 35 hours in a few days hehe they just have such great chemistry also chose thief for haanit and hunter for therion because very good utility high damage tressa is a dancer too for cyrus sounds dirty and cyrus is a physicalelemental hybrid death machine i dont get it if you barely attack with the sword on thereion you are barely getting the speed buff for the next turn or does the speed already count for the beginning of the battle because the sword is the first weapon in order pls explain d all you needed to do was level primrose up 1 time therion warrior makes a really good evasive tank are there any viable builds for haanit other than warmaster me being the idiot i am didnt realise the nuts were finite and wasted all of my phys nuts on warmaster therion that and my haanit is 10 levels lower than my second lowest party member and 30 behind my highest after u complete the game can you switch out your starting character out of your party i dont see the value in boost start starting with 1bp just doesnt sound that great i think bp2 would be more exciting i started with alfyn so i can concoct group bp if i want but horde my ingredients lol also therionmerchant can donate bp if hes bored another staple for me olberic is better than hannit he has more defense and more health hey man thanks for the work you put in the videos i just wondered what are your two 4manteams with these setups so is the starseer secondary job that bad i like giving alfyn the endless item skill that way i dont lose out on some of my important items any specific combinations of characters you reccomend especially for the ruins of hornburg without giving spoilers please notes from video haanit swords battletested blade purchase from erhardt polearms battletested spear purchase from old man after mikkmakk quest daggers battletested dagger steal from npc in undertow

victors hollow alaic staves shields gustavs shield head adamantine hat body s very useful many thanks my haanit has 900 evasion but low physical attack am i building her wrong nn li where did u find all the adamantine hats and where did you get all the elemental augmentors thank you so much for this im working on chapter 4s atm so this will be a good help when im done im using olberic over haanit olbericleader primrose alfyn tressa thats my main party but i frequently shift one character inout to do all the character quests great video elemental aid doesnt increase the sp cost of runes thats why its so perfect on runelord did you call haanit cure excuse me but tressa is the definition of cute i also prefer haanit as my sorcerer when pumped with seeds leghold on first turn sets herself up for her nuke on the next turn no need for boosting ophilia boosts her with aelfric prim does peacock danceand youre good to go i like cyrus as my warmaster again seeded so that hes a jack of all trades for breaking another nice thing about haanit as sorcerer is that her beasts dont rely on her statsso you can still bring a bunch of triplestrike beasts or end game beasts for physical damagebreaking she also becomes a jack of all trades theres a fire dagger as well so prim can have dual fire element as a runeblade and theres an icestaff as well so cyrus a ophilia can have dual ice when using battle tested axe so i dont think tressa necessarily edges them out with the damage but she does have more utility i personally prefer prim as a runeblade because i can use sealtige on my starseer and bring along a follower and she looks awesome but yes technically tressa is the best yea do all the characters it would be awesome if you made a video going over the best npcs to allureguide for each town or just in general do the vids thanks for the tips clickable timestamps haanit 048 tressa 327 therion 547 cyrus 813 primrose 939 ophilia 1209 alfyn 1428 olberic 1639 i keep sorcerer on cyrus just because he looks like drstrange can anyone be the warmaster beside hannit does therion really get enough e def to pull off being a cleric and why not run sorcerer on prim instead i thought you got the battle tested spear by buying or stealing it from captain leon after completing the mikkmakk sidequest not old man nn li i personally would like to see a video based on therions build because it looks very interesting and id like to see how it works no starseer okay best starseer to you at least nice job thanks for another video its great keep up the good work surprisingly you are one of the only youtubers who are covering this game thanks again funny thing is that my therion has 850 evasion by equipping him with mikk and makks shield falcon hat silent cape and 2 enlightening bracelets with a few evasion boosting nuts theres 2 physical belts go get the other one the way that im getting around the problem of having a large level gap is im playing all the chapter 1s then picking a team of 4 and getting through all of their stories then playing through the last 4 stories with those 4 remaining character the first 4 stories are certainly harder this way i already played the game before all the way through to the endgame but i suspect the last 4 will be easier due to having good gear and some of the secret jobs love the closed captioning vodka path traveller i still think the switch version is the definitive version though this game is so perfect for on the go gaming great objectivity not just selling it like other reviews great vid i started with therion the grinding part was the worst but the game is amazing for its ability and beautiful music to keep me interested all the time finished the insane final boss around 140 hours of gameplay im already super bored of this game unfortunately the presentation is really nice i like the visuals i like the combat i like the soundtrack etc etc but it falls on its face when it comes to the story and abusing your time ive only gotten as far as completing everyones initial chapter 1 and you know what youre rewarded with no direction it an indication that chapter 2 starts are a recommended level of 23 and all of your characters range from 10 to 17 so basically you just got to grind that shit out some of the stories were interesting like primrose but others were just kind of bland an boring and it completely breaks my immersion that none of these characters speak to each other yet for the entire duration of the early game maybe if i was infatuated with this game i would complete it and love it but i just cant force myself to slog through its low points for the hope its going to pay off id rather invest my time elsewhere which is a real bummer because thi problems with this game 1 its too expensive 2 it cant be downloaded from anywhere to avoid the grind and level up much faster giving you a constant 100 bonus to xp and jp as well as potentially giving you 5x bonuses or better 1 unlock all 8 characters and the secondary job shrines asap 4 characters at minimum ophelia and olberic are a must cyrus auto scans one enemy weakness at battle start and can analyze other weaknesses making breaking shields and battles a lot faster therion can help steal good gear primrose and tressa are good for xpjp boosts through donate bp and bewildering dance skills 2 if you have a dancer and a merchant always boost the dancers bewildering dance if they go before your big hitter for a chance at 2x 5x or 100x xp or jp a 100x chance requires a 3x boost to bewildering dance which is easier to to do if the merchant donates bp and a passive from one of the ubersecondary jobs can start your characters with an extra bp at the start of battle but if you boost that many times your team could be killed or sil if you want to get rich and buy those absurdly expensive gear keep tressa on your party all the time give her the thief secondary job and she will also be a great resource battery during battles 80 hours is long who here remembers when rpg players used to seek out games specifically for their 99 hours of play the pc version looks so much better its 58 cad on steam rn and thats a decent price but a tad to much still knowing square enix theyll probably make a monthly subscription for this game for future content 84cad on steam shocking yeah ill look elsewhere for ways to play this until the price drops below 20 i started with primrose definitely a mistake 100 hrs to beat all 8 stories pc is the only platform you should be playing octopath traveler on 4k max settings option for minor tweaks like making the game run in 144 fps and removing the depth of field holy crap the animation looks so much smoother at 60 fps it really puts the switch version to shame starting as primrose isnt that bad her first story is meant to be soloed like all the rest then just go grab cyrus and you turn on ez mode for the rest of the game i picked prim as my first char and used her for the whole game as i really liked her prim is actually one of the stronger characters in the game if you play her correctly you need to utilize her charm to have idiots that will fight for you the only character i ever considered to be kinda bad was therion his story is okay but he takes so long to ever be remotely useful outside of stealing stuff out of combat which granted is super useful when you pull it off 50 40 on cdkeys is a bit steep for a port ill wait for a sale then pick it up been debating on picking up for pc but i dont know if i want to spend another 90 hours now its a great game and it reminds me of classic ps1 jrpgs but theres sooo many games to knock out mods would be a nice addition guess ill pick this up on sale lol there is a secret ending the gate of finis which u use all 8 please say how its possible to store 8 different character stories in mind they dont allow to pass story of each character separately my favorite characters were tressa primrose and alfyn watching that 60 fps melted my eyes away o bought the game when she said it runs at 60 fps turn based rpg shuuuuut the hell up and take my money after p5 this is the best modern jrpg iam gonna buy this game worth it ya think on pc should i wait for price to got down alfyn wound up being my favorite character octopath traveler is one of the best games ive ever played the secret ending really gave me a challenge which i really loved even though it was frustratingly difficult at times end game ruined it for me well this is the death of a nintendo exclusive now that its in the master race omg those 60frames are gorgeous the game looks good and all but paying 60 bucks for a snes quality rpg best is 40 bucks and quicky go down to 20 bucks and later 6 bucks or run it on emulator for 90 aud i cant justify buying this game honestly its insanely overpriced and should cost no more then 20 30 buying it this week i cant wait im in the mood for a nice rpg really torn between platforms pc sounds like it is the better experience but 80 hours means that a portable version might be better this is exactly why we need crossplay crosssave games now im sick of being restricted to a single platform next gen isnt about graphics it needs to be about accessibility cyrus is a mage and professor looking for lost artifacts so he is a fantasy indiana jones and i think thats awesome the worst bit was the grinding i had to do just to be able to fight and finally beat the true boss quite possibly one of the hardest fights ive ever won this game has the same graphics from dragon force it was released in 1996 and this game cost 6000 this price for a pixelated retro game they can kiss my ass waiting for a crack 50 on steam for a console port yea no the switch version wasnt even 1080p while docked so yeah this looks much better and seems to scale better to different resolutions pretty good game but kind of bland in terms of characters and story some people compare it to ff6 but the writing here is nowhere near as good and original played the game on switch but stopped the difficulty when starting chapters 3 ramped up to high been tempted to continue but this is the first time this has happened to me in which i even think might not be playing the game as intended and i am a jrpg veteran i am way over leveled according to the suggested level for completing a chapter and still i get owned by the game add horrible regional pricing to the worst bits i am sorry i really like the video and if i would have looked for a reviewfirst impressions i would have totally watched it but i was expecting some more talking about the pc version i was actually expecting to hear more of how it runs and what is better or worse than the switch version and so still a great video and thank you very much for making it and letting us know what you think i played it for about 30 hours on the switch before i gave up due to some crushing difficulty spikes such as a boss who can 2hit ko my team despite being at the recommended level its a shame because otherwise i was really enjoying it i may go back to it one day but expect a bit of a grind at certain milestones this looks and sounds like something id like as a longtime jrpg fan going back to the snes daysbut i dont like the 8 character thingid also prefer 4 tbh i cant stand having party members i cant always use and managing xp gear etc for more than 4 is a slog imo really the only newer jrpg ive played is dragon quest xi and that game 1 shares xp 2 doesnt have to involve grinding untilunless you do all the postend game stuff and 3 has multiple difficulty settings so you can play how you want in my older age with less free time as well i honestly prefer games like grim dawn and diablo 3 over games with partiesparty managementtoo much choice i am a big fan of the snesera rpgs those were great stories chrono trigger ff6 thats why octopath traveler was a big letdown for me the combat is fun but the story is barebones at best i stopped after the second chapter because it became way way too repetitive what a shame hopefully we will be able to play snes games on the switch without jailbreaking it someday if youre reading this if youre planning on playing this for the first time do prioritize picking up every character and doing their chapter 1 the easiest character to start with is certainly the warrior i could swear the game wasnt gonna support resolutions above 1080p so hearing you had no issues running it at 4k was a welcome surprise great vid the absolute worst part is that game is completely infeasible to buy in many nonus regions the game costs more than three times the regional pricing of vampire bloodlines 2 in india despite both being 5999 price tagged customers in these regions have got increasingly frustrated with the arbitrarily high regional pricing set by aaa publishers i sub just found your channel you should be telling the best areas for grinding for early mid and late of the game i still can get the golden axe starting out with cyrus starts out with cyrus recruit ophelia haanit then therion and challenge that girl 19 hours in started alfyn i make poor life choices thanks the tip about stealing the golden axe for hannit was especially helpful she appealed to me most as a starting character 112 and then the second boss will squish me in a minute the end great vid thanks how many hours did you play before finishing it cyrus for smash if i give the second job of thief to someone are this person will be able to steal from npcs in the towns i began with cyrus was not disappointed forget evasive maneuvers the reason why cyrus is the best starting character is analyze period i started with therion but got haanit second and keep cyrus in my party ophiliascholar with equipment boosting elemental attack is op af shes dishing way more damage than cyrus in my party in my opinion cyrus is far away from beeing one of the best characters when you reach latr on the hidden shrines with the special classes cyrus feels completely underwhelming in my opinion the best character are 1 ophillia 2 alfyn 3 tressa 4 primrose 5 haanit and then maybe cyrus but the end is very mixed and the gap between better and worse character is pretty low overall i just think the top character have 1 broken skill that makes them important for your team hile the last 3 have just good skills overall but no must have skill ik im kinda late but i run scholar primrose and a really devastating combo for bosses is alephans enlightenment by prim onto cyrus and aelfrics onto cyrus from a cleric and also try to peacock strut onto cyrus this does insane single target damage perfect for a boss so thats your use for alephans enlightenment lol whos the worst character i have this game on pre order tressa ftw i chose olberic haanit the golden axe can be gotten very early and she can use many weapon types with her beasts shes a killing machine especially through the early game cyrus is my fourth teammate gonna go and get hannit wish me luck just got this game today and this video is super helpful thanks i started with cyrus because knowledge is power and magic is everything so heres how im building my cyrus since hes my strongest character and people can tell me if this works or not subclass cleric both final skills for scholar and cleric unlocked i dont have the final jobs yet waiting till i beat all chapter 3s sp saver persistence the show goes on patience i think at least 12 pomegranate ls are required or you have someone use merchant class for giving you enough bp for this with sp saver youd have plenty of sp to spare to pull this off stack both alephans enlightenment and aelfrics auspices and thanks to both persistance and the show goes on it stacks for 5 turns instead of just 3 youd do an incredible amount of damage on one target twice and with the chance of patience youd be able to attack up to 4 times in one turn so imagine hitting 4 times with elemental weakness using skills that hit the enemy twice and this is all without standard magic buffs too add it all up and youd get the potential of doing eith great tips thanks why was cyruss secondary class warrior wouldnt it be better on a physically offensive character 3 lolno chance in hell this game was fun great fun then i got cyrus evasive maneuvers and the game got so much better i feel like it turned into the perfect amput of time between battles seriously also he deals a lot of damage also his story isnt half bad haha i use alephans enlightenment in boss battles i use it then donate 3 bp to cyrus and deal 3x more damage than a aoe magic can i still capture with haanit as a side member in my party cyrus or tressa for their talents my team is cyrusmerchant tressadancer therioncleric and oblerichunter incredibly versatile group with great talents firing off therion is the one you want to sub out whenever its needed obleric as an apothecary is also nice got the game yesterday and started as primrose best character in game her skill is busted go get primrose on youre team if you havent and just got theirion as well and hes good it doesnt take 10 minutes to say therion started with cyrus and he is indeed fantastic i really like therions abilities and tressas donate bp skill can i ask why you chose the sub jobs you did im having trouble on choosing the most effective ones for my characters right now i have cyrus merchant scholar therion thiefhunter ophilia clericdancer and haanit is just a hunter i do have the golden axe for her and soul daggers for ophilia and therion any feedback or tips would be greatly appreciated thanks for the real tips bro appreciate the video bro the rate of random encounters is way too high in the game i started with haanit and have 3 others already going to swap out alfyn and get cyrus the huntress was gonna be my pick as main character just based on my preferences in playstyle and story so this sounds very good indeed about stealing the golden axe if you have a low chance of success would you just reload and try again after a failed attempt i havent completed the game yet by any means but i think ive found an incredibly good combination of characters that help you progress super easily 1 cyrus dancer covers all elemental attacks minus light magic and covers dagger 2 haanit warrior covers all physical weapons minus dagger if you dont have a beast to deal dagger damage 3 tressa cleric covers light magic and can be used to self sustainably revive and heal without the need for items by using the rest merchant skill to heal sp 4 therion unnecessary to the core team but has nice overworld abilities with the three character core you get a provoker in haanit to clear characters and you get evasive maneuvers to avoid encounters plus evil ward to run away easily these three core characters are so good together that i was able to progress through all of the second levels so far i havent done thirds without the need to level up the extra character who is initiating the story the only healing cyrus is by far the best character i picked haanit how do i get therion right away it seems like her path makes you go westward towards the cleric and cyrus i started with the hunter babe i do not regret it i choose cyrus to start the game just because he looks great lol does having different sub classes equipt impact stat increase when you level up ive been playing nonstop today i started with therion because i thought i may need to steal some good stuff lol you can get augments to your stealing by inquiringscrutinizing npcs all right which party of 4 would you say is the most effective to use as a maingroup through most of the game with secondary jobs included before i even watch i predict cyrus or hannit i choose cyrus and was 200 satisfied hi little b like and subscribe from italy can you make a video showing all shrine locations awesome as usual of course i enjoyed the clear tips what sub class do you recommend for the party you had look forward to more videos soon ps4 releaseplease nice on my birthday wow now thats a well written review good job hear that ign thats how you do a review love the game awesome review subscribed wouldnt mind seeing you do some reviews of past releases as well what an awesome review ive never played nintendo before and im thinking of getting the lite n this is one of first ones i wanna play thanks buddy but the game couldnt be non linear the way it is if the game had character interaction i disagree i mean octopath is based on saga games and even tho not every character interact with your group every time the events made them talk and do things rs3 for example had a lot of this saga frontier too you could recruit gen for example and travel to wakatu so he would guide your party to where the saber card would be so it was when you had white rose and asselus in your team and went to owmi they would talk with mesahirtm and you could recruit her i really want to love this game but the faux old english makes me crazy got it for 40 on ebay cant wait to play i sell my ps4 for this game im so happy that i found this gold mine of a game i havent gotten it yet but i am so going to buy it and im so excited i hear a lot of mixed opinions on this game but it makes me think really its a bad game i thought it was pretty good i had a good time with this game but hearing the bad things about this game makes me feel like im the only one who likes it i mean sure it has flaws but lets hope the sequel improves on it but i have to ask is it really that good or am i just blinded from the snes jrpg era i first heard about octopath traveller thanks to a cover thought nohing of it the day before yesterday i wanted some music while i was working and i found its ost i was so thrilled i almost wanted to buy the game just because of that but i saw one sentence in the comment talking about the lack of natural interaction between the characters relationship plays a big part in a story at least for me your review explains it well but still i dont know to spend 60 seems too much i really enjoy this game even though it has destroyed me a couple of times but my only complaint about this game its a little too long i mean i know its an rpg but im used to rpgs that are like 2030 hours long like my favorite rpg of all time earthbound i still really enjoy it but i cant really see myself replay this game very often this bumped ff6 to my number 2 spot for atg jrpg doing a playthrough on this game you can watch it on my channel watched 3 reviews on this this morning got the next week off work and wanted to play a new game since i finished my grind to 60 on wow and am waiting for the next content phase you just totally helped me make up my mind time to delve into the past with this one subbed d i really like the experimental nature of the game i hope this becomes a series and they improve on it i absolutely loved it do you think the story is shallow the class system reminds me of final fantasy v what games at 015 and 017 what is that rpg in the intro with the 3 mech uits walking in the snow can we get a full retro 3d game because if they did with the sequel thatd be amazing you convinced me my ps4 broke down so now i bought a switch with this game im so excited great review btw now this is a review not the crap you get from ign or gamespot well done so its saga frontier anyone played that aww this is switch only is there optional bosses and stuff to do after you beat game like all ff series very great review for a very great gameim playing it right now loved the stories well written sorry but no way can i agree with that sentiment even an hours worth of ff3 dialog trumps every character story in this game by a wide margin ff5 did the job system much better than this game i appreciate your optimism in the review but octopath simply doesnt compare on any level except maybe graphically with any of the older rpgs better story better gameplay waste of 60 imo the complicated turn based combat ruins the game gets boring everything else is good just bought the game ill keep you posted on if you were right lol really reminds me of the job system of ffv i really wish theyd use this artstyle in a remaster of v and vi im 38 hrs in and thats the first ive heard of a job shrine watf i was super excited to get the game its one the primary reasons i wanted the switch but this game feels fucked you start at level 1 with everyone and their second quest all require level 20 thats mental its slowly turning me off as i play through it often feels like im forcing myself to play this thing i found the bitesized chapter system being a bit shallow overall especially paired with the repetitive format and dungeon setup as you mentioned i never found myself hooked by or caring much for the npcs i met and longed for the midtolate adventure synergy and events that other jrpgs tend to have i also found the combat and job systems fun but a little limited compared to bravely default or bravely second overall i thought it was an enjoyable game with an interesting presentation and a great musical score like you mentioned but stuff like the clerics save the kid who went into the woods chapter and other scenes made me feel like they might have rushed putting this game out 1227 i really cant be the only one that actually does this at the boss httpsmemegeneratornetimgimages17096462jpg those dislikes are garbage gtfo you haters im super late to this party but i wanted to stop and say that your review was extremely good thank you for taking the time and putting in the attention to detail im still mulling over dropping the coin for it but i definitely feel that you did an incredible job of arming me with the info i needed to make the right decision for myself thanks i need to go back and finish this game its pretty fun i dont think ive enjoyed a soundtrack of a video game since jeremy soule came out with the skyrim soundtrack cupheads is pretty up there as well but decisive battle ii is my absolute favorite it just really makes you feel like life and death is on the line totally agree yes cyrus is the best boy i want to play this now and i can on pc but im getting a switch and damn it i rather play it on that lol here after it was released on pc i just heard about the game i suppose it just released to pc or just to steam recetly it is 83 for me atm on steam so im going to wait for the first discount at first but it seems really fun and will give me nostalgia romancing saga wannabe game music which is always 2nd to me after the tie of immersion and game play tie for first tho i may not play this as i am a sony fan and have been since ps1 and will not have a pc for another year but when i get a pc this will be one of the first titles i play tho i will never complain getting both dq11 and now the trails of cold steel on my ps4 finally again very solid review with good sound and good editing kind of spoiled the surprise of the job system and how it is unlocked waiting till the price drops what i am setsuna and lost sphere should have been the review was very well done im looking forward to playing this on the pc im glad games are becoming more accessible on all platforms looking at you red dead wish more developers would utilize this art style well you sold me into this they need to sponsor you lmao very cool grsphics and story plus music bravely default is better but this game is amazing fantastic review thank you im so glad se just announced this is coming to pc in june really looking forward to it just played the demo for 2 hours with therion and nooooow its bought and downloaded god is it a good game im so excited if they didnt have time skill or budget for robust character interactions they shouldnt have made a game where eight characters is the sole focus to the point of being the actual title crapping on ps1 models oh you didnt just 7 out of 10 pros long game at least 80 hours if you complete everything difficult bosses by the half way point the boss difficulty really spikes up fun battle mechanics battles were certainly entertaining cons not enough customization in terms of class for example giving a secondary job of merchant to a warrior should change the class title to sell sword and the character should also be given unique skills to fit that class some of the voice acting was really bad characters like therion and alfyn sound like youtubers doing a good cop bad cop impression played it for over 80 hours before reviewing it that is so awesome i just want to say that i really appreciate nintendo giving you a 3 hour demo to play it convinced to buy this game the demo being the hook that got me smart move my interest in the game started at a 910 dropped to a 5 went up to 6 and dropped to 3 firstly i understand its a reminiscent of the ff6 we grew up playing and loved but japanese companies in particular dont seem to ever get that those people grew up i still want a jrpg but for gods sake breath a bit of new life into it the story is completely shallow and bland just like the characters its way too easy repetitive and well boring with the combat system they tried to make it interesting and it is somewhat but ultimately its just tedious i found myself just groaning and yawning through battles with ff6 the characters spoke to one another the story sucked you in it progressed this game is just lazy even the music while well edited and beautiful is just as boring octopath traveller can be summed up in 2 words generic and lifeless octopath traveler was the first game i purchased on the switch i may be the minority but octopath traveler was probably my biggest disappointment in terms of jrpg pretty much ever tied with xenoblade chronicles x i got tired of the artstyle very quickly and i really wish they would go all the way oldschool on it instead of adding way too much modern effects every environment look abnormally dark and difficult to see and no area has a distinct visual identity i really disliked the very repetitive nature of the game both in exploration and combat every single zone is treated like a barely sophisticated corridor with a few paths on the sides i dont care if a game is linear i really had no issue with it for ff13 for instance since at least that game was making you feel you were on a journey the combat was fun at first but the jobs really lack depth and you very quickly find broken combinations and use them over and over almost every job battle system before that game were handled better from ff5 to bravely second and a vast majority of i want this but ugh so expensive guys should i buy and play octopath traveler or xenoblade2 first i cant decide great review i love this game so much what game is showed after ff6 at the start what game is showed after ff6 at the start are there any games out there with this art style cyrus is indeed best boy i wish this game was not 8 bit but im new this genre ill pick it up it and give it a chance its bad im currently playing it level 36 first of all gathering all 8 characters is incredibly repetitive the first one is fun and its challenging but then you are stuck with 7 identical missions that simply become easier and easier then you have exploration theres a simple mostly linear path with small diversions here and there that will 999 of the time to a completely pointless chest no secrets or anything exciting like that you might get the rare dungeon which are not great as ive seen so far finally you have secondary missions which involve talking to someome and then talking with somebody else congratulations you completed the quest i dont know what elae to say the world is artistically beautiful but it lacks features and content the narrative is not that great what im enjoying right now is looking for secondary jobs at dungeons thats cool and feels rewarding id kill for another final fantasy tactics game done like how this game was done with more interactions between the characters of course i will sub tho solid review mate really enjoyed how you took the time to explain all the pros and some commonly pointed out cons but did so without an obvious bias please continue to release densely packed informative videos for a relatively new channel your videos are really high quality love the octopath video played xenoblade chronicles 2 before this and to my sadness thought i had lost the ability to enjoy jrpgs but when i picked this game up i was totally floored by the beauty and charm of the graphics and soundtrack i guess ill sound like a boring grandpa for saying this but i think the final fantasy series would be doing alot better if they used pixel art with the more modern lightning and filters like this game its classy and timeless to me this is the game of the year that went under the radar dont make fun of my first jrpg ff8 squall is a badass nice we share the same name buddyow yeah this game is awesome i really enjoy this game and im loving certain stories i liked discovering secret bosses advance jobs and secondary jobs as well i found my favourite characters during chapter 2 of certain characters i like the travel banter and i do get what you mean that with how open the game is in its structure that having the other characters appear in cutscenes would be a bit tricky because some people might not have anyone with them at all itd be a lot more stuff to add itd be really great if they could but part of me does think it was a budget issue i can suspend my disbelief in some instances because i can let my imagination fill in the blanks by imagining them there but sometimes its a bit too immersion breaking for example when tressa showed up for a boss fight and was mocked for being alone when i had all my other party members behind her because then its like ok well whatre they doingwhere are they because theyre obviously there in combat just have a fu amazing game did not expect such a good old school jrpg im typically not into jrpg but i love this game the music in this game is some of the most beautiful sounding well made music ever in an rpg fantastic review thank you for this scholar is such a great class either make scholar asap or recruit cyrus first also you can turn off the vignette effect in the settings tab great review 1010 i know dragon quest takes the spotlight right now but ill definitely get octopath traveler thanks for the review needs to be on pc i enjoyed this review so much thank you for making this video i cant wait to try the game myself u therion is best boy my character order 1 cyrus 2 tressa 3 ophelia 4 haanit 5 therion 6alfyn 7primrose 8olberic support skills are awesome who honestly wants cyrus as a hunter he was my protagonist and i gave him the cleric job also i got almost every job close to after getting each character technically it isnt about saving the world also i dont think other characters are supposed to be present in prologue chapters as there isnt any travel banter i like everything about this game except the lack of interaction between characters it makes me not want to play it at all maybe after i beat some of the other jrpgs in my backlog ff4ff6chronoearthboundetc ill get to octopath traveler your vid did convince me to at least put it on my radar quality content as always im assuming we can look forward to dq11 in the near future great review and great production for such a small channel compliments this review is near perfect 9510 great video d its like saga frontier but good i mean i enjoyed saga frontier and the immediate sequel but those games arent objectively good completely agree with everything you said except the corner shadows only bothered me 5 of the time really hope we get more games like this woah you can play the whole game with only 1 party members you cant say you value good writing in video games if you like this game its simply incomprehensible the characters dont even acknowledge each other you literally have a character that hates thieves but will still help therion commit heists and say nothing about it that makes no sense just dropping in to like video im on chapter 2 right now for therion so ill watch the review after im done loving the game so far i just finished all the introduction missions i cant wait to see what happens next perfect as always that music is absolutely gorgeous and well done showing how to fix the shadow corner issue after octopath now you should focus on dq xi its look very awsome all right honest question out of all the reviews ive readwatched only one of them correctly called bp boost points everyone else has some other name for it is it different in japanese or is something else going on runner introduction starts at 001 run starts at 054 couch commentary is provided by jelloknifee rhexyn and starsmiley mrgameandshout is the host i think i cleared the whole game without learning i could run faster by holding a button in my hundred hours of playing this game it never once crossed my mind to use hired help i though it uses money well why would i waste my money like that then i preceded to beat the game with millions of gold without having ever been close to running out uuuhh oops i should start playing this again its such a great game but i got myself stuck in an endless cycle of grinding by trying to do everyones story at once need an octopath traveller complete speed run tbfh octopath community has a discord i want to join d my mind is officially blown oo god i love this game haanit is awesome no lie i didnt know that you could fast travel in this game and i have 30 hours holy shit i just googled this shit expecting like a 4hr vid or something but i got this instead im blown away now i feel like sitting through and finally beating the game as soon as i heard therion was joining the party i was happy hes my main in my game glad to see kirbopher got some love in this run when the speed run start ends up being the same as your party but in a different order awesome run great commentary especially the guy in the back yelling the dialogue came to see omar get fucked was not disappointed i really hope jello will run galdera category next event or next year please mybladeisunbending in an age of content being cut to sell as dlc 110 hrs in and getting the secret ending octopath is the only game i really want them to expand on either with dlc or a sequel the individual stories were charming the npc quests meshed together so nicely in the end thats the problem you sorta didnt want it to end my only gripe with the game is towards the end there was no challenge zone to really test out the advance classes til you hit the hidden dungeon every enemy on the map would get nuked this was an excellent run made mediocre by a series of blunders in commentary overall i was somewhat disappointed to start there was a lot of potential in this run the game is fantastic and it makes a great jrpg speedrun unique in that the any category can be finished in such a short period of time the runner spoke very well in terms of wordchoice pronunciation and enunciation he also has a nice voice and it was pleasant to listen to him narrate on a technical level he executed the run beautifully he is clearly extremely knowledgeable and absolutely deserved to be running the game here i didnt mind that they elected not to go into the details of the story as its nothing special when only considering tressas plot line so im actually glad they brushed over the lore the red scarf guy on the couch was good the other guy didnt have a very pleasant voice but he was knowledgeable so he gets a pass they also did a good job getting the crowd hyped up not ea just in case anyone was curious i believe the wr for the post game of this beating all the bosses and going to the ruins of hornburg is about 5 hours speedrunners got this shit on lock because that took me 80 hours on my playthrough excellent game and im excited to try and speedrun a path myself i knew tressa was the best character tressa is the best girl primrose best girl just have to state that invalidated run i just want to mention i find this game to be very gorgeous and if anyone knows any other highly recommended games old or new rpg wise that look and play this fantastic by all means please do let me know 3 that was an awesome run but i hated that guy in the crowd who kept yelling games not even a year old and theyre already showcasing a speed run at a gdq event has the no spoilers for one year rule of respect for the less fortunate who cant afford the game immediately been completely abandoned sigh i cant imagine how it feels to speedrun anything without the pro controller thank you thank you good run just got me back into playing again something to hold me over till kh3 thank you thank you get ready for the after game dungeon in 14500 lmao tressa is best girl is there an octopath 100 speedrun out there somewhere i want to see the final boss get wrecked by a speedrunner lol meanwhile i have 40 hours on the game without any chapter 4 done after psycopath octopath xd ok i leave thought this was octodad does he also beats galdera good lord 48 minutes it took

of the paths faster than it took you to beat one of the bosses me initially oh hey octopath traveler awesome upon seeing 48min time wait what how even if its only one character its still crazy wanted to play through this game i started and it got kinda boring for me so glad i get to watch the whole thing in 45 minutes xd yooo where is that mega man 10 run though thank you damn this game is gorgeous did i read the title right 48 min im a hardcore gamer and a 37 year old man and its my very very first jrpg i own final fantasy 7 but have never touched itthank you for your tips i am a total and utter noob at jrpg games ive been loving this game but i can imagine someone who never played an rpg in their life get destroyed in some bosses also i hear a lot of bad rap from some people and it makes me wonder is this game really that good or am i just blinded from the snes rpg era one thousandth like useless vid for beginners as you jump over several things like how you level see your level or just play the game in general just a steam player scrollin through 508 the characters you refer to are primrose and ophilia im the other way around lol i just started i start with haanit got ophelia now im getting to cyrus lol 140 his study only reveals 1 vulnerable for every enemy if the enemy same species it only reveals one in this battle shows twice because the previous battle the light vulnerable is already revealyed then the sign study foe appears and cyrus reveals the dagger whats the best way to farm for money i chose haanit and i die every time i try the fight the first big monster dont know what i do wrong i started off with alfyn because he was a witch doctorapothecary i figured since this is my first time playing a real game outside of mario and sonic games alfyn would be easy to start off in case i got hurt a lot and for the most part i was right alfyn was easiest in my opinion to start with because his first boss wasnt too tough im still playing the game and right now im going in order i picked up therion next his first boss was also relatively easy as well i have just defeated my third members first boss haanit and am now coming to the heart wrenching decision of picking out my four main party members im good your info card on this video got what i need hello any sugest for last quest to unlock the gate of finish im stuck at the last quest on west swarkii the npc is not available in there i just got it 2 days ago and im really enjoying it i started with my boy therion in the demo and its getting harder i love it vary well done you just got a new sub thanks bro maybe some party suggestions in the next video i started off with primrose to see that story everyone talked about cant say i am crazy inlove with her game machanics thinking cyrus prim olberic and ophelia im only level 15 with my squad how do i level up quicker side quests etc its easy not sure why some people find it hard maybe its cauae i grew up with old school final fantasy games first thing i really noticed in this game was the difficulty jump in caves great video thank you you can get postvictory bonuses if you perform the following tasks 10 bonus untouchable extra money if you didnt get hurt in the entire battle break extra exp if you inflict break on an enemy domination extra jp if you win on the 1st turn pro tip once you select your starting character you wont be able to change them out of your active party until you complete their story id recommend starting off with ophilia or tressa so you get a dedicated healer right off the bat or constant income respectively octopath goty very useful intro guide thanks thanks for the video i wasnt sure what danger level was i thought i was under leveled liked and subbed very helpful subscribed save scumming idk if anyone else noticed this but i think the order of the vulnerabilities is the order they are in the equipment screen so say if an enemy has a vulnerability to daggers and it appears first in its vulnerability boxes then you can know for a fact it isnt vulnerable to swords i may be wrong but just what i noticed i am not going to lie i was not going to buy this game but went to game stop today just to pick it up new sub its a good idea to memorize the order that vulnerabilities are listed in that makes it easier to figure out an enemies remaining vulnerabilities after finding one isnt provoke like the exact same as challenge for the warrior some of the characters abilities just seem like basically the same thing as another characters and that kinda sucks the shoshinsha mark brought me here great vid arigato goziamasu do you find save scumming cheapens the game or do you find the mechanics that encourage it poorly designed is it time wasted grinding vs time wasted reloading therions actually the best to start with savescum and steal good stuff in towns and he can open purple chests so you dont have to go back later i hope one day square enix will add final fantasy characters as dlc would be awesome to play any ff characters in dis game great vid as someone whos new to the series this was pretty helpful i started out with the haanit grabbed thieron and now it looks like i need to go and pick up cyrus asap i started with cyrus too but i went to get tressa before going towards ophelia so i could get her useful merchant abilities and a nonstaff user spear and bow saving and loading goes agains the whole point of an rpg great video im really loving this game rpg gold in my opinion is there anything that can be done to raise cryus scrutinize ability success rate does his level influence the percentage anything that can be done to increase the number of failed attempts i noticed sometimes if youve failed in a town prior to recruiting that towns character itll say your reputation has been restored in the top right corner once you start the new characters story thanks for this i was looking for a way to get past villagers who were blocking doors sub earned so far my main team haanit cyrus ophelia primrose i have all vulnerabilities covered with elemental and physical its depending on the beasts ive captured and townspeople i have with both primophe idk if this game should have a guide after i got cyrus the game completely changed the only advice i have is dont stack like heroes in a party primroseophelia i was hoping u would talk about the steal can u tell me when it works best a video on fastest xp for certain level ranges would be awesome cool vid i started with olberic then on to tressa and now im just doing cyrus its working out well so far money and power but now i dont know if i should go for ophilia or the thief therion pick therion for your party and do savescumming for good gear early even in later towns its still op you wont ever have to spend money on gear some basic tips for rpgs 1 always save this is the golden standard 2 be sure to equip the best available every time possible not always the best equipment is the one with higher stats sometimes is something that protects gives an element prevents inflicts a bad state or gives extra experience money 3 had curative items available at all times skimp money because healing potions are expensive is the certain way to die on a long dungeon 4if you in trouble look at some place for hints gamefags is a good place to start i cannot believe i always miss your stream part 2 of 2 all character chapters 3 4 here httpsyoutubeykkubgq5vee please subscribe to get notified when other new videos go up and thanks for watching i thought great direwolf was the games true final boss because of his difficulty boy was i wrong i never would have guessed to bring that random aspiring actor to kit i think i talked to him once in the beginning of the game and thats it how would one guess he would be tied to kit perfect thank you i loved this game they were all connected you cray cray i followed a guide that explained all of this but then forgot to tell me to talk to the guy again to gain the ability to fast travel lmao none of these quest make any sense how the hell are we supposed to guess all of that this sidequest are just so random like every sidequest in this game omg thanks for the info i just finished octopath now im going for that final dungeon thanks again the ultimate boss kicked my secundary part lol 1hit 3k good god that dungeon is gonna be such a grind i think im done playing ive comleted all 8 main quests but i cant find this guy alphus anywhere dont expect a grand interaction between the party that was my biggest issue with the game the characters never do anything of consequence for each other its all skippable and not at all applicable thank you so much for sharing this guide on how to unlock it i just finished all 8 stories and didnt know what to do next just another reason why you are one of the best gaming channels here on the internet where is kit i cant understand what you are saying and ive played it over and over again it sounds like you are saying you can find kit on the moonstruck coast on the right side what non plot related spoiler dont even bother going in unless youve levelled and equipped all 8 party members theres a megaman style 8 boss rush followed by a two phase final boss battle each phase requires you to use 4 of the 8 party members if you shelve them right after their story at around lv45ish the final boss will easily one shot them my main party at around lv75 was able to deal with the first phase with a bit of difficulty there are no random encounters or save points inside and death will result in you having to clear the entire area again 119 that woman hasnt appeared for me what do i need to do what level do you need i talk to kit but the actor dont swans i am way too bad to beat the final boss of that dungeon yet but the story parts you get to know before the boss are just perfectly tying it all together optional dungeon spoilers when the game asks you to make two parties after beating all 8 of the boss flames do you have to use both parties for the fight i started the fight and did a few rounds but im worried about investing even more time if im just going to be forced to play as a gearless lvl 20something alfyn and primrose the stories are absolutely all connected and its a shame the game doesnt point it out or at least guide you to the end a little better i did everything on the kit side quest but i cant find them at the swarkii trail do they only appear post game really cant blame people with review copies for not knowing this this is all so random lol some part of me want to know how all these stories intertwine i cant find the merchant in grandport he isnt there couldnt i just use ophelia and cyrus anyways can you only find the troupe leader in the swarkii trail after doing all eight stories because i cant find him anywhere appreciated nowhere near that point but appreciated nonetheless and always nice to see a story spoiler free video to let you know how to do something tha will eat your time can you finish all 8 stories in the same game so i dont have to play through the intros of each character again i cant believe thats how derrick pronounces android 18s name good game so far finished all 8 character stories and unlocked all 4 advance 2nd jobs thanks for the final dungeon gamexplain grinding to level 70 took enough of my free time so this was much needed so i can waste less time on the endgame content of course theres going to be idiots that care about spoilers in this game unlike cough mario odyssey cough cough kirby star allies cough cough mario rabbids kingdom battle cough i really hope we dont get this issue in super smash bros ultimate through out the story of the eight main characters i always wondered why didnt we visit homburg since it was mentioned so many times when i saw the title i thought it was something for splatoon 2 octo expansion wow thanks so much for this i definitely wouldnt have figured that out lol so you half assed the game just for the review havent played but is this a good rpg it took you long enough the gays arent gunna be hapay how u pronounced lapis luzli there it is this is fun first im first pc exclusives are cheap im happy more people will be able to play this game thank you enix for ditching that stinking rotten trash called epic store wow thats amazing finally i was dying to play this this was such an amazing jrpgfans of the genre dont miss out on this one yeah need to bring this in fast before got yuzued now you should release bravely default on pc as well highly recommended easy learning curve but combat ends up having a lot of depth to it thanks for beta testing fam i wouldve assumed that since the game runs on ue4 itd be on the epic store good thing its on steam one thing is certain there is no ps4 or xb1 version at this moment i bought switch because of this and zelda ps4 and xbox versions when you guys sure itll be on steam no last minute changes bravely default still waitin this game was absolutely fantastic yes it on steam you need a mic for this type of shit smh im guess that is your final party why isnt therion your mage for that sweet 60 percent bonus from dagger and sword to fire damage bewildering grace mostly has negative effects for me its my second playthrough and i only got a 5x multiplier a handful of times i wish exp x 100 but wild mushroom apparecce xd wasted 2 hours on the 2nd method just to get instant wiped and all my progress lost not only did i not get the 100x exp boost once but i had to switch out 1 party member and the progress wasnt even that fast exp 100x only comes from a fully charged bewildering grace right jp x 100 your items are scattered on the floor mist shrouds your party sp reduced to zero followed by a boss that spammed aoe move fml im glad i started with my grill primrose d how dungeon is this first dungeon so far i only got 113k jp from a x100 jp so now my team which was around 26 at that point got all their alts now i use clerics ult so dancer can dance 8 times a turn with 3bp but i only use one dancer bc otherwise my team would be too squishy xd its really fun but i never died that one time i was at 1hp each and the enemy mass attacked luckyly primrose had the reflecting buff from cleric so she survived xd i know this video is old but i just started some days ago with the game xd i have been in the game for only 25 hours but i was killing the 4 elite bosses with reflect damage i was already invulnerable9 reflect alwaysdone this with a cleric dancer class all boss gg the reflect with increase element and physical and critical and so what ever the bosses do they kill themselves i was shocked and stayed up all night coz of this strategy one of the worst leveling methods ive seen in a rpg based 100 on the luck i got exp x100 once went from lvl 20 to 33 on my whole party not using maw of the ice dragon has the potential to spawn all three caits using an inferior location for chapter 2 grinding mfw i find the little break bonus never hurts as well if you can get it in quickly before your oneshotter goes if youre like me and dont like putting effort into xp farming then level up cyrus and go to this grotto in the snowy area near stillsnow the enemys are really weak to any level use cyrus and do the double fire attack they should die in one which will give you untouchable break and domination so i wanted to play this game all over again with a different path so i decided to level up using bewildering grace the amount of times i got the you barely survive bullshit too many times in about 100 fights i got it 20 times and i died each time due to aoe enemy barely survive then my team gets silenced in those 100 fights i got 2x exp once otherwise its killing me where is this place where you fight the giant bird monster something that i used to help with the exp grinding is the clerics ultimate skill that allows for characters to use abilities twice thanks this saved me a lot of time i once got a jackpot on a cait nearly crapped my pants hi are you getting the game on steam youre a beast im new to jrpgs started ff6 last year and im loving octopath should i be grinding im 90 hours in and lvl 45 50 with my characters im liking the challenge will grinding just make the game too easy im chapter 4 with everyone now 2 already completed why you have two bp in the beginning if you need a really good grinding spot go to the gym in which location or cave can harvest that exp or got strong enemies cant even fathom why anyone would want to max level up in a jrpg that is already fairly easy without grinding maybe try going outside in the early game i lucked out and got x100 xp followed x100 jp not to many fights later turning me into a bewildering grace addict thank you for showing me the error in my understanding of the game luckily i just started unlocking the advanced classes as well as finding the items that increase xp and jp nevertheless if it wasnt for your relentless efforts i would misguided by primroses bewitching allure have wasted hours in pursue of the elusive multipliers why does everybody have the japanese voices on cant believe by clicking on this video the job mechanic was spoiled idk if you know this but 100x exp only will appear at 4x boost i dont really understand why this is necessary i played the game at my own pace and was able to beat galdera with some trial and error but virtually no excessive grinding with only two travelers above level 70 whats the point in playing the game after youve completed all the chapters and finished the final boss if you really enjoy the game just start over with a new more potentially challenging protagonist this just seemsunfun i started this game with ophelia and when i got the warrior i was like oshit a second dude and hes so op now i see this shit i cant even do ophelia chapter 2 o well i tried spamming bg for hours probably at least 1000 times i got jp100 3 times never got exp100 i gave up hope of leveling up with the x100 multiplier omg cyrus sp still at 250 even at level 90 something it doesnt seem like leveling up that high helps your hpsp stats at all nic vidio i like your tactics i use abute the sane set up but slower i even gotten lucky and got 100 4 times in my game so far its a bliss to see it happen thanks a lot for the info and if both of your dancer had cleric as secondary job and use aelfric auspice and get 8 dancer per turn 16 if your lucky would it be great edit i was thinking because of the set up it will be uneffificient and speaking thinking also how do you add a bow to a person i cant seem to find any information about the booststart skill how is it unlocked the amount of experience needed to get from level 80 to 99 is absurd very poorly designed exp system almost no one is going to bother with the ridiculous grind you need to get to lv99 really enjoyed your content on this and appreciate it greatly especially since youve dedicated to much time nd testing props to you where is this location sorry im lost will it come out on pc exp x100 lose all your hp the ground exploded i fought the final boss for therion chapter 4 and i did the bewildering dance and i gasp when i got the exp x100 multiplier by the end of the fight i got 150000 exp hi the skills to increase xp and jp must be select on each character or only one is enough my best fight was turn 3 x100 exp that spawned a fat cait on a sleeping opponent ended up with 100k exp my youtube site octopastraverer play movie if im not going for efficiency will clerics divine give you 8 bg with dancer at full boost the first time i used bewildering grace was in a boss fight primrose healed the boss 33k health gave him a buff and gave my party status ailments whoever made this skill mustve been high af tt i beat this game and did most of my grinding in the forest of purgation your gonna need patience and saving grace for everyone by the last few bosses its pretty much required another fine example of people having to much time on their hands i got ep x100 now half of my characters are op way too complicated i guess im stuck at levels 817 with all the characters because im not interested in doing 100 random battles for little experience just to get to the recommended levels damn shame i was loving this game at first i got exp 100 twice in the same day and im around level 30 for all of thr ok i need to farm for 4 characters and primerose is one of them so i can use 2 dancers my party will be primerose and 3 characters 1 the fastest one will get dancer as a subclass 2 the one with the high elemental attack will get the mage subclass 3 the last character is here will be a healer 1 the mage will max his elemental attack but will equip one amulet to resist mute use the 4 passive skills to do max damage 2 primerose will take thief as secondary class and equip armorhat with more sp weapons with more speed and ring with more sp the 4 passive skiills will be reduce sp costs give sp back every turn one more ep and 50 speed 3 the 2nd dancer will copy primerose 4 the healer will take the passive more xp more jp more money and the passive from dancer where you revive once with 25 hp max hp and defense for him most fights first dancer use 3 dances he get enough sp back to not worry about the 0 sp malus if not muted the second dancer uses 3 danc i love that you claim to have spent hundreds of hours compiling all this xp gaining information but have yet to realize that the best grinding spot in the game for xp per hour is not the forest of purgation its actually one of the most inefficient and obnoxious areas to level up reasons being 1 battles are too inconsistent 2 cyruss speed cant match enemies so hes usually last to attack 3 you get in those stupid fights with that giant rock monster thing that has 9 shield and isnt weak to any elements which is a huge waste of time 4 no fucking caits like ever 5 most enemies have over 4 shield so its harder to get break bonus just using a single sorcerer spell maw of the ice dragon 1 enemies are a joke to kill and have under 4 shield 2 95 of the enemies here are weak to bow attacks so one arrowstorm from hannit or therion sub jobbing hunter and everyone is broken right out of the gate and ready to die from magic 3 battles last about 10 t i dont mind waiting out for bgrace animations the only thing i absolutely hate about it is when your own spell fukings put you in silence only to further stall out the battle i found the two weaker caits and got a exp x100 all of my character in that party went from level 30s and 40s to mid 60s i defeated a chubby cait with x100 multiplier xd i got 242000 xp the best area to farm would be forest of no return correct i think it is the highest level area so i guess this is the best area but i am not sure why do i get sorta ticked off at the japanese voice acting xd beyond helpful thank you for taking your time to help others ive been killed by bewildering grace soo many times i dont even have the balls to do it in a boss fight thank you very much this was very helpful mayhaps i will have less of an ass whooping when i revisit the gates of hell for a faster way to gain xpsimply edit the save data with some hack tools and youll skip on 100 hours of repetitive grinding u da just taught me some shit lmfao thx theres always that one guy that makes you and all your experience and wisdom in a game look and feel like a total noob or just get lucky like me and get the 100x exp on a boss for 85000 exp at once went up 15 levels at least the english voices are better what areas would you recommend to grind in where enemies have similar weaknesses merchant bp giveaway dance that increases spatk full bp use on mage any mage skill lol here i thought i was hot stuff with my level 18 thief lol how to get the sorceress skill in scholar might be good to add equipmentaccessories that negate silence for the intermediate method if youre using bewildering grace because the silencing your whole team ability is extremely common method only works if you dont want to grind and or have good luck ive been grinding for 10 hours and only got 1 x50 jp nothing else above that and im starting to hate this game because i cant get shit done at my level i finished every chapter being 6070ish is there any reason i should go on and grind exp or is it just for completionist so farm where cait can spawn and kill the cait then use 2 dancers to roll for a 5 exp multiplier i will need this since i want to get stronger to tackle the rest of the game this is how cheers mate this game hasnt been out more than 5 days as of upload and youre already level 100 and already have over 100 hours into the game im just at 30 hours in and i played for 5 or more hours a day i mean this game fucked up my sleep schedule but you apparently have none best way to farm xp is to get a exp100 bonusyesterday i got 4 times 100 bonus and reach lv75 from lv30 in just 4 hoursand i didnt even farm on purposebut that is all depend on luck what cave are you in during this video just going along using bewildering grace fully recovered my eyes get blessed with the sight of seeing green blue and yellow as well as numbers everywhere and everyone being at full hp sp and bp i have 3 alluring ribbons but i cant seem to find the 4th one can anyone help me with their locations also to answer some question ice dragon maw enemies fall very easy to wind and fire magic and give really good exparound 1500 per battle also all cait types spawn together here frequently the badges mentioned in the video are unlocked after beating olberic and ophelias stories find the exp badge in wellspring by speaking to guard captain go to goldshore inquire the archbishop there and return for the jp badge go to saintsbridge and speak to nate and his friends for the quest find the npc around the bridge named bully and buy the flower he has and return to nate where can i find the boost start skill i am farming exp in forest of purgation because monsters are on lvl 58 is there any other dangeon where monsters have higher level my experience represents a small sample size so i would love to see others chime in if they share a similar experience in my time with the game i ran into cait about once every 3 hours or so however while i was running around in whistling caverns the cave by primroses starting area i ran into cait 3 times in 40 minutes again i realize this is a small sample size and it could easily just be dumb luck but the difference was certainly stark however if others are experiencing something similar this is a great to get from 15 to 30 incredibly fast where can i get the item that increases exp gain i got a reduce hp to 1 and exploded after that game over gg bewildering dance rng lolol so happy i got this game for 25 the main idea do not gamble dude i had to sub loving your videos dude your a jrpg god man lol loving this game right now i couldnt find a copy so i got it digitally ill wait for the octopath traveler wayfarer edition when it becomes more available lmao and i was thinking method 2 would be at least semi reliable since i got the x100 multiplier within 10 minutes guess i was just lucky af but nevertheless it was very satisfying to see primrose level up by 50 levels at once just out of curiosity is there a reason to grind up to 99 i leveled up to 75ish by accident by just exploring the whole map and shrines and now i feel too overpowered because im only on chapter 2s of my characters my team is tressa alfyn ophilia and haanit and i beat their bosses in like 3 rounds i havent even started on the other characters wait so can you encounter a heavenwing in the wild then holy shit im only lvl like 19 so seeing this end game stuff is amazing nice work but i mean does it even matter to get that much exp when youre already lvl 93 lol i guess to lvl up faster it helps sombody told me to spam bewildering grace during battle it would be more efficient they said i guesse it is not then again i only have one dancer being tressa not using primrose that much but in the end just one shottign them gives you more exp thanks for clearign that out btw what is a good area for lv 2530 wow thats a cool share definetely gonna try this thanks for the upload and holy shit 120 hours on the demo o thanks a lot for this video really helped me out where can you find the badges chubby caits usually take the first turn for me should i build cyrus on max speed how do you set up a 1 shot kill character what are the areas you do this farming in where are the caits hey where i can get the items for 50 more exp and jp thx anyone found a different method yet or a dungeon where i can level up from 60 to at least 70 or so cause ive been playing for hours now and i have been trying to cast that 5x exp but its sooo rare it takes soo long just to get it i have horrible luck with that dance ive only ever gotten jpx5 once any other time i use it it mostly debuffs me or does nothing if only caits didnt run away so much or this would make it more ridiculous where is the best spot to grind levels 3050 anyone know where can i get those badges what console where did you get badge of friendship if this from sidequest can you tell how to complete it cheers mate this will help me with the late game grind what about just not using bg at all thank you for this which area do you go to for level grinding what would you recommend when it comes to leveling your party focus on first choice other 3 first then swap them for the remaining four or just swap out one of the characters for the one im doing the chapter for therion is best boy right after watching this video i went to carrion caves first battle i found a cait and was lucky enough to get a x5 exp boost from bg but it doesnt stop there because i was able to find another cait right after the first one and i also got another x5 exp boost i got alfyn from level 17 to 31 in those two matches thanks unrelated to the video but do you know if things like incidental strike and eye for an eye can trigger second serving is it possible to get exp x100 more than once in other battles your help is incredible for this new game thank you for stepping up my favorite character is haanit because i like the way she plays and her backstory a lot i think i found a decent method apparently there is a rare enemy you can find and if you kill it it gives a huge amount of xp and i know this because i found and killed one and it gave an assload of xplike 1020 ish xp true and certainly the best way to go just out of curiosity though and for the purpose of experiment have you ever managed to cast the 100x xp or 100x jp more than once in different battles or even the same one only been 35hours in and only managed to get it once for each in different battles thanks for the hard work and sharing it with us as always really appreciate it can you give specific locations for the best areas to farm for intermediate to advanced thank you so much the first rule of grinding increase the enemy encounter rate as much as possible and then double it if you can 2nd rule kill every enemy as quick as you can so basically do what im already doingsigh i only have 72 hours on the game but i am nearly finished as well and did the same grinding method as it is the most efficient 35 hours and still dont get exp100 now bewelming grace is just ruining every battle a small correction i want to make at the end i say yasunori nishiki adhered to the same technical limitations as the classics but that would mean hes using the old soundchips and making something that could actually work on the old consoles what i meant to say was the same compositional limitations i just bought this game and holy crap this music is addicting i never get sick of hearing the battle music games like this keep melody alive these days games are using cinematic soundtracks and effects but theyve lost what people loved memorable soundtracks octopath traveler is a masterpiece ill fight anyone does nobody mention how the ending song flows through the 8 area themes then to the main theme watched this video 3 times within a year i learnt something new every single time thank you i would love to see you do a video about jeremy soule he uses orchestra but a lot of his songs are so memorable i get the elder scrolls theme stuck in my head all the time i just discovered your channel so forgive me if youve already talked about him you are so right alfyn is best boi also fantastic video this guy is soon going to be a big name in the world of video game composers i wish there was an option to switch the orchestral soundtrack to a 32bit version im just so into those electronic snes sounds the textures of these arrangements are exceptional especially in combination with strong oldschool inspired compositions nice video glad to have found your channel what is the game at 006 this game took the number 1 spot for game score in my book uematsu does give deference to the old masters but a lot of his music is heavily inspired by 70s prog rockers aping rick wakeman and ian anderson was one of his favorite pastimes incidentally this game also does the same the boss themes and daughter of the dark god knew what made old rpg boss themes work and thats sparse arrangements that have rich texture battle at journeys end has a little more than its share of yes in its dna so many modern arrangements of the classics like the dreadful fight miss out on what makes those songs so special and its the sparse arrangements with interplay between timbre id like to see what nishikis thought process could do as an arranger for a remix album of some of my old favorites 359 could only produce electronic pulse noises thats completely false only the nes was like that in its limitations the snes the console far more known for jrpgs used sampled instruments not electronic pulse waves as a result the instruments didnt sound like bleeps or bloops but real life instruments downsampled of course wow great editing this guy is seriously one of the best game composers i am shocked he doesnt have a lot of credits of big titles to his name seriously people need to get him on some stuff yah large orcestra kinda dosent fell right in a 8 bit style game dose it tho i guess it not 8 bit but any way it want to look like a 16ish bit graphique or something even if it like 1080 or what ever any way case and point it sond weird whene you got crazy good sond quality to have low amont of pixel it just dosent fit well as there like a flaw in the design there as low amont of pixel useally all pixel need to be usefull the same way should the song be made low amont of notes and instrument so it fell like it should be for the graphique power and all note need to be usefull like the pixel imitation hey just got a comment to make it is true what you said about the pitch of the instruments being above the others for the instruments that have the melody in most cases it is a normal practice in all music but that is not what makes the sound of a solo instrument truly prevail i believe it is the diference of the families in witch the instruments belong and the diferent sounds the diferent families of intruments do for example in the ophilia theme yes we have a flute witch is a very high pitched instrument reigning over the others but we also have violins witch as you said are also very high pitched instruments suited for melodies what makes this contrast is really not the pitch because we have a woodwind intrument a flute with the certain sound woodwinds do i could explain better this sound in some kind off way but i think you get the point if not i could try to awnser in the comments and the strig instruments the violins it does not the diffference between pit that flute reminds me of shire why did you write the part at 237 as if i was guaranteed to have ever touched chrono trigger in my life man ive never played chrono trigger but it still sent shivers down my spine to be a bit nitpicky you speak of the composer writing it with melody and chords first as if it is something special isnt it how most musics made though except maybe for some super talented composers that can think up tons of instruments at once the same with violinsflutes sitting on top it is not a trait of video game music but just common practice to write melodies for higher registertone instruments imagine if bass had to carry all the melodies great video though just my two pennies worth of thoughts that some explanations seemed a bit strange i wish i found out about your channel years ago this is absolutely incredible i feel almost as if it was made for me lol you sir just gained a subscriber ill be telling my friends as well as subscribing with my gaming channel my 3rd favorite ost of all time its beautiful and amazing and this game doesnt deserve the hate its getting your videos are awesome you undoubtedly deserve more attention keep going like that ay wind scene from chrono trigger sent shivers through my body love your videos as always the score for this game is so freaking gorgeous this review is unbending i absolutely adore jeremy soules score for skyrim have you ever thought of making a video about it i would be very interested in seeing such a video amazing thats probably why theres something special to game music particularly rpgs best boy alfyn shucks good taste right there btw while his theme wasnt amongst my favourites at first it really grew on me later his theme as well as the riverlands theme are like the musical embodiment of a comforting hug which perfectly fits his super nice and chill personality him being voiced by greg chun also helps i think you just convinced me to get octopath traveler se nintendo throw him some money very impressed what a thoroughly researched and well made video this is the highest quality video ive watched all week and i live on the internet 1210 my dude great to see another fan of vg soundtracks keep doing what youre doing im new to the channel and working on these videos is fantastic im sorry if there is any grammatical error its because im brazilian and not fluent in english yet ps could you make a video about the ost of detroit become human i would find it incredible this video is great appreciate it being a no spoiler video i know you said you had no plans but i hope you will eventually do a bravely second video ryo needs some love after all the negativity surrounding his work on seconds ost fantastic work as always how about a diablo episode diablo 2 specifically ive never played an old style snes kind of rpg but this music is just awesome i have very little nostalgic value with octopath traveler octopath on its own is just an amazing rpg to me its like it takes whats great from the old and the modern with its hdpixel graphics very simple and classic battle system and stories but with modern touches that make it stand out like the boost mechanic could you do something on child of light this made me realize that i really need the octo path music playlist ima go check for it right now best boi alfyn i think you mispronounced cyrus octopath didnt get good reviews but i played the demo and man the music was amazing will probably pick it up on sale someday just became your 40050 subscriber this channel is unparalleled this is very well done i just stumbled onto this video and i absolutely loved your analysis subscribed please make more you deserve way more subscribers i love the analysis of all these pieces and the videos the music of octopath is simply magical it evokes so much emotion and fits so well great video octopath traveler and yasunori nishiki deserve a great deal of praise for such an outstanding soundtrack the music from the demo alone sold me on the ost cd set i especially appreciated all the little auditory details tucked in from each character theme featuring a different lead instrument to the clever and intense boss music transitions that are based off the character themes as well i always wondered why games from the nessnes era had such memorable tunes limitations really does bring out the best in creativity this games theme song is an all time classic yasunori nishiki is going to be the most indemand composer in japan now this soundtrack is beautiful and while its very nostalgic the addition of live instruments give the pieces a certain feeling musician interpretation old school rpgs sadly couldnt have while i love all of the character themes specially tressa because clarinet bias haanits theme has a certain ad lib to it that makes it stand out even from the other soloists everyone has a sort of accompaniment but this theme is pure piano great video as always and i know its a bit late but i would like your input on that holy shit i havent gotten the game but after this i am sold what a great analysis you did give me chills that forced me to remember the first time i arrived at ad600 in chrono trigger you deserve more subcribers thank you for exploring and analyzing something i feel when listening to video game music in 16 bit era this also convinces me to get nintendo switch only for this reason gosh watching your video made me appreciate even more octopath travelers soundtrack even more i need to buy this game god octopath travelers soundtrack is sooooo good damn you hit the nail on the head i love the soundtrack of octopath traveler now i know why thanks for that my favorite part about the main theme and really a lot of the music in octopath in general is the progression in the main theme we start with a few strings and then the flute comes in and the horns come in they get louder and the the secondary motif brings in more instruments at a stronger dynamic and it keeps going from there and this is shown in game with other music tracks with a few building upon one another to make for a cohesive experiment great sounding game and amazing video incredible quality video the content was great and very much interesting though that background which moved constantly was sadly at least for me incredibly distracting i think the videos are a lot more engaging when the clips are fullscreen without borders even so keep up the great work fantastic work and man this soundtrack i played the demo and this was my main take away beautiful melodies clear as the photorealistic water but with nuance allowed by the new tech this video must have taken ages best boy alfyn damn right great analysis as always thanks patiently waits for ost release on itunes oo i have a really hard time with modern games that draw so heavily on earlier consoles i think octopath looks beautiful and the graphic style is a very tasteful blend of old and new but the realistic music just does not work for me at all it feels so out of place with the pixelated art style i really like the 90s synth era because the hardware was working within tight limitations still but had gotten good enough that a talented sound designer could coax out some convincing timbres it was just real enough that you could take it seriously as music but not so much that it didnt still bear some character owing to the platforms technical boundaries ironically a perfect orchestral recording seems almost lifeless in its sameness and lack of identifiable origin where a good rompler has a kind of warmth and sheen to it that is such a pleasure to listen to i wish they had composed a synthesized soundtrack reminiscent of the roland jvxv or korg wavestation it would really i wasnt going to watch this out of fear of spoilers glad i at least clicked the video to check for some music without context excellent video i love the music in this game maybe a little bit more than im enjoying my playthrough so far but still this game at least sounds so much like a classic jrpg the scoring is so melodic that my girlfriend heard that battle song loop once and was already humming along with it only thing i really have to disagree on is that alfyn is pretty darn close but hes not best boy your channel is begging for a nier automata video check out the persona soundtracks those are some of my all time favorites another fantastic video on a game i too am thoroughly enjoying and the music is just so great im guessing based on your footage and your thumbnail that you started with tressa as your protagonist i started ophilia which i guess is the standard start and went the standard order tressa is definitely one of my favorites though one other studio has been doing the same thing for more than a decade falcom ever since yuzo koshiro and others started their composition work in the 1980s falcom had an immense backlog of their own retro music and with new composers coming in which themselves were fans of this works made the later music that called back to those tunes like listen to composition of ys1s overworld theme from its original pc8801 all the way to the pc remakes with different composers throughly recognizing the core elements of the retro music and turning it into retromodern in the same way you described octopaths music all the later falcom games put the melody and bass first just so that the memorability factor of the tune strikes to the player first youll naturally start hummingwhistling a tune after you close a ys or trails game another amazing video once again you helped me appreciate video game music even more thank you did you just say alfyn is best boy careful you can just say that shit on the internet 10 seconds in and im already blown away by your editing holy smokes amazing as always and that breakdown of the main theme in the end was top notch if some of your next videos ask for a thing in the same vein dont hesitate to go into a more indepth music theory mode a composer sought to recreate the feel of classic videogamerpg music thats brilliant you always choose such beautiful games and music to showcase for us mathew its a gift id love to hear you talk about keiichi okabe ow man your videos keep making me tear up being a very auditory person sucks if you have a strong emotional response to music haha d but seriously absolutely awesome video mate now i need to get octopath d for a while i was conviced that the composer for octopath was the same as brave exvius until i looked into it your explanation about how they compose explained why their two styles are so similar great video as always the fact that watching this and hearing ocotopaths music at some point got me choked up is exemplary of how much of an excellent job nishiki did with this beast of an ost you know how you gave us chills with wind song yeah i felt that twice with octopaths main theme its fantastic and learning about the creation and limitations of these songs is simply amazing really makes you appreciate video game music far beyond just background tunes i really really hope octopath traveler is the start of a new trend i want to see more games that reimagine old genres this well thank you for this video thanks for your time and your work judging from the thumbnail and how often tressa was leading your parties i bet you started with her too a man of good taste i see 3 but anyway i was so excited to see this video in my sub box while i havent finished it yet this game quickly became one of my favorites in a very long time which has a lot to do with the music and general atmosphere of the game once again you prove yourself worthy of being one of my favorite channels wonderful analysis i will wait for a video about starbound amazing video i was already considering buying octopath traveler but now im convinced its on my wish list now im still amazed that your channel only has 39 thousand subscribers you deserve more fuck i need a switch the chronotrigger song sent me the shivers up to my spine even thought i didnt play chronotrigger and i love the description of this video theres like evrything imma be honest i only clicked because my girl tressa is on the thumbnail slap the most adorable character on there and boom you got my view i super loved watching this video i cant wait to get a hold of this game it looks and sounds so lovely thanks for another awesome video d completely agree with the idea of technical and compositional limitations as a way to deliver the memorability of game tracks in a way i do not think i could have the same nostalgic hit i would get from a remade orchestral version of ff6 as i would from the originals simpler tracks i think the complexity hinders what the mind has to do to fill in the rest and thus have a stronger imprint on memory i suppose thats why chiptunes are so popular or why some people like using the soundbanks of a console to compose their tracks they have an inherent simplicity that pushes the composer to overcome them while working within the boundaries imposed i am curious if you have ever listened to the follins brothers work on snes games they were known more than any other of the best composers for the snes to push the hardware limits to impossible heights they composed plok and spiderman and xmen in arcades revenge i strongly recommend taking a listen to the gambit theme and ploks finally another men of culture who thinks that alfyn is the best boy amazing quality videos hope you get much more subs i instantly like flamesgrace theme the first time i heard it the first part with beautiful piano melodies then transition into more grand with celloor violin then turned into slow piano solo and then the violin part kicks in it feel very calming havent played the game yet but i really want to yasunori nishiki does a phenomenal job with this games score so many great pieces and character themes edit omg i love that you cited noriyasu agematsu good video although i dont really like the classic old turnbased battle im convinced now to at least listen to the soundtrack alfyn isnt best boi youre best boi you had the smugness to say yeah just like that but damn it you werent wrong oh my gosh thank you for this vid you are one of my favourite youtubers aha i knew the victory fanfare was familiar brilliant video this has to be your best editing yet totally agreed octopath has easily become one of my new alltime favorite soundtracks really fantastic vid i thought that was really interesting would agree that this is one of the best soundtracks to come out for a long while a stark contrast to the rather subtle almost absent soundtrack for much of breath of the wild although a very clever one thanks great video this game actually inspired me to create a cover album on various themes from the game including all 8 character themes what ive got done so far is on my channel if youre interested in checking it out really good video working on a little game myself and need to makewrite my own music which i have close to no experience in so these videos are quite helpful and fun to watch i must add great video as usual d do you think theres anything to break down in the music of hollow knight aside from the fact that its obviously great and chris larkin is awesome much like bravely default this composer did good to make game music what a score this channel is one of my favorites thanks for all the incredible content ahhh the sax no wonder the trailers convinced me to start with alfyn spectacular game with incredible music and unpacked brilliantly as always man you know ive never noticed how easily recognizable the melodies of these pieces were i was so engaged in the game and reliving my childhood i never noticed how the songs were made i think they did an excellent job on doing what they were trying achieve amazing as always you totally captured my feelings this is an incredible video about octopaths music simply amazing thank you very much i was hoping you were gonna make a video on this games ost i really love this game and the music especially the cliftlands and cyrus theme also who is your favorite character that game looks like some minecraft shader yes ive been looking forward to this since you responded to my one tweet great video ive read interviews with composers talking about the limitations of those old consoles pushing them towards making music with really strong melodies i was actually hoping youd talk about it but i wasnt sure if the topic had enough material for a whole video but i guess octopath traveler proved me wrong ahhhh i always love the musical breakdowns and the octopath main theme was no exception 3 i love how you break out the staffs its so great how you dont just present your argument for the purpose of the soundtrack but you present the real evidence that supports those claims it adds determination and authenticity to the essay it reminds me of lessons from the screenplay that uses the script to prove its points very good practice for this type of review your point about the composer focusing on the melody first really drives home why octopath sounds like such classic video game music ffxvs ost is a great example of how a composer can just overdo it so many tracks have a full orchestra going and the sound is so complex that it becomes a forgettable mess great video this is a great analysis of this games amazing soundtrack i agree with the point that a full orchestra tends to feel like too muchi think the most memorable example of that for me zelda skyward swords soundtrack which feels overcrowded to me in a lot of tracks enchanted sword rare drop from the guard named alphas on the left of the purple chest outside ravus manor the sword has 464 attack is this only available in the demo got it finally i was starting to lose hope stealing over and over thank you took me 35 mins of being pissed to get this lol thanks man finally got it after wasting 20 mins i closed the game from the home screen and rebooted the game then got it on my 56 try gotta be level 25 to challenge her now smh i got the axe in one try idk how i tried stealing the weaker axe first and tried twice with no success then i decided to go for the golden axe just for fun and i got it the first try damn im lucky laughing hyena capture monster has the best attack for her in the game in the beginning took her out with 1 attack from hyena at 3 stars on 3rd turn it also took off 2000 damage in therions story against the servant i had a 3 chance to steal with with a level 32 therion i saved before hand thinking i was going to have to reset my game many times but got it in the first theft lol i celebrated i never knew that you have to raise the characters level for their path action to take a chance interesting where is your characters level at the moment let me guess level 99 with their path action at level 99 omg lol you know what it is weird when i was rebooting the game i came across this error code i thought my game was corrupted but its fine but short story i rebooted the game a second time after 3 tries on my fourth try i got the golden axe on my second reboot of reloading the game i am so happy and excited i cant wait to test it out right now i dont want to start over again on my game after this moment of getting a powerful weapon im just going to keep on truckin on my game oh thats easy just save scum until you get lucky i always abuse that feature so i dont pay the risk however it does get tedious after awhile can we get the golden axe in the game and not the demo this has turned into a grind update it finally worked i had all characters and was about to start all the chapter 2s when i saw this video level 25 cyrus and olberic level 16 therion and 21 tressa is this only in the demo i just figure out your channellittle late to see this tutorial mode to get weapons and armors easy because just get many items doing this above couple of hours ago today but doesnt mean this weapons is uselessty for share all this tips with us im my game says that i have to be in level 25 to be able to provoke her i also got it on my second attempt i luckily did this naturally before this video on my first attempt too alfyn using this axe with last resort is game over took about 15 mins to get the axe only had haanit and therion howd you get it on try 2 i am level 25 in the game so is it still worth it after you beat the woman in front of the house leave the town to the left and exit to title an autosave will have formed upon exiting the town load the autosave and youll be much closer than if you load from the save point to the far right it helps save a lot of time due to the much lower walking distance you can use this in any town as long as there are exits nearby the person youre trying to steal from thanks just got it while grinding to lvl 12 killing mobs i may be false but if the enemys shield is broken it doesnt matter if you attack with the weakness those are only there to break him got it on my 4th attempt wow before that i got the commemorative coin from an npc in sunshade tavern on my first try which had 3 chance of being stolen as well hahaha lucky me and then you save scum all over again when you get to grandport anamana just reached this area after maining olberic got hannit and therion why is the challenge and provoke crossed cant get over the lady blocking the door need help i literally saw the 3 chance and said fuck it and tried it once and got it lol if i started as therion can this still be done if i get hannit second the fastest i got the golden axe was 55 minutes and 20 seconds i did the speedrun on bubkub twitch if you want proof ffs second try damn bro im still trying 3 yeah right holy fuck i got it on my sixth try thanks for the great video im currently playing the game its out now of course and i have loved rpgs since i was a kid in the 90s im about 25 hours into olberics story and if anyone has any doubts or questions to whether or not its worth the price tag hit me up id love to talk about how good this game is again thank you very much for your great content lol its hard to many reset theres also a forbidden dagger in still snow although not true not everything is 100 to steal in his town got it on my 3rd try lol i am trying to get that axe for 1 hours with quit and load method and still didnt get that so frustrating mine does not work after beating the grandchild i get in the house and just see that oldman sleeping on his bad i cannot interact with him are there any prerequisites must be done in order to do this i have haanit theriod and alfyn in my party very nice now i have a question for you are gonna do one with a good spot to level up earlier up in the game or s spot to get good jp spots do npcs recover from provokechallenge battles awesome tip just got it today am i screwed if i did alfyns story before thank you about to do this now great video im definitely going to get that on my main save file when the game comes out i was also wondering if at some point you can make a somewhat indepth video on alfyns concoct ability and how it works ive come across some people with questions and itd be really easy to just refer them to one of your videos a bit much explanation but that may be great for all that are new to this game maybe a tldw would be helpful anyway thank you a lot for showing where to find that axe very helpful please dont exclusive japan region only going to buy switch on the holidays just because of this game when is this coming clasic turn base batlle i like it and the grafik is so nice just port octopath traveller to mobile already i have it on the switch but i will be finishing the game on my s10 so phone version will be gacha game fake looks to high quality though i would perfer this on the switch id still play this on my phone when or if it comes to the us will it come out for apple arcade please come out in the us movement i hope its a joke aprils fool is near i love octopath but fuck mobile games make it have premium price plssss no microtransaction i prefer this on switch just as i started playing octopath traveler lol this isnt the switch game its a free to play prequel game for mobile tired of this shitty clickbait stuff im so excited is this fake i want learn japanese because of this ugh so a ps4 version of the original octopath traveller will eventually come looks amazing thanks for upload why cant switch have more zelda botw type first party games tired of all the retro looking bullshit dont care what anyone says i dislike this games visuals appealing yes immersive hell no its impossible to feel immersed in this games world unlike the square games of yore since the storybookdiorama style is a constant detriment to your suspension of disbelief each character gets a powerful story and experience a subtle issue in life we can all relate to the way they are connected is strong enough to make the game enjoyable the plot is thickened just like avengers a cast of heroes from completely different lifedecisionspathetc just to give an example im halfway through it now this is the only pure turn based rpg no quick time events etc outside of pokemon that i have been able to get through final fantasy games are so boring to me with the easy spam a tactics and the repetitive grinding this combat makes you think the whole time the stories are all really interesting and while its not easy if you do everything theres no grinding i am using a guide for sidequests and a checklist for side dungeons though which helps a lot man if i had time to play this i would love the feel of the rpg classics like ffximaybe someday ill get back in this genre again a great objective review an rpg without a big emphasis on story will always be lacking makes you less keen on investing the time this needs to come to pc story is paramount in this kind of games i guess ill pass good writers need to come back to se at least do some contract hiring like bringing back yasumi matsuno for a new rpg or masato kato im getting to the point where im starting to really feel like im missing out by not having a switch solid review as per the usual good review ign should totally steal it and plagiarize this ill let them know maybe they will come here and take it and pretend they wrote it its really a good review wish it was for pc we need more retro rpgs while i appreciate its offerings but whats an rpg without a good story easy allies is my new reference for game reviews what a great fucking game seeing the score for this and beating ni no kuni 2 i can definitely say you rated nnk2 way too high ill be interested in the atrocity of rating dq 11 lower than nnk2 if that happens 80i see what you did there why are there russian captions jw as a person who started and stopped playing rpgs during the 16 bit era i love the art style and the lighting effects look fantastic game looks awesome im glad turnbased rpgs are still making a presence yeaaaaa was waiting for this already boought but didnt start to play yet really nice and fair review ben your explanation of the bp system was the most economical use of words ive ever seen in a review fair score the terrible stories and repetitive dungeons there isnt even one interesting dungeon in this game brings it down not watching the review until i complete the game but im 86 hours in have 10 chapters left and then plan to dive into the post game wrapup i get that the stories may be shallow but i think thats ultimately to its benefit as someone who prioritizes story over all else i am tired of convoluted adult stories that are really more pretentious than anything else presentation is everything and this games worldcharacters have enthralled me beyond anything in recent memory for all the lack of flash and style and objectively when pitted against classics like chrono trigger or final fantasy vi the stories are at least on par in terms of shallowness its magical and whimsical and poignant at the same time not for being some mastercraft of modern day prophetic warning of social controversy but for being a beautiful simple adventure i cant fault the story for anything i think its a breath of fresh air to not have to learn latin or entire i no mention whatsoever of the soundtrack the game has some issues yeah the combat is really fun though and if theres one thing that the game truly excels at its the music one of the best soundtracks ever 000 that very first note and the pause afterwards had me so confused thought for sure it was the orchestral arrangement of gsc route 3 they use in the intros to a lot of the pokemon movies edit this one httpsyoutubeszvnnl3pgxy they use a filming technique called tilt shift thats why its out of focus on the edges guys have you discussed making an retro games review series it would be amazing lol the best octopath review so far by far so many haanit starters anyone primrose starter here 810 too many characters ign octopath has such boring stories lazy graphics and piss poor level design that the only thing i looked forward to was the random encounters and the inevitable boss fight at the end of every dungeon youd think for a game designed around 8 stories they would at least make it interesting but instead it felt like you were repeating the same actions 8 times with some different cutscenes attached remember that time that bravely default made you redo awakening the crystal events 4 times this is the same shit but for an entire game and i agree with the score mostly id personally be a bit higher but theres plenty of things that keep this game from being perfect the main issue for me was the lack of meaningful interactions between characters just seemed odd to spend dozens of hours with people who barely ever talked overall thoughcombatmusicjust stellar so glad this game exists great review thanks i love this game one of my favorite aspects of the job system is that any support skill learned remains with your character even when you change out that job that allows you to do something like make olberic a merchant for a few moments unlock sp saver and switch it out to make up for his low magic points just one of so many examples ok easy allies how is the extremely souless flawed nino kuni 2 a 95 and octopath 80 makes no sense octopath is atleast 10 times better than ni no kuni 2 octopath is not perfect but so much better than nino kuni 28 years of rpg experience guy is wondering imagine a xenogears remaster in this style i would buy that in a heartbeat i was looking forward to this game forever but sadly it lost my attention about 25 hours in i was supremely bummed out one of those jrpg ill get half off on sale a few months from now just wait for dqxi much better than dunkeys review like the words of the review but dont agree with the number a 9 for me as the summary wrapped up i said aloud sounds like an 80 review to me i love when the review talking points match up well with the final score assessment i know number ratings arent everyones cup of tea but too often at other outlets the text and score dont align at all its a difficult task for sure which is why i applaud the reviewer here lol i dont know if its a good thing or a bad thing that i watch you guys so much i can guess your score like a minute before u give it lol nice video as usual swimming in sevoh snap i love the aesthetics and the music but im all about story when it comes to rpgs so im definitely passing on it maybe if it goes on sale ill rethink it i have been playing around in ue4 to make a similar effect and people would say i ripped this off now p with its sales its safe to bet a more serious job on story and direction will be in for the sequel or just whatever follows in the same formula i look forward to that day hopefully they increase the font size

than 8 jobs solid review ben i respect that you gave a game an 80 that you love so much it shows a level of objectivity i agree with everything you said in your review and appreciate the absence of spoilers this game is ugly i dont see the appeal i found myself just staring at how amazing the enemy and boss sprites were any moment they were on screen guys anyone who loved this games combat system should try radiant historia as well as romancing saga 2 having read through the comments i wonder if great rpg stories are getting harder for squareenix especially but not only to achieve ff15 was not celebrated in mass for its great story the last rpg i can think of is mass effect 2 or maybe even 3 if ignoring the final 20mins where the story was generally well received its hard to purchase this game knowing the story isnt firing on all cylinders im so hungry for a good story i really wish this had knocked it out the park i dont care about intertwining stories but the fact that they followed a repeating pattern and none of the stories were that good this hurts the most to hear im still going to buy it eventually but for now i have more tempting gems in my backlog im working through great review ea best reviews on the net i really enjoyed this game i think 8 is a reasonable score the combats gameplay loop is really great and customizing party with different classes brings out creativity runelord tressa is the best you can cheese even the final secret boss with transfer rune sidestep being able to equip support skills even if you are not in that class brings out diversity in builds however i feel like there is very little post game content which could have made this game truly amazing after the final boss you are really just playing to get huge damage numbers and capturing level 10 beast with haanit i have been waiting for this review after how disappointed i was with bravely defaults repetitive nature i expected as much on this new project the review is just how i imagine the game to go 80 is just fitting best reviewernarrator for reviews my main problem with the game so far is that the unique actions arent unique i can either guide or allure challenge or provoke scrutinize or ask and steal or collect because of this split it can become very easy to select who to switch out with the only one i ever worried about was theriontressa with tressa being my main protagonist that became an easy choice if this game was a ps4 exclusive would get a better score nino kui and the last guardian are 8 and 7 respectively also octopath improves some of the problems that the beloved persona 5 has like the fact that i have to go menus to see the weakness of the monster or the saving points that forced me to play for almost 2 hours without saving or the endless conversations between characters the game wouldnt be half as charming if it wasnt presented this way yo ben your writing seems to get better and better with every review you nailed this one major kudos people saying this game lacks identity personality or charm are seriously weirding me out but well not my loss in that regard the game reminds of the dq series with its simplistic approach to story telling and just being straightforward i loved the structure of the game and the only thing they have to change is having slightly more natural character interactions no grinding for the regular chapters with each character maybe you have to grind for some postgame stuff which i would hardly hold against the game no gold farming for gear game gives you options to avoid everything to a good extend so yeah more of this se please personally i would give it a 910 so far still have postgame stuff to do though 427 eyy its a mario and luigi never had or been interested in owning a switch but this looks like the one game on the platform id actually like to play cheers for this review youve given me something to think abut here great review final score could be a bit higher thx that theme song it says get ready for an adventure that spoiler mode plug made me so happy you guys are pretty bad at plugging your patreon and this one was one of the best plugs ive seen yet hope you do spoiler modes for all games and plug them at the end of reviews like this in the future does anyone else dislike the art style its this rough 16bit aesthetic with a ps1 era 25d presentation very jarring they dont go together for me around 93 when more and more i understand how this game work it more enjoyable for me i doing post game right now it not dissapoint me what the game give it to me for my point this game is not hero save the world but everyone build the world every path of character in this game is build the world not just 8 but every story character in this game is important and beautiful to make the world interesting having just completed the game today i can say that i wish there was more its great when an rpg leaves you wanting more especially after my 100 or so hours spent but the games story feelswell it feels like its missing that 3rd act considering how traditional it is in its jrpg tropes im surprised there wasnt some big twist at the end the game just kind of ends sure theres a special dungeon but i had no idea it was even there until i looked it up only available after the game is done and when certain side quests are complete i just cant deal with the combat the initial prototype demo had me really excited but after playing the allotted three hour demo that followed suit i was completely turned off from the game i felt like i had already seen everything the game had to offer in such a small amount of time the characters and their stories were shallow the chapters formulaic and the world layout felt really linear the game seriously lacks any kind of identity outside of its aesthetics well videogamedunkey says this game sucks hes obviously an expert and game design scholar so an 80 get real sarcasm we tend to be more forgiving for nintendo games simply because they are incredibly fun and addictive octopath is not the exception i really love the game but then when i start comparing it with other titles that deserve a 10 in my book i start realizing its flaws most critics are afraid of revealing nintendo games flaws but a 80 is a perfect score for a good game not a masterpiece as some other people may want you to believe i dont mind the stories intersecting in terms of content for instance if the villian for one of the travelers story had been a hero or mentor of anothers i think that may have been cool but i actually prefer that the characters themselves remain separate the stories bleeding into each other would have felt less like 8 seperate paths to me and more like 1 path traveled by 8 different characters great review but i wish you guys had done a better job of not referring to pixels as old while they may be an older style its just s style nonetheless and its a style that stokes the users imagination more than the hyperrealism inmodern games and thats why many gamers have a stronger attachment to pixel art than to hyper realistic art anytime a work of art asks you to use your imagination you fill in the details with what you want and it becomes yours this is why books are often more satisfying than movies why people have such deep and personal love of comic book characters and why so many people have a deeper affection for early ff games than the hyper realistic modern ones if anyone has a game like this to recommend on ps4 xbox or pc shoot damn that soundtrack is excellent tis game looks beautiful you are the gt reviewer nice review waiting for it to go on sale not worth 60 its a little late but im fine with it any reason why o this game is good but in some ways its a downgrade of ffv started it and i have it on hold for a little bit wanted to have another go at twilight princess for some reason wanted to love it but bosses can be cheap and damage sponges that along with the fomulaic progression takes a bit of the soul out the experience i wish i could be a patreon but alas life costs student loan debt isnt america great 3 you guys easy allies i at least watch your stuff without ad block so theres that i think that in the end i prioritize story and characters over the combat system to carry me through an rpg of course there are exceptions either way but i think that if the narrative just isnt there then ill eventually lose interest seems to apply only to turn based rpgs though since im down to play through most real time combat systems or action rpgs that require skill and and have some additional depth i think that in general ive lost patience with turn based rpgs or maybe its always been that way since ive used the fast forward button on snes emulators for as long as i can remember i hope that as things move forward increasing battle speed skipping animations and fast forward buttons become the norm glad fire emblem games have had that for quite some time the narrative weaknesses of this one sound like a bit of a turnoff unfortunately although primroses intro was pretty compelling still bought the game but might give it some time before i get around to i honestly the shallowish stories didnt bother as much because its amazing battle mechanics come first story second if this were a movie or book id agree with the review morebut as it is this game is a 9 to 94 to me good review easy allies thanks that music oh my we need more fresh takes on the classic turnbased rpg system like this hopefully we wont have to wait years for another i know damiani was the one who reviewed ni no kuni 2 but to me this game is a much better jrpg than that game which got an 95 from eza either way i see why the story and structure of this game may not be for everyone but personally neither of those things mattered to me because unlike with nn2 i instantly fell in love with the characters and their different approaches to battles the game is always the right amount of challanging and doesnt hold your hand you start the game and immediately go out in the world play with whoever you want play their story or find other travelers to me that was such a refreshing beginning for a long jrpg maybe the end game will get tiresome but that is the beauty of the game you dont have to rush and you dont have to complete everyones story you can focus on the characters you are most invested in and see their stories to the end the devs gave you that freedom i always found people saying this is the successor to ff6 to be very odd as its structured much more like a saga game still this was a great review from ben and an 8 i feel is pretty much the perfect score for it totally fair score outstanding combat and fun job system with less than stellar dialog and storytelling i was disappointed in the lack of interactions sure you have the small chats after a cutscene during a chapter but theres no combat banter and every chapter treats the party as if it doesnt exist every chapter felt isolated it didnt really feel like you were a group of friends or allies going on a journey bet how many comments will include their own personal numerical score closest guess wins a but boi i havent gotten too far but im liking this game quite a bit id rank it at a 75 right now im also very happy its doing this well the success will hopefully open the door to a sequel that fixes the short comings of this one its my game of the year hands down so far man i could listen to you read the phone book 8 is perfect fun game but has some problems god damn joness voice is the official voice of video game trailers woo doggie a souless rpgi play rpgs for the characters and over arching grand storylinesthe pacing is soo off in this game when u have to go and do essentially companion quests here and there with no real character interactions with giving a dam fragmented by choice but it was not a move that payed offalso the job class makes anyone with ocd waste soo much time in this game ohh i got to steal from this person buy from this personcatch monster with this personcharm this personetc etc sigh ive played better jrpgs 15 years ago the story here seems extremely split some love it and some hate it i wish they intertwined more but i just have some sort of joy seeing these characters interact and move through their respective themes tones settings and environment and how they interact they arent particularly deep but the way they clash so well with one another can 9 times out of ten create a funny heart wrenching heartwarming or dramatic scene and shift those at the drop of a dime and itll work well but yes the combat is the most outstanding thing here and the story catalyzes it well or maybe im just biased because i really love this kind of game the moment i got my second character i began to worry that nothing would ever connect and they dont as a fan of class rpgs like the final fantasys of olde and turn based rpgs as a whole i also dont find the combat to be remarkable at all the game is just a grind fest for the sake of being a grind fest i had such high hopes after the demo dropped in september but in the end its easily one of the worst rpgs ive ever played and i played final fantasy xiii a solid 40 for me plus the side quest are all awful 80 for 8 min octopath review video i see what you did there p ive been waiting for your review ben and i dont even have a switch i love nintendo but not giving the allies a review copy is lame they should get the first damn copy thanks for powering through ben easyallies need to stop hyping up these mediocre nintendo games they talked about octopath like it will be the second coming it gets an 8 lol probably it is lower than that we know ben overrates japanese and especially nintendo games yet nobody at eza talked about gow and it got a 10 destroyed all the reviews and sales where was the gow hype gow to octopath discussion on eza shows is 15 yet one is a 10 and the other an 8 lol nintendoallies at it again thank you guys for not giving up on this review i really appreciate all the hard work you guys do to always get a review out to us even though i bought this day one anyway lol great review ben and very much agree with the 8 you gave it love and respect allies 90 for me just so fun i find myself craving it great review 60 hours in and i would say a 9 for me which is unexpected the combat is too good i like that there are 8 individual stories i play so many games and when someone tries something different it usually is better at keeping my interest when i first initially saw the trailers to this game i was like take my money already this is now my new favorite jrpg surpassing ff6 fortnite engine cringe i wish they did something like this with a final fantasy tactics remake or sequel that game felt a bit weird to me on the ps1 similar to how this game looks but most 3d games with sprite characters did too mostly because the 3d tried so hard looking like it was flat 2d like from a cartoon or drawing no wonder this channel isnt verified they named the title of the video that in order to demonstrate the versatility and potential of unreal engine 4 df recognized how a game harkening back to 90s jrpgs can run flawlessly on the same engine that one of the most popular 3rd person shooter and open world games is powered by viewers who never would have imagined that two completely different titles run with the exact same engine would then be enticed to understand what makes ue4 such a captivating engine not only that but potential future game developers watching this video would be inspired to make a game on the engine or even a new game engine all by itself honestly when you take a moment to observe this through a distance its quite remarkable how much gaming and technology have progressed in these past few decades were now playing 16bit jrpg games with the same fidelity as a massive open world battlefield both running with the same base the same engine it almost feels surreal in a way like were living enough people have commented on the clickbaity nature of calling it the fortnite engine worse than that imo is the fact that calling it the fortnite engine is an insult to digital foundrys viewers youd think that theyd know their audience is savvy enough to know whats up this is an insult to our intelligence 2d 16bit in 720p30fps oracle must gangbang great review fornite engine huh its unreal engine 4 not an engine specific to fortnite in any way tons of games use ue4 and have used it since way before fortnite even if you ignore all the fancy particle effects and 3d stuff i feel like these sprites are a little too detailed to be 16bit its sad reading the comments that all kids seem to care about these days is frame rate and resolution just shut up and play the game it looks beautiful playing games because they are 4k and 60fps is playing games for the wrong reasons sometimes unreal engine 4 lol no oh xenogears is a masterpiece that game was so good come on guys we wouldve watched the video regardless this is how octopath traveler runs its great for what it is but im worried about dragon quest xi i feel like itll either look like shit or run like shit been playing through this and the subnative handheld resolution is really noticeable the title screen graphics are rendered at 720p and are eyeblisteringly beautiful enter the game and everything becomes quite soft besides ui cmon square i wish square enix would make final fantasy xvi with this style look at all the butt hurt kids raging about the fortnite engine title lmao i would compare the graphics to ragnarok online please dont call unreal engine 4 the fortnite engine you just had to get fortnight into the title huh would absolutely love to see this game running on current consoles with hdr would look stunning and id be able to play it lol makes me even more excited for the last night ocopath and other m 2 games that make a great point of how games can be hi end and low end all at the same time we neeed far more of this disapointing sq didnt 1080p the docked mode and 60fps should be easy fortnite engine inhales boi the game is fun buy is this ugly game not running on the max resolution unfunny engine 4 can yall chill the f out maybe its a bit diminishing to refer to ue4 as the fortnite engine but at the same time whats wrong with giving an example of a modern game that is wildly popular to compare what the engine is capable of it guarantees that the viewer knows a tangible example of a game that runs on ue4 and has some idea of what it can do yea its a bit clickbaity but it also serves to illustrate a point to an audience that may not know a whole lot on the subject matter i love the design of bit game in modern era its like how kids of the past era envisions video games in the future i love this games 25d16bit art style dude literally all you talked about through the whole review was the graphics performance and nothing about the actual game itself epic fail bringing another battle royal shooter into the title when discussing a well made passion project 2d jrpg just for views anyone else disliked because they said fortnite engine games like this are exactly why the switch is now the number 2 selling consoles globally and rightly so uncompromised 4k and playing old games you already have on your old consoles doesnt attract gamers take note microoft does anybody know if theres any chance this is coming to other consoles please do not call the unreal engine the fortnite engine please dont maybe theyre just trying to be funny 98 comment fornite engine 900 dislikes because of a title smh just click off if you dont like it i think it looks more like 32 bit jrpgs like final fantasy tactics and tactics ogre okay continued watching sorry also i personally think xenogears is better than any ff game on psone octopath traveler reminds me heavily of paper mario unlike because of the clickbait title the game is great tho one of the best jrpgs ive played in the last 20 years you guys have more class than that df rename this video based on the actual name of the engine please this is what pokemon should have started looking like not this cartoony feel for 3 year olds this game looks beautiful best review i have watched good thing i bought the wayfarers edition im a new subscriber from philippines i keep scrolling past this video in my recommended and the clickbait title makes me cringe every time really fortnite engine wtf guys dislike god i wish the 3ds could render this game cause this game would look so beautiful in 3d the sense of depth on a regular tv is already amazing this would definitely be one of the 3d standouts if the 3ds could display this properly what is mega drive never heard of it are you guys seriously resorting to clickbait titles now youre better than this i think this game looks really ugly i love the 2d sprites but no matter how many awesome effects is put in it just looks incredibly ugly to me so much so that i wont buy it no matter how much the gameplay apeals to me this game is ass i honestly would love to see final fantasy 4 5 6 remade in this style wow that looks awesome why would anyone enjoy playing a game that blurs 75 of the screen its unreal 4 engine change the fucking title fortnite engine are you serious whats the problem with calling it just unreal engine 4 ue4 wasnt made just for fortnite you know just because its the most hyped and overrated game that doesnt mean you have to clickbait this desperately just for some extra views on a game that is nowhere similar to fortnite except for the engine its using if theres one thing i absolutely cant stand its seeing this overrated piece of crap game and its name on every video i click on sorry but for scummy actions like these i have to dislike the video you guys do great stuff but please next time you better not put this overrated game in your video title just for clickbait when you are looking at games that arent fortnite octopath traveler for life guess what df will release videos of arkham knight arkham asylum and any other batman game on fortnite engine i really was considering subscribing to df patreon but the kind of clickbait title this one has just put me off for some reason its an odd reason but i find predatory marketing terms very off putting i mean do you want people to click on your link because theyre excited that df is making a tech video again or you you want to stoop to the level of riding the hype of fortnite to get people here wow this looks so cool amazing game as an old rpg player that truly loves final fantasy vi im really loving it damn people care about the title way too much if theyed have put octopath on 3ds i wud have got it lol well at least i still got fire emblem awakening to play the resolution and frame rate are both kind of disappointing i mean i think that this game is one of the best looking games in the last 10 years just due to how good the art style is but this is a pretty simplistic game in terms when you get down to it and yet it cant even hit a full 1080p or 60fps now that i have a switch im hard pressed to get this game but there is also xenoblade 2 splatoon 2 hyrule warriors disgaea 5 and so much more just bought botw too after beating smo leaving post game for later say between this and xenoblade 2 which do you guys recommend dislike and unsubscribe beacause of fortnite engine instead of unreal octopath traveler goty this looks and runs worse than the original lol another 30fps unreal 4 game with framepacing issues on the switch typical digital foundry comment section yes the title is total cringe but do all of the comments need to draw attention to the absolutely obvious anyway holy crap this game is beautiful the fact that all of the characters actually cast shadows and the other water and lighting effects are incredible final fantasy v and vi remake in this engine now please this fortnite engine thing will be a meme from now on like igns too much water dislike for the fortnight engine and the fortnight in the youtube gaming tag please df thought you were better then this the most glorified 2d trash valued at 60 cuz nintendoooo man do i dislike for the clickbaity shit or upvote for the octopath coverage looks like a game that would have been perfect on the sega saturn ue4 might be epic games engine but calling it a fortnite engine is a plain attempt at clickbait god i miss those days when you couldnt make money on youtube is it me or is df struggling to find stuff to talk about kind of interesting that a game with such relatively simple graphics is having trouble running on the homeconsoleonthego switch 720p and 576p for dock and portable mode respectively i was disappointed by the flicker on geometry edges due to the cheapnonexistent antialiasing and thought se were being idiots again but looking at the resolution i now understand why do want pc port need disliked the video for clickbait title octopath is a good game though shows fortinite for 10 seconds entire video is flagged as fortnite gameplay change this title please disrespect appreciate the concept underwhelmed by the final product also nice fortnite clickbait embarrassing clickbait title every comment is about fortnite engine clickbait boo i just cant find any interest for this game i am a big rpg fan but this game is just hideous to me i like the effect style but the spriting itself is so old fashioned and ugly to me and the sepia tone filter makes the game so monotonous please take the fortnite clickbait out of the title its the fing unreal engine 4 give the credit to those who deserve it instead of the stupid money printing machine that destroyed the original game that vignette is awful i noticed japanese major games these gen have a problem with framepacing i wonder why xenogears my love octopath traveler fortnite fight me the title is insulting unreal engine fourtnite 4 great analysis but fortnite engine lol and thats because i like fortnite this looks more like dragon quest vii than xenogears imo this is what i would imagine would be on the nintendo playstation thumbs down for clickbait title and irrelevant speculation about what if these effects were available in the 90s xenogears was a kick in the balls for me ugly to my eyes compared to the full 2d 16bit stuff i was used to i didnt understand why they were so excited about ugly rotatable pixelated polygons i was sad to see octopath ape that style but it certainly comes off much more beautifully and more akin to full 2d stuff writing fortnite on the title unnecessarily for them clicks eh shame on you lol what about grandia unreal engine 4 fortnite engine its not all about the visuals and frame rate with the switch there is a massive variety of games its the only platform where i have at last really progressed on skyrim thanks to the portability tone down the blinding bloom and the blur and it would look great but as it is now is horrible exclusives matter take note stupid microsoft is it just me or is this game full of godrays and blur fortnite engine dont insult octopath traveler please its uengine fortnite engine really i thought yall were professional i hope that they release a patch for 1080p dock and 720p portable that would be neat love the game though i come to this channel for analysis from people with insight and integrity not herp derp fortnite culture what are you gonna do next tell us how crackdown 3 utilizes the superbowl and kim kardashian disappointed that this game is 30fps 65 for this shit im sure at this point more people are familiar with fortnite than unreal engine 4 or even source just say unreal engine 4 kind of a new low for a tech analysis channel to call an engine by the name of its current popular game instead of its real name fortnite engine plenty of people here making fun or being cynical about it but youre doing gods work getting as many of the chitlins possible interested in a decent game like octopath and here i thought this was a serious channel but with that clickbait title of fortnite engine you lost me is disrespectful to the viewers of this channel who already know a lot about gaming i assume and to this great game that doesnt need any clickbait insert popular game in the title for views just disappointing pathetic and intellectually offensive comment section missing the joke says what welcome one and all to the comment section that lies just beneath the path travelled by the joke contained in the title only if i had a switch that art style is orgasmic this game is a masterpiece but please please change the title it is not only disrespectful to epic games but to all developers that use such a powerful versatile tool that is unreal engine 4 highly disappointed in this please just call it ue4 and not fortnite engine lol what a lame clickbait for the ignorants i like how all the comments are about the title and not the actual video lol why the hell would you say fortnite engine instead of unreal engine 4 if you wanna attract people who dont understand engines then those people wont understand your whole channel i know im going to live this on switch but cant help to think it would have been amazing on 3ds pc release when woooooooow digital foundry fortnite engine trying to get them clicks pretty pathetic psa never read the comments on a digital foundry video why are these videos all so looooong you have an extremely boring voice the fortnite engine gtfo if ffivv and vi are ever revisited using todays tech i hope it it built off of what we see here what a beautiful game i have zero interest in playing a jrpg but man i could watch this game for hours ff6 remake in this style would be perfect imagine how paper mario could be look with this graphics respect lost with that title choice gotta get fortnite in the title somehow unreal engine 4 isnt the fortnite engine its a good engine corrupted by fornites popularity not my kind of game so thumbs down better luck next time df my beloved 1632bit jrpgs were pixelated because of technological limitations not design choice but i still respect the work that went into this look even if i despise the look itself i was going to watch this but i changed my mind after seeing the full title im not going to support your clickbait df graphic whores always complaining abour nintendo switch games nothing new i enjoy games based on gameplay first and performance second in the past developers used various 2d techniques to replicate 3d effect but nowadays they use 3d effects to replicate the charm of the 2d pixel art style what a turn of events come to pc plz ye thats some blatant clickbait lol they turned down the textures to make it more 16 bit looking than ramped up the dynamic shadows lighting and reflections to the max the system could handle theres some reflections in this game that look absolutely breathtaking namely on tile floors they should have done secret of mana is this kind of style instead of that cheap bland uninspaired remake they did yes ue4 is the fortnite engine cause fortnite and ue property of epic games now you now that noobs guys please how is this clickbait its more agressiv marketing and every boost in viewership is good for the game that title youre better than this now a beautiful jrpg gamevideo is labeled as being a fortnite video on here shameful 720p eh it looks really nice but this and crash bandicoots low resolutions are very questionable to me 576p on a console that costs more than an xbox one and came out after it just lol at nintoddlers this is a really boring comment section 99 of the people are talking about the same thing can somebody put an original comment pleas lets not call ue4 the fortnite engine please its a hybrid jrpg for a hybrid console cool it was nice why would you sat fortnite engine ewwww i wish they bring it to the pc too i really hope square makes a final fantasy 6 remake in this style octopath battle royale i cant believe the desperation of this videos title when df clickbaited me hard lol great game tho do an analysis on the switch eshop the lag and frame drops are atrocious i absolutely love the look of this game gonna have to buy a switch now beautiful game i wish i like to play rpgs lots of blown out browns and greys that distract from the sprites more than flatter them give me xenogears or ffvi any day im suprised that everybody is loving this game but whats the hype all about this game looks similar to the remakes of the star ocean series in the psp fortnite engine im literally unsubbing because of that holy shit this game is amazing am i the only one dreamingwishing of a xenogears ue4 remake fo pcps4others style actually reminds me of ragnarok online 2d models on a 3d plane fortnite engine you mean ue4 the growing trend on youtube clickbait im disappointed they couldnt hit 720 in portable mode the iq looks pretty rough in my opinion 3d dot game heroes was a great zelda type game that updated a classic game visual style in a modern way good vid but that title come on df clickbait like that will lead you down a dark path like linustechtips i thought this game ran at 1080p at 60fps but it runs 720p at 30fps great game visuals mean very little to me but this game is great to look at art style resolution yet another game the pc cant run what is with the dislikes you dont have to imagine when tecnology advanced we had final fantasy ix when tecnology advanced again we got final fantasy xii and now we have final fantasy xv is not the same you said well then we have persona 5 and dragon quest xi perfect clasic turn based jrpgs that are not afraid of the tecnology and its principal apeal is not nostalgia im not against a version of ff7 remade in this 2dhd style however id like the world map and characterenemy models to be full 3d keeping retrostyle doesnt have to be advent children gfx at all honestly the postfx give me nausea after playing for a while and i end up having to boost colour contrast on tv i still wish there was an option to reduce the strength of the postfx effects absolutely awesome title guys gotta get them fortnite kiddies the thing to worry is if ot is a 720p docked and 576p 30 fps tittle when it is supposed to be just a modern 16 bits game which will be the final resolution and frames of dragon quest 11 could square enix having too much trouble making run a decent version of the downgraded ps4 one could dq11 too difficult to port to switch unless they decide to port the 3ds one not happening if they ever remake ff6 i want it to be done in this style just call it unreal 4 come on guys i understand what you tried to do familiarize the audience with what ue4 is currently being used for and comparing it to octopath but it really didnt work in that sense good preview though usually dont give two fucks about a click bait title but common guys your better then that just say the engine name from now on its not hard fortnite engine i honestly had to think about whether this was a joke video or not for the love of god this title is insulting have some selfrespect guys im sorry but i have to downvote for that i want quality content from you guys not that shit what looks deceptive is the light beams look like they come from the topleft of the screen yet the shadows suggest the light comes from the bottomleft of the screen dont call unreal engine 4 the fortnite engine just dont please man this game looks fantastic thanks for the analysis omg a mention of xenogears the game that needs a remake more than any other yeahyou should probably change fortnight engine to unreal 4 engine in the title for thisunless you people are that desperate for them easy clicks i hope it makes its way to pc and consoles later this game is amazing clicky baity baity this art style is so sumptuous it makes me want to buy a switch absolutely fucking gorgeous this is a sure contender for df retro years down the road lol clickbait really octopath traveler is the game we saw in our dreams of games of the future back in the 16bit era damn all these whiners just for a fucking title digital foundry really has the worst fanbase ever this analysis was awesome and i didnt click because it was written fortnite get a life kiddos the vignetting is definitely a killer for me also the lines on character and enemy sprites during battle but not as much as the vignetting looks like some kind of amateur game designer that uses filters to make their game look better like all of those fan creations on ue4 its annoying calling the engine based on a certain popular game doesnt automatically change the name edit it would sound more interesting if call it by its real name on the title wait what 720p are you shiting me 720 fucking p and at 30fps a game that looks like that runs at 720p 30fps pathetic and they expect me to pay them 60 for it no wonder squere enix is having a hard time porting dq 11 to that godforsaken tablet funny thing is all these nintendo fanboys are asking for a nier automata port on the switch and it cant even run shit like octopath at 1080p 30fps hahahaha octopaths graphics reminded me so much of xenogears that i instinctively tried to rotate the camera i cant believe this was built on the street fighter v dragon quest xi tekken 7 ffvii remake unreal engine 4 df what is it with you guys that say ooooh how could they go so low about the title of the page really is it because its tainting the name of the engine with the name of a massively successful game made by the same company that makes the engine is it because it could attract a lot of people who would otherwise miss this video are they less entitled than you to watch it because they dont know about engines is a person better than the other just because it knows more about technology is it because its more financially sound for the channel dont they have the right to earn money for what they do why should them be phliantropists if you most surely are not is it because it is clickbait what is your definition of clickbait when they use a sensationalist title for me is when you really feel baited fooled its when they promise you the best scoop about some subject and when you click on it theres only ads and the content is sorely lacking pokemon been making rpgs like this for years unreal engine is called like that for unreal and unreal tournament calling it fortnite engine is a sacrilege this video is too good to have this likedislike ratio i didnt catch the shadow detail into you pointed it out which is such a cool touch but calling the unreal engine the fornite engine is just lame cmon guys change the title your normal quality of work will eventually reach more people and they will stay more engaged when they see that it is genuine just mho so apparently they made fortnite and then they build unreal engine around it referring the title what a shitty move fortnite engine down vote for misleading engine dont be shills question is does it run at 1080p docked and 720p undocked would look quite eye popping the colors and 3d structures would truly shine and another digital foundry analysis based only on two levels of the game i think the game is bueatiful great video loved it fortnite engine why not just unreal engine 4 i smell a clickbait mmmm delicious comments on this video 1 fortnite engine 2 fortnite engine 3 fortnite engine 4 me making a pun i used to love fortnite engine 3 is dragon quest getting a switch port ring the bell ahah sorry can everyone bitching about the fortnite title please unsubscribe and get lost maybe digitalfoundry videos will have less cancerous comments sections without you bitchy whining kids who dont understand people need to feed their kids or that referring to something by what its popular for isnt evil or malicious or condescending fucking retards looks great im waiting for the inevitable steam port love this game and almost hate the hype its getting bc now everynody knew it was gonna be great gtfoh u liars lol but anyway i love it and really hope we nintendo ppl can keep this as exclusive and get some sequals unreal tournament engine fortnite enginereally just call it unreal engine 4 720p is this a xbox one launch title this game is just so amazing its justwow octopath traveler looks like an enhanced version of final fantasy brave exvius but it uses a different engine obviously good lord imagine an ultima like game using this kind of rendering it would be amazing superb art direction looks beautiful shame the battles arent animated anywhere near as well as its influences from back then looks like a hi res shining force 3 on saturn and thats a very good thing people actually care about fortnite engine how sad if this bothers you you have way too much time on your hands seems like people dont understand tom morgan is trying to show the stark contrast in visuals and makeup between fortnite and octopath traveler whilst they both use the same engine if you take the time to not be triggered by something so trivial like the title and actually watch the video you may be able to see the thinking behind it xenogears best rpg of all timethe deep storyline and themes went over a lot of peoples headsahead of its time why is everyone so salty about the title there is much worse clickbait on this website fortnite engine wtf is wrong with you guys call it what it is unreal engine 4 clickbait trash this title is horrendous first you make it sound like this game is a remaster and then make it sound like fortnite uses some special proprietary engine vids like this are why i use adblock i have to say this is one stunningly beautiful game i thought it said frostbite engine smh thumbs down because you constantly harp on tabloidstyle about fortnite and mention it even when its totally fucking irrelevant to there we go let the usual switch bitching commence play the nintendo ds pokemon games this game looks absolutely stunning wow what a unique and creative approach thanks very much for the analysis wait so even this nonsens cant run at 1080p on switch or even 720p on handheld that transparent blur effect you get when you hit enemies cant be seen in handheld mode at least in my case i tried really hard to spot it but my eyesight might just fail me 720p docked thats horrible thats last gen specs were pushing 4k tvs as the norm i honestly thought the game was 1080p60 fps playing it the look of the game is so beautiful it actually fooled me shows how far a great artstyle can go not disappointed in the actual performance just surprised then the people begs for a final fantasy xv switch cant made 1080p60fps with op switch cant move ff xv wow how impressive 720p30 on a 2d jrpg im so blown away ha the look of this game is a real frankensteins monster i dont think it works out well in the end but others seem to disagree with me no 3d dot heroes reference i dont like the exaggerated bokeh it gives the impression that the game is at a very small scale like play models i admit some people could like the effect because of that i wish it was not only for nintendo platforms now dont call it fortnite engine if it catches on we will be stuck with it like metroidvania it should be only metroid style games of just adventure as nintendo tagged the game on the original cartridge holy shit i thought clickbait was dead did you really feel like you had to put fortnite in the title or did you really think that most viewers dont know what engine fortnite runs on i love the look of it i usually hate how indie games too often will do 8 bit or 16 bit graphics for some false sense of nostalgia but this this is how it should be done this needs to come to other consoles and pc its so pretty seems like we switch owners got lucky to be the test subjects on this one im sure nintendo publishing it internationally certainly had a lot to do with it ib4 some weeb says that the eng dub ids bad like how the eng dub of dbz is bad fortnite engine crossplay confirmed wow youtubers i would have preferred they target resolution over framerate since its not a realtime game apparently no one understands the difference between clickbait and creating an attractive title its far from clikbait and i cant believe everyones so mad over one accurate word in be title aaaaand who cares this channel is getting worst than the usual this game looks fantastic for what theyre aiming for in this case idgaf what df is talking about im not really feeling the spritework and animations tbh the scaling looks off too contributing even more to that almost janky uneven look this is the first time i see an usually cancerous comment section come together and bash on this horrendous video title isnt it more like an early ps1 32 bit game breath of fire 34 grandia etc 2d characters spriters with an 3d environment great video though d you could have said unreal engine instead of fortnite engine have a downvote 500p rpg maker 2d game lol is this a joke how dare digital foundry switch out unreal engine 4 with fortnite in the title utilizing highvolume search terms to take advantage of youtubes terrible algorithm is unacceptable best jrpg of the year so far tho the titlei justwtf non switch owners or the ones who dont like jrpgs are the ones giving a thumbs down please dont start giving ue4 the moniker fortnite engine easily a top 10 game of the year square enix is back baby i hope they keep making more games like this they were always my favorite type fortnite engine sorry df but i gotta thumb down for that if the video was about resident evil 2 remake and the title said runs on resident evil 4 engine instead of re engine nobody would give a fuck but mention fortnite and watch the gamer snobs spazz out why so many dislikes i seriously dont understand you guys be thankful that they analyse the perfomance of every major game ignoring the whole fortnite engine thing am i the only one a bit put off by some of the games visuals texture tiling is fairly obvious and poorly done color grading doesnt look good in some scenes and that depth of field shimmer is pretty bad cool concept but the presentation is kinda rough like an older ue3 game wow what a beautiful game unreal tournament runs on the fortnite engine too best jrpg so far this year hands down its worth buying a switch to play it showing that you dont need the best graphics to be a great game its like people forgot about saga frontier or saga frontier 2 or legend of mana im so picking this up when i get a switch its nice to know how ue runs on switch compared to the wii u eugh sonic boom fortnite has probably made epic more money than the unreal engine 4 license agreements so i can see why someone would call it the fortnite engine regardless however they are wrong why did they not do that kind of graphics at the time of the ps1 rather than ugly ffxvi characters on realistic background and lets be honest if the switch can handle it so does 94 playstation im not a fan looks like too many things would constantly obstruct the view and since squareenix made this im sure this copy of octopath traveler is the first of potentially dozens of releases sad to see digitalfoundry being a bunch of sellouts for the clicks writes the word fortnite on video so fortnite teenage boys who have no idea about octopath traveler can click on the video click bait fortnite developed by epic epic developed unreal engine fortnite engine insert fortnite engine comment here really though i love how octopath traveler hails to ps1 rpgs despite being on nintendo i could never get into xenogears but i am reminded a lot of grandia in its use of 2d sprites 3d environment and voice acting the set camera also reminds me of pokemon gen 4 although pokemon can only dream of having these lighting effects imagine new harvest moon with this graphic style i would be loved it so much here i see people saying i wont buy this because its 2d good video but im disappointed in the clickbait title the result is paper mario goes to show that even the best channels on youtube cant avoid clickbait i think digital foundry is getting a little lofty on providing the technical info on games in recent days redout seems to me where df has kinda started to change how it talks about games and imho i came to df for technical analysis of games and now im getting editorial opinions on games and game engines especially from alex generic switch hating comment this game looks so great there is no good excuse for this game to run at 720p 30 fps thats the average for an xbox 360 game would love to see a chrono trigger remake that looked that way one thing that kind of irritates me is that enemies and bosses get these giant detailed inbattle sprites but your characters remain the small little sprites from the overworld think golden sun ff7 where when you get into battle youre swapped out with a much more properly scaled detailed and animated model for some reason that treatment was only given to enemies just another comment chiming in on the ridiculousness of the title there no such thing as a fortnite engine wtf i dont understand why nobody mentions ragnarok online when talking about this game thats one of the most direct references the character design the use of classes and the 3d bg vs 2d elements ofcourse this is not unique for ro but common this looks like a ro remaster on first glance can you look at vermintide 2 on xbox wait octopath traveler runs on ue4 amazing also whats up with all the dislikes df become more trash with every new video fortnite engine lol what a shame waiting for the 240 fps low setting pubg autists to complain about the dof effects best part is the beauty of portability 30fps and doesnt even run at native screen resolution well its blurry as fuck so resolution doesnt really matter i guess hey now that wasnt dragon quest at the beginning that was dragon warrior dragon quest didnt have different directions for the sprites are the characters sprites i thought they were flat 3d models genesis port when its unreal engine 4 ue4 click bait stuff when are we getting octopath traveler battle royale mode omg my eye burns it is so overlighted with the bloom effects what exactly is causing these dislikes i thought people would be relieved on realizing its not john doing the video why so many dislikes oh wow i didnt even realize the game wasnt hd as ive been playing undocked this whole time truly a well made game theres absolutely nothing wrong with the title just a bunch of basement dwellers looking for validation unreal engine 4 did not exist until fortnite did apparently i do miss xenogears and artonelico era i am glad it is back thankyou square enix exclusive game running at 576p i would love a final fantasy vi remake with these graphics and fmv included when you consider the title revived on hellblade senuas sacrifice engine is also legit you can do better df its 32bit not 16bit fyi a remake of xenogears with that idea would be amazing fortnite engine really now i have currently 20 hours in octopath and i didnt even notice the low resolution in docked mode maybe its the aggressive depth of field effects idk but when playing on tv it seriously doesnt look like 720p but the lower resolution in handheld mode was noticeable for me i bet everyone in the comments who complains about the resolution in docked mode hasnt even played the game the title is an insult to the original game the unreal engine comes from unreal long live unreal and unreal tournament bokehevery time i hear someone say bokeh depth of field i want to go in a murder spree fortnite engine thats not the name for the engine this game looks like doodoo tbh i really dont like the excessive dof bloom and color filtering it looks like a bad postprocessing mod how does a game so visually deceptively simple not even run at 1080p on switch what is everyone but nintendos problem you knew you would get views regardless what you put in the title and yet you click bait dont make sense now howabout a ff6 remake with this engine would this be possible on vita and how likely is a port sick and tired of these stupid clickbait titles wtf happened df you used to have integrity lmfao that title not hating on the grind though wow i had no idea that fortnite ran on the octopath engine i heard that unreal engine runs on a modified version of fortnite so if digital foundry can either be at option to rate or criticize a game for whatever fps or graphic design it has then i guess we can do the same to them i gave the video a like but it wasnt anything spectacular on a vlog journalistic point of view simple and plain the game doesnt need an explanation you get what you pay for and that people is entertainment at its finest rpg has come a long way but in my and many peoples perspective it belongs as is this game is the definition of rpg the game looks beautiful an alternative timeline exists where square continued making 2d rpgs instead of following the ff7 route and all their games all look like this gotta love how all the best comments are crying over the videos title theyre right unreal engine 4 is the fortnite engine thats not clickbait i really like the look they have gone for i think its gorgeous but im still waiting for a wreckfest video can df do an analysis on impact of fov on console games that let you adjust it i would like to know how it effects fps and frame pacing sorry game looks trash fortnite engine seriously call a well stablished engine such as unreal fortine engine fortnite engine could have been daemon x machina engine then its all unreal engine 4 1024 x 576 resolution they should have dialed back the effects and just hit 720p proper please write unreal engine 4 and not fortnite engine thats literal clickbait how the hell is this game too demanding for the switch change the title please unreal engine the word fortnite used for clickbait im here for octopath traveler i didnt even notice the word fornite is the most popular game that use of the ue4 right now so it makes sense that is used as a title wow so many sad people in the comments are salty about the title the depth of field effect on this remind me of 3d dot heroes from ps3 i just think it is really too much dof used on octopath traveller it could be less agressive at least on the foreground this game is so beautiful omg i have no idea epic rebranded the unreal engine to fornite engine this is a new one why so many dislikes the reason i despise the usage of the fortnite engine in the title is multifaceted first of all its inaccurate since the proper name is unreal engine 4 which is popular enough for most people to understand secondly its used for yt clickbait which is something i despise when trying to watch decent content lastly digital foundry you guys already set up a patreon as a source of revenue 3652m ontop of the eg affiliation so the clickbait isnt justified this is the game thats going to make me buy a switch oh and btw you can just say using unreal engine 4 instead of fortnite this shit making me wanna replay xenogears what is the interestinginnovative tech that this game has where is it there is no reason to make a technical analysis on this game but we all know why this game is still covered its because its on the switch and people still say that the nintendo bias isnt real id like to see one of your patented side by side comparisons of octopath with a beautiful snes rpg like final fantasy vi or chrono trigger stellar content as usual guys keep up the good work octopath is probably the most beautiful game ive ever played this game is a dream come true for me get it when its 10 not worth 60 it looks and plays like a 20 year old game i really dont understand why the fact that the title says revived on fortnite engine instead of revived on the same engine as fortnite is supposed to be some horrible sin please square remake them old final fantasy games with this tech another game proving art style and trumps 60fps 4k create a fun unique game and bam selling like hotcakes love how literally everybody has had the same thought reading the title that title made me dislike the video good job df beautiful game soundtrack is on fire and the gameplay is super fun and addicting good job square can you please do a retro video on dark cloud 2 please why not create a secret of mana in similar asthetics this game is awesome ive been playing docked on a 55 inch 4k tv im kinda surprised the game is 720p it looks incredible too bad all that artistic design is shown through a 720p image and if thats not enough its also 30fps its still a good game that ill buy but honestly before i tried the first demo i thought it was going to have a much higher visual impact and was disappointed when i saw it on my tv i would have said whatever about the low resolution if it was 60fps 720p 30fps why fornite enginewell i did type in fornite in the search box their video showed up in the results and i didnt have to scroll far to see it i guess if you need the exposure you didnt even mention alundra which looks very similar to this i was wondering why this had so many dislikes then i realized it was because of the title of the video lol i dont know what kind of exclusivity deal they have with nintendo on this one but if its not a permanent thing then i can definitely see them porting this game to pc ps4 and xbox one in the future i think its massive popularity really took them by surprise and i imagine they would want to capitalize on that popularity as much as possible any news when se realise it on pcps4 love the video title is some stupid shit i feel like df would not need that kind of shit overall the game looks pretty nice except for the resolution and the ground tiling they couldve done some randomisation add noise or some other techniques so it doesnt look like the same sprite repeated all over the place digital foundry on octopath instant watch tim soret the creator of the upcoming the last night which also uses sprites in a 3d world recently tweeted that he is disappointed with the quality of the sprites during combat in octopath because of the scaling and how he solved that problem for the last night unreal engine has only been out for a couple of decades totally cool for a hardcore tech channel to call it fortnite for views s god all the people bitching its a 3d 16bit game it doesnt need 4k or crap like that itd turn based its fine at 30 all that would have to be scaled down to get 1080p or 60fps and dof would most likely be removed entirely its a fucking handheld they know this they focused on graphical quality heavy use of a very high quality depth of field that alone is enough to bring down a gpu theres a reason depth of field is usually removed out if console games or is used at a lower quality amazing lighting effects high quality shadows while styled like 16bit ones the textures are fairly high resolution to fortnite engine yeah sure ok 99 percent of the comments fortnite engine 1 nice video i love how half the comments are about the click baity title generating engagement and therefore making the bait even more effective well done df i honestly didnt know the resolution was that low if you never mention it you dont even notice well i still cant notice it may be due to the artstyle why the dislikes get ready for this to become your most disliked video for some reason it already has more dislikes than your crash one and it has almost 20x the views wow that title really is a new low i dont have a switch but im really digging what im seeing of this game game of the year whats next calling the quake engine call of duty engine did you add fortnite engine just for the views or is it different then normal unreal at least the title made comment section more sensible it looks like its visuals are heavily inspired by the last night in terms of postprocessing particle vfx look rather unfortunate and dont really match the visual style the sprite scaling with nearest neighbour selection really really bothers me it looks super ugly with uneven sized squares they should have written a custom scaling shader for it that analytically integrates over the area of each pixel or used one of the numerous cheap tricks to accomplish a similar goal of giving each source pixel the same overall contribution i do want to have final fantasy vi remade like this this game really got my attention with its art style when it first premiered at the switch announcement stream game looks great but 30fps on this just once more shows how much of a joke the switch is also bullshit title on the video using fortnight in the title for clicks is pretty obnoxious these graphics blow for being fortnite is the game on psone its only 30fps look at all the intense dof that feature will bog down a gpu do a no mans sky next teaser analysis love to see their tech in this new next update i dont really like the game or rpgs in general but i bought it anyways because its so beautiful to look at just walking around and looking at things is the most fun ive had with the game octopath looks like one of those 3d pop out books i love how unreal engine 4 is now called the fortnite engine epic should rebrand it setting the switch to output 720p will result in far superior image bypassing the poor upscaling entirely this is especially noticeable on the games hud in combat the switch can change resolution while the game is running so no rebooting of the game is needed you guys are pros dont go for gimmicks like calling ue4 the fortnite engine it makes you look a lot less pro guess unreal 4 is fortnite engine now we truely live in dark times what a low title just to get clicks thought you were better than this im a simple man i dislike clickbait titles real quick thumbs down for the click bait fortnite engine just naming it fortnight engine was able to unite this community for once this is exactly the kind of graphics tech i was hoping new sonic games would be but alas gamers still praise 16bit lol what they say sonic is the same type of thing looks freaking identical to the mega drive versions i was hoping the game would have a crt filterscan lines to blurry up the pixels and make them mesh better im very surprised it only runs 720p docked just came here to say how clickbait that title is fortnite engine ffs digital foundry i thought you were better than that just say unreal engine 4 as if people that are clicking on these analysis videos dont know what the hell ue4 is fortnite engine more like clickbait engine also thats sad that the game does not run at 60fps ps im a switch owner while this game looks amazing and has a nice addition to turn based combat i still skipped on the game for now dont hate me but from what i saw in reviews they said theres a lot of repetition could be forgiven and theres no interaction between characters the deal breaker for me so it really doesnt look like my type of jrpg it seems really lazy to me that they couldnt put effort into character building between protagonists thats like one of the biggest reasons i buy rpgs i could care less about individual stories if the characters dont talk to each other on this adventure to help each others cause out whats the point of other protagonists joining you didnt this feel awkward when they were creating the story the game wouldve been basically the same if they didnt allow protagonists to group up and made each protagonist powerful enough to fight everything with balancing changes and make it a single protagonist game its a its 2018 spriates outdated and turnbase only work for certain games fortnite engine are you serious df this is low you should be ashamed of yourselves df just reached a whole new level of low when it comes to their clickbait titles why fortnite engine instead of unreal you think this audience wants that cant wait for the gears 5 running on fortnite engine analysis i think xenogears is harder than this because of those fuels the people in the comments still somehow find a way to bring up 60fps like stfu its a cool look in theory but it needed better application and to be used in a game that wasnt a glorified saga series game which is a series a few people love but never sold reviewed or imo played at all well back in the day when they were released regularly fortnite engine come on youre better than that df octopath traveller is amazing one of my favourite sprit based jrpg the amount of people upset over the use of fortnite engine in the title is ridiculous instead of seeing it as clickbait why not look at it as a showcase of how versatile the engine is like when i saw the title my first thought wasnt omg clickbait unsubbed1 it was huh talk about two games that couldnt possibly be any different yet here they are both running off of the same engine interesting also it is the same engine as fortnite so its not untrue which means its not clickbait calm yourselves people im 100 sure its called unreal engine 4 not the fortnite engine i thought you guys were supposed to be precise you guys should collaborate with sheshez 105 dislikes switch fanboys you mad because the switch is exposed 720p30fps sonic mania plus please guys fortnite engine ohhh df really trying get those clicks ue its big on its own df no need for this ambitious this title is distasteful fortnite engine just wow dumb video title apart this game is beautiful what were you thinking using fortnite engine in place of unreal engine your clickbaiting isnt even going to yield significant gains on a video like this because the people that watch digital foundry already know what the fortnite engine actually is and anyone new you do manage to clickbait will now be misinformed or at the very least confused please dont stoop to this kind of silliness its not that big a deal but it subverts the entire purpose of these videos informing people and its just unnecessary why didnt you just call it unreal engine pixel art with subnative res oooookay fortnite engine really come on guys youre better than that fortnite engine if thats the bar youre setting for future content i am unsubscribing i dont need eli5 level content honestly the game is hideous they should release this on ps4 with this art style does resolution really matter my guess is that at the higher resolutions it didnt look 16bit enough please dont ever call it fortnite engine again full tech analysis uh wheres the analysis on texture filtering antialiasing and the like half of the video is gushing about things like the soundtrack reminder in a tech analysis video while ignoring the technical aspects many of us came to see df if one of my top 5 favorite channels on yt love the content and everything so far but this kind of clickbait title is really depressing i love how the title has annoyed so many people wait 30fps and sub native resolutions wow did not expect this and even still frame pacing issues only 720p 30 fps and with frame pacing errors sounds like an early ps3360 game to me it should be 720p 60 or 1080p 30 at least especially on a modern console disappointing come on fortnite engine really ill be honest i wouldnt even mind if se makes a some remakes with this graphics implementations maybe something like ff1 to ff5 fft though i wouldnt get my hopes up because again this is se were talking about i wonder if this game ever come to pc uncap fps 4k wouldnt be a problem even for low end machine 720p wow i honestly couldnt tell 1 clickbait title its unreal engine ffs 2 still waiting for an updated video and console pc comparison on nier automata edit can we have this on xone ps4 labeling the glorious unreal 4 as a fornite engine is a disservice smooth 510p 30fps gameplay downvoted for clickbait title dammit im missing out on another awesome game on the switch first it was mario and zelda now this goddamit modern economy too much effects looks fucked up did you actually call it the fortnite engine i think the unreal engine is fairly well known by the gaming community this game could use higher resolution and taa i can deal with 30 fps cap on this kind of game guys we are gamer please write unreal engine 4 thx the excess of bloom and dof effects its too overtoned 576p 30fps with framepacing issueswtf is this 1998 why is this simple indie mobile cellphone game even struggling this muchwtf weak switch why is everyone so salty about the title lmao who cares gears 4 used fortnite engine aswell everyone complains about the title of the video even though the video itself is great and interesting sweet youtube community why would you insult such an amazing game as octopath traveler by having it at the same sentence as fortnite cant say im not disappointed its 576p30fps that seems horribly low for the type of game it is i think this boke effect is as dumb as lens flare in fpss its a videogame not a movie theres no need to mimic the quirks of real cameras i saw fortnite engine and it took me a good second to realize that it was unreal engine 4 they used fortnite engine because the unreal 4 engine is a lie i say this after having just learned that the cake is a lie and then learned that everything is a lie except of course youtube titles long live fornite engine lol hmmm never knew epic renamed unreal engine 4 to fortnite engine its been beaten to death but calling it the fortnite engine is absolute cringe its not cloth dynamic just a simple vertex world position offset animation say it with me xbox fanboys exclusive game good video with well explanation of game elements thumb down for clickbait fortnite engine as you can do without clickbaits in vid titles i think they went a little too far with the pixel art they shoulda do it kinda like ff6 but with this town design and enviroment gotta get those filthy casual gamer clicks by putting fortnite in the title gotta get dem clicks off a 2d pixel art game lol holy shit this is pathetic even for you people are more concerned about the title of the video than the content of it they even explain in the first minute why they compare it to fortnite gotta love this comment section and the internet these days yeah well i do remember ragnarok online this also was a 25d adventure and the sprite work was faaaaar superior to this even 14 years back clickbait title youre better than this df digital foundry i love you guys but come on fortnite engine you guys are better than that fortnite doesnt even show unreal engine 4 at its best great content like always shitty click bait title meh strategic clickbait is strategic 576p and the game is not even in full 3d graphics this could run with no problem on android why is the resolution so low the name of the engine isnt fortnite engine please dont stoop this low change it the music in this game is wonderful reminds me of the good old snespsx jrpgs fortnite engine lmao seriously youre all better off subscribing to nx gamer hes only one dude and he pushes out higher quality content than wichard and his malnourished goons ever could this game would look fantastic in 3d how is that not native 720p in portable mode switch truly is a piece of garbage to be honest though we never heard anyone from df say that they wouldnt exploit click bait so this title is completely fine how the fuck is this game not running 60fps 1080 on switch docked at least and 720p handheld im pretty sure the switch could run this game at that lazy work honestly some of the most beautiful water you do realise unreal engine 4 existed before fortnite right while epic created it it wasnt created specifically for fortnite as it existed way before that fortnite engine just say unreal engine 4 and also xenogears dev now is under nintendo fortnite engine wew i really hope epic wont have the same terrible idea but thanks a lot for covering this i will wait for the pc version fortnite engine for fuck sake lol why not call it unreal engine directly gotta get that fortnite in the title gotta do that seo well played df damn you df you put fortnite engine because you want views pathetic are we really going to refer to unreal as the fortnite engine for clicks now come on technically beautiful soundwise amazing but but but rubbish generic story big big dissapointment for me fortnite engine whats next captain toad has nothing to do with fortnite but were still putting it in the title everyone here fortnite engine wtf me ummm wasnt the unreal engine named after a super popular shooter as well i hope nintendo users have fun with this xd when i first played the demo i was beyond shocked that it ran at 30fps there is no excuse for that and now i learn its locked at 720p no words for that the vignette is kinda annoying though the vignet is too strong in this game but its nice that you can turn it off in the settings the youtube compression doesnt help the effect in this video sadly i wish ppl wuld shut up about them putting fortnite engine for clickbait and just discuss about this game and its tech tht was presented in the vid i wuld like to discuss with their opinions im honestly mildly triggered right now hahahah yall that desperate to clickbait fortnite yoh they busted out ue4 for this gotdayum xenogearsits my favorite videogames of all time could you guys do a tech review when no mans sky next update comes out personally im really not into turn base but i can respect this game because back when i was a child i did play games like this not because i like the game play but because i liked anime wouldnt it be better to say unreal engine 4 instead of fortnite engine that aside the game being 720p docked is surprising to me because it looks really good imo at least its basically a locked 30 fps despite frame pacing issues ive been playing the demo for the game and i enjoy it a lot will definitely get the full game soon its absolutely baffling that it doesnt run at 60fps extremely lazy and ignorant fortnite is shit and ue4 isnt so change the title fortnite engine yes because only fortnite uses unreal engine 4 and its not like unreal engine 4 has its own name like unreal engine 4 naaaah mate amiright coming to ps4 did you guys test this game as a download or retail cause as a retailgame there seem to be much more stuttering in towns compaired to the digital version i have significant more issue than a buddy of mine who has the digital version such a great game lol fortnite word to gain views finally a digitalfoundry video that wont have people bitching about graph and then i read the comments section i wish square will remake ff6 and chrono trigger with this graphics style this game would look amazing with 4khdr 60fps look at that cheap subtle cough way to get all the kids of the currently most trending game to get their video in their search results and click it df you were quality before you got super popular now youre literally just in it for revenue its actually kinda hilarious and sad how obvious you made it with that title how about just putting fortnite and world of warcraft at the end of all your video titles since we already got you figured out anyway might as well been playing for six hours and cant get enough this game looks and sounds really good and it also plays fine right now im more than satisfied with it man you really had to put fortnite on the title to get the views you could just wrote ue4 or unreal engine 4 you viewers are not all braindead too bad the switch controller is so crap id like to play this game oh well a professional tech analysis channel begging for views by going low and calling the unreal engine the fortnite engine nice its not coming to pc so its crap this game isnt 60fps lmfao on fortnite engine instead of on unreal engine mmmm gotta get them clicks indie devs really need to learn from these og companies that they take from so much which is not to emulate nor simulate the old retro game design but to innovate like look at this game it looks leagues better then any indie retro style came i have seen fortnite on the title of the video is odd why didnt just put unreal engine 4 is it true that were going to get 1080 ti performance for 250 im hyped fortnite engine sounds pretty insulting for the one of the most powerful engine of this generation edit it isnt the most powerful engine more like versatile using fortnite engine to get views if pubg was more popular then they would definitely use pubg engine unreal would be fine for views though since when are we referring to unreal engine as the fucking fortnite engine i mean come on digitalfoundry octopath looks like a really good jrpg from what ive played so far although i do wish it ran at 60fps since most jrpgs on the nes and snes ran at that target fortnight engine is that the new name for ue4 come on now do a hollow knight analysis game deserves the exposure because its amazing gotta admit i was really confused for a second there like what is fortnite engine ohhhh fortnites engine as in ue4 doh got it fortnite engine what edit oh i get it it was used for clickbait this game is such a disappointment was super curious about this game butonly on nswitch im not buying nor have i ever bought a whole new console just for 1 game shame really fortnite engine to get those clicks i see you digital foundry fortnite engine really 60hz so itll take my 85hz strobing monitor i use and switch it to flickering seizureinducing eye rape ill patiently await the ps4 port i love the art style but the story or i should say the lack thereof is absolute shit also the battle system oh the battle system i love my jrpgs and i love most of their battle systems i find them relaxing but the battle system in this game is just stressful and i dont find anything about it relaxing so what does this game offer me it offers me the look of jrpgs of old but that is all because it is but a illusion because beneath the look there is nothing to me that resembles jrpgs of old feels like what it really is a game of today and i havent liked any game of today excluding the witcher 3 the wild hunt that game is sex incarnate lol i stopped liking most jrpgs and most games in general since about final fantasy ix and that isnt because i just got old i can to this day play games like chrono trigger my favorite jrpg and game period final fantasy i through ix vi being my favorite of the series and my first game i ever truly played in the genre is there a filter option for graphics didnt see you showing that otherwise it will be like capcom street fighter collection with no filter just no go on led screens 5999 for this its like from 2000y game with bad voice acting stupid dialogues this is one sort of greedy company dont get me wrong if you like it buy and play it been wanting to see octopath in 4k and it didnt disappoint graphics below average everything else is great but the most important thing now is squareenix investing big budget for graphics for a sequel it doesnt has to be similar to ff15 graphics just better than this i hoped this would get a pc release i do not own a switch yet so im definitely buying this great to see a good pc port of a jap game you dont see that everyday i loved the demo but i didnt take the time to go all in watch this is definitely sparking interest and i want to add this to my catalog d i know im a minority here but is there a way to filter the pixel art in the pc version something like hq2x or xbrz battle network is up next awesome isnt there three versions since ive heard the virtual console ports on wii u made some improvements besides the weird star force thing and potential regional differences im impressed that the pc port looks so nice sick vid bro im 6 hours played in the game and lvl 15 i think i did the secret bosses in the wrong order sorcerer warmaster starseer and then runelord apologies if i missed it but was it explained why does the runner occasionally save and quit to title menu only to load back into the same save i had the run playing in the background while i did other stuff and occasionally tuned back in on and off so i didnt catch everything dude on the couch adding a lot to the run good job is this a 100 walkthrough i had to look up how to beat galdera 2 because galdera 1 was tankable with 9999 overhealing but galdera 2 can hit for 7k times 2 galdera 2 needed sidestep theresa xenox ghostwalker breaks the game again it takes a great couch to have an entertaining 5hr speedrun but the brit on the left does a really great job on keeping the mood up and engaging without being annoying or a sperglord yo is that the dude from games done quick in the background i beat the game today so now i can finish watching this without being spoiled insane and dope at the same time cool thing about redeye is he has a move where he heals someone in your party proving its graham for sure my favourite final fantasy reference is that the super rich guy in tressas story has a butler named gil he did this on level 35 retweet if the treasure chests say dad props to the guy in the couch explaining the plot i hate many speedrunners just brush it off like its nothing earned a like from me how much coffee does that cup store dude my word i still cant manage to beat the galdera and my party is level 50im probably doing something wrong i kinda appreciate you dying to galdera i died to galdera comments here actually take away from the runners wish they stop talking 11210 pretty sure therions english va did mattias wish this game was on ps4 when you took 80 hours to beat galdera and see this cyrus is a rogue because hes an anti social dick whos rude scruntinize is just getting someones story by being an inquisitive questioning and pushy asshole after hearing the japanese for this i do prefer the english cast p i think cyrus sounds a lot more like a scholar in english than in japanese only 15 minutes in but the commentary is stunning lots of info delivered very smoothly everyone seemed very comfortable with each other fun stories mixed in very well done great run 2500 guess speed and crit are no longer stats that can be powered up 2920 its russell 33430 haanits chapter 1 has determination anyways good run jello always good when a run includes daughter of the dark god saintsbridge best town music dont me at 38 min or so it was definitely primrose for me i understand the other answers though 33000 square enix knew about what was going to happen with the sonic movie and tried to warn us hrodvitnir is another name for fenrirthe more you know dam you famous i cant wait this run to be in gdq in future time to sleep octopath speedrun starts woke wtf i have 60 hours and still trying to kill galdera 43832 all the buffs jello mentioned on tressas wind attacks are x15 elemental break x15 peacock strut x2 alephans enlightment x2 aelfrics auspices x15 bp eater x12 augmented elements x15 elemental aid x125 dreisangs spell x16 tradewinds spear primeval bow of storms total x486 damage on tressas wind attacks yep props to jello for doing a galdera run it was all pretty stellar spout all the pretty word syou like you know the truth she will never again know the happiness she once did why do you rob your sister of the hope i offer her what else does she have but that futile wish i tried to do this but the devourer of dreams only had 2 charges not three did they change it is this a world record i havent seen this boss taken down in a quick fashion ah so you do need all 8 party members for this fight reminds me of ffvii when fighting that statue like form of sephiroth love it when u land it on stillsnow tq for the guide ty for this ill try this out tmr how to gain that bright pursuit what did you have on ophelia to let her do that many axe attacks much harder than ff7 olberic said no and galdera died 615 how are you supposed to kill a thing like this 620 uh this is how this video is good i invested 85 hours into this game and i am not gonna invest 20 more just to bring every charakter to level 99 enough is enough oh shit son you pwn3d him like a true boss when i first tried this boss i got cyrus as warmaster best boss battle in jrpg history for me and took me more than an hour the final boss of this game is quite literally an optional superboss dude how are you so powerful ive been trying this method for the last 10 hours still no success everytime the last phase of the 2nd phase does something really crazy and i cant survive it took me 15 hours still cant defect it gg how to get devour of dreams capture rate is always below 25 and it flies off than it dies thank you so much for this strategy i just beat him and couldnt be happier man what a challenge how to make visible eq this game battles mechanics are epic your strat was 1010 it took me over 20 hours to win thank you im confused why the title of the final boss song is daughter of the dark god youre not fighting his daughter tho fucking hell i didnt know who the final boss was im on my final 4th chapter and this pops up in my feed no warning no spoiler alert nothing why do you need to say who the final boss is just say final boss no need to say the name thats so very annoying damn you it tooks me two hours straight to beat that dark god and his hencmens yet you did it under 10 minutes you how dare you you make me feel so inferior lowly to you galdera just a puny god huh followed this strategy except for one sorcerers robe haha and it was damn easy my party was around lvl 7585 never would have thought seeing haanit as sorcerer and ophilia as hunter and everyone in the first part dishing so much damage it was crazy thanks ive been playing this game wrong all along i remember for the first fight i had sorcerer primrose as my main damage being supported by cleric cyrus and starseer ophelia and second part was rune lord tressa abusing side step and olberic warmasyer as the hard hitter i think i had alphyn healing part 2 took a bit longer than this but worked really well i dont think i ever got too close to losing this boss look like cover death metal album this final boss theme is amazing i love it so much one of my favorites of all time can someone just explain how to get olberics damage high tried this 6 times now died everytime my olberic does about 10k20k 1hp fortitude highest equipment divinationed lowered armour and warmaster ultimate nothing how are people completing this shitp yeah i can confirm the tactic works for the second phase i have done the first phase my way however the second phase is just ridiculous and you cant beat it without using some tactic like this what a shitty boss design it forces you to use overwhelming damage because there is no other way really such a shame this fight needs two grps i am way too lazy to build up the other 4 characters just to beat the second phase also a shame that you have to beat the 8 bosses before everytime since you cant save in there such a dumb design why even bother wtf olberic chill i did this for test i didnt know before when used a staff to hit any enemy with elemental blade buff hits like a beast this took me like 8 tries and who knows how many hours do someone know the amount of hp of this beast plz great for me its too powerful the first boss i didnt imagine will be second d im sorry but last i checked theres only one unique battletested weapon for each type of them so why would they be two according to your list did you make a mistake or did i miss something i honestly dont get how you get that amount of dmg im 30 levels over your chars and i have all the gear youve said in the description i dont understand how he does that much damage my olberic is fully equiped and level 82 and does about 8k 14k damage per attack with the divine how is he hitting for 30k each the greatest crime here is not defeating galdera in a mere 10 minutes its not activating the travel banter lol i finished this game today but i will not try this one my party is underleveled and i dont have patience to grind and look to these damages lol my top damage was 9999 finally beat the game thanks to this after several failed attempts wow wait how did you have a devourer of dreams with more than one summon i can only get him with one summon i am pretty sure i am playing this game wrong haha me has used pretty much the same 4 people the entire game who are now around lvl 70 while the other 4 are around lvl 40 this boss is the bane of my existence wow thanks for the spoiler thumbnail thanks for your help well done this boss makes me seriously want to hurt the developers meanwhile i struggled for an hour and a half on phase 1 before i finally died how to make sure olbric does not die when he is 1 hp i messed up and caught the devourer of dreams with 0 boosts thank you so much for this tutorial finally managed to beat this guy and the strategy with the first team makes even the boss rush fun every boss can be taken down within the first broken phase how did you get olberic to one health i just got both teams to level 100 and did my own thing wasnt too hard you should have used defend on olberic before galdera used banish soul that way he moved first next turn you still had cyrus to give him bp before then so theres more than one of the battletested items each example are there more than one battletested shield and if that so where can i find them thankyou i retry 4 times because of bad rng at phase 2 where to take lucklees sellword npc im going to follow this guide to the t i primarily used alfyn primrose cyrus and haanit i neglected the others so i will have to outfit them and level them up this video gives me hope thanks for posting this so is the eye birth and the beast death could you please make a video of how can i capture those beasts of haanit and make them that powerful thanks it reminds me the final boss of radiant historia thank you so much for this guide i finally beat the boss and can rest in peaces second phase is random btw my primrose got oneshotted before her first move and then whole team got wiped out bs i will forever hate galdera its so stuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupid where did you get the double tomahawk oh this game can fuck right off with that ending is it possible to capture more than one devourer of dreams or you can only have one at a time by the way great strategy i ran through gates of finis the prior 8 took me upwards of 2 hours to get through and i got to the second stage of galdera before losing and realizing i wasnt leveled enough yet this strategy helped me out especially with the equipment reqs and job setups thank you thank you and thank you for me this strategy does not work as same as you did it but still works how do you unlock this boss galdera i am the god of darkness and destruction you simple mortals cant defeat me prepare to die olberic hold my beer ehm how should i get 2 battle tested shieldspls answer thx this game is perfect for me everything is perfect there is any problem or anything i say this can be better no everything is fucking perfect thanks for spoiling the final boss in the thumbnail i basically have up on this game because i only lasted 5 minutes after like 8 hours i put into the bosses prior and havent really gotten back to the game good lord that light rune is crazy strong im only on chapter 2 of everyone so i got a ways to go and a lot to look forward to leave it to olberic i won the fight after 2h of fighting but i did it damn it thanks for the spoliers took me a few tries but i managed it my setup was generally different but i took this warmaster olberic build with less optimal items but it worked my numbers werent as absurd but the second form was far weaker than i had expected thanks for the spoiler you fucking jackass reported thanks for the thumbnail spoiler asshole if this boss fight was a communityvoted record then you have broken it fuck first time i made a mistake and forgot to give my warmaster bp got wiped fuck but my fault ok second time i did everything perfect but fucking by chance my 1hp warmaster got the last move of the turn got killed before his movefuuuuuuuck there goes my 2 nights i am fucking done delete game so i dont waste any more time thanks for the thumbnail spoiler asshole the entire gate of finis sequence took me about 5 hours start to finish this video is an insult to me at around 800 why olberic is hit by magic and only bop is consumed i really have to thank you for being a good enough person as to put the final boss right in the thumbnail this amount of damage is illegal so i was using olberic wrong the whole time i was using him as a damage sponge end me only hope you could fight this boss again was so epic battle in loooooooooong time i must be missing something my party is the same level and i was hitting a tenth of the dmg you were really needs to let you save after the boss rush cos after 2 attempts first was not expecting that difficulty after such easy bosses im done why ophelias attacking 9 times duuuudeee i actually defeated the boss in about 6 minutes with your strat thanks but after that i was like now what hahahahaha how does he have 3 sorcerers robes man i love it when a thumbnail spoils one of my favourite rpgs i keep getting screwed out of turn order on 2nd phase trying to do this you are great strategist thanks for this guide me ok the strategy look interesting see the 48k damage me what the fuck thanks for your reddit guide extremely helpful how do you get it 2 physical belts nice job toi hard for me how is this spoilers its a boss that 80 of people wont even reach much less actually defeat it which is the monters that you used with haniit i like this but arent you really banking on olberic not being hit or does cover make up for that how do i get him to 1hp before the fight though because this strat looks broken dude i didnt even know this was in the game time to play octopath again where does the hearty encouragement come from where did you get the third elemental augmenter as far as ive seen there are only two available one from the scaredy sheep quest and another from therese in stonegard thank you for this strategy because i was at my wits end with this fight i tried so many things but yours even if it took me many tries to get perfect because sometimes characters would mess with order but on my try i was able to beat it i know someone will say you are just bad im sorry but have you seen the moves where he does 1 hp and the aoe attacks so yeah thanks any advice for a not having the belts i refuse to grind rng and the fact that the boss always opens with spamming the ice attack the final boss is optional why i went back after using a bunch of nuts id been sitting on all game olberic destroyed him in just under two turns thanks for posting this i did something a lot like this and got pretty faruntil i got right up next to the gate and accidentally started healing my whole party with olberic at 1 hp all that careful planning oh well thankyou i did it on the second attempt first time i forgot to bring eliza along and struggled through the first phase but got killed in the second both times in the second phase the boss really wanted olberic to not be alive he kept using all of his aoe spells to kill the poor 1hp man it was touch and go for a long time on the second attempt but eventually olberic got a lick in and murderised the bastards friends luckily the next turn the boss just went for standard attacks again thankyou for posting this guide both here and the text version on the subreddit how do you do so much elemental damage did you just put elemental damage on tbe first team and no fisical damage or is he just very shitty against elements i have one question the video doesnt answer why is it important then olberic only has one hp howd your team get that speed boost at 811 thank you so much for this after blindly walking in here not long after release day i decided yeah fuck this boss but then i came across this and beat it no problem first try in less than 10 minutes thank you ive just beat the final boss using the strategy from your video thank you so much d hey how do you get multiple battle tested sheilds and force sheilds im seeing a lot of battle tested shields thats weird that you only get one in the game and i definitely see more than one this video helped so much i was about to resign myself to a long time of grinding and this cut it down to a few hours thanks what a sobwell i had already beaten the boss so it wouldnt be a spoiler to me but how come so u use hang tough then everyone could remain in 1 hp and deal crazy damages and that beast well i rarely capture monster dont even know there is such a monster sorry but youre a spoiler just like profasiagaming so you should take that thumbnail down and change the name though you spoiled it for everybody who wanted to see what this final boss looks like youre no better than that jerk profasiagaming that 1hp olberic makes me want to try it but at the same time i need the best rng to avoid dmg thx for the vid i will try to do the strat once i lvl everyone to 7073 ps i have some stat nuts but idk which ones should get the boost olberic will have the strength that for sure have fun capturing devourer of dreams kids worst strategy ever to beat final boss darn all my characters are at level 7075 and my party was killed before i could even get to the second round now i have to fight all those bosses again first not everyones a jrpg expert i will stop you here and now i was desimating everything in my path until i reached this boss and got my ass wooped and thrown back to the begining of the dungeon and i just sat there followed everything still got my ass kicked on the second round it seems you have the hang tough skill but you didnt mention that in the description man i was glad that people on reddit marked their pictures as spoiler i was evading it susscesfully and you piece of garbage destroyed it lol wtf well so much for avoiding spoilers before even clicking on the video i was spoiled both the name of the final boss and what it looks like your video and party setup helped me finally beat this superboss thank you how were you able to use devourer of dreams multiple times when i captured that monster i was only able to use it 1 time how did ophilia hit 6x basic attack on just a 4x boost you didnt even bother healing poor olberick at 1 hp before starting the battle thanks to your strategy guide i was able to successfully defeat the final final boss thank you so much ok i am not a pro why olberic all the time get just one hp ok when therion is in the second party he must be special i think its a testament to this games final boss that the quick kill is like 10 minutes i know its been a while since this game came out but still thanks a lot for putting the boss in the thumbnail you couldve just called the video octopath traveler final boss and had something else as the thumbnail the amount of cheese in this strategy is unbearable once you finish the entire game youd be glad that this battle took you a long time because now the battles are quick and theres no more thrill ps im not discrediting the achievement this person did im actually in awe and admiration that someone can defeat this boss in 10 minutes im getting huge ptsd from this boss bad thumbnail also your strategy requires some extremely rare stuff fast kill meh check this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzw7wxnqi holy sht thanks to domtendo for linking this video and greetings from germany if i killed the devourer of dreams in his boss fight can i capture it anywhere later all this talk of spoilers is silly to me as i knew right from ophilias first chapter who the final boss would be guys just dont look anything up related to a game when a game comes out it wont be recommended omg hardcore shih t well done domtendo is proud of you i wonder if the guardians of the subclasses could beat this boss do balogar got transfer rune probably yeah imma spoil myself fuck it how did you get the bright pursuit skill i mean the attack after your normal attack in phase 1 which gave a bunch of damage this video help me so much i just killed it man f this boss yeah i came here to say your thumbnail is really uncool man bad form youtuber did you use any nuts thank you for showing the final boss even if i dont click the video really cool to see my fav character olberic put to good use on that second phase such a powerful character with warmaster lol everyone is bitching about the thumbnail first hit of second part he use thunder and wipe oberyc and 40 all the squad you were lucky description calls for multiple characters to have the same battle tested gear as well as other single gear theres only one of each battle tested weapon per weapon either your description is wrong or the fast kill is bogus im lv 70 with all the gear and im not outputting this much damage jesus dude chill the fuck out i tried with olberic and i couldnt make the same damage and i have the same things you used maybe because your olberic had 1 lp and how begin the battle with 1 lp with olberic damn this is one hell of a strat this game is damn good hoping for dlcs whats the monster that hanits summon i just beated this boss by looking up his weaknesses reading that tressa is really useful with runeblader job and grinding the party until they were all lvl 80 it probably took me about 4060 min to beat it and now i see your video with job combinations i would never have considered as i thought such were bad or starting the 2nd phase with olberic at 1 health point so dam lucky i hate you amazing job thou nice strat wouldnt want to kill the boss that fast though the music for this boss is too good perfect soundtrack omg it took me at least 3 tries to beat this boss but yay i finally did it i like how this game lets you be creative and use different combinations of skills i beat it in 10 minutes with your guide lmao such weird secondary jobs i like it great fight you could perhaps kill him one turn earlier b ut it wowuld be akwards soafter you beat him no other story play comes in you just get some money and an item and go aboutlame this fight doesnt seem worth the trouble holy shitballz i just finished the eight paths but man i have no clue how you got here do you need to enter all eight of those secret shrines or something damnthanks for the thumbnail spolier thats pretty damn impressive i never even gave it a shot cause i heard it takes about an hour to do the final secret dungeon but after seeing this i will probably give it a shot httpsimgurcomgalleryavoaqxr i just had a fun 3 hour fight with this guy and you just wheee kudos happy i beat him though hey where is a second bishops staff i have one after completing liannas epilogue side quest in flamesgrace wow are you for real you duch was i the only one who expected the final boss to be some sort of octopus its amazing that you developed this strategy so smart you cant really beat this boss with a conventional setup unless you get to really high level where is the luckless sellsword dude i was biting my nails at the very end you got so lucky hello and tell me how you do for attack normal more than 4 times wow youtube algorithm just spoiled that boss great also please try to use spoiler free thumbnails and titles next time anyway ill write if this video is helping when im at that boss if i remember to edit this xd have a nice day why isnt olberic dying at 754 wouldnt it have been better to use memorial axe instead of death cleaver fucken whiners about spoilers noobs always whine pros just conquer through knowledge die you gen z scrubs with your tickleish sissy taints thanks i tried this combo and it did jack shit for me thank you so much its really helpful to me yeeeeees i was finally able to beat him omg omg omg i just used a chubby cait and galdera couldnt do anything what this much damage on 6570 what how i dont understand yay spoiler as a thumbnail thank you now im not going to play octopath traveler for like 5 months 3 as ive had my fucking ass handed to me 12 times nowi am only more infuriated to find i havent even made it to the second half of the fight yet thank you for this i used this to finish the boss i didnt have the belts items but it was still manageable since my team are in their high 60s its just not possible for me i tried this build which lowered the stats of my parties but i was dealing good damage no matter what tho somehow he always manages to kill whatever character i buffed like it knows that one character is about to attack so he kills him ahead of time i also broke his eye shield for once and right after that he brought two of those bodies back and got his shield back giving me no chance to attack i can really last a long time but once those three bodies appear thats when things go south i kill them and break their shields but nothing after hours of battling he still wipes the floor with i guess im just going to give up how can i block this shit spoil the fkn last boss in thumbnail why isnt there a youtube policy about this thanks to this video ive finally 100 completed octopath traveler really people are bitching about the final boss in the thumbnail you had a month to get to him before this video was uploaded its your fault for being slow i got to him in about 2 weeks and some of you are even complaining recently the game has been out since july 13th spoilers are out the window my friends imo the first phase is a lot more annoying than the second the second phase i took galdera out in 4 quick attacks please help me understand my characters are at higher levels than yours all sitting at 7072 with my mchaanit at 81 my equipment and gear all push my characters far above 500 in terms of attack power and elementals plus their defense my cyrus as sorcerer is sitting at 990 right now haanit is my warmaster and even using surpassing power and warmaster doesnt even do this much damage i dont understand how ppl with way lower stats and levels are causing that much damage i just tried this boss and my entire party got defeated by one fireball attack is there something i can equip to keep olberics hp low wow i have been farming lvls to close to 65 before i wanted to try for the boss guess i better go farm some items those r some sick damage i grinded all the way to level 70 and you decimate this thing with level 57s60 in 10 minuteshow the fuck how are the light runes doing so much damage exploiting game mechanics to the max i wish theyd give us the ability to fight again after beating the boss the game has no fights left that require more than a couple turns i want some decent fights to play with different setups did you really spoil the final bosss name and appearance in the thumbnail that is disgusting bybye i tried it its really effective especially the summons well done how does the runesword buff scale the damage so high i am really wondering how that damage formular looks and if it takes attack into account as well just want to say that its obvious galdera is the final boss if youve played everyones chapter 1 you call that a fast kill for phase 2 i killed him in only 2 turns and without even getting hit read more where you can find eliza this build helped me out i made some changes though equiped sp regen items since i didnt have multiple battle shields or mental bangles and gave alfyn dark guard made olberic the sorcerer hes lame team rogue ftw took me around 30min to cautiously widdle down both bosses final phase of eye almost wrecked me but olberic slapping the eyeball with a staff did the trick smooth sailing on 2nd boss only boss in the game where i gave in and consulted a guide on how to beat him holy shit this thing is well beyond ridiculous wait so i do this all the same except the critical boost is that whats making such a huge difference thanks for the spoiler thumbnail was about to comment asking for equipment and skills used on an impulse and the good lord said let there be a description section damn i thought id actually be able to avoid spoilers gg my 1st fight took 20 min but my party was all lvl 7080 and i was playing it safe to not lose a single member tressa as runeblade is a must for this fight httpshranisifkja25ulmdikoctofinal222311jpg ffs final boss in the thumbnail unlike and unsubscribed way to have your thumbnail as a huge spoiler terrible be a little more considerate i tried to avoid this but it still happened fuck the spoiler was much appreciated i turned down the character volume boy am i glad i did its so bad haha really sucks how i open youtube and see a huge image of the actual final boss of this game and im only 50 hours in and have 7 chapter 4s left to do i dont give a fuck about spoilers usually but for this game i really like the surprise element of seeing the final bosses for the first time and the intensity of the fight anyway lol how do you get to the final boss this boss took me almost 2 hours and it was 3am so i booted off the console and here you are doing it in a mere 10 minutes just fuck my spoilers up fam seriously this ruined my day i have put nearly 100 hours into this game before seeing this boss i consider this spoiler in the thumbnail so dislike however i watched the video so i know what im up against good job i guess how anyone can play turn based shit like this i do not know how in any universe is this fun too soon for final boss posts fake no one actually uses alfyn well damn last boss is spoiled now yes its been out a while but ive been taking my time woahhhhhh this boss looks fucking insane now i want to keep playing the game thanks youtube for putting this in my recommended dddddd now my chapter 2 ass is spoiled xdddddd holy crap thats a lotta damage i got this game day one but stop playing it i just dont have the patience to level up youre pretty good do you know how long it took me to beat this fucking boss this is so frustrating to watch but more epically satisfying so i forgive you did you really have to put the boss in the thumbnail not cool galdera who i dont know her not really fast kill when you waste turns just attacking normally well that video title was a spoiler and a half thanks youtube its pretty surreal to me that i will not only need to gear all eight of my travelers simultaneously with only one copy of each secondary job to be divided amongst all eight of them but i will also need to lead with a functioning party of my weaker four characters how do you get the physical belts and the elemental one also the gareth helmet thanks a lot is this the fastest strategy or are there other ones that are similarly quick this is a great guide but im screwed im too low lv where do i find the cats to lv up fast this boss took me over an hour are you shitting me soooo why was olberic at 1hp the whole time are you kidding me what took me 2 hours of work couldve been done in 10 minutes great strategy dude thanks for helping me conquer this fight this video but more importantly the strategy was exceptional where did you get the monster that has vorpal claw mh i was of the opinion you could skip the second add imunity phase tecnically speaking with sorceror bomb you can also kill the eye before right after the first add dies if you manage to break him in time i think skipping completely any shenanigans he does would you please list your class and equip choices in the description damn i thought my strat was pretty good but that was hella optimal i wish square would remake ff6 in the octopath engine hey man apparently i purchased the octopath demo a while back now i have the internet so i can download it when i go to the store and click in it threes no download button it just says purchase but thats greys out as ive already done this theres no download button what am i supposed to do any ideas after 3 hours i can continue playing the latest save i made even when i overpassed the 3 hours of the demo so whats the 3 hours demo theyre talking about im just starting everyones chapter 3 now its a game about 8 individual stories not really so much about the story of 8 travelers together which is sad for me but their stories are all pretty good to at least ok so far the visuals remind me of chrono trigger id wish it to be available on ps4 or at least pc im really excited for the full version i just wrapped up the three hour mark playing as olberic id just gotten to the merchant character before my three hour mark wrapped up spent too much time grindingforce of habitp in the demo i found the battle system to be great definitely cant go through battles mindlessly story seems to be pretty bland from what i could tell too this and smash are the only reasons ill get a switch this christmas season i didnt feel a vibe for this game but then i heard it was good so i downloaded the demo and wooow i started with primrose and felt in love with the game reminds me of chrono trigger with the music and ff6 chars stories cant wait i hate nintendo underpowered switch console you pretty much summed up my thoughts on the matter i havent been too hyped for this game primarily because i know whos developing it and ive already played two games by the team bravely default 1 and 2 they were amazingly average games with fun moments but hardly anything worth writing home about they left a lot to be desired outside of the job customization some of the dialogue was humorous but overall i was let down by the games the way youre describing octopath is how i felt about the demo and bd 12 this might just be a game for rpg starved switch fans or people without insane backlogs like my own i cant help but feel that other games are probably much more worth our time this year like tales of vesperia definitive edition and dragon quest xi i have this game preordered but im so torn about whether i should keep it it just feels so amazingly average once you look passed the graphics this game kind of reminds me of valkyrie profile in how the characters you recruit have their own self contained stories i hope that they have a point where the characters interact with each other to tie it all in so it makes sense im reserving my critique until the full product comes out therion is amazing you steal very useful items from npcs right from the beginning he can also evade alot of attacks i was kinda cool with the character shit if anything because its very ddesque to me as a gmplayer for all sorts of tabletops this actually has made the game resonate with me overall and sure if they crossover later and do more things thats fine but i get this i mean if people want more actual character interaction and stuff sure thats fine and if you want that its cool but im used to having to work part of it out myself and i personally enjoy that and how it plays out likely when i do a proper playthrough ill be playing therion first because his entire character makes more sense to me if you start the game as him as opposed to recruiting him later him or alfyn cause while alfyn is kinda lacking he makes sense to me hes the face hes the guy who gets himself involved or just wants to do shit and that makes sense why hed butt in on therion or therion begrudgingly asks for help because this is something he cant actually handle by himself for once after level ups heal all of your hp and mp so item management doesnt seem like it will be any concern i started my demo as the hunter and the dialogue is really bad for a cool game the writers just put th and st at the end of words and are trying to pass it off as old english its kind of terrible really im not sure if its the same for the other stories but at least for the hunter its odd and doesnt flow well im so excited to play the full release in only a few days thanks for giving your thoughts on the demo dark pixel gaming i thought your review was done very well and covered pretty much everything in the demo in terms of story i agree that primrose has the best followed by therions and ophilias story path great impressions video i wholeheartedly agree on how flat those character recruitments are its just not well tied together i do like the game overall just dont know if its worth a full 60 i mange to only get 5 character somehow i went into the demo expecting the game to be replayable in 8 different ways for each character the ability to recruit every character in one playthrough basically boils down to playing 8 tutorials of an hour length each which is pretty boring in my book the combat is as basic as it gets i must say im disappointed right now apparently they will make changes to the game based on the feedback to this demo what made my love bravley default was the character interactions and communication in an overarching plot coupled with great combat if it doesnt have a connecting character interactions thatll be a big blow to any recommendation i think the combat is satisfiable but nothing that made me stay though many wouldnt encourage comparisons to bravely default i dont believe its wrong to compare quality archetypes in rpgs to set a basic standard for this one great video made me realize some of the feelings i got when i played it like the difficulty being lower than the last demo and also the fact that they just randomly decide to team up it sticks out like a sore thumb when you go to recruit the thief i really want this game to be good i hope that this was just exclusive to the demo in regards to recruiting characters i thought the demo was insanely promising i see so much potential im hype really dark themes which surprised me ive only played primrose so far but wow i picked the apothecary alfyn i chose to go west towards the thieves beginning therion i found therions introduction to be believed as a reason as to why alfyn would want to team up with him im usually not a graphics whore but i really hate seeing big chunky pixels in hd just like how some people doesnt like the blur effect as it can be distracting its exactly how i feel regarding pixel art im fine with them on small lowres screen but in hd i feel like im wasting energy trying to determine what exactly im looking at is it a tree branch or a staff what emotion is being conveyed is that green pixel part of the outfit or part of the background let me say i love stylized games botw disgaea hollow knight xiii even bravely default but you wont ever find me playing snes or gba games on the big screen i believe square enix has the budget but cheapened out on the graphics heck if they made the characters have 2x more resolution id be very happy because as of right now they look like stick figures and paying 60 for such presentation is not up my alley this comes out as soon as my leave starts you already know what im finna be doin im usually not a graphics whore but did they really have to go with the pixel art style i really hate i dont know why i took the whole 3 hours to tressas story and barely recruiting primrose skipped the guy in between it might be easier combat wise but personally i felt rewarded for exploiting enemy weaknesses and especially with the boss fights timing coordinates attacks to break their defenses to prevent what would be devastating blows against my team its easy ish but its also fulfilling and while theres no signs of an over arching story yet this is the prologue i found each character had either a good enough story or was just plain likeable enough that i look forward to playing the game as a whole i couldnt disagree more especially with the combat its a lot better than it was in the first demo and its not boring whatsoever compared to the thousands of rpgs out there that put me to sleep literally everything you said was the exact opposite of how i felt about it and hopefully this video doesnt give people the wrong impression thank you for the take on okay storiesi literally fell asleep twice playing the demo its a cute little game but the story is meh yes i played primrose story the only mildly interesting story compared to alfyn and therions and based on your review definitely some other characters still its a bit too cliche also there was no background introduction to the world the story is set i thought it was less of a fantasy but just a middlecentury time themed game based on the initial feelsstoriesnpc dialogues then all of a sudden there are these fantasy monsters even magic abilities characters can use i love fantasy and magic stuff but this just felt annoyingly out of blue for me and the combat system no info on enemies at all donk know what random creatures they are apart from their names cant see their hpstatus during fight at all and wtf is that enlarged image of boss human characters like the butler therion had to fight i think this game has its good thou what in the battlesystem of bravely default is better than the system in octopath traveler i found the brave and default options to be very boring and most of the time they were meaningless i agree that octopath traveler should scale up the difficulty later in the game or have an harder mode weird when i played the demo i didnt think abouth the way other partymembers join you now i have to agree that this feels wrong and could be resolved a lot better therion primrose and therion are the best story wise by far they actually changed the combat when you break an enemy in the first demo you could break the enemy without them able to attack after because they needed to recover but now with the second demo they attack no matter what after they been broken which makes the combat more alive instead of just standing and breaking your enemy like in the first demo hope they keep improving the game the only things i dont like is that its 60 and not like 40 and i havent seen any character interactions between the main crew i hope they have conversations later in the story cuz they are really cool characters so everyones playthrough is exactly the same with the exception of their opening chapter i was expecting it to be more like saga frontier on psone im a pokmon fan at heart but the last couple of games have been lackluster to say the least once i heard about octopath traveler i was super excited and i hoped that it would be a great rpg that would quench my thirst for pokmon after playing halfway through the demo i can strongly say that this was extremely fun and a very pleasant surprise this is a great game and i will definitely pick this game up once it comes out i think this will be at least one of my top 3 favorite games this year and maybe even one of my top 3 games for the switch only time will tell but i have faith it will deliver i appreciate your review not being bullshit all good i felt a lot of the same sans the insight about the previous iteration of the demo this is probably going to be the first jrpg ive played in a long time between the visual and sound design and the well written stories not to mention the well balanced cutscenes its too early to completely judge this game based off of a 3 hour demo each character has chapters and i do believe that the story of why they all joined forces will come together once the full game is out but i feel like in order to completely understand why they came together is to read every thing and look at all stories there has to be a bigger purpose for why they journeys all intertwine sodo you even actually like the game you said you do but nearly everything you say is negative i personally love the game and found the stories really enticing especially cyrussdont really understand your problem with his story am i the only one having serious issues getting passed the dungeon bosses like seriously hard time you do know that cyrus is being followed by the men with the mark of the crow right this is the game that came out in 1996 on the nintendo playstation cd i hope this game sells well i really do i want to see more turn based games jrpgs with this art style again am i the one person that loves tressa and chose her absolutely gorgeous game really cant under sell it i agree a lot with the review in the way that octopath traveller is a great game but feels like it didnt grasp its potential to become a timeless classic and it definitely hashad that potential that being said im judging it off a 3h demo the devs have gone on record to say that the characters will have interactions with each other presumably we dont see them in the demo but they will start to appear in the full game after the first chapter of each characters story i thought this would be lightyears better than i am setsuna and lost sphear and be greater than bravely but it feels like a simplistically cheaper versionnot feeling it i think il just wait a month for dq11 and play secret of mana remake in meantime god and im already underwhelmed by fire emblem 3 houses i find that the character interaction is similar to side quest characters hey can you help thanks i like to think they stick around afterwards just because theyre all too socially awkward to figure out how to say they have to leave lol bro your three hours in give it a chance imagine how i felt when i started with ophelia and went straight to recruiting therion and seeing her then join his quest to steal something so nonchalantly i actually love cyrus story but then again i only got his and the merchant i think its because i played a scholar in a tabletop campaign it was actually a mid evil pokemon rp and i played an up and coming professor but it struck a cord with me i am excited to see the others if they are even better i do wish that the characters interacted more but this game got my imagination going enough that i made up my own character interactions which i quite enjoyed knowing how bavely defaults story was with 4 different characters i bet this one wont be dissapoing also bravely defaults title had a couple of meanings and twists i wouldnt be surprised if this was also the case for octopath traveler speaking about addin another layer for combat just ask all those stupid players who cried after the first demo that it was too difficult anyways dont you think the graphics has gotten worse what a debby downer i played the demo and loved it dont give a damn about settings no console even try to give you or that a game isnt darksouls levels of difficulty if the game is enjoyable and i like the game for what it is its great im glad they dialed the combat difficulty back a bit the enemies in the first demo were damage sponges soaking up ridiculous amounts of abuse the bosses in particular it wasnt even that it was truly hard both bosses had pretty simple move rotations to figure out but you had to go through those rotations like a dozen times that wasnt fun it was tedious yes i agree with all what you say the gameplay combat graphics and so on are so good im looking forward to this game the game is unfortunately hyped on the back of the fact its a switch exclusive and the userbase is starved for jrpgs or games in general this half yearthe game is nowhere near as good as the general opinion is making it out to be the savior of the genre in modern times i was expecting a more like dragon age i liked the game so far but it looks so blurry thats really annoying in my opinion i hope they fix that else i will skip it im leaning more on the side that theyre intentionally leaving the characters transition into the party out so that not everything is actually included in the demo it just wouldnt make sense in this day and age for any sort of rpg to have such a stale means of character recruitment despite that im still looking forward to this game the character s should have diolauge but gameplay makes me want to play it more i really disliked how theres virtually no interaction between the party members i really hope that changes once you have all characters or something like that because if theyre otherwise just walking rpg roles and statistics that get a speaking role when doing their specific quests ill be really disappointed and yeah i found that depthoffield effect to be way too aggressive same as in the first demo almost got four characters by the way started with alfyn the apothecary and made my way east picking up primrose and olberic ive seen both of their stories before but i figured getting a healer buffer and tank would be a solid start so i skipped primroses prologue and rushed through olberics just to remember if there were any details beyond he got betrayed almost made it to tressa but at least i saved in her hometown so im ready to go once the game comes out the dev says that you can finish one of the characters without recruiting another character i agree this is a little disappointing for me i thought it would like wild arms that each character have their prolog and background and eventually have a bigger issue to solve together between character damn it why doesnt sony get these games might get a switch to play this ive seen people who played the game at e3 who said the difficulty was much harder in the full build of the game they thought so is this a more story driven game with a deep plot or light plot focusing on a character each time so visuals are great music is nice story is somewhere there characters exist meh i was hoping that the character interactions would be the driving force of the game so far there doesnt seem to be a grand overarching story while i do enjoy the combat ill agree that it does feel too simplistic and is perhaps targeting a casual audience the games strongest aspect is definitely its presentation which feels like im looking at a 3d set one thing i wish they implemented are some character portraits next to the dialogue like in fire emblem this video is the best impressions video ive seen everybody else is riding the wave great game but not perfect primroses story is what convinced me to buy the game the game is great but it needs banter with the characters or else they just feel like they join some travelers just because they happen to stop by the characters town other than that i love the game so far btw tge theif had the best story eeeeh still gonna buy it not every game has great story but if the gameplay is good then im good i downloaded the demonot expecting much i wasnt an initial fan of the directions theyve takenafter playing the demo i love it cant wait to get my hands on the complete onejust need to stop myself from doing so before i complete my current back log so can i travel the world and recruit any character at any time or are there to many high level areas to go through to zigzag i started with tressa and went south i somehow skipped over the warrior and started primroses story instead i didnt intend to skip the warrior though so just curious as u get more charaters in your party the levels of the dungeons increase its interesting i really truly hope square doesnt go the live a live route for this game i mean just having 8 stories to unravel without any central plot might be what we get but then why would square set the game like that 8 characters in the same world at the same time unfortunately i think there will be no middle ground for this game storywise it will either be the best story the switch will have for a really long time or one of the most disappointing story square ever produced i managed to get a full party of four in my play through and it could have been due to rushing but the 4th boss was actually hard to beat so i think that the difficultly will ramp up going forward zero interaction between characters if i was sure to buy it before now im meh not worth all those bucks after playing smt strange journey redux this demo just felt like a very basic rpg ill wait for a full review before buying it so its 2018 saga frontier i chose the hunter for the demo and seriously stopped playing bc the ridiculous use of ye olde english a fight starts and she says letten the hunt beginnen i hope the entire games characters dont speak like that or i may have to skip this one similar gameplay to breath of fire how do i get the demo its good that this game is complete and that it wont be getting dlc this game has way too much dialogue so much talking holy shit why so much talking i kept waiting for the game to start proper and i realized this is it this is the game 1010 best small talk simulator of the year would chat with npcs instead of having actual adventure again will this game only be on switch started alfyns story first chapter ends on a im gonna help people all over the world note then when he meets therion 10 minutes later oh you want to steal something and killmaim a few dozen people in a process yeah sure ill help like why thats so against his established character and even more therion who turned down help form a pair of fellow thiefs just a minute ago because i work alone suddenly is yeah sure lets go together best writing ever i really want to like this game but im getting no mans sky vibe there is zero character interaction both in demo and in any highlevel plays theyve been showing recently its not just meeting that is a dissapointment characters dont even appear in cutscenes after that only the one whos story is in progress couldnt they at least put a single line for each character to comment a situation even mass effect andromeda did that for gods sake i sure hope its just for the first c theres a chance of character interaction being in the full game the devs might have not included it since it is three hours and wanted people to get to experience this game i think its important to remember that this is a demo amazing game but bravely default octopath traveler i wonder if speedrunners will ever be able to get a sub 3hour time and be able to beat the demo i mean itd be incredibly difficult to write 7 different dialogue paths and thats if you want to go the simplest route of each character has a believable dialogue with each other character about joining the party also if youre playing through their introduction portion of their story its like theyre telling your current party how they got to where they are right before the first dungeon so youre basically playing through all of that dialogue i think its a unique way to tell a story with out dialoguebut i can see its not the most obvious thing nor is it readily understood immediately to a broad audience after that introduction portion of the story and they say something to the effect of wow thanks for agreeing to help me with my dilemma then its just a matter of accepting the fact that you are playing the role of someone who is really helpful and is willing to assist in their current problem i think its brilliant way to tell a story through both dialogue an sadly there goes the 1010 hopefully this is the only flaw the game will have there was an article the other day that did say there would be interactions between the characters they probably dont show up until youve gotten the whole team together which is why there will probably not be that many at the start i also dont agree with your complaint about the lack of urgency in some characters like cyrus stories not every character has to be out to save the world or some other dramatic thing i think its refreshing to see some characters who go out just because they want to go on a journey or want to find something like the ancient tome in cyrus case you proceeded in this demo the exact opposite way i did i went from hanat to ophelia and finished with cyrus i used to play jrpgs back in brasil on my ps1 and snes when i could barely speak any english still i enjoyed the hell out of the games story in games is a massive overrated thing i just want to play something beautiful challenging an with great music cool indie game is the mini map new played all of them and can agree primerose has the best prologue out of everyone i find it sad that the saga series makes you feel more like your with a group of travelers than this game so far from the demoi mean the merchant girls first boss are basically thieves so youd think shed at least say something if you recruited the thief character my final impressions after playing the demo beautiful looking rpg that is best suited fore beginnernovice players of the genre i completely agree with your assessment of introducing the characters to one another i really felt like something big was missing in the story thinking ok so theyre in my party now although there are 8 characters with different path options every two of them are actually have the similar path functions for example allure and guide are the same so does the rest of pairs which was quite a disappointment for me and i also have the same feeling about the combat there are only 8 weapon style in the game and each character has 2 weapon skill so there are overlapping among the characters i am not sure this is a good thing which makes the combat easy and characters less unique however i really enjoy the music and visual effects are stunning i really want this jrpg game to be great you cant judge everything from a demo they already said therell be character interactions in the full game this was merely the prologue portion cant believe its not saga when i started the demo i chose haanit and enjoy it her capture mechanic reminds me of a a way better version of gau from ff6 it was fun but i got to the boss and quickly died because i was underleveled i was kinda put off by the difficulty so i went to alfyn who had easier gameplay lucked out there i was really invested in his story and he is probably my favorite character so faras far as story and personality i recruited primrose and love her story and personally cant wait to see more of it her buffs along with her path action made her a very valuable member to have probably the best character to play if you want a taste of what this game can offer olberic had a kinda generic story but his gameplay is great his abilities offer great variety with multiple weapons strength buffs speed buffs aoe attacks and even using brave to buff his defense i had the most fun with him by far tressa was really solid too her story was enjoyable but not as good as alfyn or primro also ophelia is standing ther but sayss he needs to go to the cave but doesnt want to go alone will you come with so youre helping out after that they join you and maybe if we get them all we might get a snippet of dialog or something you must have skipped a lot of dialog all 8 paths are intertwined honits master went missing but was recuted by some knights mabe conection to the people with the crow tats to go hunt a red eyed monster a connection of the god that wanted to rule opelia its relates there are 12 gods of the realm one god wanted to rule but one god stopped that god the soclar talks about a town that was destroyed 8 years ago primroses town no one knows what its religion was like and that missing book from the library might hold the answer well ill say this in favor of the game i took a look at the demo trailer today and i went and bought a switch so that i can be ready for it when it comes out with it being the opening chapter of every character of course its going to look like you started a brand new game with them its not like when you choose your first character they get any help whats so ever i feel like after the first chapter it will open up the dialogue some more in a game like this its hard to make it flow the way you want it to story wise on the first chapter since its inherently the individual characters story and we knew this was the case when it was first revealed maybe in the end there will be a big bad boss you have to pursue after all the characters main campaigns i do hope once the first chapter of all the characters are over the other chapters will include them i think once we get more characters it will add more depth like hannits capture skills breaking enemies i think id say its style over substance thou maybe the combat is easier because youve got that time limit id say they want you to experience the story as much as possible and that is why the combat is easier but honestly idk i wish the characters jumped forward and attacked i loved ff6 and accepted this as a hardware limitation i suppose but these days i wanna see my character actually move up and smash the thing i mean come on they even attacked in golden sun on gba well whatever im usually willing to look past that if the story is supremely entertaining like ff6but characters just joining because the system asks you if they should join come oooon its 2018 i thought this was a modern game with old school graphics and feel from a aaa developer definitely went from a i have to have this to a well see after the demo dont rage at me for having an opinion im a 31 year old die hard jrpg fan and i just expected a little more im just wondering if in the full game we will get more classes because as it stands for a 80 to 100 hour game 8 classes doesnt seem enough expecially when they dont really have that many unique skills i kinda wish they release this in vita sounds like you didnt find the combat challenging enough i noticed the same when starting as cyrus weaknesses are easily exposed and exploited with his abilities all aoe when starting as tressa in my second run i had a bit more of a challenge at the start picked up cyrus after haha hoping the difficulty fluctuates throughout the game i also was a bit unimpressed by the lack of a connecting thread when meeting new travellers hoping this unfolds more as well in the full game great vid so its saga frontier without the battle system i went for therion haanit and ophilia therion was my favorite in terms of writing and begin of the story what i wonder is if for example ophilia and therion have special interactions as cleric and thief they should definitely have some conversations about right or wrong just as a simple example i dunno i wish for some interactions like ophilia sometimes asking you how you could do that and that its a sin and therion being completely ignorant or sth like that the first demo killed any excitement i had for this game generic stories uninteresting game mechanics really only the graphics were cool but the game was just not fun or interesting if you love oldschool jrpgs then why focus to much on the difficulty i have played rpgs for over 28 years ff6 chrono trigger and suikoden 2 masterpieces but they arent hard games and thats fine this is a demo dont focus on that too much project octopath is no dq 11 quality ofc but it looks really good music gameplay and story most important things not how difficult a jrpg is so youre saying this isnt the dark souls of jrpgs haha i think whats most concerning is people thinking they have it all figured out after 3 hours of gameplay in what jrpg ever does anyone ever have the whole game figured out in the first 3 hours i thought it was a bit too hard for my liking still gonna buy it day one but i am pretty sure they were looking to have a mix of not so easy that you can mash a in wild encounters but not so hard where a fan like me who doesnt want to make encounters that big of an affair idk if they meet it well it might be too hard for people like me in the end but too easy for hardest of hard cores very good and unbiased reviewimpression youre a generous man if you still think the writing is pretty good after reading haanits dialogue to be fair this might not actually be the case in the final game some things are altered for the sake of it being a demo is this going to be a full price title because it looks like a neat little indie game for which id pay 15 or even 20 bucks but certainly not 50 or 60 great video you covered a lot of things i was wondering about especially how the characters tie together i actually decided to pass on the demo as i felt and still feel like it will take away to much of the game for me so i just prefer to play it on release just the video i was waiting for i loved the demo cant wait for this game this looks gorgeous any game that have more then 2 characters is usually bad let alone 8 but hopes up for the gameplay romancing saga much saga frontier much so its an above average game not bad but not as much as the hype maybe this game will be a hype killed type game hmph i did like how the original game seemed a little difficult new games have gotten really easy i do hope the battle system evolves since it was really easy to figure out from the demo is it just me or is the game a little too hard honestly that really caught me off guard i thought when i first met a second traveler that they was a side character part of their story but it was actually a whole other traveler lol whats the name of the mellotron song at 820 at this point i kinda wish they just made a game about primrose didnt do what they did to that girl at the opening of her story and had her be your second party member after you beat the boss just go on this tale that is more personal maybe themed around women dealing with different pretty serious issues cuz that seems to be where they were strongest so far im still really excited for the final game this is pretty much exactly what i was expecting i think the writing is really good overall and its nice to not be playing as an amnesiac teenager who is destined to save the world from an ambiguous evil force i am really interested to know how the game proceeds will it just be helping random villagers and progressing each individual playable characters story will the pcs ever acknowledge each others existence or once you unite the 8 characters will a grand overarching story begin octopath traveler is a day 1 purchase for me regardless of the answers but those answers and the execution will certainly determine if this is a good or a great game i love this game but it sucks that ill take a while to be released thank you for your insight ive been looking for an updated review on the new demo im so pumped for this game im waiting until the full release and am skipping this new demo while im a little bummed that there is no story or dialogue as to why people are joining your party it doesnt make me any less excited im interested to see how the real thing plays out after playing both demos this game has me both concerned but optimistic at the same time i dont know if ill pick this up right away and even if the reviews arent flawless id still be wiling to play it solely because i had fun with what was presented so far as for the overall story ive played other games with bad to god awful stories before not saying that this games story is bad mind you but still ending up having a lot of fun playing them and in the end thats why i play video games to have fun is it 3 hours total or 3 hours each character i completely disagree loving the demo this might be the best jrpg in years i kinda feel like they will tie the characters stories together later in the game and its almost like in the early chapters having the other character isnt canon in the story its just like a gameplay mechanic which is kinda weird but they would have had to come up with a silly amount of scenarios if each time you meet a character it tied them together right away considering you can obtain the characters in any order like you could say this is lazy but i dont find it to be fatal considering i like the idea of just experiencing each characters story in any order and with any team you want for all the people curiousworried about a potential absence of a unified storyline and character interactions i say dont be i dont think i can get into too much detail but from what ive seen from the demo and whats been theorized out of these observations there is definitely going to be an overarching story that will unite the stories together i recommend checking out the octopath traveler subreddit as there is a lot of really smart speculation going on there that makes sense edit just dont be too pessimistic or optimistic stay neutral and keep your expectations realizable im sure there is an overarching story that develops as you play this type of interaction is not surprising to me i will recommend all of you guys the saga frontierromancing saga suikoden games in which characters joining and interaction is separated from each other and rarely intertwine it is a choice of character design that focuses on single storytelling rather than character interaction and in my opinion it feels more organic and kinda natural in a roleplaying game in fact i think the only reason they put them together is for gameplay mechanics but i can understand that if you had higher expectations of this it could be kinda dissapointing just open your mind and take it as a different way of telling a story i cant stand the art direction of this game 16bit sprites on top of polygon background was always a hard to sell for me but this ugly mix of 3d and sprite base style is just super tacky and the added visual effects do not help an rpg giving you the freedom to go where ever and having a compelling storyline that weaves 8 perspectives together is what was advertised but if youve ever been on the game design side of things youd know that shit is impossible especially when given time and budget constraints from what i can tell i dont think the stories are actually linked think of it as an ooc gathering of party members with only one character actually being in focus at a time well see i guess i feel like such a spoiled child when im disappointed in the fact that the enemies dont animate their attacks they just flash white the game looks really good minus most texturing but i guess thats the point im really getting that breath of fire vibe and i know the devs work with a small team and a small budget but i also feel that animating the attacks is the least they could do sounds like a 90s rpg the story wasnt too big a concern for me but the aesthetics and combat was the big draw i can say with certainty that it gets more difficult by the levels assuming its the same in the full game and not recruiting the other characters is gonna add difficulty to the thing though for some i guess they would ask why you would do that my experience with the difficulty came with me accidentally killing a cait and getting a huge exp gain that put me in the midteens 16 and 14 for haanta and alfyn so i thought that i could try one of the dungeons around olberics place danger level 15 and i was practically destroyed after one combat better gear couldve helped but not having the other members to cover certain team positions or a lack of materials really made it difficult people always complain individual characters stories never get enough focus and the overarching done to death plot takes front and centre now heres a game all about individual characters stories and all i see are people bitching about oh muh grand story muh overdone party member relations wahhh jesus christ unclench your collective buttholes and be willing to try a different method of story presentation for more than a three hour demo i know it was only 3 hours worth of demo i but feel like octopath traveler is less likely to shoot itself in the foot than bravely default ended up doing not gonna lie but bravely default got pretty boring around the 2030 hour mark for me lmao i honestly thought the demo was just to allow you to play all 8 characters first chapter and i was like woe thats huuuge then when those 3 hours came up i was sad haha look who didnt read that warning slow enough im looking forward to the full release something about this game does feel like an evolution on the saga games and ff vi kind of era of jrpgs like what if ff vii didnt get made id imagine octopath to be a game that would be made for that style of final fantasy octopaththe game that looks exactly how i pictured in 1999 games would look in the futureexactly the rpg looks i like and ive been wainting to get for years wah wah waaaahhhh the game is way better than youre making it out to be legend of legacy on the 3ds had more party member interaction than the demo for this game did by that i mean they actually had a conversation i worry that each characters storyline will be unaffected by the rest of the party and the other protagonists will be nothing more than combat allies until its time for their turn in the spotlight when i started as haanit and recruited therion and defeated the chapter 1 boss of his story the narrative played out as if haanit were never there and this was some kind of solo scenario akin to swtors class plot missions i pray that im wrong the power of nostalgia why should we look for new ways to play when we can play exactly like almost 30 years ago is there any confirmation that this is how the full game will play considering that gameplaystory in demos can often be altered for the sake of being a demo im hesitant to believe that the full release would have characters literally standing out in the open to be recruited with little interaction ill remain optimistic that the full game will be much more fleshed out not enough character interaction once again we seem to have another jrpg that is lacking in the writing department i know this is just the demo and the overall impression can stil change once the full game comes out but why dont the developers play a few games for benchmarking purposes persona 5 and tales of berseria were great in terms of characters and they came out not too long ago i wonder whats the process and goals they set up for a games story to be honest extremely limited character interaction like this is what i thought was to be expected in this kind of jrpg seems like a lot of people were expecting much more i have to agree it was rather jarring to see no character interaction i wonder how that will be addressed in the full game another game that you covered on here the alliance alive which i played through had a big cast of characters but were introduced and felt as if they impacted the plot and other characters within i was hoping for another interwoven character driven jrpg but i suppose keep an eye on things before preordering i hope it will be different in the final version because it would be extremely disapointing otherwise they advertised this game so much about these 8 characters crossing path and going on a big adventure and here they just are some random character you can recruit i started with ophelia and played around 2h with her alone combat wasnt easy fighting against the first boss with her and a summon took me a couple of tries i enjoyed her story although its a little exposition heavy my main concern right now is precisely how the 8 characters come together and if theres an overarching narrative wait so do the main characters interact with each other at all not as deep as bravely default bravely default wasnt deep it was gimmicky this either speaks to this games shallowness or just my definitions differing from this dudes hoping for the latter i only played through tressas story but i really enjoyed it so far its a lot more lighthearted and fun than at least olberic and primroses were i really do hope the game story isnt tied solely to each character hopefully there is an overarching narrative to tie things together about the combat ive been saying for a while since the first demo that the combat was too easy it doesnt have enough layers because the bravely system theyre borrowing is too straight forward and i assume enemies cant stock turns either im still looking forward to the game though i remember when it was wholely known that jrpgs took a while to get going persona 5 was fucking amazing but the first several hours were a fucking slog have a bit of patience good gameplay can carry a meh story until it really gets rolling welp the way you recruit other characters is very disappointing just go and talk to them i was expecting this epic tale where depending on who you first chose they would have a different story at the beginning on the way they would join you but nope add ophelia to party what a fucking let down i did haanit for an hour or so the other day i actually found the dialogue pretty annoying i should probably try a different character before i decide if i wanna pick this up nice 15 game at best to be honest ive never been expecting much in the story department from this game maybe it will improve once all the characters are collected but at least at the start it seems to me that the gimmick of the eight characters and their distinct stories lends to an overall sense of gameiness it would be rather difficult to provide the option of collecting the characters in any order like the game promises you can and also provide reasonable and meaningful reasons why they all team up i would have preferred for them to fall on the side of depth of writing and character rather than game gimmicks but whatever it looks like it will be a fun rpg just not a spectacular one i hate how they moved the black box window on the new demo during combat it blocks the inputs under it and slows down combat specially with multiple party members old demo the box was further right ophilias story is my reason to play this game xd i feel like they really focused on telling 8 individual stories and 8 different journeys hence octopath 8 different paths people joining your party seems to just be filler for battles and an over arcing story might not even come into play until the end half or less of the game i actually like that we are getting 8 stories for the price of one because many rpgs tend to have filler characters or cool characters that never get any spotlight or much backstory was hoping this would come to pc otherwise ill need to get a switch i agree with most of your critiques but the initial demo wasnt balanced well imho i died to helgenish at least 3 times before reading that i had to grind a few more levels to beat him and even then it was a jawclencher in the recent demo i only died once between all 8 prologues but i still felt like they were satisfying im on board with you on the music though of all the new town and area themes only one didnt leave me feeling in awe and even that one was passable i think its shaping up to outdo bravely defaults soundtrack which is one of my absolute favorites as for the story i dont have my expectations set too high but im cautiously optimistic there will be more interaction between protagonists and a slightly more unified story later on well definitely see come next month i remember them saying that they wanted the game to be true role playing its possible that they want this to be a build your own adventure type of game like u can interact with other characters stories but the one that really matters is the one u mained im loving the demo so far the story and game play are awesome so far if its anything like the bravely games itll turn out a masterpiece players cant simultaneously expect open world style freedom and a tight storyline look at breath of the wild the devs arent going to spend an inordinate amount of time writing an exponential number of possible character interactions and storyline changes for the 8 characters and all the possible parties and sequence of encounters and youre judging an 80 hour game from a 3 hour demo which has been stripped of content cmon i know some people have played so many jrpgs that pretty much all new jrpgs suck for them and they have strong opinions about everything from how the english vo sucks to writing and gameplay but im more willing to trust the vision and experience of the devs in all cases especially this one you can turn off corner shadows in the menu to get rid of that lens effect it still has some blur in cutscenes but the main game looks much better i started my game as therion the thief and his story seems really good and im intrigued by how its going to evolve however primroses story seems better the blur effect is called tilt shift there are ways to do it well and ways that dont look so well personally i like the lego set look it gives most areas i found combat to be more difficult the more you play many encounters are scaled to your level and how many party members you have im really hoping that the stories will eventually combine or overlap in some way itd be a huge shame if its just 8 generic rpg plots with no connection to each other in a few story arcs it seems as if 15 years ago a lot of things happened for a lot of characters the mechanics visuals and audio are good enough to play like an etrian odyssey game where youre not in it for a complicated story but its kind of sad to think that the bravely default team would run so quickly from narrative like this in essence itd make this title no different from i am setsuna or lost sphere except with better presentation in fact id prefer the character interactions and dialogue of those i was also disappointed when i realized the characters dont actually meet each other in the story but i kind of expected it to be the case even if theres only dialogue between the new recruit and the party leader thats still 56 unique scenes they would have to write only 7 of which a player could ever see on any given playthrough from a development standpoint thats a horrendously bad return on investment they couldve and shouldve written a bit more to explain it maybe have generic dialogue and just tweak it slightly to fit the character voices a la chrono cross but i cant say its anywhere close to a dealbreaker for me im not sure how to feel about the combat yet i enjoyed playing this demo slightly less and it does feel like they toned the difficulty back a bit too much based on feedback from the first one but it is only the first chapter of the game im really hoping that the difficulty curve picks up quickly in the full game im taking a week off from work to play this this is very concerning to me i was expecting a great story that tied all the characters arcs together in a meaningful way im thinking the battle mechanics will be augmented by use of those other menu tabs in the menu screen the combat asis will get stale if they dont throw another mechanic or two in along the way im still really positive about this game though well thats dissapointing really weird that the characters just say hey lets go together and beat some shit together they need to rewrite this it will be cool if they adopt mana khemia battle mechanic what you think of both bravely default games do you recommend both to be honest i cant say anything about the stories so far just because primroses story started good doesnt mean it wont get worse and so as for the others the story might get more interesting and it has potential to be the combat gets difficult but not in a stupid way i have played the game and collected the all the characters and i can say the difficulty is to my liking not too difficult but it provides challenge as i said the demo is like less than 10 of the game and i cant judge now but most of the things i saw i liked and will hold my thoughts until the full release really excited for this game i will definitely wait for the full release on a side note am i the only one who thinks the last song is very similar to xenoblade chronicles 2 friendship song i loved this demo so much more complete than the first one this type of game is right up my alley probably the game im most excited for this year i was very impressed with what i play loved the combat and story presentation my one gripe is i wish the colors were brighter without the darkness around the edge of the screen i also agree with your point about how the characters dont come together naturally but it didnt bother me as im wondering if that is fleshed out more when we get the full game what a shame same as the bravely series story was just very lame and combat was too easy i think many people forget how much ramp up time some of the older jrpgs took to get really interesting at least for me im staying positve that they had the 3 hour limit for a reason to not get too far into some of the plot details in a demo 415 the writing in general is pretty good nonooooo it is not by your own words in a different podcastvideo bad writing is as you may already know exposition dumps this game is chock full of really really bad dialog writing i agree on the character interaction stuff i wonder if the thought was that by the time you recruit your 4th character there would just be too many dialogue options from a math perspective i think as long as they had the party leader and the new recruit interacting even that would go a long way for me im not totally against the way it is now though even the path actions require some filling in the blanks from an rping perspective still the demo did nothing but make me even more excited for the full release and i think its safe to say that im going to love it maybe i just wish it was even more ambitious with its storytelling ill pass i dont like the way it looks or the battle system as a teenager i played ffx and golden sun as my first jrpgs i remember thinking of all the great similar games that existed and would come out in the future somehow they cant surpass those amazing games and i dont think it is pure nostalgia either are you forced to recruit the other characters or does the game allow them to be skippable even if you miss some characters that wouldnt excuse the lack of effort ffvii had great scenes for vincent and yuffie this is more a question of curiosity this is exactly how i felt for this 2nd demo i liked primrose story so much that i didnt even try olberic to not spoil it for myself i was expecting everyones story to be on primroses story level is there a way to send any feedback to the developers im sure they are interested in fan opinion before the release took me awhile to get into it but the game is enjoyable to play good presentation and music i dont expect chrono trigger or anything here i have a feeling that there will be a sense of accomplishment once everybodys stories are sorted out i also found it really disappointing that the characters just join each other it was the cheap option i guess i hope at least that the story turns out to be good in the end im actually curious about this game lately ive been getting games because i feel like i should but this may actually be nice also its been so long since i played a game i dont know a lot about before hand i miss the old days of discovery and wonder reminds me of paper mario the best art style of this generation keep up the good work mike and co loving the videos i need them in my life and im looking forward to this game too also looking forward to your chrono cross review even though ive never played either looks too much like valkyrie profile but thats not necessarily a bad thing thats an interesting plot hole you noticed im wondering if they can or will fix it before release that could really hurt the immersion in any case this seems like the classic jrpg ive been waiting for for years now the struggle is real for a 30 year old gamer who doesnt like multiplayer reflexes not what they used to be and hearing 12 year old girls cursing at me makes me lose faith in the whole medium aha but is it sound vibrations in the air are translated to sound by our ears but if there are no ears is it sound or just vibration dont underestimate tressa jon get her give bp ability and hired help those two abilities define the merchant and makes her a grade a support character shes actually one of the best choices for main character whom you cant remove because give bp just lets her effective give her turn to someone else everybody talks up how dangerous the journey is for ophilia its literally just walking between towns like this dangerous journey is what tressa was planning on doing for fun swearing live stream is the best live stream hearing jon say fuck is incredibly satisfying was only going to watch an hour then i end up watching the whole damn thing lol huh take the frist letter of each their names its party toco whats with the wierdly awkward pauses between each line of dialogue yeah dont need to play fall out 76 to know its trash lol but you do you baby just suggest that you dont get too pissy about people disliking a random vid every now and then ophelia guides the citizens unto olbrics waiting fist its all connected can you charge up the spells like you do melee attacks if not magic seems a lot weaker than just bashing a creatures head in octopath traveller or how olbric kidnapped us and forced us to duel and teabag innocents nobody john did i mention i speak latin oh yes yes yes yes wanted to go to be fit for tomorrow but screw this carry this on next stream do they fix audio in battles later or is it loud mess whole time female cock blocking did you mean beaver damming hey what is the game they are talking about at 10827 the one they didnt get a promo code for i cant make out what the name of it is over the game sounds and im curious which game it is love this game at least octosemita would have been a bit less obvious and more mysterious i hate the apothecary character because despite him and the cleric both being healers i believe ophilia is better because her job class has an ability that heals the entire party he uses ff8 the most understated of the final fantasy games as the example of final fantasy melodrama odd choice see now i know this is an unpopular opinion but im pretty sure other than the graphics that looked like paper mache over dogshit ff7 was the last good one especially the gameplay and story and atmosphere arguably tied for best one with 6 8 9 and 10 is where they just became more and more like all the bad anime ideas garbled up and stuffed into a flashy catlitter box imagine thinking ff7 and ff10s environments are visual diarrhea that arent readable big oof the irony is that actually apothecary lad is arguably the best main character since his higher level from not being able to switch out means he can find secrets from talking to people earlier and because his alchemy is the best support power ever said support power can really really speed up those lengthy boss fights too so i think yahtzee cheated himself by ignoring alphyn probably has the same name in japanese it seems to be a thing in japan that they make foreignlanguage titles with a word they can pronounce paired with a word no japanese person can pronouce it makes the name catchy and memorable want to waste 80 on an old game me either 030 also yahtzee the letters of octopath are also the first letters of the eight characters names kinda off topic but i feel like chrono triggers combat system doesnt get appreciated much i mean first of all no random encounters every enemy in the game appears on the over world and when combat begins it takes place in that space rather than that stupid transition to featureless pocket dimension bullshit final fantasy does second combat doesnt necessarily have to be turn based theres an option to allow all participants in battle to have their turn as soon as their action meter is filled so long as youre not in the tech menus which brings me to the best thing about the combat the techs the techs most of a characters techs can be used to wipe out multiple enemies if targeting the right one at the right time cronos starting tech for example cyclone can hit multiple enemies in a circle surrounding the initial target and luccas flamethrower which can hit multiple targets in a straight line provided you target the enemy at the end of that line those tw yahtzee what exactly is 8wayseduction 024 024 achtwegeverfhrung how did yahtzee come up with that d eight ways to seduce are we sick of the pixel art bullshit yet at first it may have been making a statement on the overemphasis on graphics in modern gaming but its starting to feel lazy i dont mind using sprites and static background images but can we at least scale them up so they dont look like shit on my 60 tv like how scyther in jp is literally slash only in a japanese accent so whatever you do dont pick apothecary lad first oops 05 i havent even played videogamedunkey has a little something for everyone how did i know yahtzee would like chrono trigger best jrpg ever hands down no contest honorable mentions go to ff6 ff7 legend of dragoon dragon warrior 7 dragon quest 8 and golden sun is golden sun a jrpg i actually dont know it seems like one there wasnt an octodad joke was there this video was nitpicking and biased i win byebye that said all in all it had something for everyone 9310 did you know they are trying to sell this game for over 50 thats insane the graphics arent worth it the story isnt worth it its not worth it i think octopath traveler might be like the bad version of legend of legacy its an atlus of course it is rpg about a group of ragtag adventurers finding their destiny on an island where you pick from a group of protagonists who then recruit two of the other characters the difference is that the story is written around the specific 3 adventurers from the group you get so its able to maintain like some coherence definetly has its ups and downs wish it just had a little more development sort out whatever cyruss bullshit was chchank time to die i picked apothecary lad first and im enjoying it d rampant cliche and grind arent they an associate law firm to dewey fuckyou and howe so its a standard turn based rpg theyre all virtually the same battles drag on forever and any tweaks are extremely minor at most yet they get fancy names like action turn based depending on what little thing is added im looking for the episode where he said its like scissoring during a peri this is the newest worst thing i have ever wrote but the apocrypha lad is op if you know how to use him especially late game how dare you make fun of ffx i love this game still to this day wonderful music too in german it would be acht wege reisender acht wege verfhrung would be octopath seduction still awesome review tho xd what is that meme in 013 should i be proud that i understood merde de chien before he translated it i love how he mentions persona 5 everytime he talks about good jrpgs 3 i picked apothecary first lol yeah sadly it was just a mediocre game i really hated that the character interactions were so few and far between but most of the characters were charming in their own way and the stories were okay too combat became a joke after unlocking all the extra jobs and abusing primroses bewildering dance to level up super fast i think if it had been less than full price i woulda liked it more im loving this game its amazing that squire enix finally remembered how to make a proper rpg although i think they actually just published it so thats half the battle won hopefully its success as i do believe it has been successfully due to my inability to find it reduced anywhere and having to give up and pay 39 will mean its rpgness will rub off on them a bit so they start actually making final fantasy into a rpg again rather then a catwalk simulator and remember about star ocean which was good once and all plus add pretty much any other one of their games followed by it was good once here because its pretty much the same with everything they make or made in the long long ago octopath traveler bit of stuff and caves mostly theres the standard warrior man with swords who is seeking justice on the man who robbed him of his honor because arent they fucking always xd funniest review of this game so far i think i need a game with 2 characters like staton and waldorf just like tag longs with nothing to do but to rag on achievements of the rest of the group octopath traveller is awesome olberic is my favourite thus far thats the warrior whos blade is unbending cyrus his story is just pain 13yearold me rears up and curses you yahtzee whenever you dunk on ff7 nevertheless your tone smoother than a winning pool shot against astonished kindergarteners while smoking a cig calms me down again dont do that last thing ever was this published on the 8th day of the 8th month of the year on purpose a game so forgettable that i thought this was a new video until youtube informed me that not only was it not new but i had already watched it ff 6 was the best one by far imo square enix should remake the 16 bit jrpg games like chronos trigger etc in this artgraphic style can we please get a bigger middle finger fornff vii or maybe a dumpster fire because that game sucks hah that german translation was excellent keeping up the wrong name maybe accidentally even then d translated back itd be eight ways seduction which is also fitting with the lone stripper assassin but not really theme the random battles tend to drag on a bit and no not the fun kind of dragon that one made me chuckle i picked apothecary lad first i guess that is a better title than unlimited saga 2 at 430 there is a little creature that pops in and the sword hits him does anyone else remember these or what they are called i remember playing with one when i was a kid it was like a puppet or something to me this is just the game that shoves itself into directs but never comes out until it does i think most japanese kids take compulsory english classes in school so the title wouldnt exactly be foreign i did not equip cyruses park reduced encounter perk because of your video thanks clone of radiant chronology apothecary lad is actually pretty strong when you level him up if youre using chrono trigger as the more tolerable example any chance you would consider a retro review of it if and when you get one of those rare lulls that is wait what with the dogs bum nice foot in the grill that was one weird netflix documentary i remember why i hate this mothafucka shlorp almost drowned in my coffee at that bit of textbased foley stuck with him the best choice i made was picking alfyn to lead the group id surrendered myself to the idea of everyone being 2 dimensional characters because theres 8 of them and they cant all be complex alfyn is indeed 2 dimensional nice guy archetype but hes still fun to have in the party compared to douchy cocky noncharismatic edgelord rogue archetype in the group i like having therion in the group too im just discussing the archetypes and besides as a first character alfyns perfect to have solid melee solid magic cool concocting ability and a fucking kick ass single target heal which got me through like 2 boss fights on its own before i got ophillia so i guess the whole point of this is if anyone who doesnt yet own the game is reading this then dont listen to yahtzee alfyn fucking rocks oof chuckle brothers reference no tales of berseria xd octopath is not a good game im a big fan of octopath traveler and i do have to say that the character interaction is the weakest and most disappointing aspect of the game if se ever comes back to this game formula again and they probably will i hope they really put in some serious time in making character interactions work octopus the spirit 2008 probably one of the few good parts of the movie btw the starting letters of their name is octopath sooooo bravely default but worse i think my only real problem is that the devs behind this game have proven they can make turn based jrpgs more palateable to newcomers if the genre based on how bravely defaultsecond were those games let you control random encounters manually you could handicap your expjpmoney gain if you didnt want to be too overlevelled or wanted to give yourself a challenge and the brave system basically think the boost system in octopath but you can go negative and pass up future turns was a great balance between breezing through enemies and startegizing against bosses octopath seems to just pass those up for the good ol days hell bravely second made grinding so much faster and efficient if you managed to sweep a random encounter in one round you can choose to immediately fight a second wave while retaining your current bp to boost the expjpmoney you earned and there were numerous points in the game where you could do this effortlessly because there was an auto battle sys achtwegewanderer sry had to do it go back and review the game fracture on 360 taking the screws to a couple of games called shadwen and dispatcher might be fun you should review little nightmares poor apothecary lad yahtzee man when is your contract ending with these dipshits so basically its a good time killer but other than that just another jrpg with jrpgisms sprinkled about why isnt this channel just called zero punctuation at this point yeah yahtzee i found that forcing yourself to never use fast travel and leaving the audio for the dialogue in japanese made things way easier still did a little grinding but then you can milk 2nd jobs later in the game for nonsense money and stuff and off course i started with the stripper assassin soooo what does it say a game if i fell asleep through the review even though i adore the game im actually pretty impressed that yahtzees overall opinion was centered somewhere on meh i was genuinely expecting him to hate it since by my own admission the writing barely has one layer and the rpg combat loses some complexity and fun and i know yahtzee tends to be quite critical of bad writing hey yahtzee not to be that guy but the game actually does tell you how high a level you should be for each area right before you enter theres a blurb on the bottomleft corner that tells you where youre going and what the recommended level is and its not hard to see either so really youve got no one to blame but yourself if you went into the cave labelled danger level 20 at only level 13 so is escapist finally dead ive been checking back there and i havent seen a new video in a while and theyve been running ads that tell you to subscribe to their youtube channel and not the fun kind of drag on was that a drakengard reference you should do a review on the forest dont choose apothecary lad first except alfyn is arguably the most versatile character in the game but yeah sure whatever if you increase the video speed to 15x the intro sounds like a metal song yahtzee if you like fastpaced shooting action with robot space ninjas doing bullet jumps walljumps midair shooting and stuff like that you should check out warframe final fantasy 8 is underrated it was great because its on nintendo with very few worth while games on the system this year yhatzee i know you like good narative in games so how about try one shot the statler and waldor joke made me chuckle wtf im over trying not to get too overleveled xd so no grinding for me so far and yea i avoided the cyrus low encounter rate skill lol whaaat apothecary lad is my favorite pick him so i havent played this game but just based on how yatz explained the set up it reminds me a lot of samurai shodown rpg that game just had six main characters instead of eight with a ton of nonmain characters who can join you and depending on the main character you pick you might not be able to have other main characters join up with you can you please review oddworld dry heave abes oddysee review the adventures of square its a real shame this game wont be released on other platforms id love to try it on ps4 or pc well done zero punctuation you cant even put a video on your own website any more utterly useless and also if your gonna do a ad for the content on your channel maybe cut out the people who arent with you anymore amateur hour hey yatzee im looking into developing a doom style fps would u mind if i put you in it lmao yahtzee just played the game wrong rip barry chuckle errr how did you manage to translate traveler with verfhrung seduction i fucking love that intro awesome that at least someone doesnt use those fucking electronic trap whatever you want to call them shit songs i havent seen a boglin in years nice one dont you mean mike tyson not chris eubank i do kinda enjoy this game but it bugs the hell out of me that characters so rarely interact in a meaningful way during their stories it never feels like the group really matters because theyre constantly ignored for story bits the eubank joke killed me off right out of the gate outstanding its a jrpg never expected him to like it much l sounds like i should just dust off my old copy of saga frontier instead playing this i like apothecary lad i really wish video games developers would stop making main characters after the various fantasies of a 12 yr old boy most gamers are not 12 yr old boys and would very much like to see some gasp originality maybe they also need a thesaurus to look up the word originality you should rereview no mans sky after its mega patch i do have to say your review was actually pretty solid given your hatred of jrpgs but the character who you choose first is only locked as leader of the party for a certain amount of his chapters once you complete enough of them you actually can change the party leader a flaw in and of itself but its better to be accurate with these things in a review this game sounds like a rehash of the best elements of seiken densetsu 3 into a bleh game sad lol chris eubank i wonder how much in to boxing you are yahtzee oh my god the first two character he explained were the one i played as in the demo in the order i got then whats the chances properly easy to work out if i wanted not the fun kind of drag on fkin lol i love apothecary lad rip barry chuckle i feel like they were trying to create a canterbury tales with each character telling their own story of how they got to the common meeting place then the story would progress as one unified story from that point forward unfortunately they didnt account for different party makeups especially ones that dont make sense and how the story should have been impacted by each party combination to me some of the cutscene feel really weird if you have certain characters present in your party for example having the honor obsessed knight in a party with the thief while completing part of the thiefs story you would kinda expect the knight to speak up at some point that last joke fuckin killed me wtf yatz just to be a slapdick ill point out that the game actually does specifically tell you the suggested level for each area before you enter itby saying danger level fill in the blank before you pass into that area the true cleverness in the title isnt just the onthenose explanation of eight pathslook at the names of the main characters o philia c yrus t ressa o lberic p rimrose a lfyn t herion h aanit you know i had figured with the name itd be a buddhist allegory ahh the less encounters skill as soon as i unlocked that i looked at it and was like why would i want less exp and decided to never equip it play dragon quest 4 if you liked this one i think it does the separate paths thing a lot better anyone realize that octopath traveler is trying to bring back the saga series i still dont really like it sodid you guys permanently move to youtube and wasnt this one done a week ago on the original site yet it is the latest one so youre a week behind on posting a review i like yahtzee i really do but i feel like hes undercutting the latter ff series a bit too easily ff7 had a great character study in cloud the others werent about the techno babble it was just there as worldbuilding rather than intrinsic parts of the story except for ffx where technology is featured as part of the ongoing plot at their heart most jrpgs are about the characters so why would technononsense be the dealbreaker hey why cannot i watch your stuff on the escapist anymore the stupid site just plays a 045 long advert instead of your videos a shitty 8bit jrpg with a bad instagram filter more saga than final fantasy 434 a fucking boglin what the fuck is with theescapistss player it keeps showing me their 45s advertisment instead of the videos opera adblocks off its phrases like power testicles that make me wish the penny arcade jarpegs got their third and fourth episodes from the same people that did the first and second the whole thing loses its edge when you cant put fruit fucker on the enemy label i know its not really up your alley of game types but i would have never thought it would have been a game i enjoyed so much myself and you have a very similar taste in games as myself would love to see you play the divinity series can even start with divinity 2 dont need to have played the first one to try it out why do people overrate this turd as a good story sure it can be kind o grindy in some cases usually not that bad there even exist a enemy that gives you lots of x and everything usually goes up several levels its this cat with a short name like caith or such but you must stun it or kill it in one shot or it will just flee chuckle brothers reference well done son i think yahtzee would really like final fantasy ix every character has a specific class invokes classic era of final fantasy and the story is surprisingly still relevant rip barry so what your saying is you wish there were skits between the characters like tales games have to make it feel like the characters actually interact yahtzee do not stick things up pepper stadler and waldorf ive always wondered what those guys names were overpriced grindfest reminder that you can get a good jrpg monster hunter for the same price ff8 is a great rpg fite me scrub guess i wont be buying this game tedious random battles no thanks i dont have all day to fight a bunch of frogs every 2 steps schedule pretty tight to be wasted on random battles 131 holy shit these tongue gymnastics i barely managed to make myself finish a single story tressa the besta before losing all interest im kinda curious now that i know they overlap in the end but grinding through another 7 stories that range from semiinteresting to boring as fuck doesnt sound like fun to me 16bit 3d fusion indie jrpg which stole the story arch mechanic of the 3rd game in the secret of mana series from the 90s and being pushed as though its original literally named the game after said story mechanic sold for 60 on the least powerful new console which is literally a hand held being sold as a home console wow where do i sign up 8 paths only loosely connected little to no interparty interaction lots of grinding required sounds like saga frontier with one extra path it would be amusing for zp to review that one merely due to the sheer amount of crap it gets past the radar and how unfinished it feels sometimes why is the masochist door from lost pause doing here i mean in defense of the name octopath traveler was the working title project name it wasnt supposed to be the final name for the game but it got so much traction so fast they didnt want to lose that by actually changing the name also you say it doesnt tell you what level an area is but it does right before you walk into it we cant all be stripper assassins thats a lie and you know it yahtzee pretty much what i expected he would think of the game 300 this is what bugs me the most about this game but i believe its on the right track and yeah only use evasive manuvers when youre over leveled it happened to me because i wanted the advanced classes before i even started anyones ch 4 so i ended up at level 60 between my a team and 50 for my b team i used my b team after i over leveled my a team final fantasy x was the first game i player from ff seriesit was full of things but i kinda liked it ah so a shittier divinity original sin carefulign may copy this review that poor dog i didnt turn on the ability to circumvent random encounters i saw that chucklevision homage rip barry rip i was wondering if you would do this octopath traveler in japanese is okutopasutoraber which doesnt sound that much different from the english title according to my translator 034 dog poop has gravel 045 115 146 he touched my bum he wasnt exactly fired was he stripper assassin xd you made primrose sound more badass then she actually is 202 standard warrior man with sword olberic did not have a scar on his eye 211 xx i wish i picked ophelia first instead of primrose i guess i should give primrose the healing abilities for her secondary traits 409 i like how they turn gigantic it sucks that i had to resort to grinding in this game which can take hours cave of awful death reducing random encounters can be useful but i disable it when i grind you can disable perks if you dont like them you dont have to keep it active 510 429 rest in peace my sweet prince over dressed lemmings ha ha best episode in a little while so maybe give just shapes and beats a little love 435 i only watch one boglin boy thank you very much unsubscribed okay now you need to do one for the legend of the heroes series aswell please this is about the only place on the internet youll find where this game can be criticised without the content creator being skewered by a deluge of sensitive fanboys humour is a magical thing sounds like a sequel to the cave oh dear random combat that drags on in a game that is 90 random combat not sure about that or the bad interaction ff6 did character narratives really well if they needed to focus on the story for a small group of characters they would all be sent on some meaningful quest if they needed to focus on just one character for a while theyd have them get washed down a river or infiltrate an enemy town the last joke on your dog was just uncalled for and disturbing the game map refuses to tell you what each area is suitable for yahtzee it literally tells you everytime before you enter a new area danger level 11 danger level 35 ringing a bell eh fuck you guy i happen to like statler and waldorf also the video was enjoyable keep up the good work i picked apothecary lad starting out still feel like i relate to him the must must mean im a boring cunt wheres the new episode i rather like this game like a lot id say its one of the few good games weve gotten this year so far im glad yahtzee remembered therions name because thats who i chose for my main character and im glad i did because not only is he snarky and cynical hes also voiced by chris kirbopher niosi god bless you square enix larian studios has the same concept but done wayyy better hah i picked the apothecary dude first p tressa is 18 ill have you know she just looks 12 because japan i love now that whenever yahtzee gives an example of a good jrpg persona 5 is his first choice and rightly so to this day i have yet to encounter a game that does party interactions as well as star ocean 2 and im talking about the ps1 release not that shite they put on psp i am really glad i am not your dog my bum has a no long cyrendrical objects rule yep im calling this game octopus rattler from now on neat review eight major stories does seem like a lot to balance persona 5 ruined other jrpgs for me huh a game where 8 characters go on a separate journey up until the final segment of the game where they all meet up for one final act of the game this sounds a lot like livealive just without the interesting story mechanics of livealive not gonna hat on the review but it does tell you the optimal level for each area with random encounters kinda hard to miss actually this sounds like a retread of the original saga frontier but done worse in that game you had your choice of 8 or so characters and then you played only that characters story the other characters existed in the world and if you went to where they are in their own story they or sometimes their rival are usually an obtainable character likewise side characters obtained as part of another characters story can usually be obtained in roughly the same way they were obtained in the characters story minus much of the plot i love the game and yeah yahtzee isnt wrong the reason i love the game is the combat and world building but i also like pretending that how this came about was someone was clearing out a filing cabinet at squareenix and found 8 character stories they liked but knew werent enough for their own game the game is all about side characters and side quests that are loosely loosely related its a game where the worlds chosen hero didnt show up so it is up to this 8 person traveling troupe to stumble into the main plot as they go about their own business for someone who goes as fast as possible your intro sure is one of the longest ive seen sooo its decent im not very good speaking yahtzeeish we cant all be stripper assassins but we should all try dd wait a game called octopath has eight paths final fantasy 7 was better than final fantasy 6 cringey review you speak like someone who just discovered swearing the fact that anybody even liked ff6 or any other shitty grindfest with badly translated story after chrono trigger is blowing my mind it had everything from characters to actually engaging battle system and it absolutely never wasted your time meanwhile any other jrpg only ends its prologue at the time you already finished chrono how the fuck does anybody can tolerate such a low density content its like naruto that stretched one fight over 10 episodes cause they needed to waste time and then added 20 filler episodes on top of it that ending though woof you should make a jrpg game with your review characters and style try not to use too many dildos youre getting a thumbs down for ripping on my favorite game of all time sorry not sorry you know strangely enough yahtzee i disagree with your law firm your rape jokes are rather few far between and i meanokay yes extremely tasteless but i can list offhand at least 15 jokes youve made about the holocaust so maybe start there immediate edit my lawyers are telling you less animal sodomy jokes however would not go amiss im about a week or so from getting this game lets hear yahtzees opinions xd edit yup about what i expected p i hope ill have fun with it anyway lol on first glance i thought this is a spin off octodad game this game is the main reason i need a switch i have been meaning to get to this game but i just cant put down the fact that as yahtzee and many other people said the group really does not care or interact with each others personal quests they just feel so weird whenever i play the demo too try and find out why i never bought it yet maybe i need to actually buy it but i am running short on time with rpgs to dedicate to atm and i feel like this isnt cutting to me despite playing the first demo 2 times and the 3hour demo more than 3 times as well ive put quite a bit of time and i like how cheesy and grand olberics story is and how primrose contrasts it greatly but i cant get over the dissonance needed to play it for which i have in spades even the gameplay is tight and fun but i also do not like how random battles are so frequent out on the field especially because i have some ocd tendencies of exploring every nook and cranny of caves and such however the graphics are so charming and the soundtrack is baller quick start a poll is yahtzee statler or waldorf and which youtube personality is the other sounds like the kind of cliched bullshit we have been getting shoved down our throats for ages video was uploaded 8818 i see what you did there the only reason this game is even remotely noteworthy is because a nintendo console is yet again starved for games between the big 1stparty releases and as usual people that blew their 60 on such a bland offering feel the need to justify their purchase by trolling reviewer videos these closing lines keep getting better also try survive the storm its a zomb no dont go its a zombie game but its really good for coop real coop not some online matchmaking bullshit have a friend over and play this bitch i think you might like it well i would recommend bravely default jrpg with a pretty fun gameplay though later you learn to auto your way along the characters are fun and natural interact with each other a twist you wont see coming if you dont focus on the blatant signs and all around i would recommend it its biggest flaw is being on the ds dead cells is next well at least you sorta liked ff6 hearing you mispronounce game titles is honestly the funniest shit ever you should do it more often if i play it im defiantly picking stripper assassin fist the reason is even repeated twice in their class name ass ass in so it is yet another jrpg but with more memorable visuals instead of the same failed attempt at photorealism dont pick apothecary lad first amputation cheap revive and concoct boost says otherwise play and review divinity original sin 2 already why not darkest dungeon and not the fun kind of dragon that was a fine ass piece of writing i even cracked a smile what puts this jrpg apart from any other jrpg edit oh it doesnt alfyn the apothecary is one of the best characters give him that mighty armulet and he deals a lot of damage with his amputation not to mention empoison is one of the best debuffs for bosses too his innate ability concoct also makes him a lot better than the secondary class apothecary primrose is my bae i love the french language i have sampled every language french is my favourite fantastic language especially to curse with nom de dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards denculis de ta mire you see its like wiping your ass with silk i love it merovingian matrix reloaded ff10 smoking crack is pretty accurate ooh throwin that ffvii shade now this is how you properly take the piss out of octopath as someone who loves the game to death i still get a kick out of watching this whereas dunkeys vid is basically just i dont like jrpgs and barely played this so it sucks can always count on yahtzee to be entertaining and make valid points even if you disagree tho the drug dealer is the best healer and supporter in the game why wouldnt you want to use him 247 i feel like he went out of his way to not catch all the shit that dunkey did lol oh come now x was great sorry to have to be the one to have to tell you this mr croshaw but barry guffaw chortle giggle chuckle has sadly been taken from us hey mr croshaw i started playing your consuming shadow game and i wanted to say fuck you for how much it kills me to play it nice job i was expecting this hahaha great stuff as always however you really dont need to grind that much at all as long as youre keeping everyone even in levels and strategize well i beat a level 30 side boss with level 1721 people 412 thats how i wish all jrpg bosses look like currently listening to your new book great so far and loved all your other books thought experiment step one take a labrador dog step two strap dog to kids merrygoround step three follow yahtzees instructions step four pull pin and slip rubber bands over trigger lever step five post on youtube in the name of your worst enemy i mean tell me you wouldnt play a jrpg where statler and waldorf commentate it i suppose we cant all be stripper assassins i suppose my dream is now dead with his disdain for jrpgs i found this surprisingly fair and accurate i need a jrpg where the protagonists are statler and waldorf imagine it i will never be a memory cloud well youre kind of forgetful dohohohohoho 430 the chuckle brothers too soon yahtzee ummi think he actually liked it and just went pissy cause wellif he didnt go pissy he aint yahtzee didnt zp originally release a week earlier on the escapist then on youtube so its divinity original sin lite i love yhatzees cynical view on the games these cunt waffles want to ship out does anybody know the artist who recorded the song in the intro sequence cannibalistic serial tax dodgers fucking lol ssomeone needs to confiscate that poor poor dog from yahtzee the dog rape joke at the end seemed kind of forced and fell flat the german version would actually be wanderer der acht wege i never equipped cyrus less encounters abillity and i never needed to grind a jrpg type game he did not utterly trash the entire time wow you didnt need to ac tually grind at all the game is mostly focused on your items as opposed to levels since you can augment any stat with nuts or strong items and you get levels enough off the bosses to really never need it consistently im 7 levels behind the first new chapter encounter with my main team and my side members are always not even half that but by the end of the new chapters im on par or even ahead in levels with my main team and my side members are 5 levels where they were before even with the evasive maneuvers perk you get from the scholar permanently on this is what happened kind of sad you didnt mention the sub job system and how the game tells you nothing about it and how theres 4 other sub jobs that are secret and you havent seen yet you need to fight a strong boss to get i cant be the only one who didnt think that was snow 448 hmmm my lawyers office name is dewey cheetum howe reminds me of a 3ds game where the 3 last chapters were the exact same so you basically had to finish the game 3 times in a row to get the true ending very lazy how the hell did traveler turn into verfhrung i liked the power testicles part he nails how bad the suspension of disbelief is 511 i fear for peppers safety d why verfhrung though thats seduction if yhatzee says a game is worth playing even just for killing time it means its a great game do you guys ever talk about games you like im not exactly upset by it just genuinely asking octopath traveller was actually the working name project octopath traveller but people clinged onto it so much they said they wouldnt change it yahtzees description of the main characters reminded me of brainscratchcomms playthrough the ffxv duscae demo where lewis accuately described the protagonists as anime guy with glasses bad cloud cosplayer sasuke uchiha and big muscular guy with sword i will leave it up to you to determine who is who how many was that six fuck rip barry chuckle i just wanna mention that traveler is reisender in german verfhrung would mean seduction just sayin great joke tho thank you based yahtzee will yhatzee ever review just shapes and beats beat everyones second story chapters in this game and im left completely deflated absolutely no interest to carry on there is such a lack of variety in this game no puzzles static environments and absurdly boring dialogue at times golden sun on the gameboy advance was a vastly superior game was that a bogglin i just saw probably shouldnt have used a picture of the chuckle brothers barry chuckle died a few days ago i know its a bit late and this is probably already explained 100 times in the comments but before going between places it actually does tell you at the bottomleft of the screen the recommended level of the next area you are about to enter sure not on the main map but still there love you okay jrpg fans you can stop bitching about how yahtzee totally hates jrpgs and only rags on abou what this was already established years ago and the aforementioned fans just completely missed the proof over and over again okay then id play octogan wafflers the last bit reminds me of being a rogue in every mmorpg you can stealth past a lot of mobs but then youre underleveled and have to grind on mobs comment section help me has anyone ever emailed the fullyramblomatic email im really curious to see if yahtzee still uses or reads it any info will be graciously appreciated escapist mate seriously lovin the vids but will u please do battle tech its xcom with stompy robots and a shitly written plot story but boss gameplay im confused this says posted 3 hours ago but i watched this several days ago whats going on i guess that octopath traveler is mediocre at best and underwhelming at worst guess thatll save me from wasting money on a switch game thanks again yahtzee i love you yhatzee please do a video on maplestory because im a sad sad man congrats on the wedding yahtz but you dont stick it up your dogs bum the website buggered up i liked apothecary lad as my main hes very clutch for breaking armor with his concoct ability hes support attack tank and utility all in one one of the chuckle brothers is dead now youre starting to sound like the old man of the gaming community reminder as a square fanboi im not shelling out money for square enix titles until the chrono series gets revived in this style perferably chrono cross no ff no kingdom hearts no mobile bs they are trending the same path as ea ill vote with my wallet and they will get no more funding from me octo is 810 but also a message edit scrap job system keep bp and fuse it with the energy building from cc and flesh out team attacks by getting rid of 38 cast members make em allurable summons that will comment on game events with your main cast i havent laughed like that in ages please never stop making these im surprised yahtzee usually like point and click adventure games p s i actually like octopath traveller so far every area tells you when you enter it what danger level it is what do you mean they dont tell you how difficult an area is is it just me or has every episode on the escapist website been replaced with an old website trailer this is actually one of your funniest videos i love this game but literally every joke you said was something that passed through my mind while playing or that i joked about with my friends who also played the game why was this reuploaded hurry up and review darkest dungeon please dont stick long cylindrical objects up your dogs bum the objects will get soiled ophilia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion haniit youll shit bricks when you see it yahtzee nothing but love bro but tressa is 18 years old in game trust me i had to look it up upon playing the game just in case someone were to make this mistake need to work on those end jokes its probably the hardest single part but still 429 that just a bit sad now tfw i started as the apothecary but with the cleric secondary job i find him hella broke protip grind in areas 57 levels above your party and youll catch up within just a few encounters whats going on at the escapist theres no new episode and it only shows me outdated promos yahtzee 100 abuses his dog statler i think that number raises a pertinent question waldorf whats that statler why did they do it yahtzee would hate saga games yahtzee hates jrpgs because hes never played a good one and before you genius say thats because theres no good jrpgs i refer you to my previous statement zp translation the characters are alright the stories are a bit samey combat takes too long and it is somewhat grindy too soon dude barry chuckle only died a few days ago i enjoy this game greatly and yet agree entirely with the points yahtzee makes here bonus marks for the picture of the chuckle brothers intentional 030 that doesnt mean octopath traveler achtwege verfhrung means eightpath seduction i never understood the grind complaints maybe i just got lucky in that i killed two whole caits i dont know but my party has been consistently high enough in level to take on these second chapters with no issues the one character who has been significantly behind in level is going to be carried by my significantly higherlevel party members also combat only drags on a bit when youre stingy with your bp use it to break and to hit weaknesses for tons of damage even without breaking guard half the random fights im in i dont even get the break xp bonus any more because i have party member who can simply overpower them im surprised that you are so unwilling to try to optimize your characters but then this isnt an action rpg so fuck it right i picked apothecary lad firstshit good game but youll get more for your money when dragon quest 12 comes out octopath traveler your just buying a ported 3ds game the memory size and everything on it is about the same size as bravely default hey escapist your website is broken and only plays an ad for shows you dont have anymore from like 10 years ago its more to the name octopath isnt it think the name consists of the first letter of every characters name final fantasy 8 was my first final fantasy game and thus my favorite so it made me ever so slightly butt hurt when you made fun of it but still love the video prithee couldst we all agree that speaking in such a manner as this maketh one sound as a twat fie ont i was already at level 14 halfway through party member no 4s first chapter mainly because i equip and unequip a certain skill based on how bloodthirsty im feeling at any given moment it took me weeks but i have finally finished my chronological binge of all the zero punctuation videos so far now i need to find something else to do with my life statler and waldorf need to do commentary on everything octopath does not translate as eight way seduction in german lemme tell you that much the best part of these videos is the different names that he comes up with for the games that and his rampant cynicism eh octopath is my goty have you tryed rimworld or overgrowth rip chuckle brothers shit review yahtzee its time for a intro song remix youre hurting people who love you im loving octopus troubador but good lord there are a lot of encounters after getting the 8 characters i was over leveled for half of the 2nd chapters i would play the shit out oflemmings rpg every single review video ive seen of this game says that the game ranges from mediocre to average and yet every single one of the comments sections of said videos are filled with several people defending it as a title worthy of game of the year but none of those commenters can seem to give much of a reason why the game is so good all the reviews ive seen have suggested that the stories are generic uninspired and unrelated to one another and the combat is alright but borders on the grindy side the best aspect of the game appears to be the graphics but good graphics doesnt automatically make something a good game im beginning to wonder if this game actually has anything to offer at all other than being something to slightly scratch the jrpg itch re the idea that this name probably sounds cooler if youre hearing it as a foreign language imagine if the villain in sonic the hedgehog was named dr tamotoko and then you learned the translation later thats pretty much entirely why eggman is such a stupid name so basically it has the depth of a crumby shonen battle manga rip barry chuckle i dont think this game is as bad as dunkey calls it but i also dont think its amazing as others call it yahtzees review really does a good job its not a bad game and for most rpg fans it is like the old claisscal games its just that its doing nothing really new and been done before by so many others including seperate stories cause there is an actual old rpg that does the same and the game gets grindy which is annoying i dont mind grinding but i rather wish it was quicker that being said we all know yahtzee does have high standards for games even great games he can find flaws in and this review he points out the issues but these are minor issues to be honest and for most people they wont mind this so i say its a game worth checking out if you are a fan of classic rpgs so its jrpg mass effect i feel like this guy just hates act of playing games he wants games to be as simple as possible so he can just get though it and be done with the game so he can move on just goes to show that jrpgs are mostly an acquired taste nowadays rip barry elliot had to come here to see the video on their site you just get a 45 second reminded of how awesome the escapist used to be okay now i really think he should give trails series a try preferably the sky trilogy first 434 bogglins wait this isnt jim sterling not ff6 but saga frontier was the first step to this game okay im new to the zero punctuation so can somebody explain to me why youtube isnt angry at showing dildos and other sex toys in the episodes no hate i just wondered about that the fact that yahtzee could sum up the entirety of all the stories in one sentence each says something about their quality yahtzee yahtzee yahtzee silly boy apothecary lad is not only best boy but also has the best combat talent and the best divine skill tied to his primary job ive been waiting for this that was a boglin that chuckle brothers picture is a lot more relevant now pretty sure achtwegeverfhrung isnt the correct translation of the title in german but thats just my little nitpicking still great video as always i cant remember ever loosing my shit so hard as at the stattlerwaldorf joke i read that as octodad oh look dunkey was right all along and got hated on anyways my only huge complaint about this game is the map system i find it for the most part completely useless also it does show you a danger level on the bottom right when you enter an area which is slightly useful i think the main thing to remember is got to every town first and get all of the characters before you proceed with any ones second chapter by then the first person you chose will be at the recommended level for their second chapter also money is hard to come by until you get tressa apparently 436 the final fantasy vi iii box smites the skeleton halloween fucking boglin we have strayed from saucy commentary into surrealist art rip barry chuckle so were in agreement then primrose is the best bets on if this is making the top 5 anybody this is the most on the fence ive been all year i actually speak french and i laughed my ass off at the start go pleasure yourself stripper assassin regardless of the objects shape dont put anything up your dogs bum eightway seduction sounds kinky i call second blandest of 2018 i went apothecary first lol he was great but despite the games beautiful visuals and solid fun gameplay game fell short with its storytelling and the majority of its plots octopath made me think that the chaos gods of warhammer came up with a new title of the eightfold path to corruption 17450th lol xd how many is that 6 shit primrose is bae kids still saying that these days adjusts bifocals dont pick apothecary lad first so true i was convinced by all the initial positive reviews but after dunking 10 hours and still hating the writing ive kinda given up on the game because yahtzee and dunkey are right its just super formulaic and feels slapped together im mailing my copy to a friend who has high hopes for it im crossing my fingers they like it because i really wanted to anyone else having an issue with the escapist site where the new episode doesnt even show up this game could have been so good if the characters played off each other during the stories that would have given it a niche thus a reason to exist 430 rip chuckle brothers your german was wrong 206st wait what are you am i doing up at this hour therion means beast in the greek btw fuck i picked apothecary lad first it would appear there is a glitch in you tube no matter what video i click the only image shown is yahtzee flipping off the newer jrpgs hey has anyone noticed a glitch in the escapist website where all the videos of zp are some sort of site trailer im really hoping this is just a glitch and the website hasnt shut down octopath traveler is fantastic id really like to see yahtzee do an episode on final fantasy 6 i cant even look at that therion imp without laughing fun fact i picked apothecary lad first and cant change it im so far into the game i almost cant bring myself to restart its wednesday that means i get to hear my favorite british game reviewer rant for 5 minutes or if you will giving you a long cylindrical object and telling you not to smash in the skull of the jackass who raped your girlfriend what an interesting movie that was generic jrpg who wouldve thought cannibalistic serial taxdodgers has to be the most diabolical combination of human being that isnt hitler funny you mention ffxv i just cried myself to sleep because of the ending last night octopath better not do that to me so dont buy a switch for one or two titles got it oh so this is just another saga game the only review i need for all of the games ive never heard of hey i love ffx you cynical twit they kept octopath because it sound like octopus they actually said that i would play the shit out of a jrpg where statler and waldorf are constantly taking the piss out of every interaction edit keep em coming guys im archiving them all at current pace it will take 15 more years for squareenix to produce something of 7th saga but good level to me to y t sobs baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarry summary its not final fantasy vi just play ffvi the absurdly high enemy hp is exactly what turned me off to the game my god does the combat drag on and since leveling up is super grindy you have to do a whole lot of combat i get why people love it so much but this game is definitely not for me and im a person that loves jrpgs as well this game needs some sort of patch reducing the enemy hp 3350 at the bare minimum you have to review this is the police 2 pleaseee wait what the fuck is wrong with final fantasy 8 the series only went to shit after 12 this game smokes lots of beers hang on stripper assassin is a job my life would have been very different if id known that sooner rip barry chuckle anyone else not able to watch any episodes on the escapist website otacon breviller what a reference i was really shocked by this video because yahtzees opinion was basically ehn its passable for me i guess neither too outthere nor is it innovative in any way this about a jrpg the part about the bosses taking ages is so true even if youre overleveled bit close using a picture of the chuckle brothers a few days after one has died doesnt bother me might catch some hate for it though from the diehard fans of 90s children television im sure there are some somewhere i think this actually sums up how i feel about this game pretty well that jab at the boss sprites was pretty great i remember that one of the bosses was on a horse and since i was skipping cutscenes due to losing interest in everyones stories i had absolutely no clue where the hell that horse came from oh boy here we go very cool video thanks much 244 i could watch that all day preferably with a slot machine sound effect yahtzee has freshened up on his french i see octopath traveler seems more like its trying to be saga frontier on the playstation then ffvi the character sprites and the oversized battle monsters just scream saga frontier heck saga frontier even has the multiple story lines bit where you pick one character and all of the other main characters are playable on all the other stories but make no mention of their own personal goals in them yahtzee look up saga frontier and youll see what i mean the last joke cracked me up d rosy retrospection games i liked jrpgs on the nes in the 80s cant all be stripper assassins sounds like a bet he didnt even mention you can steal candy from children id love to see the new episode on the website but the fucking thing wont work i liked the part where he criticizes the game finally man i was craving for my dose yesterday i began to watch all escapist videos again for like 9th time i really like this game and actually found this review funny and refreshing i love hearing people pointing flaws in some of my favourite games hell thats why i subscribed to this channel in the first place please dont stick long cylindrical object up your dog bum it is not healthy for him great game waitwhat did you do to your dog i have never hit a zero punctuation review so quickly oh its that british sherlock actor i essentially heard its good though could be much better which i agree on the cutscene and traveler banter crap more interaction between the characters wouldve been nice also the we cant all be stripper assassins bit is very appropriate since alfyn apothecary lad does have the least engaging intro chapter at least hes a good boi whom i expect well see fanfiction written about by the usual fujo girls that have him and cyrustherion doing something risqu or should i say risgay obviusly people gonna love this game it has the nintendo its a masterpiece tax one month of summer game drought then a couple more then christmas time is here and all the promised e3 games that were not delayed will be upon our wallets hey yahtzee during the drought can you do a full recap of mgs story better find your magic hammer too bad i was itching for a good jrpg i suppose i can count myself lucky that the price tag dissuaded me long enough from buying this one most other reviews i saw seem to fall pretty much in line with this one after all sans the french cuisine id love to see statler and waldorf do commentary for a wwe match statler by hendson he just got split in half waldorf good for him statler statler why is it good waldorf because now he can form a tag team with himself dooohohohohoho i advise ditching the rape jokes some very sound advice p why is the website only playing 1 video why does the german translation at 025 say octopath seductiontemptation the game is fun but man is the writing not good its just not this is high school level of dialogue writing 428 rip barry chuckle got to say im with yahtzee on this one yes but does it have burlytight men of varying ages traveling across the map in a convertible while posing in black leather no then good day sir that character switching is probably the best animation this series has had yeah i stopped listening at stripper assassin and woke up at gameplay gonads sooo did he liked the game just finished the demo about to go buy it but then this popped up in my notifications youre one of the most consistent youtubers stripper assassin is an odd career choice considering she is supposed to take her clothes off which might reveal the hidden weapon escapist website got an update looks neat but didnt they kept the name because everyone loved it and sqaure said fuck it lets keep the working title its good but its no p5 thats for sure sorry to say this yahtzee but it does indeed say what levels each area is right before you enter them octopath more like tentacle hentai knowing that yahtzee will one day review huniepop it fills me with determination dude please review the classic overlord first hey can anyone still watch these episodes on the escapist i keep getting redirected to a promotional video for the escapist youtube channel that is so out of date it still includes top five with lisa foiles should be achtwegereisender you translated octopath seduction cck and wine lol oh goody what a lovely game also another lovely video by yahtz im early for once you sexy beast dog turds in gravel sounds lovely actually yhatzee dont be so cynical i havent seen the video but im gonna go on a limb and guess that yatzee dosent like this here video game better than dunkey oh an rpg i wonder if yahtzee hates it dunkey already did this bit m8 i wonder how many endings there are hello there i was waiting for this xd this game looks interesting does it have any games before it i could check out why do i only have 2 abilities in the demo version it needs cutscenes of some kind either animated or storyboard 2110 i like yusufa me someone whos played the demo many times but wanted to see a different take on it yeah me too just wait though revenge x2 2815 more talk awesome yusufa is 4505 the queen of the stage primrose tells helgenish basically go fuck yourself is it any wonder why i like this demo thats some western rpg quality voice acting there unlike those shitty dub ones god man better stick to reviews this guy is like a mage in wow going meele boost 4 pathetic auto attacks instead of using the single target darke skill which would do 5 times as much dmg i guess the game has a cool nostalgia look to it but still a bit weird that the graphics are hardly better than on the snes i dig the graphics ive been looking for a good turn based game i might buy a switch just got this lol is it exclusive to the switch i feel like my 3ds could handle it july seems so far away hiya i just played this demo i cant wait for game official release july 13th i played primrose i love her story line and some of fights can be hard you just keep going until you master to take down an enemys and once you get hang of it they problem at all slapped to death my fear is it suffers short storyphone game syndrome it seems to have an indepth system but if there isnt more then just this sort of thing then it hits low priority here is a tip once you broke his shields it is better to use an strong attak like moonligth waltz because the weakness are use to break the shield then other attacks will be more effective master helgenish out here lookin like he came straight from the smurfs not onlu does the game look amazing and have an original art style but the voice acting and music is great the combat is interesting and the story seems engaging and much darker that what i thought it would be 4459 ddid she just tell him to go fuck himself i love this game already over 30 mins before the first battle but i didnt care when i played i found the story and writing decent no lame weeaboo shit like i expect from a jrpg and the battle system enough of a tweak on the classic turn based systems to be interesting the demo was awesome thats why i preordered the ce i kept losing to the boss until i grinded to level 6 im such a loser lmao lol i did everything he did until the catacombs were i stopped you sound so much like john lenahan author of shadowmagic i listened to the audio book versions this guy shills out praise for some silly shit not knockin the game it looks awesome also that boss fight was quite the shameful display have you no tact sir i played it and i died because of how beautiful it is every jrpg should have 4 digit health pools by default just finished primroses demo loved it definitely getting this game when it comes out looks great i just downloaded the demo yeah if they redid ff6 like this that would be awesome not complaining but it seems like there are a lot of rpgs on the switch right now damn this looks dope a boss that sits in a chair drinking wine during a fight sequence the absolute very least he could do is throw his wine glass to the ground and say what is a human but a miserable pile of secrets so heres what i learned so far as im playing this i think alot of us newbies who start the game who has experience or none at all or somewhat experience like my self i played strategic games but not like this one and not as long too is that we rush instead of learning about it i know depending on the game i do ofc but heres what i realize when your playing primrose 1you can upgrade her dagger and buy more items you need you can do this buy going to the armory and pri i dont know how to spell it lets just call it store and you have 360 or 380 of money to help you healing grapes are 60 and the sliver dagger is about 160180 again i dont remember by heart lol you can buy that and that upgrades her attk levels are helps her out woth damage on the boss 2items so you can find treasure chests in the forgot what is called lets call it sand dome sand dome section and get items from that chest for example you can get a necklace that makes you stronger you can i like how they used a 3d engine with a classic pixel art style that nigga got real mad when you said thank you metoo probably on my top 3 most hyped games for switch 2018 finally something worthy after 1 and half decade of games fucking nintendo imma buying switch looks great will definitely pick this one up especially since its the same team who did the bravely series i just hope we can pump a ton of hours into this game and not be able to complete the game in a couple of days eeeee i love this demo the orchestral music is sooooooo good primrose is such a good character the battles are so fun finding weaknesses is satisfying as hell did i mention the music i think he has upwards of 3000 health so you would not be able to kill him the moonight qalz can do 750 damage if boosted so you should have used that instead shes bad ass enough to fight monsters with crazy dark magic but she takes shit from those other bitches in the dressing room and from her master like a meek little kitten wtf lol you just kept using regular attacks on a boss in a jrpg p can anyone please tell me if the r boost mode in combat will have hd rumble vibration on the joy cons each time pressing the r i swear i had it before and it goes stronger each time i press it also it would vibrate each time i slash the enemy using boost mode but somehow its lost after the 401 system update someone please confirm me that kinda sad he didnt finish the demo tho could you not talk over voiceactors didnt saw this coming but i have to have this game now 0 reminded me of saga frontier and with the cute little sprites but mature story telling thats some terrible voice acting holy shit you cant go inside shops that kills a jrpg for me i beat helgenish because i brought one of his lackeys with 4 star strength with me he helped me take care of the two other guys quickly then i spammed daggers because break and midnight ode with boosts wow i was really looking foward to this game looks pretty but that intro was shit and had me completely turned off maybe ill give another chance when we know more about the game battle system is great you can also boost your defense awesome this game better get a deluxe edition my complaint is that the font size is toooooooo small its ridiculously small to read they should enlarge font size and maybe bold it too i just played part of this demo last night and needless to say i will be getting it i better remember to equip accessories though next time and buy armour i only just managed to beat helgenish and without support as well they changed the font in the character select looked much better in the trailer the capital s looked almost like an 8 had character to it now it looks like generic font 17 oh man this looks so awesome the tone of this compared to bravely default same team is light years apart im picking primrose first when the game comes out this game is incredibly good i cant wait for full game played a bit with primrose in the demo this game looks like itll be great that was rather impressive imo the writing tone and melodrama reminds me more of valkyrie profile than anything and i mean that in a good way was the voice acting really necessary i dont think so jeez helgenish is a despicable human if you can even call him that so who is the main protagonist olberic or primrose i played 2 hours of the demo before i completely ran out of things to do and got to level 10 with the warrior its a fun game im excited for the full release omg this is like tactics 20 i hope one of the characters is a merchant and i can bribe everyone also you should be able to challenge and knock out the save point guys in a shovel knight break the save point get reward way you can buff the defend command too as olberic graphics and story look good but i cannot stand random encounter battles they should at least put the enemies on screen so you can avoid battles if you want anyone else find this demo surprisingly difficult dark attacks were more effective even though helgenish was weak to daggers instead of 50 you couldve dealt around 300 to 1000 damage per hit with a max boost moonlight waltz after a break that was the strat since he had so much hp this is a must buy for me i had fun playing it it was giving me golden sun vibes also seems like its best played in portable mode because on the tv its very pixelated with the art style they went with tho i had no issue with it dude you had him you need to work out your strategy to keep him broken but also hit him with your single strike dark attack if you fully power up peacock dance and then launch that dark attack fully powered you will do enormous damage way more than the dagger playing as a stripper i love this game the demo sold me i just started playing olberics campaign and its pretty goddamn good i too chose this path when i played this at my friends house little did i know what i was in for for the final boss of the demo you could just boost twice per turn and then boost x4 on the single target darkness spell for 1k damage while his guard was broken 1100 not gonna show off the entire demo just go for like 30 minutes 50 minutes later derrick you shoulda used your dark dancer abilities after you broke helgenishs shield you can wreck any enemies with any types of attacks once you break their weakness shields just a helpful tip holy wow this game is amazing ive beaten both characters demos twice now and it just gets better everything from gorgeous artwork and godly music to the deep story and characters and awesome battle system already shaping up to be a classic not that id expect anything less from the team behind the bravely series i am soooo hyped for this i like yusufa yyeah dont get too attached when the guy said ho there i as prim said what did you call me and then i thought we say yo ho but we dont say ho because ho is disrespectful the text speed seems really slow the voice acting seems to go faster than the words appear god final fantasy 6 in this style how dare you raise my expectations so high it was so hard watching derrick do that boss fight because he just would not use moonlight waltz it does so much damage which is useful since helgenish has so much health i played osteric patrick seitz woo xd so i havent seen primrose yet i was mostly convinced but this holy crap what a dark gritty amazing story i actually shed a tear before the boss fight you wont find spoilers here also derrick keep playing and learn exploiting the boost system is the best way to win break them first quickly with boost maybe then go full force on them with level 4 skills or attack just remember abb always be boosting xd so far im really in love with this game ive never been into turnbased rpgs but this one works really well the artlike visual style is very appealing and it lends itself well to the story and atmosphere the only complaint i really have is that some of the battle models for certain characters and enemies are very offputting and just look strange compared to the small 16bit sprite of your character 1311 i was actually thinking when i played this that i would love to see a chrono trigger remake or chrono trigger 2 with this graphical style it would suit it so well i cant be the only person who think the postvisual effects are too much the graphics are nice but the overdone bloom and lighting just ruin it game so dark its amazing put those kid thoughts to shame dang so many rapey undertones shouldve boosted spells attacks the boss has like 5000 hp lol gotta break his guard then use max boosted magic attacks i am ready this is one of the many reasons why i love 16bit rpgs the most out of all the jrpg eras so to speak because they can get away with so much more due to the limiations of the hardware or in this case imitating the pixel art direction which itself is timeless ff6 for example had content in its story that would not fly if it got a 3d remake here is my list of all gears and weapons available in this demo maybe some of you missed the 5 stars npc duels the most challenging battles after you beat the boss giving the best weapons notice all armors helmets accessories can be equipped by anyone but not the weapons weapons primrose dagger phyatk elematk starting weapon silver dagguer compared with dagger phyatk 28 elematk 15 buy it for 160 at the two towns blacksmith assassin dagger compared with dagger phyatk 48 elematk 28 reward item duel the old man npc located on the left at the desert town entrance careful he is rank 5 and strikes hard olberic broadsword phyatk elematk starting weapon longsword compared with broadsword phyatk 30 elematk 0 buy it for 200 at the two towns blacksmith spear phyatk elematk starting secondary weapon heavy spear compared with spear phyatk 32 elematk 0 from the brigands den entrance go right to a c daggers and dark magic is a epic combination for the boss fight i leveled primrose to 7 break one of the guards when you break one of the guards use her moonlight ode it does a lot of damage to them once you take out the guards break helgenish after you break him use moonlight waltz each time its an easy 300 damage attack once hes broken also dont forget to also boost magic when helgenish is broken to kill him faster this game is fantastic i will be buying this day 1 yalets not use midnight waltz her best attack lol amazing voice acting great plot maybe 12 rating for primrose history the only thing i could ask is a improve in the menu interface like items and weapons tumbnails and characters portraits not only text and numbers hope they change that for the final version it looks like if a archbishop casted resurrection on ragnarok online i liked your video but i cant watch it this game looks too good and i want to go into the game next year fresh you forgot to use the boost so many times use your fucking magic ability that boss was a fuckin sponge of hp it was just annoying id rather they make them more fierce but with lower hp livealive styled game baby finish this playthrough you were at the very end battle music reminds me of romancing saga games and like some one else said the combat looks like golden sun i put 3 hours into primroses demo alone every time i ran into a you cant go past this point in the demo npc i got more impatient ive been needing this game since january dang it just finished the demo and man the design and music is amazing this game is one to look forward to this battle is beatable at level 3 atleast i could do it reminds me a lot of golden sun the way the camera moves during battle i immediately became attached to yusufa and primrose and immediately hated helgenish the game looks fantastic and the stories seem like theyre going to be intriguing definitely going to keep an eye on this one you sold me on this game the demo was so sick my girlfriend and i were voice acting the rest of the game so fun haha im probably in the minority but i did not like what i played of this demo why the hell does a fucking cave bat take so long to kill that and this boss fight pissed me off im not sold on this game yet and im also waiting on the name change christ is this name beyond stupid 8 characters with different storyabilities this game will be the death of me im most excited about this one too i yearn to play this game in vr it would look incredible this 100 times better than ff15 this is godtier rpg material preordered is this a sequel to the bravely default series not going to lie i hate rpgs like this but the story and concept of 8 different points of view is cool beans if i had a switch i would get this for the story alone i hope this game develops into something great can we talk about this games soundtrack it was amazing 4503 she just told him to go fuck himself holy shit damn this game doesnt waste anytime people are dropping like flies out here omg go primrose i have been hyped for this game since they announced it with the switch and the more i see about the the more hyped i get i think the weakness only applies to sheilds when you break you want to use a strong attack also lion dance boosts an ally not yourself warning this comment will include some details about the demo not shown in the video im really looking forward to this game now both characters had really great stories making me curious about how both of their stories will develop as well as what the stories of the other 6 characters will be my only concern is that as you can recruit the other main characters and use their abilities explore their dungeons and in the demo at least both characters share the same side quests it might be somewhat tedious to play through the game 8 times when the storyline seems to be the only thing exclusive to each choice of starting character im getting a strong final fantasy tactics vibes from the tone of the story so far and the presentation of these scenes the problem is that some people didnt figure out how to play the game properly and found the battles too long and boring because of that in the old days it was common sense to figure out all the stuffs by yourself but it seems like every game has to have a tutorial explaining exactly how you should play the games now mastergo pleasure yourself royally savage i like the graphical style the game is going for but the lighting could use some work things either look too bright or too dark depending on how close they are to the light source i also wasnt that excited about the game when they first showed it but after seeing all the positive reception toward the game i got interested and playing the demo sold me on it i just hope they dont add in any unnecessary padding like they did with bravely default the second half of bd really killed the game for me even the weakness is physic ur magic can deal way more damage im in hearts with this we need more of these types of games graphically i hope you can skip the really long cutscenes before the boss fights anyone who died during paper mario ttyds final boss should understand in the trailer the game had more moving camera angles and such this felt very lacking and way too much rapey story for a nintendo platform game who else things spla2oon splatoon when they hear octopath dang its lovely so i already beat her demo and i know how to beat the boss also for the record i was level 4 with vanilla gear and the guard as support you bring the guard in to deal with the lackeys and then in a 1v1 showdown you do these steps 1 you attack regularly without boost 2 you use boost x3 attack to break his guard he always take 4 dagger swipes to break his guard 3 use the most powerful dark ability you have with boost x2 as thats all the boost youd have at that stage despite him being weak to the dagger your dark attacks do more raw damage 4 repeat steps 13 until the boss dies there is usually only 1 thing you might need to do to break this pattern and thats heal with an item if that happens just save the extra boost you earn and use it on your dark attack for maximum damage this worked for me on my first try so hopefully it helps someone else win i was able to play the demo and it was really good i like this type of format with the 3d almost as good as ffta on the gba sp i seriously cant wait for this dual audio too nintendo do this more often im worried about the notverypromissing soundtrack i feel like they are taking kind of a botw approach to music which seems like a huge downgrade from bravely default i havent heard anything ill remember later not even the battle theme her story is better than the male character in my opinion so when it comes to pc you can charge up your abilities with the boost as well i beat this guy by using a hyper midnight ode after breaking his defense it did like 1100 damage it is good to see nintendo and square working together again since the snes and nes days that is literally the bp system from bravely default except you dont need to defend to preserve bp now primrose story is the sort of dark tragedy you dont get to experience in video games anymore this is a day 1 buy for me boss had too much health wonder when the sjws will come after this game knew shed die powerful stuff though for so early there isonly 1issue i had with the demo when i played it the weakness is only for breaking their guard when i used a max strength moonlight waltz it did so much damage it doesnt explain that at all just makes it seem like the weakness is the only good way to do damage i still cant get over how fantastic that game looks jeez o i am so afraid playing this demo i dont want this marvelous journey has to end short just no i feel like with the background depth this has itd have looked amazing on the 3ds but so happy its on the switch these plethora of rpgs coming to the switch leave me a happy camper im glad that gross sounding guy is the first boss of primroses story ive never seen derrick gush this much over a game before i was really interested in this game and after playing the warriors demo im completely sold i am in love with this game the voice acting music sounds animations the art its all very high quality i really like the boost system and enjoy having hardcore elements like no hp bars and only breaking with a weapon the enemy is weak to so there is more discovery and tactics also the story has me hooked i want to find that traitor mofo 4459 for the greatest roast in the history of demos im curious why they chose to put a strong vignette on this game not a bad thing per se just odd i played primroses path and from the first time i saw that evil master i wanted to stab that bastard and stab i did again and again and again until the final one pig theres probably gonna be some good tracks in this game i fell in love with just the xharacter selection the music and details are amazing chrono trigger and final fantasy vi remakes in this style is a must square just do it this game is like live a live final fantasy 6 a bit of smt that last fight is where you realize that weak doesnt mean more damaging you have to break him with dagger attacks then use your most damaging attack which is midnight waltz not more dagger attacks optionallypreferably you can buff elemental attacks before hand youll do thousands of damage not tens he wasnt even close to winning that fight also this game is insanely good so few jrpgs arent written for 12 year olds her magic is really powerful a lot more than her dagger skills especially if you use boost to increase the magic to the max for me the peacock thingie inflicted more than 1000 damage your excitement for this game is dare i say pathetic i played the demo and it was fun but it is nothing groundbreaking and needs quite a bit if polishing also this game better be in the 2040 range 60 for a game like this would be way too much his level 4 ability does 1000 damage helgenish is a horrible person its a great demo but dont let kids play it there is some highly suggestive material and barely even innuendo in primroses route this game is unbelievable im blown away by how good it is i cant wait this game looks great this is not clickbate i swear hey gamexplain i dont want to promote myself or anything but theres a update to the switch app that look like it could be the future switch app it looks ten times better than what we got i dont know if its a japan exclusive but its look awesome also it looks like we are getting a messager its on my channel im not clickbateing i sent this to switch force aswell but i know ur a newsgaming channel for the switch so its important odin sphere the music is so on point for this game this game looks so good just some pointers you didnt lose the first boss fight because of your level it was mainly because you just used basic attacks the whole time even though hes weak to daggers and they break him he would still take a lot more damage from prims dark magic nice music nice graphics interesting story the game looks nice but the battle system is extremely flawed it requires overly complex commands to accomplish something very simple this is fine in moderation but after playing this demo i was already sick of it there were way too many long and drawn out battles the game is awesome except for the grinding this game looks gorgeous ill totally be picking this one up when it releases the battle music is g l a m o r o u s after starting the demo this game is a must buy lol i am shouting at my screen to use midnight waltz it does 1000 when charged to the max i honestly love this game and i cant wait to buy it when it comes out 15 secs in and im already sold on the art style alone this is a very generous demo definitely sold me on the game this game is a bit too dark for me i mean i am 18 and all but that doesnt mean i enjoy games that have all the crap of the world in it dont want to see more of the story but i sure as hell hope you get to beat up the dirty old geezer i love this game played it for half an hour i love it love it love it and cant wait for the full game tried it thought it was dull tfw u just want bravely third i am loving this game so far seems like it has a solid story or actually i guess you could say stories since you play through 8 different ones essentially the music and voice acting are top notch the gameplay is familiar yet has something new to offer its almost like a bravely default system but hey its made by the same people all in all from just playing the demo i can tell its gonna be a day one buy for me i hope it gets a physical release and maybe a collectors edition with the soundtrack i hope it sells well and we get more retro style rpgs i felt how i felt when i first saw ff6 as a kid when i saw this game im just amazed and it doesnt take photo realistic ps4 graphics to do it wow a lot more mature than expected xenogears remake when this is my kind of game am i the only one who chose the warrior instead of the dancer at the start of this game i played the demo and honestly im more excited for this game than anything that fat man is invincible will get this for sure looks really good just annoying that bravely second ends with a post credit scene sequel bait that may go nowhere those fights and the music are gorgeous i want this gem of a game that clarinet tho so any of eight characters something about this seems to be reminding me of live a live i hope they remake chrono trigger with these graphics preordering immediately primroses story won me over i must say also she sounds so much like velvet that i cant play as any other character all i can say is my blade is unbending damm primrose looks thick i volunteer i volunteer as tribute get it 4440 this game really just went there im not even disgusted im more impressed than anything i loved bravely default so ill definitely be checking this out when i get a switch go pleasure yourself im getting a switch just for this and all the other games on it not sold on the art yet but i most said the gameplay look solid by how this game is structured it reminds me of legend of legacy but way beyond just picking which hero you want to start out i just love how much this game took from bd the title screen even uses the same fond so far i have some minor complaints cutscenes are unskipable you cant autobattle and you cant alter the random encounter rate everytime you got a new class in bd the way a character played changed completely which kept battles from getting too repetative i wonder how theyll solve that in this game probably with all the playable characters on every path its official octopath traveler dark asf i want to see chrono trigger remade like this the team behind this game did the bravely games they are incredibly good at making a traditional jrpg the bravedefault mechanic was amazing and intuitive now this system seems just as good octopath looks like a spiritual successor to the saga series but with a better imo team behind it im with derek on his opinion during their discussion i was already looking forward to xc2 but op really wowd me in terms of being something i absolutely wasnt expecting im super excited for it this games graphics and battle mechanics reminds me of brave frontier as someone who isnt a fan of the rpg genre im honestly impressed by this demo now i want this game so badly great voice acting at 125 speed started with primrose too had to attempt the boss again because i forgot to pick up a meat shield for the boss only have two minor complaints the desert world has so much brown and bloom that it looks really really bland all of the sprites being a few pixels higher than their shadows makes it look like theyre all floating half the time this game looks amazing bought old style turn based combat back and voice acting is great ill buy it if there are 8 seperate characters each with their own story i wonder how they will interact does that also mean that each story will be less than 8 characters is a lot of narrative to get through unless each character gets their own story as a prologue and then they all get together mid way through hmmmm so much to think about i think i need to get a switch i cant wait to try this out with my tv set to 3d mode home from the office in 2 hours i cant wait lets just stop for a second shall we how come this game came before bravely default huh i want answers this was everything i was expecting and more since i first saw the game in january aw ye primrose really awesome game glad nintendo is finally getting great thirdparty exclusives that will demand people to buy their consoles again derrick maboy you sound excited about the whole waiting in the chambers topic the style of this games narrative intrigues me i wonder if well be confined to the route we choose or be able to bounce around different character routes i do like this type of games more or less the next step for 2d rpgs graphically speaking anyway that and now they can get away with much darker stories without getting censored left right and sideways the presence of the sprite work is a tad jarring to me compared to the more detailed backgrounds but i love the style of this and bravely default this is climbing my list of games to try when i finally get a switch you need to use powered up abilities when he is broken not attacks youll do like 1000 damage with her single target dark dance at boost level 3 if only she said this hello my name is primrose and you killed my father prepare to die whats great is that even after the demo scenario has ended you can simply keep on playing and find other stuff this demo is massive im still playing the demo even though i beat the first story part is it even possible to kill the last one i tried it 5 times demo huh nice i like it when they do that thats how i got into etrian odyssey actually you yes you you should try eovs demo right now just another thing i want for the switch reminding me that im a poor bastard i freakin love this game i hope too god this game has a collectors edition especially with the soundtrack square enix head out of the park with the music and im absolutely in love with that art and graphics its killing me we gotta wait till 2018 for this i need this game right now this looks noice i hope theres a special edition of this game yeah voice acting is honestly better than zelda and xenoblade for me for high health enemies you should set it up so that when you break them your next attack can be a fully powered special ill probably play as primrose looks like agnes if she started rocking the brave bikini with confidence also her story is very compelling right of the bat the music seems on point this game is the fucking truth we have a classic on our hands here you can tell its by the bravely guys if the demo is this big default and second had huge and great demos there are full 3ds games that have a smaller playtime in my records than the bravely demos oh yes derrick i loved what i played of this demo i can not wait for the full game im excited game of the year bitches i just randomly found you i like what you say subscriped will check out your other videos now i love this game one of my all time favourites i hate when people say realism on its own is always a good thing in a game if i wanted realism i wouldnt be playing a fucking game with monsters and magic id be playing college life and just be studying for finals whoa realism is so much fun is itzorn and thorn theme from ff ix in background yeah but if there is a character who by all rights shouldnt be able to fight and yet they are able maybe an explanation would help cyrus is a master scholar so it just makes sense that he could use magic from tomes totally agree i dont understand the current trend of realism especially towards vr monopoly a 100 year old board game was not beloved due to its realism it was because it was fun many games these days forget that games are first and foremost supposed to be fun i can see myself getting addicted to this game very easily it is in essence nostalgic and from what ive read so far has the right combination of storyline and character to be compared with the legendary snes chrono trigger chrono trigger was in my opinion the best game in history all genres as i base this to the game mechanics details story line graphics and music for its time 1995 even 2 decades later no game has truly stood out for me until now i totally agree this reminds me of midichlorians some things are better left unexplained the game advertised 8 travelers 8 adventures every path is yours to take no 8 heroes join in a epic adventure if people expected something else is their problem you can have another character just for gameplay mechanic as you say or you would just figth alone summon a lot of old strategyrpg games give you random party members when the focus is the gamplay yes the story could be better the paths could converge in an epic endgame and everything you we want but remember that this is the first entry in a franchise even if the sturio made bavelt default there is a lot of room to improvement prims one and only friend is dying as we speak meanwhile in my party i had ophilia and alfyn just chillin in the sidelines eating popcorn all is good i love rpg i love both turn base battlelike dragon quest persona and real time battlelike tales witcher and i dont care much about realism but i still preferred 3d over 2d though about octopath though i preferred 3d games i must admit octopath visual have it own charm the reason i dont get this game isnt because of graphics but because i dont like the battle animation yes thank you i have been saying it for years and i am so sick of games that constantly hold your hand through the whole experience a quick explanation and im talking like a couple seconds at the start of the game should be the maximum extent of what is needed after that proper game design should naturally direct the player in the proper direction to achieving their goals without having to read a text books worth of instructions or watching a feature length films run time of tutorials if a game ever needs to tell you to press the a button to jump then its dead on arrival in my opinion im waiting until payday to pick up the full version im playing the demo now and couldnt be happier to me it feels like final fantasy vi but not at all like final fantasy anything im enjoying the fact that this is not an clusterfuck epic story some ff games to save the world its just 8 epic stories that actually seem plausible for a team of heroes btw tosdotnw is not a great game but alice is still the best tales girl xd sadly like most of the great backstories of tales games hers is hidden under an unforgivable sidequest i hate those in tales games if you look at the bosses each character fights in there story they should be at vastly different levels based on in game lore as for the reason they are together that is due to design imagine trying to tie all the stories together when you have the freedom to completely ignore a character they would have to prepare for any possible combination of characters and the absence of any characters there are already people trying to do solo traveler runs i like the approach octo is taking i have seen a lot of videos complaining about the fragmented narrative but i think this is done purposefully instead of interweaving a bunch of different stories like a ffvi dqiv or a tales game focusing on interpersonal relationships octo is focusing on 8 distinct stories where each chapter has that character as the protagonists and the others just background gameplay noise i think this is so unique to jrpg fans as it breaks away from something basic to almost every jrpg that they tend to dislike it right away i think both approaches can have their upside one is like a collection of short stories and the other is like a novel some people like short stories and others like novels some like both for me its not simply a matter of realism its that the characters not interacting takes a lot of the heart emotion that could have come with the game their lack of presence in the cutscenes make it so that you cant see how their personalities intersect with one another or form any chemistry whats wrong with liking both some game narrative work better with realistic type graphics you become more immersed everyone consumes games differently pixel art games are cool and cel shaded is my favorite art style but i definitely would have not like to see the new god of war in any of those styles this game is so fckin amazing and dont know where to start hahaha best game of the year 2018 octopath traveler this is my favorite game already the closest to everyone can fight right off the bat at least for me legend of heroes trails of cold steel everyone has a weapon but unlike with octopath there is a reason for everyone being there and has new game mechanics galore to point the whole game is a tutorial if anyone can create such a game i would want an action rpg thats old school in how characters can fight right off the bat doesnt need a reason to be in a party in short someone please make an action rpg version of octopath sorry but i play jrpgs mostly for the story and the characters if this game doesnt have a story or characters that have well character then i am not motivated to play the game no matter how good the game play is for one thing the way cyrus fights totally makes sense to me he studies tomes which can hold ancient incantations in them so of course he is going to learn and use powerful magic in battle and the others abilities in battle can be expained similarly because of the tropes they fall into i especially like tressa can use tradewinds lol thats such a cute reference to merchant ships literally using tradewinds for their trading path back in that time period a couple of people are pointing out that phoenix downs only recover people from ko status and to them i say ok now explain why they couldnt use the revive materia which grants an ability called life that has the tooltip restores life to target this is the kind of thing im addressing in the video you guys are just reverse nitpicking now trying to explain something that was never actually explained by the game which didnt need explaining because we all just accepted it was part of the game if you dont believe me try googling anything to do with aerith and phoenix down ps if characters in battle really only get knocked out then by realistic standards they would eventually wake up of their own accord but you could theoretically leave a character knocked out forever and when somebody is knocked out forever we call that 1 of 2 things death or a coma thank for the facks about the game i like old nes and snes games but in 2018 i think it is just lazy to make games with this look they could have make something like hand draw or chibi style like they did with bravely default the game has some cool retro look but thats all this is like megaman just because people like nes megaman means they have to make always nes megamans they have to keep improving and make something new maybe both old school but with better graphics i dont know i try to avoid realistic games like the plague only times ill play a game of that type is if the gameplay is to my standards otherwise ill pick a sprite game or a game with cartoon art over a realistic looking game almost always mages are typically depicted as scholars in games i would say that is why cyrus is assumed to be able to fight absolutely agree sometimes i feel like game designers rely toooo heavily on a good story to cover up the shotty game design zelda botw proves that a game doesnt need a good story or any story at all tbh to be a good game thank you i know what you mean lol i was never aware that the cleric would ever be able to have her staff be a physical attack weakness to an enemy when we think of casting classes like that theyre glass cannons and physical attacks are a no no but in this nope lol im happy to not have things explained i was slightly nitpicking alfyn in the demo how come an apothecary has ice magic but then just decided to go with the flow i also went with cyrus first and am proceding anti clockwise gotta catch em all with haanit i dont remember where but i read that its actually written into the narrative that cloud wasnt carrying any phoenix downs on him when aerith died but i could be wrong about that also the series has shown that if a character takes sufficient damage to a certain point then they cant be cured with a phoenix down ff5 is the best example of this sense they actually try to bring back a character with potions and etc but my immersion im loving the game thanks for the video bro have a good start to the week i can accept that things are done for gameplay reasons but if the game doesnt have a very compelling plot to begin with then the gameplay isnt going to save it for me thats how i feel about octopath traveler im happy other people like it it looks gorgeous but i dont find it compelling or interesting at all i am loving this video game i love it more than i thought i would and i preorderd the deluxe edition because i was sure it was going to be fresh air and it is surpassing that even this is what i am hoping for core pokemon 2019 a videogame built for the purpose of being a very good video game i started with cyrus too i am in love with this game so far im all in for 8 separate stories instead of some overarching save the world plot that shoehorns characters into your permanent party for weird reasons 2 words chrono trigger perfect balance between narrative and freedom of exploration in octopath if they put little effort in story they can create good connection between characters in any order we join them to teamand individual motivations its not about realism just effort to do it consistent on everylevel more freedom u give player more narrative u must build around choices and possibilieties and more of it players never seen in 1 aproach so low budget makes it not realistic but good budget and passion like in ct can definitly do it even in old school and i think its good ppl demant reasoning login and consistent in games rant on i cant properly put into words how extremely disappointed i am in this game and how disgusted i am with the review coverage i guarantee that if the next mass effect or tales or witcher game came out and all it had were side quests nobody would like it this game is a collection of 8 side quests and that sounds so terribly boring and disjointed that i have zero interest in playing it yet almost every review seems to just brush that aside do you want to play a witcher or final fantasy where there is no main plot just a random gathering of characters that have nothing in common gathering to do side quests absolutely not but apparently its fine for this game rant off jay i am not trying to get on your case and im very much looking forward to your review couldnt say it better you rock keep going mate i prefer old school and celshaded 2d sprites 3d with celshading pretty much because the games will continue to look amazing in my eyes years later especially if it vibrant one thing i wish more jrpg get back to doing is prerendered backgrounds i thought bravely defaultsecond were the closes thing to it so it made me happen but it wasnt exactky it thank you lol someone finally said it i totally agree with you here people always ask for old school andor unique concepts when they get them they complain its not the mainstream idea of an rpg that follows a direct story where you have a defined party defeating an evil emperor or something i already got the game because i loved the demo i like old school rpgs glad it looks like ot is selling well so we get more i question a lot of things in games mainly if it mirrors real life to a certain extent even as a child playing jrpgs with a side quest where youd have to go through a long ass dungeon to save a little girl or an old woman id wonder how the fuck did this childold person with zero combat experience make it so far in without being killed by all these monsters im encountering on every few seconds on my way to them or how they solved some puzzles without key item i needed to advance pass it i was a very analytical kid still am as an adult lol games that do explain shit very well are some of the modern tales games usually theyll have a magic science reason for their powers and spells tales of xillia how they use spells etc are from humans in their world having mana lobes which product mana in turn spirits absorb that energy to create a humans spell this is the level of symbiosis between humanity and spirits i fucking love it or tales of vesperia that use accessories or the aerith phoenix down thing was solved the same day it revives from ko status not bring back from the dead i relate the old school to my youth when i was much younger i just accepted things for how they were and just kept it moving amazed and dazed by the gameplay of these older gamers anyway now that im older and i left those days behind me i need explanations good ones well done narratives that provide a sense of immersion its like when i read a book i expect a good story well done writing consistency coherence i expect the same in my games now so like is it just me that notices the description of revival items in the ff series mentioning that they fix ko knock out incapacitated and do not mention bringing you back from death just nitpicking but i just thought its easily answered yeah im really enjoying octopath so far the stories are really entertaining so far however i cant say for sure that i think the ability to pick your starting character and then go in any direction you want is necessarily outright better than having story related character interaction regardless enjoying it a lot to be honest i would kinda have preffered a saga esque approach where each char has it own plotline that you must follow and once you have done some all or some plots fuse together towards one goal im so happy you made this video youre the first person reviewing the game that seems to understand that things are there for gameplay and dont need to make sense i love the 8 stories i love that they dont have to join up and end with a convergence id rather have this approach where it just happens rather than most games where realism is explained poorly or in many cases is just shoehorned in and youre left with an unsatisfactory explanation it also helps with the classic approach this game is taking new two part series octopath traveler which character should you start with httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkk0pzfk3dk wow where it all started making nintendo videos and now making vr videos the saving up of points in the battle system comes from an old ds game final fantasy the 4 heroes of lightnot the bravery games imo you said olberic wrong its olberic sorry goty rpg of the year for me im really loving it but my biggest issue is the lack of party interactions some small things like part banter during combat or something like xenoblade chronicles 2 where being in a certain place would trigger a small cutscene between party members would be very welcome if you use the merchant to steal from a boss you can get 2000 coins try the theif story i know that if i play the threehour demo ill stall out and have a hard time getting into the full game when it finally releases not the games fault thats just me so i havent played the latest demo i do wonder though if anyone knows are the path actions more equal than they sound to me it sounds like scrutinize will always be useful whereasthe one that shows you an enemys weakness will only be useful the first time you fight a given type of creature am i right or does it play better than it sounds i was hungry for more as i neared the time limit but thankfully i can just overwrite the save and play again im gonna do a third full playthrough again to play the last two characters the only concern is lack of interaction between characters i hope that it was just a demo thing otherwise i too am going to play the crap out of this game game of the year will be dragon quest xi but octopath could be 2nd place there one thing that you point out that its true i played the demo with the 3 hours and it felt like your only playing it just for the story which is ok but your right i hope they do a lot of side quest so you can explore more the town or village or the map because your only exploring for the treaser chest but thats it i hope they do side quest something like can you find my child he went on the cave so you go and find the kid you know like any side quest will do because this game is really shows that gonna be more 50 hours to beat it which i cant wait this game looks so awesome i already preordered it i dont particularly care for the preorder bonus but its there so if i was gonna get the game anyway might as well cant wait for the 13th cant wait to play this game on my channel im not hyped about the demo im addicted to it none of my friends or family have played my switch yet so im using their save files of the demo to play again hahaha its olberic you can play the demo multiple times just dont save and it will autosave a separate file for you every time you enter a different area at the end of the three hours then just choose not to save and it will keep your previous game intact the whole time i can see the inspiration from bravely its much harder than spamming 9999 damage moves 4 times which is good as much as i love this game it kinda feels shallow sidequests dont feel fulfilling and party member interaction is very limited and it just doesnt feel alive the game is super pretty and the music is superb but the world itself doesnt feel alive hopefully they can add more interactions before launch oh damn i thought this was gunna be a joke on how everyones saying goty from a 3 hour demo 309 i see your a man of class god of war exists you can actually replay the demo without overwriting your save data if you start a new game on the demo you can play through it without saving at all and it wont overwrite your old save theres even a bonus autosaved save slow so your second run would have an autosaved file while your old one retains your old save i know this because ive played through the demo 6 times haha is olberic that difficult to say brilliant review video bro i cannot wait too play octopath traveller the first demo was hella fun i havent got round too playing the 2nd demo yet but i will do i am calling it now octopath traveller will be the best aa rpg of the year a suikoden remake with this technology and graphics might be a good one this game is incredible already have it preordered through the eshop yes i loved the video how the hell so many views but no likes what no one wants to see more reviews from this guy dont worry jlp i like your content man keep it up my brother is playing right now wow howd you get so many views i subbed and liked smash the like button for more reviews you probably know this by now but the dev team behind this game was also behind bravely default and second nice review ill be looking forward to this as well i was going to get on july 13 but after i saw the playstation and nintendo e3 shows mario and sony took all my money im probably going to get around black friday or christmas still looks like a great game subbed to you cant wait for this game you never used the path actions in the first demo though i love rpg and i want to play this game when it comes out one of the best games ever made 3 im looking for a short trailer or footage collection for this game that mainly shows off the game and music without all the voices is there anywhere i can find something like this what year is it just bought just about to play fingers crossed for turn based bring back the love i played the demo and surprisingly enjoyed it a lot to say the least i normally dont like jrpgs but this game is awesome i hope a lot of people pick this up or at least try the demo only on nintendo square will bring its true unique talents two months man i want to listen to that soundtrack from 157 forward all day its so good i loved it lately ive felt jaded to traditional topdown rpgs but i played the demo and im buying this the day it comes out the music the voice acting the art direction cant wait for it the guy who voices olberic voices zeke d akihiko yoshida dont need to add anything else im sold 8 heros 8 paths 8 stories 2018 whats with 8 its getting all the good stuff yay its done now they can make bravely third this reminds of radiant historia a bit im having trouble beating the thief boss in the demo but im going to keep at it because this game has me super intrigued for the full release damn im gonna be so mad if this stays only on nintendo consoles golden sun 4 should use this grafic too definitely gotta give it a try project final fire emblem cannot wait for this game the demo was soooo fun it left me with wanting more this is my 1 for 2018 olberic okay monsters as festivus rolls on it is now time for the feats of strength 129 i think the name should be tales of legend if this videogame changes to an action 3d rpg like xenoblade chronicles 2 with those story mechanics it should be the new great franchise i love the nostlgic videogames but i would like 3d with an interesting storymechanics like this final fantasy vi throwback nostalgia graphics another switch sold maybe even two i really want this on the 3ds i missed these types of rpgs honestly my first sight of this game like is this when old school final fantasy and romancing saga combine into one game really i feel the vibe of those two in this octopath traveler somehow this and fire emblem are most wanted 2018 games for me this looks like the perfect game engine for a remake of final fantasy vi or chrono trigger man i played the demo and its good the name eisenberg was in bravely default wasnt it after seeing the demo played i was fairly disappointed a lot of exposition before you can do anything and even then its excessive and unneeded exposition sell me a story dont tell me one i can read a book on my own time this game should be called monochrome bloom traveler primrose friend was also killed and she kills her master who killed her friend and quote today is the last day i serve you and then she fights him 5 stars this game looks grrrrrrrrrreight most interesting looking game on the switch so far really looking forward to it ive heard that this game is exclusive to the nintendo switch it looks so nice no offense to the game team but thank god its still a working title oh square enix you have done it again 3 downloaded the demo today and its got such a nice story to it honestly ive played the demo with the two playable characters and i thought it was boring at first then i past the prologue and wanted more this trailer really doesnt do this game justice well time to buy a switch i wasnt sure about this game at first but after having played the demo im super excited i thought the graphics looked amazing in the trailer but of course its even better on a large hd tv the combat system feels awesome especially with the hd rumble it makes me feel that much more powerful additionally knowing when to boost and how much boost you should use makes for very interesting strategies i really cant wait to see where they take this game the twodimensional appearance of the characters in this 3d world kinda reminds me of paper mario lets hope itll turn out to be a worthy successor nintendo themselves clearly gave up on creating another ttyd is the heavy bloom just because its a trailer or will the actual lighting system look like that the bloom is kinda distracting from how good the graphic style is olberic shows up oh sweet beans its patrick seitz d this looks amazing and im totally going to buy it but wheres bravely third square enix in so excited foe octodad 2 8 children but seriously i cant wait for it the demo was super dope loved every second of the demo just glad i dont have a certain number of times i can use the demo because im going to be playing this over and over until the full game comes out outta my way olberic voice is huge guys u need to try the demo its tremendous so hyped for this game day one purchase the demo is fantastic i need to get a switch for this and breath fo the wild and mario odyssy took me about 3040 mins for primrose a lot more dialog and slightly less than 30 mins for olberic both sides where really fun but you only get the story until they leave their town after that demo ends and all you can do is go to either of the two main characters towns and the areas within everywhere else is blocked off by some npc visuals remind me of 3d dot game heroes not a good thing i want a pokemon game with graphics like this ive been waiting for this game since it was announced in january and i was so pleased that nintendo square enix surprised us with a demo after we hadnt heard a thing about it since january im so happy this title is getting the positive attention it deserves and i cant wait for the full game to arrive honestly its my most anticipated game of 2018 at this point i hope square enix will consider using this style in the future for brand new projects as well as remakes id love to see some classic jrpgs like the early final fantasy and dragon quest games remade in this 2dhd style this may sound stupid but think of the name of this land orsterraolbericprimrose also it has eight lettersthat could belong to the other travelers first names third traveler s fourth traveler t etc i have a feeling this will be revealed to be part of the long dormant saga series i cry lot i played on prim character remind me of saga frontier 2 hope nobuo uematsu or yasunori mitsuda as the composser of this game this looks amazing the storyline is so freaking amazing for everyone who chose to start as primrose did the story make anyone else want to or literally cry when i saw the word octopath i thougt something about octolings this is amazing usually im not into games like this rpg type games never really interested me before but after trying the demo they won me over this game is a must play like i think ill likely be playing this demo even after i beat it im hungry for the full version i would suggest this game to anyone keep the japanese subtitles but fix the brigand den cave mapping for the secret and overall exploration and a few less save points sweet demo overall loved the demo so much cant wait to buy the full version in 2018 i will get this this this is just its all its got i need to catch my breath i ran for like an hour oh ya the game looks cool can we get chrono trigger like this the game is almost perfect just make it more colorful less gray and brown please and get rid of that dark hue filter around the screen corners and the game will look perfect they should remake all snes rpgs with this style of graphics also give me more information on enemies hp and on what the items do before i use themother than that i love this demo if you dont release it on 882018 ill hate you forever that music baby i been waiting a long time for a game like this this reminds me of chrono trigger and i love it i dont understand ive never played a rpg and after playing the demo its definitively going to be a day 1 bought for me i hope it doesnt get delayed the title could be 8 diferent lights the voice acting in the demo are actually better than anything ive ever heard in any game for a long time is anyone else having flashbacks from final fantasy 3 this is merely undertale made by nintendo i find the lack of octopus shown here highly disturbing im so so so happy this isnt cancelled man i hate the flat character sprites everything else is beautiful and polygonal and they just stuck the characters on billboards its a shame because the style is otherwise beautifully executed this is the example of game i didnt gave a damn about until i played the demo i want more much more rpg like this on the switchyou could ressurect some franchise liek golden sun nintendo please ok thumbs up if you want a physical release of this from nintendo not just eshop there arent enough thumbs ups in the world for this for me turnbased crap gimme secret of mana instead reminds me of ff vi chrono trigger dragon quest iv ff tactics and godamn ogre battle i dont think this game can possibly appeal to me more than it already does day 1 for sure now if only i had a switch im really into this its been a while since an rpg i know nothing of has interested me this much im already in love with the soundtrack i will take this one over any recent ff games friken gorgeous ahh no words can describe how beautiful this game looks 810 too much paths i love the pixel art characters in the 3d land it reminds me of pokmon black and white as a pixel art freaking lover this is a must pick even if the gameplay is not good but probably will be awesome since its from the bravely default team this is a game i would get an epic looking rpg day 1 purchase dont even need the demo that old man npc is op it seems like a turn based more modern take on seiken densetsu 3 secret of mana 2 a jp exclusive i mean multiple characters with unique play styles and story plus the warrior guy reminds me of another character from that game and the dancer is like a mash between the origin of another character in that one and the personality of another i cant remember the names i agree that the name is pretty stupid but it looks sooo good remake of golden sun and ffvi like this please i feel like this is easily going to become a cult classic octopath traveler is the new next big thing there better be 8 save files so i can technically complete the game 800 okay 8 jokes aside this looks absolutely brilliant this game is incredible i can see it being rpg of the year when it releases nintendo is back baby this does look good but i hope its not too easy this is a game whom i truly can say that i feel at home with i will avenge my father through dance primrose oh my god i just played the demo and never even heard about this before i love this game already and cant wait for the full version looks like it has some bravely default and live a live feel to it i think it totaly looks like the bravely series i want bravely 3 i love the demo my only hope is that this game provides a meaningful reward for playing through all 8 paths if it ends up being just 8 separate rpgs that share assets i will be a little disappointed i hope they reward the diligence of fully exploring the games different paths with unlockable bosses challenges or even secret story eventsdialoguecutscenes ps audio and visual art style is amazing and i am a big fan of turnbased game mechanics im 100 going to get this based just on the charming environment i experienced in the demo yep buying this everyones freaking out about how sexy this game looks and i just want to know about the other 6 characters please bring back legend of dragoon in hd2d this game was so good man id buy the hell out of this one a remake of the finals fantasys of snes in this style would be great we neeed to mario maker on nintendo switch holy arceus too many shinyness spoils a little the pixel art i guess i need to buy a switch now i guess its the closest well get to a child of light sequel i hate you ubisoft i was not looking forwards to this when i first saw it on the nintendo switch presentation half a year ago but now after the direct i love it and now i want to play it and use it for inspiration for my own game i want this game and people say squenix forgot how to make good rpgs pshhhhh its visually awesome the battle system is kinda fun im really bummed i cant see how much health the opponent has and olberics prologue has somuchtalkingchrist ill give it a 8 when you get to the game itself its fun but theres just moments when it feels more like labor especially given that you cant skip cutscenes going with the music illustrations and font used this is not a final fantasy but a vagrant story game this looks amazing i want this allready bravely third who one of the few things that didnt seem like a waste of time to me in the direct give me this and more omg the music in this game i loved the demo still playing through it though i havent felt like this since ffiv on the ds this is the square enix that i love so glad theyre going back to their roots on this one the music is top notch as always too what i love about this trailer is that there is no graphical trickery what you see is what you get and what you get is amazing ill a switch for this not for mario or zelda or any of that i was nintendo loyal up until the wii this game will make me purchase another nintendo system remind me of romancing saga series amazing 2d art love it i want this gamelike yesterday i must say ive grown fond of the working title hope they dont change it just remove the project part i invite you to enter my channel where you will find my last drawings of the nintendo universe the demo is superbwill purchase the full what gorgeous piece of artistry i swear the art style itself should be put in a museum im getting a bravely default x wild arms vibe is it a gba game i love the art style hd2d nailed best games are from japan i think they change the name too brave souls or bravley souls so after watching gamexplains discussion i really want a final fantasy 6 remake in this style btw project octopath traveler a nintendo switch exclusive will be powered by unreal engine 4 yesss i cant wait for this or bravely third no new 3ds version love how the game looks but the project name utterly stupid someone was smoking some cigarettes of joy at square enix the music for this game is absolutely fantastic playstation fan here but this looks amazing looks like ill be getting a switch for this and xenoblade chronicles 2 just played the demo this game is amazing and i dont even like turn based combat day one for sure this game looks hela dumb and boring hoping this can top bravely default cuz that game is a feel destroyer just played it its definitely a jrpg experience ive been looking for in so long the only problem so far is the art direction they have going on its nice and unique however for some reason the colors are a little too saturated contrast being too high a little bit of subtlety and restraint could go a long way especially with its liberal use of effects in battle my other concern is difficulty while it is literally too early to tell i hope they give us a ton of challenging enemies that makes us really play with the characters abilities this game represents all in what final fantasy xv failed my opinion only i love final fantasy 105 i love the music that starts here dont change the nameit makes so much sense 8paths to the storyi love it im starting to dig the name octopath traveler i hope they decide to stick with it in the end omfg the music real hardcore rpg i love this so much square enix please put all the money on this one omg its beautiful this game is the main reason ehy i bough a nintendo switch the bravelt default staff is always at the top thumbs up square enix this game now has a subreddit join us at rprojectoctopath we are looking for moderators as well i playedwith the dancerandit very good story didntexpcet thismuch of thisgame but now its on my wishlist this is how i could imagine a golden sun rendition for the switch i like how they seem to be implementing the whole who you chose changes what happens idea that they used in seiken densetsu 3 this looks really promising just finished playing the demo for about half an hour this games gonna be good wow the music is superb this game is beautiful but the whole time all i can think about how awesome would it be to take this and make it into a true mario rpg sequel 108 is that caldisla from bravely default wow just take all my money this is damn beautiful and the demo was nice anyone else getting massive saga vibes from this such a beautifully crafted rpg you bet im getting this square enix if this does well please give us ff6 remake this game is pretty fun ive been playing the demo and i can say that this game is pretty good i hope that the 8 characters can have romantic relationships with each other that would be so awesome dear nintendo im so happy you bring minecraft to 3ds but i got question can please put like a demo version please ok and tho other people dont judge had a great time with the demo im really looking forward to this now best game of this nintendo direct played the demo and it was amazing this will be the best square rpg in years looking for a httpsyoutubetgc7yvskup0 played the demo found it to be fun probably gonna pick this game up the music is great when i heard it was from the creators of bravely default i knew this would be good i never got to play bd but i will play this i give this game an 88 this is the rpg that younger me loved and wanted more of so happy to be able to play another portable rpg soon i miss the feeling of losing yourself in the story through battles the characters etc to the point where you forget where you are and what time it is lol this game is gonna have so many hours put into it definetly getting it looks beautiful and very good looks almost perfect to me the only thing im worried about is that it sounds very open and i really dislike when there isnt a strong story tying up everything im not a fan of do whatver you want i love structure but ill buy tu support the principles behind it like classic sprites and rpg mechanics wow this game came out of nowhere for me wow it looks so unique the music sounds great and i cant wait to try it out goddamn turn down the shaders i would rather have new bravely game but ill gladly take this one too just finished the 2 scenarios this game is so awesome ill upload bosses video in a couple of minutes of all of the new games not from nintendo this year im probably most excited for this been playing the demo all day its great the setup of the 8 separate stories brings back memories of live a live if it turns out to be anything like that im instabuying jealous trolls be like i could make this with rpg maker in 2 weeks whos behind the soundtrack octopaaaaaath nobody suspects a thing this is an idea that has been done to death it looks gorgeous though see live a live saga frontier saga frontier 2 wild arms wild arms 2 seiken denetsu 3 just to name a few im loving the demo i want the game nowwwsjldskjfsdkfjadjfspodjfi 8810 ign too much 8 this seems beautiful and the music is fantastic ill give this a chance so i just played part of the demo with primrose and while i didnt get into gameplay i can say that the sound design art and voice contribute to phenominal story telling even if the animations are limited everything is so clearly telegraphed that your brain ends up making a movie out of it unintentionally akin to reading a book honestly i probably would been content just watching it but as good as the story may be i cant give it a grade till i get into gameplay im hoping the stories connect somehow not like sonic adventure but more like if your chosen character may pass or witness the effects of the others occasionaly during their travels oh this one was a highlight this is my kind of rpg awesome music 044 holy crud is that patrick seitz lets apperciate this music for a second please feelss so like old romancing saga yayyy i want this but im broke af the game looks very interesting i also like the aesthetic and any chance at an oldfashioned jrpg is always appreciated now can we please change the name and change it fast this looks freaking amazing and funthe rpg gamer in me is getting excited already id expect no less from the minds of bravely default octopath is this the splatoon dlc with playable octolings i think it definitely looks like something worth picking up i just beat this game i really enjoyed it just make the knights side quest less grindy and make it a little more story based like primroses other wise it was great you should defently play it if you havent i hope they keep the octopath title and make this a new rpg series with eight new tales every game i give it a 1616 because im going to buy it twice the game looks amazing get the demo on the eshop its amazing sothis game is kinda like live a live except its going to be released at some point thank you so much square the voice acting im pretty damn excited for this game this game gives me a major livealive vibes and it is impossible for that to be a bad thing i absolutely love how this game looks welcome everyone to the what is going to be the name of this game your objective is to guess the closest to what square will really name this game go this is honestly better than a ffxv port in the direct it said worldwide not in argentina nice gane btw hd2d if its flexible i want that on all 2d games all of them thank you and thank god for jim sterling all your own aint it more all of one of those eight 666 likes lel well i was here when i saw it anyways i really really liked what i saw and played congratulations square and nintendo is this going to get a physical copy if so this is a day one buy for me or or you could just make golden sun 4 just sayin help i cant contain this erection mario oddessy is now number 2 for games i want for the switch cause this looks amazing this is awesome played the demo for about an hour still going at it quite pleased with combat and the overall look and feel of the game high on my list of titles to buy for the switch isnt this more like 25d very beautiful eightly default gotta say what a game that demo was the best definitely the highlight of the show for me as someone who likes the brave default combat system this teams amazing style of art and music this was already bound to be high up my list but the converging stories and unique approaches to rpg overworlding of each character are what really elevated it above and beyond the music has already got me so hyped and coupled with the art style off to download the demo i love fighting random npcs i hope they take advantage of that and have great surprises i liked it the most in radiata stories mostly because you kick them it really reminds me 3d dot heroes the most though in looks just with 2d character sprites this demo make my switch hot on docked mode anyone i wasnt really interested at the first sight but im so hyped rn totally going to buy this game uuuggghhh 2d sprites on 3d worlds looks baaaaad like this looks just ugly the game itself looks neat but i cant get behind that art style im sorry the biggest thing here is the 8 main stories that is amazing seems promising but i wish it was on the 3ds or playstation i dont have the switch lol saga octopath traveler these gameplay mechanics look soo good square you need to make more games like this again the new bravely default looks good a nintendo switch exclusive from the makers of the bravely default series a definite must for both switch owners and fans of jrpgs this just bumped up to being one of my most anticipated switch games the blending of jrpgs and older table top style western rpgs is something that i always wanted as an rpg fan i have high hopes for this game about to play the demo im all for innovation in style but mashing 2d sprites in a 3d world is ugly no matter what game it is the reminds me a lot of dragon quest iv chapters of the chosen where you play as your party members i love this so much the better question is are all eight main characters going to meet each other and work together for one goal or something becausethat would be reading a novel with eight different stories without or somewhat interacting with each other ever so slightly wow it looks pretty so whos playing the demo right now definitely a 88 for me how is the game this close to being done and yall still dont have a set title is it me or have i heard olberic somewhere before this console is so garbage and fathers probably buy it for the cringy 12 year olds in this world or their just pathetic and sad dads that have no friends either ways this console sucks and probably the only reason its been sold alot because not everyone is 18 and parents dont always give them what they want pitiful and vexatious and of course cancerous 10 12 year olds play this trash console manso excited for this game while watching the nintendo switch presentation back ini think it was january i couldnt stop drooling over this game being shown and was wondering when theyd show it again this nintendo direct really made me want a switch and just in time now that a mario odyssey switch bundle with two beautiful red joycons is coming out in a bit over a month eisenberg has the same english va as dio from jojos bizarre adventure looks awesome downloading demo now i havent been this hyped since overwatch the graphics look so beautiful im going to download the demo once i get home i cant wait for this game that logo bravely default are you not smash im fine with not getting bravely third now we need revo for it anyway i know revo was busy with the sound horizon tenth anniversary last time and couldnt compose for second this time though bravely fans should be put first before sh we gave up seconds pst being composed by revo for laurants sh fans why cant laurants give up something for us bravely fans so we can have our composer back wait is that yami yugi as the voice of olberic we all know this is the new saga frontier live a live alright guys we just gotta make shure we dont go to wwlll before this comes out and were good love this game this music i need this now that musici wanna be in this journey please take me seems like a free to roam fire emblem game im somehow more hyped for this than pokemon i cant tell if that means that square did a great job with this game or gamefreaks game was subpar then again opinions this was the biggest thing from this direct for me i never finished xeno x so i dont want to play 2 and they couldnt make me more interested in mario odessy than i already was i think they should call it octopath please have the legend of zelda breath of the wild dlc pack two antagonistic man oh boy i cant wait to play as protagonistic man hey it looks interesting and all but could you make the game look any darker like seriously brighten up the atmosphere other than that it looks interesting primrose can allure me any day i got this in my newest video i broke youtube cool i wish this was on the 3ds i want this more than xenoblade 2puts up shield this game looks absolutely stunning im cryingthis is so beautiful im playing the demo now the music graphics and stories are incredible looking forward to this game this game needs to chill its already got me by the balls if only i had a switch id be on that demo immediately primrose one thicc bih this should be bravely third lowkey hyped for this im honestly interested in this game itll probably become super underrated im gonna buy it mainly cause it just is visually unique i like the art for the characters a lot besides the graphics please no more rpgs i have to purchase enough already eight brave souls eight lands eight stories i give this game an 8 i love the graphics its amazing how many choices you make in this game game looks amazing but the title is atrocious name it something like the eightfold path or along those lines but this just makes it sound like its connected to splatoon or has some other octopus theme this looks soooo awesome im incredibly hyped oh man so many thoughts on this the graphics are really intriguing as the melding of old school pixel art with 3d models gives it a very unique look and while theres not a great amount of animation frames for characters and enemies or even the basic walk cycle the fact that they are drawn frame by frame instead of using modern cheating animation techniques makes me really happy d and i absolutely love the way the background is out of focus giving the environment almost a model build feel to it though i wish they took this a step further by designing the buildings and trees like they actually where little model builds instead of just generic 3d models also the gameplay systems seems really cool i love how they are going for an open exploratory feel for the game and making every playable character have unique attributes even outside of battle and sticking with old school turnbased battling while infusing it with some new elements all in all im super stoked t who do they think that they are kidding with that working title tag project octopath traveller is exactly the sort of godawful name which squareenix specialises in they should just own it there is a certain charm in their absolute awfulness bravely default flying fairy may well be the best worst nonsense title for a game ever this game looks fantastic not gonna lie this looks amazing and right down my alley so is this like a big thing for rpg fans i dont get the hype cool cant wait to try the demo game looks crispy now this is an rpg am i the only one that is hyped for this game im first have you played octopath traveler let us know what you think one of the greatest jrpg of all time massive amounts of dmg does 1000 dmg this is a beautifully written video thank you although there are 8 separate stories its more likely that ophilia is the main character been playing and this game is amazinglyamazing why do people spoil games without warnings why show bosses while talking about a game amazing soundtrack that makes the game beautiful why its a square enix game cant wait for octopath traveler 2 on the switch perhaps my favorite turn based jrpg of all time multicultural group had to shoe horn in that nonsense didnt you if i wanted a game with 90s graphics id play one from the 90s not a wanna be 90s game in 2018 actually think this is a really solid review and explanation of how the combat is used as a story telling mechanic enjoying playing it even more now nintendo fans are so starved from good games with actual overarching stories that you can throw them a pile of dogshit and theyd dig through it to find anything that was not digested so that they could call it a plot the combat blows its load from level 1 of the first character it does not add a single new mechanic after that unless you count the other characters passives the main stories are at the level of side content from other games but here at nintendo those 8 shallow repetitive uninspired and unrelated plots are a masterpeace that has transcended other amazing plots such as the ones out of the hundred iterations of mario yo you mean to tell me that there are stories that dont involve rescuing princess peach from bowser woah how dare i say that these 8 stories are unrelated bbbbbbut cyrus once mentions a kingdom that olberic was a part of that must count for a lot also also also if you lowlife 80 hours into the game and with the he first game i bought on the switch cyrus but hes a warrior how come this dude is doing button commands like hes playing street fighter or something at the 631 mark lol ive done hundreds of battles and was never pounding at that dpad like that literally my only gripe with the game is one that bothers me with all rpgsgrinding grinding and more grinding but ultimately i deal with it since its a hallmark of an rpg and the overall game is usually goodfun while ive had to grind more in octopath than other rpgs ive played i still enjoy it a lot i also like the way the writing knows when to be funny and when to be emotive it actually got a lot darker and deeper than i thought it was going to really enjoying the game this is my favourite game this year i picked up octopath traveler only last week and ive already sunk 32 hours into it i am nothing short of overwhelmingly amazed the best review i have watched about this masterpiece which at 70 hours i feel i am just beginning the sum of its parts make it what it is a real work of art i like what youre going for but i am in starting chapter 4 of every character now and the lack of interaction and party exclusion from cutscenes is really jarring it feels like a university group assignment where group members go off and do their own part one of the characters stories and then chuck them all together at the end and submit it without really looking at each others parts the interaction is basically just a text cutscene on a black background which could have easily been something they added last minute to desperatly look like these characters have even met the combat is fun but i do not think it really is enough of a storytelling device to make up for the disjointed nature of the stories great review whos played suikoden 3 my favorite rpg on the ps2 this game shares some great qualities especially with the story and character depth if i had to sum up my response to this video with one word bullshit the battle system is definitely one of the best of its genre but character abilities that run in parallel with their personalities is as old as the genre itself while the game does a good job of this it is nothing new or unique so to say this is what helps push the narrative is a ridiculous overreach great story no game of the year hell no the key component of a jrpg is its story and that is undoubtedly the weakest part of this game how can a game have a great narrative or have a great story when during quest cutscenes the rest of your party literally disappears how many times does a non story party character have dialogues with npcs of a story character none the other 7 party members have zero effect on the story they barely exist during each others stories and dont feel like theyre present the party conversations are spit and bubblegum on this aspect of the game to keep it fr this game in my opinion is shet and if tried to talk about it would be to long and people wouldnt be bothered to read anyway mostly because of lazyiness and bad story and poor design choices that either they forgot to add or just didnt because they wanted to make it harder which just made it annoying brilliant yes which makes every random encounter last for fucking hours this is a really well done review boost points remind me of xenogears i feel like there is a reason why the storylines are simplistic since there are eight stories having it simple can make it easier to follow in contrast a more develop story could have an overwhelming feel to it for me its either this or ssb ultimate for goty octopath travelers combat is definitely what keeps me coming back to play but i was impressed by the story elements despite their lack of depth the individual stories are trope laden predictable to a tee mostly mundane as hell and yet still interesting enough to drive the game forward i especially like the small world vibe they give off which as you progress through each chapter reveals that the individual characters may not be so unrelated as they appear thus far im about 100hrs in have completed everyones individual stories and am in the process of level grinding to take on the ruins of hornburg good times i love this game but the thesis of this video is really thin reflecting a characters personality and story through their skills is maybe one of the most common things you see in a game so to hold that up as a unique virtue is really specious i agree that the combat system has very deep levels of complexity but stating that the combat helps flush out the narrative is a bit of a leap i am enjoying this game but the pattern of go to a village go to a dungeon and then fight a boss for every chapter can get a little redundant keep in mind that im only about 50 of the way through so if that structure changes it will be a welcome change my only gripe for the combat system is that some of the battles can run way too long i think the structure of the entire world is incredible for a 2dgame there are intricacies in both the story lines and the battle system that together make the actual map a wonder to explore with level caps blocking you from advancing to far into certain areas at any point in the game ive really enjoyed simply retracing my steps and going to caves that i wasnt strong enough for at the outset such as twinfalls or carrion caves the minibosses that exist within these caves are also a subtle touch that make every dungeon worth exploring whether attached to the main storyline or not sidequests also seem to blend seamlessly when you decide to start one that starts in one town like orewell but finishes in another like stillsnow whether the game is building towards unifying these 8 paths or not ive yet to see because im not anywhere near done with any single storyline but whether they do or dont doesnt matter anymore the exploration of the map is what i enjoy most this is kind of a stretch one verb per character doesnt make good enough story telling just one more excuse for bad writing im one character away from finishing everyones chapter 4 none of the previous 31 chapters could hold my interest at this point im only in it for the combat and the 16bit rsaga nostalgia that was a good review well polished and informative i was looking for more of a reason to pick this game up and this review gave it to me the game soundtrack and everything is beautiful but i wish we could remap buttons because we can play this one handed on one joycon instead of using 2 hands the start feels kinda slow tbh at 10 hours in im still 6 characters under level 15 i played bravely default and bravely second so the battle system feels familiar visuals and soundtrack are great and the combat is so satisfying its a shame the stories are kind of disengaging the battle system is horrible it takes forever to break their shields so a random encounter is 10 minutes long excellent video very insightful and thorough tbh listening to the review this video mostly sums it up to the characters do things appropriate to the character what i dont quite understand is how this is such a big deal as to warrant an entire video i mean can someone give me negative examples where a jrpgs character doesnt reinforce their character concept and another thing is that im usually joking about the merchant and how her combat style doesnt reflect a merchant at all so the video completely gets it wrong for her she collects money from enemies and stabs them if they dont pay up until they do pay up then kills them shes a mafioso not a merchant according to her combat style jesus mike is sexy and octopath is awesome this is actually a really good point about the game and i think its something ive noticed but not paid much mind to for instance i recall noting that olbericwarrior is the only job to have no innate elemental abilities while tressamerchants has the tradewinds ability to tie in with the theme forgoing the seff staple of aero as the wind element ability you were right that you could go on and on about the connections between the combat and the characters stories because theres so much detail there and i think it is a very poignant point about the game rather than the usual bad writing disjointed stories requires too much suspension of disbelief criticism though these criticisms are valid and ok to make well done the character the developers called a thief can steal from enemies in combat narrative masterpiece it also tells us why many of them can use different elements oh wait it doesnt i think the game is great but even so i think we are all giving square enix a freepass to leave out some things that would make the experience even greater like actual oldschool cutscenes and i also get annoyed a bit by the english voice settings i dont understand japanese so that could have the same problem but it annoys me to hear stuff like well now while the text states a complete sentence that doesnt even include those words id prefer fully voiced pieces of text or just no voice on those pieces if that makes sense the combat is the true shining star of this game i am about 15 hours in and so far most of the story or stories have been a little boring still a 910 game though easily truly excellent commentary changed some of my opinions about the game combat style reflecting character traits is practically expected of character driven rpgs at this point its nothing new and it certainly isnt the glue that holds the characters together lets not lie to ourselves there is no glue holding the characters together for a game so focused around its premise of eight great characters supporting each other through their individual journeys the game gives no thought to why the characters journey together how their personalities play off each other etc i like this game i love the combat and the stories themselves arent bad but it completely misses the mark on its main selling point how dare they claim to have a groundbreaking structure when all it amounts to is eight regular story chapters hacked to bits and stuffed back together in whatever order with no consideration for how that actually affects the flow of the game i love the visuals audio presentation and gameplay the story could be better but ill take it the world building saves the overall story i think we need legends of dragoon back but on switch that would be so awsome o philia clement c yrus albright t ressa colozone o lberic eisenberg p rimrose azelhart a lfyn greengrass t herion h aanit mind blown love this game its the reason i brought a switch im addicted to this game right now there is so much world building just about every npc has a backstory and some of them seem like they could be more interesting than the main characters am i the only one that didnt know boost points applied to special attacks i gotta pay better attention lol loving the game either way 10 hours in in terms of the combat system tying things together i also want to point out that every charcater has a voice over for every ability in the game sometimes funny somtimes surprisingly fitting always full of character so to speak why play this when anyone could play cod the peacock strut if battle chaser is for me so this one one thing id mention about the boost mechanic ive found so far it is almost never correct to only use part of your boost you typically want to go all or nonethe reason for this when you use it it doesnt recharge that turn so say you have 3 and use all 3 charges youll attack 4 times or max your skill and then next turn regular attackuse a skilldefend gaining a boost charge back if you instead use 2 of the 3 charges the 1st turn attacking 2 extra times and then use one charge once next turn you still used 3 charges but didnt gain a boost charge the following turn i hope that makes sense obviously when there are multiple enemies with different weapon types andor the character has the only damage types to break shields you may have to mix it up a bit just something i havent really seen or heard anyone mention that tattoo looks stupid as shit just annoying they didnt animate the enemiesfeels a bit half assed talk about the review of the ages i enjoy everything about this game good job to the developers please keep these games alive the combat it describes these characters with verbs rather than adjectives damn fine writing clickbait video no hidden mechanics revealed best rpg in a long time xenoblade chronicles 2 is second place now people who are ps4 players who want the game and are being haters then there are regular trolls gamespot should have gave this game a 90 one my top 10 list of all time 1 being dark souls really enjoyed his comments on the connection between gameplay and the characters personality it makes me think of how celestes themes mirrors its gameplay and story i fucking love the games music i like the combat but enemies at every turn damn i tried to save my game and as i was running to do so i got caught in another fight lol what gives great story so far though this is turn base ff 13 battle system just some honest feedback from a fellow player i personally think this is a bit of a stretch of course a characters abilities reflect who they are in a game like this thats true in many modern jrpgs look at xenoblade looks at bravely default look at realtime games like nier automata look at the other new game shining resonance refrain this isnt some huge new revelation and i think at best deserves a 20 second mention not 23 of the video to me if the combat didnt tell the story and reflect the characters that would have been a negative but simply being there doesnt amount to a huge positive its an expectation a quota its like praising something that should be there anyways that all being said i enjoyed the video itself even if i disagreed with parts of the message and its delivery your effort in the video and passion for the game a clearly evident and i did like your insight a lot youve more than earned my subscribe almost a week in i still find no glue omg you have my team in the thumb nail this video and your comments quote show dont tell should have been in the review and made it a 9 lol really nice way to put it though the thing you said about how each characters story and background is justified in the battles adding a much more believable depth in the characters and storywise spot on 810 was unfair its octopath not octapath just great review bravo great insight on a great game nice work square enix has paid yall off the game is mediocre maybe excellent if this was 1998 fighting isnt up to chance ummm should i mention bewildering grace can people stop the circle jerk already youre paying 60 bucks for something that looks like a ds game but omg its so beautiful shut up with the artsy bs game of the year runner right here why this game gives me golden sun feels that intro music had ne milly wopping lol nice video but video game characters having abilities that match their err character is nothing special in rpgs i dont see why you treat something thats so fundamental to most rpgs as an invention of octopath traveler this game looks like a bag of donkey shit people actually like this 50 for this ass ffs what ever happened to good games only good games on switch is fortnitemario odd mario kart zelda and donkey kong yet another fantastic video mike keep it up on chapter 4 for all 8 characters awesome game they stole the idea from bravely default amazing turn base give me a break loser hmm guys is this game worth it i want buy it but im not sure thank you for making this video in the style where youre talking directly to us also thank you for making another video about this great game whats the point of this video the combat in octopath is pretty straight forward theres nothing hidden about it as soon as i read on nintendo switch i fucking clicked off quick as hell great video showing the relation between combat and storytelling 20 hours in and its fire like almost any nintendo game gameplay story and graphics listen i know how you guys like the potato things but please do not ruin pokemon please xenosaga on ps2 used boost points as well there is one thing about connecting the stories that i do not see mentioned anywhere they are glued together implicitely by a cohesive world cyrus teaches about the fall of a kingdom that has fallen 20 years ago while olberic was the actual guard of the king who has been slain back then he also tries to get the knowledge about the evil god to be able to stop him if he ever will be unleashed which is exactly what the evil guys try in ophilias story another incredible video from a very easy to scare and awesome dude i did not think i would like the 16bit animation but it honestly feels even more immersive that way it feels like you have these figurines that youre moving around a game board and youre controlling the story truly a beautiful game that is the perfect amount of challenging as stated in the video if youre here to complain about the artstyle or graphics or anything that doesnt mirror a 3d action game please leave god of war 4 potato mode some of the comments are definitely from players to young to have played games like arc the lad ff6 etc so of course you would view this game differently listen go play gtav destiny 2 and halo games like this might be to hard for you the graphics are interesting the combat on this game is really addictive more turn based games shoud look into this im loving it i just got therion to level 39 and my ophelia and cyrus to 38 i cant stop playing give this game time to play after 10 hours or so it gets so much more various and awesome combat rounds this game is really focused on the combat systenawesome if the dialoges were way more human and emotional with great storylines it could be perfect this game has to win at least 1 reward at the game awards maybe try not to spoil some parts of the story on the video some scenes are from after the initial chapter and that is completely unnecessary is this a switch exclusive what is this ps1 game i got the wayfarers edition really great game bring back reboot second comment first like nice review do you take recommendations octopass this game is hecking beautiful sadly the graphics gave me a headache when playing the demo the blur is the background and the weird ring shadow in the foreground is ugly in the hunter womens opening sadly because the games have me a headache im happy i didnt buy it i never thought the grinding was bad in this game if you travel on foot and fight every battle you will actually become a little too overpowered by mind game cyrss is the best dam this guy is shit at explaining things and hes the reviewer i would say that it is a blend of final fantasy vi and saga frontier feel like this game has the potential to revitalize the jrpg genre haha i got a 3 item after trying twice soo helpful and i mean after trying to steal just twice not resetting twice i really lucked out and if youre grinding youre playing it wrong go do some dungeons no need to grind simply a matter of get good and explore the game demands you play smarter not harder now we want octopath travelers 2 pleaseeeeee if you avoid unnecessary fast travel then youll never have to grind and besides there are tons of secret dungeons to find as you travel this game reminds me more of suikoden than ff dunkey is right octopath is terrible i miss profile press for banter i hope they make a interwoven dlc story expansion octopath looks more like xenogearps1 minus the rotating camera view i thought its pretty grindless if you go follow all 8 story this guy is a game reviewer hes doing a bad job talking about this game lol im doing 4 characters at a time then ill do the other 4 and ill grind with them on high level areas well if they put the whole party into the cutscenes you would need 71 different cutscenes for that 1 cutscene depending on party size octopath traveler and xenoblade chronicles 2 is my favorite jrpg now forget final fantasy im done with them they dont play good as it used to be the only final fantasy i like is final fantasy x they added fast travel after the feedback they got from the first demo which supports your theory that it was balanced for people walking from one edge of the map to the other i think the grinding is not that bad because the battle system is good enough to let you win with skill instead if you are not completely underleveled also there are some areas in the game good for grinding ieexplore the side quests and early character chapters and optional dungeons are for grinding the gold axe absolutely not octopath traveler doesnt feel remotely like ffvi nor valkyrie profile its gameplay is just much too different to either games not to mention those 2 older games has more to offer than this dont let the retro look fool you it does remind me of valkyrie profile in the battles break you dont need to grind if you are doing the little side dungeons this discussion was kind of hard to watch lol ophelias bosswas weak to staffs staves each of the bosses in the 1st chapter are weak to at least one of the things that person can do and there was definitely a disconnect between the other guy trying to explain how the storylines work and how the moderator was understanding it but either way loving this game so far cant wait to play more wont know if their stories are connected until you finish the game i dont know anyone who finished yet calling it the stories will join into one after youve completed all 8 how amazing if they would do an all out attack game remind me of romancing saga 1 and 3 and saga frontier 1 due to choose a main character the old style final fantasy games 123456 and dimensions due to battles and graphics somewhat bravely default and bravely second due to boost lota pipe honestly its too hamed to me it just cant keep my interest sentamental indulgence was flatuated along with technical development of 3d for the yellow meet orange dragonquest foreplay ya give a little puff puff then you carve their innards out just to make sure theirs no hard feelings all of the storys arent connected thats a pass for me if they cant nail the story then na i thought i was the only one who got the valkyrie profile vibe this game looks like the best jrpg time in ps1 like you say valkyrie profile chrono trigger this kind of games have to keep coming retro style with gameplay so good thats even triple aaa doesnt have sometimes everything doesnt have to be 3d hyperealistic am i the only one who is bothered by the questionable art choice in battles when the heroes are sprite pixeled and enemies have cool stylised look i think this moment alone makes me whana skip the purchase of the game this game looks awesome how many times can one guy say like juicy joe juba ben hanson its nothing like ff6 your stacking attacks like the bravely series is what i gotten from it im really on the fence about this game i grew up with games like this and although i liked the demo im concerned about the lack of an overall story and party interactions finding chests in caves definitely gave me ffvi vibes haanit can summon beasts with swords though lol switch games nintendorks so desperate for games theyll buy anything this game has some cleaan music well these two have ruined this channel for me only reason i watched was because juanita is hot i dont think the game or the controller was broken the problem was the person playing had no clue what they were doing apothecary is a pharmacist your traveling down the wrong octopath my friend please no lets plays please god no goddamnit i didnt miss this i just didnt type anything these girls look like they never touched a game before do raine and juanita have any links dang i missed it gotta appreciate them student lives thanks nice gameplay great gameplay the story is where the game falls flat and this is the most predictable rpg story talk to people fight boss now do this 32 times i just bought the game looks great square enix is my favorite publisher great job i think i found a new game to play amazing video in every aspect expecially considering how small your channel is hard to find good non click baity reviews now days thank you for making a great review that included exactly what i had questions about really good video just wished it talked how good the music is and how well it fits in the environment and moods all these salty people complaining before even completing one chapter give the damn game a chance wow this splatoon 2 dlc was a lot different than i expected already started playing my copy but you know since the ground work is already done how about a final fantasy 6 remaster using the octopath traveler engine i play jrpgs for their music and stories the fact i keep hearing that the characters are almost nonexistent to one another is off putting ive read that the thief mentions that he prefers working alone in his story but ends up joining the other heroes anyway i hope its not that kind of narrative as i do plan on getting it eventually that really didnt sound like a 910 reviewlike at all yay a reviewer who can read the 72 point font and call it break and not stun stagger etc we need chinese language pls we need chinese language pls im so confused why they have done it this way theres nothing better than playing for 80 hours and finally coming to an amazing ending where everything comes together it makes the time youve invested feel worth it so what happens when youve completed 78 origins you just finish the 8th and thats it you wont even feel like youve completed the game by the time youve got to the 8th youd of forgotten the 1st or those in between im still going to pick it up but was really looking forward to diving into an epic adventure and being hooked how does it stack up to radiant historia perfect chronology because thats one of the best jrpgs ive played in years i dont get how people keep praising this games presentation blurry pixelart mixed with cheap 3d effects no thanks take a look at persona 5 for a game with amazing presentationthat game is a work of art 415 i think im going to need to unsee that 353 me outrageously over leveled nonsense hahahalooks at bravely default and second im perfectly ok with the separate 8 stories that dont intertwine i can focus on what i want to do if i dont feel like doing everything since your party isnt required to have any certain character besides your starting one trying to make party dialogue or a plot that includes multiple characters doesnt seem viable can someone please tell me what the music is near the end is it from the video game i need to find it please its slow and so beautiful starts at 400 thank you i cant wait for this games release tomorrow its going to keep me busy summer long no intertwining story can someone explain the collection of he other characters to me i loved the demo but only got my second character shortly into it do you have to rush through the game just so you dont have to wait 30 hours to finally get the 8th character if you are not skipping their origin storiesprologue how do you get all 8 without a bunch of forced story grinding i am buying it tomorrow regardless but want to know what im in for is anyone else a bit disappointed not a lot of replayabiliry you said thinks to self about upcoming 25th playthrough olberic best girl i think there would be a lot of replayability in that you can skip the talking i thought it was a spiritual successor to livealive theres one thing i dont get i have the choice of with which character i want to start but lets say ive started with therion ill level up on the way to the next character lets say alfyn when i play the story of alfyn but with therion in the team am i not overpowered for alfyns story foes did the creators really build in so many variables for these many cases i doubt it but i dont get it im simply amazed of the fact that i cant really comprehend how they solved this thanks in advance mates there is a final boss sorta sealing the story for all characters where you use all eight in two epic battles edit cyrus and tressa are my favourites the character righting was really amazing almost surreal to answer a question that wasnt answered if you do all the main storys in the game it unlocks a final story with lots of cheractor interaction pretty bad when 25 of the answers are i dont know there are four chapters with each character so thats all around 32 chapters and when you count in the fact that every chapter is around 1 hour that becomes 32 hours with just the story but theres also tons of dungeons loot chests and side quests so that could easily turn into a good 100 hours back in the 2000s suikoden has 108 heroes and have a cutscene according to the party you go with and harvestmoon has a ton of cut scrne the lack of communication among traveler in this game could be added in some noncanon cut scene like when visiting cold area maybe alfyn ask the other if theyre fine or prims feels the temperature etc etc etc or maybe the developer has in mind that the chapter is semi open world and by adding cut scene could lead to the ambiguity and inconsistencies story development one bravely default ref so far in merchant chapter 2 tressa does edeas mrgrgrgr for second jobs you have to find shrines for each of the jobs had a character interaction between hannit and therion where she takes a shit on him for being a thief but then later i made her a thief too through the secondary job what a hypocrite no dignity honestly a tip that i can recommend if you want to start off id suggest getting apothecary second job first then whenever you get a new character with a lot of jp around 630 then you can give them the hale hearty skill early and get a major buff for anyone who is much lower level does the na version have japanese text in you play it on a japanese account does the na version have japanese text in you play it on a japanese account does the na version have japanese text in you play it on a japanese account does the na version have japanese text in you play it on a japanese account does the na version have japanese text in you play it on a japanese account okay i know that probably nobody will see this and noone cares but when the bravely default music started i started to cry these games were so beautiful you really should have played the game first before answering all these questions there are so many questions answered wrong here lost me man answering questions about the gamedoesnt know that secondary jobs are just found in certain caves for free you dont need to level a single ability in any jobyou just find the shrine and get the job i personally think therions chap 4 is dark as fuck ideal parties would be 1 of each path action type of character prim and ophilia essentially have the same interaction skill as to olberic and haanit as do alfyn and cyrus however id say that tressa and therion have the most different path actions both of their skills are good for your finances but therion lets you unlock locked chests which i adore and you can pickpocket on a percentage based chance whereas tressa passively earns money and instead of stealing you can buy stuff from people and on discounts but some people charge higher for market price on some items and some people are unwilling to sell certain items from their inventories each path has 4 chapters and they level up drastically so its beneficial to go to each characters chapter 12 so on tressas chapter 2 has the best bravely defaultsecond reference in the universe jobs arent based off of how much you fill one jobs skills in its about finding where those jobs are located and can be done anytime if youre willing to adventure into higher level areas for a bit there are encounter rate modifiers but youll have to find and equip the items and beating the true final boss gets you an item that stops random encounters entirely for leisurely travel visibly its inspired by 6 but not story or gameplay wise really there is a point of convergence of all of their stories and a true final boss just have to hunt for it i would say that octopath traveler isnt a good place to start for people unfamiliar with turn based rpgs because this game will give you an unrealistic expectation of how amazing rpgs are because this game is amazing new game you are incorrect about secondary job keep playin bub the game dont tell you that each boss has over thousand health and dont get me started with the side quests i have a very important question why does helgenish insist on calling me kitten im clearly a full grown cat there is a final story and a girl behind some of the final bosses being evil and you have to fight 10 bosses in a row without saving the order of the bosses chapter bosses you fight without saving one boss per character ch4 ch3 ch3 ch4 ch4 ch3 ch4 ch3 final boss cutscene final boss i read somewhere that your first character is locked to your party until you complete their story not for the entire game if you havent beat the game dont review it yes there is a final story im interested in this game but i downloaded the demo played haanit and just could not beat her first boss is there a trick to the combat system do you have recommendations to beat the bosses is there a benefit downloading the demo if i own the game already like how pokemon sun and moon gave you ash greninja do you get an exclusive item you know your characters can talk to each other as press said person if you have will interact to each other in their own way as you can get items from chatting to them to are the stories different between characters for the whole game like after the prologue does the game just end up exactly the same for each character octopath traveler 2 for the win hehe this game is a gem if you love jrp gs and some vibes from ff6 also i would love to see a bit more steampunk in the next game tho like ff6 but still buy this game as for the secondary job question you need to find the shires on the map each one is appropriately in an area outside of that character classes hometown and yes you have to wear the new cloths but only in combat outside of combat there is no change dont answer questions about a game if you have no fucking idea what youre talking about you arent even right about how to get secondary jobs which you can get as quickly as a couple hours in fucking trash content creator there are 4 poeple to a party right could you do one full play through with 4 characters then another with the other 4 characters or it just faster better to play all 8 in one go alfyn is trashhhh cyrus and haanit are op you can get an item later on in the game that reduces the encounter rate any romance primrose is boss love her as a red mage do you think it will be made for pc and steam the no party communication is a huge no no for me i love the rest of the game but so far ive got 4 characters and whenever you go into a section that is one persons storyline the others just disappear as if theyre not there and the bad guys dont see them either there is no banter between party members basically and this makes the game pretty crap in my opinion it makes me just want to play final fantasy 9 or something i miss the interaction of all the characters going on a quest together this feels like kids of today hanging out on snapchat theyre all therebut not actually there probably used the wrong there but oh well haha 1053 cyrus has the ability evasive maneuvers which you can equip to lower the rate of random encounters so yes it is possible to lower it you can equip and unequip whenever you want to im definitely enjoying the game with a few complaints bouncing back and forth between stories kinda sucks because by the time you get back to that sane character you forget whats even going on anymore i have to grind right now for a boss because some of my party is under leveled because they dont gain exp if not in your party ive been over random battles since the early 2000s the random encounter rate is obnoxious so i always keep the cleric in my party to lower the encounter rate which should have been the rate to begin with games like chrono trigger and chrono cross ended that annoyance years ago and in 2018 it feels super dated it def got repetitive finding and doing all the characters prologues they are essentially all the same set up and very predictable and so far none of the characters stories are that compelling battle system graphics and music are all on point im on chapter 2 with therion rn but i have to grind to beat this boss and i rarely run from ba you can get the job before you get a class by going to the jobs shrine the shrines are in the chapter two locations that are connected to the city that you recruit the character as someone who has no sense of direction i would suggest looking up the locations of the shrines do i need to train everybody i heard it takes 6 hours to grind in each area sounds like a lot combat has a valkyrie profile feel to it break 223 wrong its tressa do you like this or xenoblade 2 better i didnt finish the game so idk most of the question thank you you have answered me nothing the only jrpg i played before this was pokmon which is basically its own genre and i wanted to get into more traditional games of the franchise and this caught my eye im only 2 hours in and im already enjoying the game and its mechanics secondary jobs you have to discover its not play until you unlock them does the na version have japanese text in you play it on a japanese account i started with haanit how do you select the next character is there a chef or catmancer class in the game i actually kind of like those classes in bravely second the music in this video is from bravely default i cant believe it no one ask about the language of this game can the game play in japanese voice or japanese text thanks please remake final fantasy 6 with this art style and or graphics can we finish game on solo no party im lost how stories work in order to know everyones storydo we need to just restart and play each one if so thats like a million hours just going through everyones storythey really didnt do a good job explaining how this works what is the bgm around 1200 it sounds so familiar but i couldnt reacall whered i heard it im hearing conflicting things another video said that all you need to do is complete another characters chapter 1 before you gained access to their job for a secondary what paths are the spiders on lmao teamtherion as time goes awhn so the character you pick to start is always locked in your party but wouldnt the character whose path your currently doing also have to be included like if you started with tressa but youre doing ophilias chapter 2 wouldnt both need to be included tressa permanently ophilia just temporarily the background music sounds like bravely defaults land of sand and a large clock so excited to play as primrose again im so ready for this game it may have just been me but did anyone else get annoyed by the way he kept calling them chapter onestwos rather than firstsecond chapters just bugged the hell out of me lol my neuroses aside i am so ready for this game haanit therion alfyn and cyrus will be my starting four great video but being a huge bravely fan and not knowing if well ever get third youre wrong for putting that bravely default music in the qa lol no but really pre order is set im dying for friday to come im loving this game its a great bedtime story starting with alfyn i think he reminds me of peter parkerspiderman damn thats major points off for me already knowing that passive leveling doesnt happen with non active party members 100 still picking this game up but god i hate it when rpgs do this so much pointless grinding is eliminated when all members level at consistent rates and it doesnt feel like i am losing out on possible strategic opportunities when i can utilize my entire parties potential do you think they will make any dlc or like an expansion im counting down the days til the 13th but i just feel like im gonna be pretty sad when i eventually finish it lol gotta say it seels to come up short of what i was hoping itd be but idk ill wait n c going 2 pay for my copy today cant wait to play this saturday this game is released finally bravely third can start thanks for the answer on party interaction i also saw another bit in game informer about a small interaction involving tressa and alfyn hopefully in later chapters theres a little bit more great video so glad more people are covering octopath this game is so awesome so excited for its release q and a is a good idea for a game like this i might try that in a future video thanks for the inspiration lol they did confirm at e3 that all paths will connect near the end and will have 1 villain in control of everything alfyn tiz i found my main secondary jobs wont be obtained by getting every skill in your first job you have to find a shrine for each secondary job where youll get the ability to equip one of your party members with this secondary job only one character can have a specific secondary job at a time ive finished the game and its absolutely amazing 3015 i noticed you left in that these nuts moment you had on twitter good man xd is there any item or passive that allows you to see the enemies health bars i just hope as the story progresses they connect more and more question 1 you can reach all 8 characters in the 3 hour demo one play through i know of at least one speed run that hit all 8 in less then 2 hours a cinnamon roll is a character that is very kind and sweet but faces more hardship and suffering than they truly deserve comes from the usage of an article headline from the onion titled beautiful cinnamon roll too good for this world too pure to describe a person or character that is very good but faces a lot of pain in their life i dont think you know what cinnamon roll means 1214 hours for every character 122 seriously its a 60 to 100 hour long rpg do you really have to ask for replayability i feel like there must be a final part of the game with a common path with all 8 characters i cant believe there would just be 8 separate small stories and then its over if you dont like turn based jrpg grinding and repetition then most often than not you wont like this game im a fan though so i will get it first day of release so excited i really interested in the lore of the game regarding the 13 gods but im actually relieved that there doesnt seem to be a huge converging ending where the characters have to travel to an evil realm and fight the 13th evil god i dont know if thats the case but ill be happy if story is less crazy then most rpgs square did a nice job of transferring a 3ds game over to the switch and selling the 2d backgrounds i1m starting two separate saves for this game each with 4 members only that way i can enjoy all of them without having to switch characters every time the first is therion main alfyn haanit and primrose and the other is with ophillia main is there a final boss maybe theyll have a converging ending where the last crow man is at the final kindling area and he turns out to be the man olberic is searching for and has stolen the dragonstones and the tome and kills haanits mentor that pirate dude and alfyns hero xd the subclasses are not unlocked by learning all skills of the main class they are unlocked by praying to the corresponding god at a shrine for example the god of the clerics is aelfric so in order to unlock the cleric subclass you need to pray at a shrine of aelfric sealticge for dancers alephan for scholars etc i just love therion dont even know why what are you doing on youtube get back to beating this game cracks whip but seriously fun qa hope youre having fun cant helo but feel this game sounds dissapointing the demo made me pretty excited but the more i hear about this game the more worried i am that i will actually like it still on the fence is it going to mess me up if i only play with 4 of the characters for my first playthrough and then do a second with the remaining 4 i dont like doing rotating teams and id prefer to just have one team of 4 even if i have to play the game again cant wait honestly im just confused as hell about how this games storystories work doing eight chapter ones followed by eight chapter twos and so on sounds so disjointed dropping one story to pick up seven others before returning to the first but then doing it one full story after the other wont you have progressively op party members supporting a level 1 character as they begin their stories fighting level 1 enemies etc does anyone know if i buy the game in belgium or other country will i be able to change the text idiom to spanish 218 well while listening to the atlasdam theme i noticed it kind of sounded like caldislas beginning theme cyrus is the best waifu it got all 9s from famitsu 3640 so that makes me feel better about my preorder people do realize ff6 wasnt the only rpg to use this style of sprite work back in the snes days right i am getting fed up with everyone comparing this game to ff6 probably the biggest reason so many seem upset with the idea that this game may not have an overarching plot is due to it being compared todescribed as a ff6 spiritual successor this game is its own game the only real old school rpg it may have any resemblance to is the saga series only because of the idea of having many main characters with their own seperate stories when you send out an npc youve alluredrecruited is it one use per npc can they be rerecruited if so or can you run out of allies eventually thanks for clarifying on the save files derrick it was a small tidbit but i appreciate the info so i dont need to delete a file to start a new game just a small correction the produced never said it was a spiritual successor to ffvi he just said it was inspired by vi mechanically looking forward to this game so much nice to know ahead of time that we need consider party management and that first character cant switch out i only played the first demo decided to skip the 2nd and planning on picking this up on release date regardless to be honest it doesnt seem like the video revealed anything we couldnt see from the demo can you use multiple path actions per npc example rob everyone then recruit everyone im starting to think primrose is your waifu i hope this was recorded at least a week ago since it sounds like derrick is not even close to the end i strongly advise to not do a review when you havent finished the game but gotta hit that embargo for publicity and monnnneeeey agh i think its pretty suspicious how much he likes primrose maybe he was brainwashed by her my theory ive thought this for months now if youve noticed all of the characters are along the edges of the world with the noticeable omission being the center and each of these characters is setting out on a personal journey around the world but while we know where they start we dont know where theyll end up see where im going with this ive always believed that each characters story is isolated from the others but everything will climax at the end where they all meet up in the center of the world and i believe that all of their issues will be connected too like theres one overarching villain or group responsible for all of the characters conflicts and thats when their stories intertwine i believe that there will be two endings also ala bravely default as they specifically mentioned once that you can complete all 8 characters stories in one play through so my thoughts are that if you complete all of their stories before going to the middle then you will i dunno man im feeling a bit turned off from it i pre ordered it but the lack of interaction between the characters so far sound a bit dissapointing i was hoping thats a demo thing only actually im kind of disappointed by this i was hoping for a more traditional rpg game with a great story but this just kind of seems like a cluster fuck octopatheight pathssquare enix chose that name for a reason we should probably look at this as a game with eight different paths and the only reason theyre meeting is so that we can finish the entire game in one play through youre wrong about how you get a second job at the treehouse at e3 they showed some characters with multiple jobs in gameplay and they didnt have all their skills in their first job maxxed out they were able to buy skills in multiple jobs and since they actually did so during the demo we know that the two jobs have independent jp requirements for the next skill and the second job even follows a different set of scaling jp requirements oh and they did not show us what the skills were on any shown characters oh and i was actually able to acquire 4 party members in the demo of the game you can save a lot of time by skipping cutscenes and not listening to the backstory and i played through twice the second time doing the same things but skipping everything up to where i was when my timer ran out the first time then continuing normally first time i picked up tressa and olberic then ran out at the entrance to the cave in ophilias story and the second time i w finished my 3 hour demo run last night as the thief and picked up the hunter along the way boy was i sad when the 3 hour time limit came up the lack of alfyn recognition is killing me im curious if you have to the chosen character in your party at all times and characters dont gain experience outside of the party does the chosen character usually end up vastly overleveled compared to the other members of the party a little disappointed nobody asked derrick who he thinks is the best girl in the game derricks adoration of primrose is puzzling shes pretty much your run of the mill edgelord or edgelady in this case nothing especially interesting about her the art style remind me the mmorpg ragnark to get the second job looking at other reviews there are hidden shrines around the map thay give those jobs weve already found out that thats not how you get secondary jobs lmao this is kind of useless when your responses to all the questions that arent already easily answered online are i dont know yet or incorrect is there any mini games the impression ive been getting is that its a good game just not what people expected it to be the demo personally pleased me so ill be picking this up jeez it seems like the majority of these questions would be already answered just by playing the second demo i switched my first character from therion to primrose in the demo primrose is now my first character i thought you couldnt do this i picked primrose ill be ok right how does the you surprised your foe or your foe surprised you thing work is this chosen at random how exactly does this impact the battles please answer this in your review thursday ophilia is the best poor girl first gonna play al the badies then all the goodies i like primrose the most just because she is the first character i played in the first demo so when i get the full game i think i will start her first the question is which party member should i get next to help primrose after her first chapter i think olberic may be good to go next since primrose isnt really strong in physical attack or defense and having manpower party member or tank like character is probably best for her i really dont like the somber atmosphere of the game also the fact that there are 8 characters makes me think that the story will not be focused on one specific great one japanese or english dub with the developers constant mention of final fantasy vi regarding this game do you think theres any chance theyre using this engine and art style as a possible test run and if the game is well received and sells well that we might finally get either an ffvi remake or sequel in this style i feel like a lot of people if not most regard ffvi as the best in the series and yet squareenix has never done anything with it but sub par mobile ports i personally think a fully voiced ffvi remake or even sequel in this style would be amazing i think weve already gotten enough final fantasy 7 content for two lifetimes itd be nice to see ffvi get some love im playing octopath traveler demo while watching this now some concerning items nonparty characters dont gain xp also no party communication just went through the prologue stories in the demo i have to say some of them felt corny and cliche as f visually however it is a looker cant help but love the hand crafted pixel art mixed in with modern effects gonna wait for a good amount of reviews before buying good video but why does he keep answering similar questions i cant get over how pretty the graphics are i especially love the particle effects and sparkly snowsand really looking forward to playing this thanks for answering my question 2325 uff overall that sounded pretty bad about the game i also cannot believe that the subjob requirement is filling up your first job it was already confirmed that this is not the case maybe you missed something in the game gamexplain regarding subjobs you actually get them by finding shrines near their respective character not maxing out all their abilities and the differences between for example tressa and theirons path actions is that one is noble and one is rogue tressas is noble so your reputation cant go down while theirons is rogue which means it can suffer so you are not even half into the game this seems like a long jrpg in the demo i went to the tavern when i had five characters and tried to swap out the party leader and it said you cannot swap out your party leader at this time im sure youre pretty far in the game but when it says at this time i get the impression that you can eventually swap out the party leader i guess one way to add replay value is to just recruit 4 character and go through the whole game that way probably makes it harder though lol in kirby star allies their a fourth dream friend this game makes me moist i think when i buy this game i am going to pick a character and finish their story before going on to the next yeah i know derrick mentioned you have to do a little grinding but i enjoy doing that if i am constantly switching between peoples chapter 1s and 2s i will lose track of what was going on cant wait for this game though 623 okay the red around the camera bothered me when i was playing i guess its only in tv mode because i didnt see it in portable mode i really really really hope that theres more than 8 jobs because the battle system with only the 8 basic jobs get very old very fast i can forgive the very odd design decisions regarding the whole lets have very few interactions between party members because we decided it would be open but having very generic battles that gets repetitive by the end of the prologue is a big problem and the fact that developers never announced it in any ways makes me think we will be stuck and it will suck i guess the answer by friday will come up ophelia was my choice cause we always need a heal bot sounds good that its split into bite sized chunks cus i cant sit and play longer than 2 hours at a time followed by a long break appreciate you answering my question derrick thanks not got a secondary job yet sounds like you still have a long way to go judging by how they claimed that was a big feature of the game so much misinformation sigh best sleeper hit of 2018 i dont know who to start with help its either therion or primrose im not interested in the game i just love gamexplain i played the demo chose primrose just cause i like dancers in fantasy i am in love does he mention whether or not after the initial chapters you have to keep the character relating to every chapter in your party when you play it or can you put together one party and tackle each chapter without having to switch out one of your main party members therion is best boy i feel this game is overpriced usually switch games that use these retro graphics are around 3040 dollars this one is 60 dollars i might pick it up if it ever goes on sale as for what you said about this not feeling like ff6 i felt this was like ff6 from the first demo in both games you get random monster fights from walking around and the battle system is nearly identical with the way you choose an attackitem from the menu thats actually why i got bored with it because i felt like i played it already the second demo didnt make it feel any differently and i only put about 2030 minutes into it before getting bored again im lowkey excited to play this is there any hd rumble ophilia is best girl the special edition map is two sided and its an old school style square rpg there will be some kind of expansion or change to the map through story im still thinking and hoping that the stories will converge into a central noncharacter specific chapter after completing all of the characters likely 4 chapter stories running speed increases the encounter rate according to the dev update video they did a while back im playing the prologue demo and i chose the teacher first im not even farther than 15 min in the demo but im fighting the other teacher who stole the book super very early in the demo i keep dying i dont know how i can win when i have nothing not even hp consumables what do i do i dont think theres a clear message or theres a disconnect that acquiresquare is sending vs how consumers are perceiving the game first the game is called octopath traveler you should be able to deduce that theres 8 paths to be traveled i think if they wanted to make sure we knew that rather than making a more conventional name for a jrpg but then again we got the producerdirector i forget saying its a spiritual successor to ffvi and besides graphics it doesnt seem to be the case i think the best way to go into this game is that youre experiencing 8 10 hour rpgs in one the lack of interaction is disappointing but it was kind of expected out of a game this open im just looking forward to seeing how each characters story pans out i dont want this game to be final fantasy vi nor do i need it to be i want it to be familiar but at the same time something i havent experienced and i think theyve done a good job of accomplishing that it took 12 hours for you to meet all of the characters i got to 4 of them in the demo didnt finish the fourths intro though do they progressively get harder as you go 1116 thanks for answering my question derrick we need therion and primrose for smash wish there were timestamps for all 45 questions but that would be way too tedious thank you for the video this gamesmash and jojos this year its a good year cyrus for smash i miss your smash bros videos gamexplain please give us more plea about possible characters top 10 soundtracks that needs to be in smash etcetera sorry i know offtopic whats updogs loved the one yall did for xenoblade chronicles 2 before that released it got me even more hype thanks for these first nice video steam lol this is my first jrpg and im having a great time i wouldnt consider myself a hardcore player though does someone know if you can create uncompleteable quests by messing up or will the outcome always be the same will there be a physical copy of the game i know i have 128 gb sd and barely 10 gb down but i just want the physical for less space still although physical isnt my style and i prefer digital bcuz its better in erryway i like having the game case and seeing the inside of the case art like skyrim case and zelda is it possible to see the enemys amount of life demo was great the depth of field is vital to the art style and i hope it remains untouched in the finished product foreground and background wtf those low res sprites the art style is very much ff tactics or vagrant story i like it man final fantasy tactics would look lovely with these graphics i would subscribe but i cant stand your hello lovely peeeeeoople what is a college student who has no money supposed to do with a game like this thanks for the review very much looking forward to this demo was great could you elaborate on character interactions im not a native speaker what do you mean by soft graphic i hope people dont judge the story by the 3 h demo tho game is super difficult pass i played the demo it looks fine the softness is part of the aesthetic that it really pulls off also you dont have to be a hardcore rpg player to get the combat there are a set number of weapon types and elemental types enemies are weak to at least one of these types of attack its like pokemon but simpler its also pretty easy to figure out which enemies are weak to what based on geography if the enemy is near a heros starting area one or more of its weaknesses will be one of the weapons or elemental moves that hero can use so lets so youre near the hometown of the hero who uses axe and frost the enemies around his town will likely have a weakness to frost or axe the game is pretty lenient with this because once you figure out what the enemy is weak to it will mark that attack type in the little squares below it so youll never forget so essentially the first time you encounter an enemy will be you figuring out its weakness then the rest of the time a mainstream 2d rpg okay im now officially buying a switch maybe a 2d zelda and a 2d metroid soon after the first demo i was not interested i dont know what it was but when this demo came out i said let me give it another try after playing the full 3 hours i am wanting this game the story was fun and interesting and hooked me i am wanting to see how the story develops and i love the combat its very fun i also love how special abilities from the 8 different characters make you react differently to the world i am excited so its challenging good should i get normal edition or compendium edition because i am not sure omg i said to myself i hate this game now i am freaking love it i dont know what happened to me but this game its gorgeous and the game play is amazing try the demo on the switch omg the music is also amazing fuck i cant wait for this game now this could have been the next golden sun interesting the style of tactical rpg gameplay makes it sound kind of like final fantasy tactics without the map even the special effects are pixelated wtf please check out my latest nintendo themed youtube video httpsmyoutubecomwatchvg81yagzsyks thanks square for giving us a game that feels like something you put out on snes thats all us 20 somethings wanted so excited for this game music and graphics and gameplay and story is all so very solid and good the harder you say the game is the more im like yes the break system just looks like the generic rock paper scissors weakness in ff13 ughhhh random battlesthought that ended like 15 years ago wait they changed the way the bonus power up things work now blocking is tge only way to get them thats so much worse why did they do that challenge challenge i fear no challenge pokemon has babied me with their difficulty so i want a real challenge even if it means taking on the dark souls of rpgs come at me for my blade is unbending i wonder if there is actually enough content and what kind of things can you do after the story maybe a really hard mode i dont find attacking to stun your enemies to gain a damage free turn sophisticated hopefully the approach to combat changes with each character i really liked the demo the music was so good im excited to see the complete game i hope this is hard basically im a genius probably smarter than any two people reading this combined i just solve things every thing its a curse imagine knowing everything instantly what lesser minds take hours or days to even begin to understand i know within seconds yes im that smart this looks way better than i thought it would its been upgraded to a definite purchase how hard could it be getting 60 fps devs need to understand the gameplay satisfaction of smoothness its wins over a slight graphic boost any day whisper sharp difficulty curve to me one more time this is day one stuff for me i adore jrpgs i slept on the demo then played it and fell in love with it im stoked for the release id ideally like the special edition and good let it be hard i dont need a game dumbing down for me im 25 not 7 60fps is literally pointless for a turn based jrpg id much rather them focus on graphical effects and resolution over 60fps theres something sweet and simple about a game that has snes style graphics i dnt care about graphics but i need interesting combat and a great story talked to another gamer today and he mentioned this looks interesting but im unsure i dont that im more of a casual player i am buying this no questions another month lets go man did i just see you get into a random battle with some random monster you cant see i hate that michanic so damn much nintendo life did you experience frame rate drops while playing the actual game i know experienced a few in dock mode while playing the demo i really enjoyed the demo for this game so i cant wait also i have to say the way you say hello lovely people reminds me a bit of christoph waltz very cool i cannot wait for this game if you like such games try battle chaser nightwar turnbase good difficult and nice artstyle im done with it and waiting now for octopath lighting is both the beauty and a curse of the demo to be honest sometimes everything is so blury you can barely tell whats what but whatever still the game im looking forward the most the game points out enemys vulnerabilities and they lose a turn when exploited how much more forgiving do you want it to be shhhh dont complain about it being difficult theyll hear you and make it super easy like all the other games nowadays great review after ni no kuni 2 im really ready for a challenge this game should have better graphics or at least 60fps 30fps just seems lazy we know the switch is more than capable also the artstylegraphics are a bit silly for a full priced 60 console game i typically dont play jrpgs but i played the demo of this game a lot and i absolutely love it i am so excited for this games release i typically struggle with difficult games but octopath traveler or at least the demo is something that i love aside from level grinding for primroses boss but it is so satisfying to take him down i think its stupid to put this type of graphic on a game console if it was on a handheld system i dont mind its a saga game in disguisei love it the ui is clashing with the overall art style of the game but looks good regardless gameplay looks good but the art style hurts my eyes for some reason id prefer it to run 60 fps and have softer graphics rather than killer graphics with a lot of fps nosedive coughxenobladecough to me a game like octopath looks better at 30fps dont know why but it gives me some nostalgia retro feeling compared to the smoothness of 60fps resolution on the other hand should be 720p1080p mandatory is the game that difficult the demo was ok balanced how long did you actually play it i feel like if you only played a select portion of the game for a couple hours judging the difficulty would be hard to do accurately you have to take into consideration the time it takes to get used to it something you might find hard in a jrpg at the 3 hours mark could feel laughably easy at the 25 hour mark and this is a square enix jrpg its not gonna be short awww man i dont want to buy switch just because of 1 game its great theres an engaging difficult jrpg even for random encounters instead of just spamming attack to get through each fight or only applying some amount of though for bosses the game looks too soft what im excited for this is it good i hope so ive ordered the wayfarer edition for god sake what a hack video there is no new information given and they even go as far as to say elemental weaknesses and the bravedefault system are unique and of course they top it of with completely unsubstantiated praise just to tell the viewer what they want to hear and earn that like love the art direction thought the demo was repetitive and grindy though looking like they made plenty of improvements honestly i think they should call it final fantasy octopath im buying it but seriously its a final fantasy game it would be a good idea as that franchise itself is always changing each game so it would be a natural fit they could use it well looks great hardcore wtf do u mean by soft playing the demo the battle system and menus were quite intuitive especially if youve played turned based rpgs in the past like final fantasy 6 or 7 i was pretty sure there was explanation in the game that told you that you need to break an enemys defense before you can attack them it takes some thinking ahead to execute a proper victory but its not as difficult as this guy is making it out to be anyway loved the demo and definitely planning on getting this think it comes out in july cant even pronounce renaissance correctly this guys a joke hire some better pee pole to present ok u got my attention at 225 wont buy it if its just hard to be hard is it really as mediocre and sub par as it looks i am a jprg nut who dislikes mediocre crap this looks like mediocre crap ummm did you not know that you can turn down the post processing effects so that it doesnt look blurry i played the demo and its really not hard its pretty basic like smt or persona but it has cool tricks and the ability per character is really cool any noticeable improvements from demo uh not worth 60 will wait for a price drop the only game worthy of 60 was breath of the wild and mario and maybe splatoon in my opinion the rest should be sitting at 3040 so its basically gonna be a turnbased dark souls yah because you thought that modern jrpgs are fairly easy only a few would dare to take on those challenging roots this game gives me such a dnd vibe looks good but not worth 60 imo thanks for the video totalbiscuit the gameplay looks fun but i wish that i liked the visuals they are covering up all the lovely pixel art and environments with weird blurring and atmospheric filters that make it look muddy and ugly goty confirmed the best looking 2d style rpg ever and disappointedto what what looks better that it should look like what on earth makes you play it and think soft did you even play any rpg on 3ds it should be better cause its switchits not a x so dont know why your whack expectations are worth saying disappointing im begging for this to have multiplayer the same way they did final fantasy iv the after years on the wii yeah this game looked awesome but i immediately changed my mind when i noticed how soft the game was i thought i could handle a game that runs softly but the soft mechanics obviously had no thought put into them they were much too soft i like my jrpgs course and rough like sandpaper so i can wipe my hardcore gamer ass with it until i bleed ive only played the demo so far and unfortunately id have to rate it soft10 just picked up persona 5 i best finish this game before octopath traveler comes out i cant wait nice i cant wait for this game it looks so awesome im happy you said it will present a challenge looks great of course without intending to be a jerk unless youre a jrpg connoisseur your steep learning curve is just probably normal to the rest of us ive heard a lot of people who dip into rpgs call some of them hard when i myself hated the combat because of how mind numbingly easy it was at least i know it wont be ni no kuni 2 easy i guess reminds me so much of pokmon in terms of adventuring and the music soooo excited for this release bravely default and 2nd are masterpieces and this will be one soon damn does it stutter on every attack it seems to just be me but i hate the art style of this game i played the demo and enjoyed it so i am still looking forward to it but i have really always hated pixel art style is it just me alex maybe sometimes we just want to waffle you ever think of that does anyone know what the story is like after playing the demo i can say i loved what we saw of primroses story so far but olberics seemed very generic im worried about how expansive the stories might be very much i hope but also by how character interactions will work o you pick one main chracter like in the demo how many cutscenes of the other characters own stories do we see yes i love classic jrpg my favourite was all ways dragon quest 5 seems only playable for the more diehard jrpg players looks very nice but the will not be my cup of tea square plz make it hard tired of new gen weak games i grew up on nes silver surfer mega man one pixel jumps i want hardcore lengthy smart game play ni no kuni 2 is a huge fail as its for 1st graders square please dont change this if your reading i like the art style soundtrack is soo good already hope they not messing anything up but this is my most wanted game atm the battle system is extremely reminiscent of bravely default that is for sure this is a game i am looking forward to ive been wanting this since the demo its going to be hard good i like a challenge already on preorder the demo was fantastic and its nice to know that its not going to be riddled with micro transactions like everything else these days my only problem with the demo is that i had to do a lot of grinding and i dont like grinding for hours and hours in a game looks great though kinda worried the switch is gonna become a jrpg machine which is frightening because jrpgs are terrible i knew this one was on the saga hardcore difficulty very hardcore loving this pretty pixels and great colors looks absolutely fantastic reminds me a bit of crimson gem saga which is one of my favorites i love that this guy just assumes the switch should be able to crank 60 fps on this game ive never seen an art style like this and would not presume to know what kind of graphics engines are underneath and what type of gpu power they require ill assume to people who made it know better though he said this game is hardcore and im confused i found the demo to be fairly easy an im not even the hugest jrpg player the only turn based jrpg ive ever finished was persona 4 golden that said i never really got stuck in the ones i didnt finish i simply lost interest and so far octopath has the most enjoyable fighting mechanics to me so the question is is it really hard and i just happen to be actually good at something for the first time in my life or does alex from ninteno life just suck how difficult is it compared to the demo because the demo wasnt crazy hard its a classic style jrpg of course its hard what does soft even mean in gaming its nice to see your allies follow you in the overworld in the full game im sooooo excited for this game the demo was sooooo good fuck yea this gunna be goooo00000 eeeeh still wouldnt pay 60 for this feels like a 40 game to me for anyone interested the game now has an amino community just search for us on the amino app the combat system here looks to be the first steps of evolution that we might have seen had square and the other devs that followed them not decided to do away with turn based combat in favour of the dumbed down crap combat they now produce i understand why they went that route financially you sell more as the average persons not very smart and more simplistic gameplay suits their simplistic minds but for those of us who grew up with turn based jrpgs and wanted to see how they would progress those mechanics and systems we got totally screwed over i hope this game sells well enough and we see a resurgence of other turn based jrpgs in the coming years that experiment more and more with what turn based combat can offer that real time and these weird hybrids cannot weakness isnt really a new mechanic smt has been doing it for years fuck yeah return of the turn based rpg death to all action rpgs this game has been growing interest from me i need to play the demo what does a game looking soft even mean i hope that this game turns out good i can already hear ign saying its too hard so we didnt beat it and people complaining about the difficulty and learning curve lets not forget people whined about xenoblade 2 conbaty system and how tough it was the 3d look and overall graphics reminds me of final fantasy tactics on ps1 played the hell out of that game remember did a lot of things to get cloud years ago maybe i am wrong anyway my switch shopping list is growing dktf mario tennis ace and this love turnbase rpg hope this one has japanese voice track but hows the music and the voice acting of the entire game is it all just as good as in the demo having to think about what attacks to use in regards to enemy weakness is for hardcore rpg players nowadays its so weird to me to treat casual players like they are monkeys who can only mash the auto attack button and consider everything above that too difficult for them rather play god of war or detroit this is a step backwards for gaming what the heck i thought i was subbed well now i am the preview sounds like an 8 im all over this game and sushi strikers i despise turn base anything but i enjoy this so thats def saying something ive been wondering how certain characters would play looks like cyrus is this games version of a black mage fire emblem xenoblade 2 dlc octopath and valkyria chronicles 4 its a good year for rpg fans on the switch i guess this looks ok but this game better not be 60 however knowing nintendo it probably will be cool i really do hope this game is as hard and tactical as can be been really disappointed with how easy jrpgs have become it looks great i cant wait this is my most anticipated switch game im begging this to be good i loved the demo so thats what those embargos were for first shit now everybody hates me there i killed myself looking forward to it please be good this is easily one of the best games of the year even if it does have some flaws i didnt love thanks for watching and liking this video octopath fans please try saga frontier and thank me later one good thing for the pc version is editing config files to turn that blur filter off holy shit your videos volume is high as fuck if i lower my volume anymore it silents it i bought my first switch last monday and bought this game as per your recommendation loving it so far you should specify which final fantasy this isnt better than because id say its much better than all but 3 or 4 of themthose being ff67910 its better and more beautiful than any rpg ti be released in a very long time the last final fantasy which was worth anything was final fantasy 10 but what makes octopath stronger is the in depth gameplay i would say its in no way a flawed ff since ff is flawed in its entirety in recent years to begin with the last good ff i remember was 10 and everything afterwards felt poor octopath is a combination from the first letter of the characters names in term of technologie it may not be superior to the latest ff game but to me i have so much more fun playing octopath traveler than any recent ff games since they made ff games more action base and less tactictal i did not enjoy them as much as in the past not as good as final fantasy hah its final fantasy on different way but it could be said they are in the same class we can expect a sequal i imagine since bravely default got one and nintendo pushes for west release and publishing of these games bdot are way more interesting to me than any ff since ps2except ff14 ive been saying it since bd launched these are the new ffs to me even though it is more like the saga games i hope for the sequel they fix a few if the issues i would also prefer you be able to remove your starter out of your party this was only a problem cuz i wanted to run through with 2 seperate teams goodrogue path action characters but my cyrus had to be in the party until i beat his meh i would prefer either 1 less character since you can only swap out 3 if 4 so 1 character was always left benched most of the time or i would prefer a more focused story but told through 2 different groups start as either good or rogue or whatever idk i think the easiest fix would be able to remove starter from party as my cyrus wad 46 and my alfyn was 16 gear is more than levels but i also i remember a very old extra credits video about jrpg which said that the low technology was one of the things that actually helped telling an engaging story it seems they were right focus fire huh and there are tons of fights in this game that are easy found out you dont need to grind at lower levels kill the cu sith near atlasdam for massive level boost this game was made on unreal engine 4 i just find it quaint how this japanese rpg was made with an engine that traces its origins to an american firstperson shooter i love the art music and while i have enjoyed the combat the excessive grinding being asked of me is killing my funjrpgs have never been my jam and while this one was a gem it will be the genres last chance for me truth is most ff games lack emotion and the characters are clich for about 6070 of the game even some of the best ones this is a masterpiece from the title screen to the end and yes some characters like ophelia or olberic may seem clich but with a twist and you know whats going on with them from the start while leaving space for surprises while ff hides their identity for several chapters oh and if you hate a story just skip it this or i am setsuna wish this would hit steam or playstation i dont understand why people say you dont have to grind much in this game this is practically grinding the game with how crazy strong the bosses are look how much the recommended level jumps in between chapters and youll see what i mean i didnt like the story of the game as the plot wasnt too deep and thats fine but i wanted a lot more interaction between the characters but still a great game pre ordered this and got hollow knight a few days before ive got a lot of hours on the switch to be played xd so far got about 22 hours on each final fantasy play a saga game you fuck the blur effects are there to mimic tilt shift photography not just for the blur well for me the game looks like a lot of snapchatfilter and high light setting on max not to be judgemental cool game but not easy for the eye zelda botw xenoblade 2 and octopath are the best games on switch so far wait theres a sonic adventure esque final chapter yaaaaayyyyy best review of octopath traveler by now another pixellated throwback rpg setsuna was junk lost sphear was shallow and boring and this based off the demo is just a more fleshed out bravely default aka the reason i sold my 3ds people get hard for this retro aping nonsense and i dont get it the combat is different and if it was actually fun rifling through dozens of attacks trying to beat these obnoxiously powered enemies then maybe id like it more but its not fun its just a bigger waste of time on a game whose story lacks significant emotional weight if the combat was good they should have saved some time and put it into a better new game but people wouldnt be clamouring to play it because its cool to be retro and gay to like anything from the last 10 years octopath was the game i was waiting for since the announcement of the switch however this is not final fantasy it may have similarities but it isnt cant wait to finish this game i came here just to read the comments 95 out of 10 still not as good as final fantasy octopath traveler bravely second bravely default final fantasy 4 warriors of light im happy to see this studio keep improving on its battle engine theyve truly reached top tier this has been the best most informative review ive watched surrounding octopath thanks so much for the content there was some spoilers in the footage you showed for those of us who have played some of the game but it wasnt too bad and actually got me stoked on whats to come please keep doing what you do because your very good at it imo my biggest complaint is that none of the party members really have a reason to travel with and help each other there individual stories are good but there is no big story that ties it all together loved the review you just pumped me up even more for this game subbed there are definitely quest spoilers in this video you beat this game at a conventionjesus thats a convention to avoid octopath or rainbow skies oct this game wants to make me play mario paper solid review once again i have been following you for a long time and you are one my most trusted reviewers you have helped inspire me to start a channel of my own thank you i plan to give a shout out about you on my first upload today wow this game looks to be great why only on the nintendo switch and not on ps4 as well do i have to buy a switch really im still rocking my ps vita they took the break system in combat from dissidia final fantasy i would never play my switch out in public good for you and not caring what people think about you its a cool game im playing the merchant right now and its fun as hell looks at final fantasy 15 what do you mean flawed final fantasy octopath is at least better than most of these new games looks like shit to me especially for 60 i was going to try octopath but then i seen it was 65 all these people in the comments saying that octopath is nothing like final fantasy forget that octopath has a job system just like final fantasy 5 and the bravely series also not a spoiler since they showed us in the trailers great vid 3 only flaw i see is its not on the pc well im sure someday it will be in emulatorrom mode i hope the good sales get us an octopath traveler sequel is this a big step above i am setsuna and lost sphear i picked them up during the switch eshop sale a few weeks ago so i feel obligated to play them first but this looks so good man this is going to force my hand and buy a switch just waiting for this gem to go on sale refuse to buy another game for 90 whats with the click bait title oh cool you started with therion just like i did i thought he was a pretty cool character wish this was on vita i grew up playing rpgs loved ff 123 mystic quest chrono trigger etc i dont like when they changed from the pixel graphics to 3d ff 7 was awesome but that was the last rpg i completed start to finish i always preferred the pixel style graphics and this game really brings me back i love it so far 35 hours in and im addicted the combat is amazing every other game is on hold until i finish this its that good i want this style to continue great review btw btw anyone captured a cat youre calling too many games masterpieces imo its a great game but maybe the sequel can improve on the short comings flawed first jrpg i really enjoy talking to the npcs they all have theyre little story to tellmy fun is trying to figure out how to do the side quest niiice work my dude ive never been a huge fan of the genre but i played the demo and loved every sec of it i usually check out your review before i buy but i snagged this one because i was too excited i think your final score is spot on im a photographer though so i really dig the blurry bokeh effect it makes it feel more artsy to me tbh this game bodies most of the newer final fantasy games and to me is up there with ff6 and ff7 you can go into options and turn off the option shadow corners and that removes the blur effects there is never a fight that is easy even if you overlevel judging by your party you left cyrus in the dust you have lv 26 therion which sucks ass at dps great for breaking armor tho and a lv 3 cyrus which is arguably the most powerful character when you get those 300 sp atk staffs and gain the secret magic skills he basically one shots most things except bosses looking at all of these reviewers it seems im the only one who has cyrus as his main cyrus mains where you at gaming literally now a daysyoutube tells you whats goodeveryone its good i guess lol he said the plot makes or break it i am 5 hours in and i skip every scene i love the visuals of the world but the characters somehow oddly seem a little to 8 bit for the rest of the game world the combat is really nice and all but the story being average at best is what kills it for me i shouldnt have to dig in the game for character banter and chemistry it should already be there like it is in most jrpgs im currently doing my 1st playthrough of ff7 and as we go on our adventures i grow closer to my party every step of the way on our journey in this game the characters are just tagging along for no reason it feels like and they dont even acknowledge each other until way later i also dont really like how the stories arent interconnected in some way or another i know a lot of people are going to counter argue that this is a game of 8 stories and not one big plot the likes of weve seen in most jrpgs where you kill god at the end but i wanted that and octopath just doesnt have it with that being said i appreciate what the team has created and the combat is superb but not enough to keep me engrossed when the story isnt all that interwoven like i exp you didnt even mention the music this game has a glorious soundtrack 10 hrs in and already im like this is better then any of the old school final fantasy games this looks so sick but i cant afford spending 60bucks on this c i didnt buy any big switch game since odyssey in october 2017 now i bought mario tennis aces captain toad and octopath in 3 weeks and also hollow knight which might be my favourite indie game on the switch even better than stardew valley and steamworld dig 2 octopath traveler reminds is very similar to final fantasy brave exvius because of the graphics and gameplay without any spoilers are the plot twists and the conclusion to the stories feel rewarding though im contemplating on getting it a really good grounded take on octopath traveler i appreciate your candor and willingness to point out the games flaws is there a way to see enemy health its like a complete guessing game how much longer i have to hit them before they die i dont see a health bar anywhere another fake review coming at us from dreamcastguy they should have done side story on the 3ds good job man im getting the game today that had to be the worst fight you could have shown to show strategy that was a squash match is this a new ip or are there previous ones too much grinding in this game but its a good jrpg golden sunff v are better for me im no math wizard but if there are 24 hours in a day and you played this game friday saturday and sunday that equals 72 hours where did you find the time to sleep eat and edit this video and play this game for 72 hours getting left in the dust by your friends as they march on to 200k subs you wallow in your 100k so lol on you why is everyone gets hype with this overrated android lazy ass game you didnt mention that there are random encounters did you also have you reviewed any saga game like romancing saga 2 which is out in latest gen consoles for download like nswitch some other reviewers are comparing this game to the saga series well im currently playing romancing saga minstrel song and am currently on one of eight quests of the game ironic because this is better than final fantasy the blurbloom looks quite annoying so is there any love for primrose out there i thought okay ill start the game with her and how satisfied i was disposing of that domineering prick of a master cant wait for this to be emulated on pc before some of you get crazy about that statement just know i would gladly purchase this game if nintendo had an app for their games on pc please stop with the click bait titles i like how your channel is targeted towards adults but cant stand the title you use wish they brought golden sun back glad to hear this game is doing so well glad i preordered but i gotta put my backlog on soon too many games three games that this games structure reminds me of metal max returns you can literally end the game from a dialogue choice from the second person you meet in the gamein the 2nd room from the start unlimited saga and romancing saga so they used some ffxiii breaking shield before you can cause damage octopath is a jrpg fan jewel the game reminds of the strawhat pirates from one piece8 people with different goals joining each other to accomplish all there goals together glad to hear you loved it i finally got to start playing it and im really enjoying it so far havent gotten to far yet but hearing your thoughts as a fellow jrpg fanatic makes me look forward to what i can find even more now they just need to make a true chrono trigger sequel i think this graphic style would work for it long time lurker here and this may even be my first comment on youtube ever lol but i wanted to let you know you are getting better better i love how you addressed the plot first before anything as thats the most impt part in any rpg for me you acknowledged accepted the flaws and still gave a real opinion on it 1010 review my appetite for rpgs soured after playing i am setsuna shouldve just called it final fantasy octopath traveler hey dcg i saw you and your boyfriend in downtown dallas last week do you know how many times i walked up saw a 3 success rate with the theif and said im in and got it first try there is an immense satisfaction to gambling with the theif great review ff is also my favorite gaming franchise i just started playing ffxv for the second time since the game has been patched several times since launch since youre also a ff fan do you think i should try ot instead of replaying ffxv i ask because i dont have that much time available to play so whatever i choose ill have to play it for at least 23 months if i get a switch this would be the first game i get for it very stoked to see a great rpg come out in turned based style im loving the game as well bless your soul for not mentioning anything about the characters interacting with each other like every review ive listened to has said thats a big issue for them like why its not path traveler its octopath traveler fine ill buy it still trying to finish ys vii this game is nothing like final fantasy except they are jrpgs its saga frontier live a live seiken densetsu and those stuffs that this game is based on and contributes to but the name final fantasy will draw more people to click the video i guess the first must buy game of 2018 are you crazy did you play god of war love the game never pre ordered a game before but i did with octopath glad i did especially since they sold out super fast not up to the caliber of final fantasy what this game is way better than most of the recent ff games and holds its own with the classics that wolf boss is weak to spears olberics thousand spears move makes the fight alot easier why always make your titles seem negative or controversial makes me want to buy a switch thats one flaw with the blirr not that bad so why that title hey dreamcastguy im kinda interested in the game but i just wanted to know how long a single play through is i was really excited with the 3 hour demobut now theres no main plot driving me forward i know ill beat it but in dragging because the beginning is very very bleh ah the thrill of the fight thats it im buying it sorry but this would be cool in 1996 ive got to say i thought id tire out quite quick with this game grinding etc but im hooked i love it the music graphics 2d and 3d effects and each of the individual stories have me wanting more im 20hours in and only have 4 of the characters chapter 1s so far lots of exploring backtracking and grinding i am in love but does it suck plz do another fortnite live stream game of the year period voice acting is shit in this game they should have voiced every line or none at all it is annoying im not gonna spoil anything proceeds to spoil every fucking chapter 1 boss i am so behind on some games that i chose to wait until i finished them cant wait for it is there any plot reason for all the bosses being so big or is it just copying pre5th gen final fantasy one thing i remember from the demo is that bosses and even normal enemies were really hp spongyuntil you learn how to exploit the boost gauge gonna be a fun game to break assuming they havent patched out some of those exploits havent got it yet but im really looking forward to it that first demo was great this is why exclusives are important now i have a reason to buy a switch perfect combat and fun of ff maybe 10 years ago the ff games were good up until 12 really 15 disappointing me heavily i think smt has really picked up the ff slack and dq need to beat zelda first then ill pick this up i always thought resident evil was your favourite love your videos and great review but i feel this game is just as good as final fantasy if not better i watched like 68 hours on twitch from the begining propably the most boring opening in any video game i played or see in my over 23 years of my gaming experience absolutely useless dialogues that makes kingdom hearts games looks like the last of us in terms of good story serieously wtf characters looks like shit voices dont match at all english dubs i cant take anything seriously in this gamei tried visuals i can make a map within 3 hours that looks better than anything you see in this game with 0 effort the fightinh animation is the basic of the basics except the lightning and some cool skillsspells this is a game for 2018 after zelda this is the seconds best jrpg laughable garbage 410 nay final fantasy is a flawed octopath traveler takes me back to the snes days as a kid very good game im about 1520 hours in and i didnt have to grind once i also skipped most of the starting stories because i played them all in the demo i started with haanit and so far she is my favorite character in 3 days dreamcast u a savage why are you saying flawed final fantasy in title then you give it a 9 i hope bethesda is taking notice theyve forgotten what makes an rpg great great review looks like im picking this up soon need to sink my teeth into another good rpg you cant give it an octo out of ten 810 xd im not a fan of the washed out dull colorsthats about it having a blast so far you should just be bold and give it a 10 great review im loving this game how many hours do you have in im around 20 so far only just over 3 hours in and what ive seen im loving got it for 21 thanks target haha bravely default final fantasy spritual successor octopath travellersaga spritual successor great review i am having so much fun with this game my favorite charactet is tressa you said this isnt up to final fantasy standards but let me tell you i would rather play this than any of the following final fantasy games 1 2 3 5 8 9 12 13 14 15 95 i knew it if u hold the and buttons for 10 seconds at the title screen the sprites will be naked i would chime in and say how great it is but even though i preordered it a month in advance gamestop decided i didnt need it yet thanks gamestop you are slowly becoming the bane of my existence lol im confused as to why you said you dont really need to grind and that youll get enough experience just getting from point a to b even if you focus on just the story of the 4 characters in your party you absolutely need to grind even just to get from chapter 1 to chapter 2 grinding is a key component of the game yet you brushed it off as if it wasnt necessary when keeping your party up to a high level is central to advancing the story thanks for the reviewnow i know i gotta have it great review whoo one of the reviews ive been looking forward to most even though i already bought it im starting as haanit octopath traveler is nothing like final fantasy other than both are jrpgs thats where they end its also the best jrpg ive played in a long while too at this point im not certain where the flaw is since its a pretty solid game 12 hrs into it nice ive been waiting for your review stop it nintendo i cant afford a switch but youre making me want to buy it pretty little game ill never play dreamcastguy for president also first another amazing nintendo exclusive theres another really good place to grind in a cave between cobbleston and rippletide called untouched sanctum its pretty close once you reach the north cobbleston gap screen the enemies are much stronger than average but probably just a step lower than the cave you mentioned in this video theres also a really good staff you can get from a chest here called pole mace with phys atk 76 elem atk 51 crit 23 so theres that too lol i started doing this when i was about average lvl 15 i think though i did steal some items in noblecourt after scrutinizing the guy for better steal chance with cyrus merchant sub and tressa scholar sub therion with cleric sub didnt really have anything better and olberic because i needed to get him to lvl 25 for challenging the dude in grandport to get yet another stealing increase there and boy do they have awesome gear in grandport most important thing is i guess having 2 scholars ready for fast breaking dont know if you know this the danger lv is the lv of the enemies and if you have a hunter and go to east victors hollow trail you can catch an amazing healer which if you use one battle point for the character you can heal your entire team by 2000 health points also if your near lv 20 you can use it 7 times this helped a lot about primroses bewildering dance you failed to warn us that it can also hurt your party with random status ailments and complete sp and bp drainage thanks a lot bro im just gonna go find me some caits i didnt realize you changed your name dude its ornsteinsoulstv from twitch i hope youve been well man gonna give this a go just wanna find caits and grind off them have plenty of stones and stuff could you make a moneygear guide um i dont know if this is good or not since the game came out already but if you go to the forest area where hannit is there is a rare chance you will encounter a cait cat like creature with a bag over its back which has only 4 hp but an absurd amount of evasion if you defeat it or capture it you will gain massive amounts of money and experience this seems very pointless in the full game and especially the demo it does have a powerful midtier boss but the problem is it is almost impossible to capture it 4 chance im about to try this and im starting at lvl 30 trying to lvl up my lvl 19 hannit with apothecary secondary class anybody have a good sub job suggestion for primrose it dependsdepended on your team i grinded in the twin falls because i had cyrus and primrose on my team and those frog foes were vulnerable to ice and dark attacks i let my cyrus learn blizzard early and i could also find the psychic staff elem atk 78 in a purple chest in there which further boosted his attacks it might still work now in the full version because even there you will only be able to stay in the lowerlevel danger areas in the beginning btw in the carrion caves you can encounter very strong foes like the big bird with three little hatchlings those absolutely destroyed me in every encounter at that time are you going to make more guides for this game by chance id really like to see that sort of content with this beinga vast intriguing game i just saw a japanese playthrough reaching level 74 with his team within 3 hours im not sure what this guy did to reach that in that time window but its pretty safe to say that this is not the best location in chapter 1 i really hope he streams this game soon prob one of my favorite rpgs olberic eisenberg beats up everyone a new epic rpg from square enix it would be nice if they made the main characters a good battle sprite during battles i came here hopeful wishing for a sequel to octodad lilithmon vinny is the best art ever you can tell vinny is italian bc of the way he says mario nipples the guy who did the chrono trigger sound track is doing the tracks for this game you can hear the homage so basically this game is if bravely default and ffxiii had a baby only the weebs complain about the va tbh its pretty decent you dont need japanese to make an rpg sound good some of them are trying to put on accents and accents arent easy i cant tell whether all of them are supposed to have accents or not feels like they just do whatever and i appreciate the attempt and some of them sound good but a lot of them are off the japanese one definitely sounds better because no accents for the japanese 13916 great sage jesus shows up and stops primrose love how vinny flips his lid about a slightly mature script in a nintendo game yet the same day the announced doom and wolfenstein for the switch 736 who me the voice acting isnt bad at all l dont understand also the music is fucking fantastic l love it the vo work is so incredibly amazingly unnecessary why cant game companies just make a fucking game and not get carried away jerking off with some aspect that kills the whole thing this would be an instant classic if they didnt shit on literally everything they have going with the cheap vos it looks great the music is great but then we have olbric plastering some overthetop bullshit over bitesized dialog that could just be read by the player to use their imagination you know kind of like the classic rpgs theyre trying to revive fuck me every square character be like why i do the bad thing reminds me of saga frontier except its not shit i liked primroses story a lot more even tho i know its also a generic story setup it just felt like we were going to see more of a personality unveil as time goes on and a possibility of a good mystery that pre fight dialogue with her master got so repetitive and dragged on too long i know as a writer you can come up with a lot of cool sentences but trying to stitch them all together doesnt equal good dialogue sometimes you have to leave out parts that are technically good for the sake of being briefto the point jrpgs are guilty of this i dunno if its merely japanese writing styles seeming weird in english but translators should fix that when localizing games i feel like a pixelart based game full voice acting doesnt mix well maybe if they had character portraits similar to fire emblem it would seem less weird to people long game or not i still wish hed play xenoblade chronicles best jrpg story ive seen in a game my favorite story in a game ever actually characters are so fleshed out it feels so natural voice acting is great 4657 dont forget this jabroni has an english degree is it me or do these look like ragnarok online sprites i think the voice acting is great yeah its cheesy but that is clearly the style they are going for and it fits the dialogue style too some are saying that facial expressions are lacking but thats not what i find off about it my gripe is that every single character even the bad guys just look adorable because of their size proportions and big eyes hearing a cute little sprite character trying to grunt in a deep manly voice just doesnt match expectations trying to judge the age of characters that arent straight up kids also becomes difficult when the only indicators are usually hair color and facial hair i couldnt tell from olberics sprite if hes 18 or 50 but the lack of facial features wrinkles scars makes me lean towards him being really young which goes for every character expecting someone to sound young and then their voice doesnt match that at all can be a little jarring still its a minor thing the va is still excellent despite this why tf is this story so fucking generic vinny at 15 speed at 5855 is incredible to say the least vinny doesnt know the characters meet up with each other he just doesnt know hd 2d its like they didnt know blazblue existed voice acting is fine abit low tho also you expected a generic british voiceactor but it was me olberic it was gooooood you know the moment you hide a meh with a positive word it will be transparent to everyone never thought id hear voice acting where the voice actors overact more than vinny except for in botw which was worse but at least didnt have so much bloom that you could use it to fry an egg 10623 h a g r i d c h e c k i t o u t this makes me want a switch even more expected a little bit more of great ill grab my stuff but this game is pretty neat 5626 a series of spoopy incidents was my favorite book series as a kid oh god after hearing vinny butcher analogous i cant even hear the correct pronunciation in my brain i havent played a good jrpg of this type in a while if this is received well it may be enough on top of mario zelda etc to have me buy a switch it looks like a cross between secret of mana and old school final fantasy holy shit olberics va is dio love when games make you experience 15 minutes of riveting storytelling before actual gameplay begins i think with the voice clashing itd be better if they had character portraits something to show for other than little chibi sprites i am ready i have some terrible news vin has bloodthirst random little girl hes destroying the whole town the biggest problem with va in general is that it almost never sounds natural you would never hear these kinds of inflections or intonations irl these common strange speaking patterns are traditions carried by drama and theater it hasnt aged well this is for the switch fuck me first time in at while im interested in an rpg and its a goddamn switch exclusive after the shitshow that was the wii u which had no games i cared for except for smash bros i refuse to buy the switch oh well my loss i guess why do i keep expecting to hear the hero character end every sentenceinteraction with for the alliance holy shit i wasnt ready for yusufa even when we all saw it coming the game looks promising i had to watch the movie next to two giggling little shit children try getting engrossed into the horror film with annoying laughter piercing your left ear in the one scene where the bullies fall down the hill chasing the fat kid all i could fucking hear is hehehehehhahaehehheheheeheheeeee breaks the fucking mood stop bringing your children to rated r films honestly its weird that so many viewers loved this game but had lots of negative things to say about xenoblade xenoblade has 10x more depth and unique mechanics in comparison maybe just nostalgia square enix exclusive on a nintendo console what year is this again oo i think the voice acting is pretty alright but olberic being voiced by patrick seitz the english voice for dio and scorpion from mortal kombat won me over this game is boring i feel like there will only be so many times i can hear phrases like my blade is unbending before violently throwing my switch at a wall i played the demo and looks amazing im looking forward for this game my blade is unbending11111 what it was a clown movie i n d e e d which romancing saga game is this wots that folk round ere got a problem wit th voice acting i dunno bout that th lads doin the voices sound awright to me doubt a japanese man coulda done a betta accent huhuhuh show us ye minge project octopus shitty vas turn up the music more so i can stop hearing them at least thats good thank the gods its not prevalent through the whole game so vinny can spice things up but no the totally not fft sprites are great in their dioramas totally not jarring lets not get into the generic fantasy writing but hey at least theres 8 stories worth of it still cliche as fuck tho also can the gameplay be any fucking slower please so we can all agree youre suitably angry now could someone please tell me where vineyard is and how to find notifications when movies start im getting lunar and working designs levels of voice acting as in thats good where are the octopi i feel like it needs to zoom in during the cutscenes and battles the characters are so small on screen as for the voice acting like whatever but fake british accents always annoy me either dont try unless you can actually do it properly qv philips frequent slips into american pronunciation or hire an actual british person i kind of like the visual style but it makes it look like an unusually polished indie game sir burg twas a good fight villager cannot interact already dead mayhaps i should learn how to swing a sword anyone wants to come to my house and help me train i thought i was hearing artanis while hearing this game the voice actor for oberic is patrick seitz why does this game look like a minecraft texture pack screenshot so many comments about vas overall the experience is rather enjoyable regardless glad square and nintendo but this out as a demo made me more willing to give it a chance and try i was level 11 when i fought him looks pretty neat though the way the environments look like 3dd environments of snes games gives me a weird feeling and im not sure if i like the way the sprites look in it the boost mechanic strongly reminds me of bravely default what we get here from primroses story gives me some heavy som2 vibes and big yes for livealive its so good square enix always surprises me with their amazing music va from sprites is really antiimmersion for me this game has promise tho this looks like one hell of an rpg but since its just the demo theres no telling how good its really gonna be but the potential is through the roof this game is trying so hard to lool pretty by like slapping on 4 filters at time they should have an option to turning some of them off like vignette ewww that dub sucks the point of this demo is so they can improve it everyone who has a critical comment better send it to the developer this is like a lovechild of bravely default and live la evil i absolutely love it all id like to see more of this game once it releases honestly 3 i much prefer this vinny to the dark brooding trying to be deep vinny when he plays games like observer and soma if i wanted to think about existential shit id read a book not watch a memelord whos supposed to be making dumb pizza jokes i think if the characters had a character portrait when they speak it wouldnt feel so stale something like kid icarus uprising or fire emblem idk punch everyone edit whats up with the comments the chat on other streams were loving this game and youtube comments were also good for this but this comment section is interesting the va looked like standard jrpg fair all it is are like voiced replies like ive seen for years yo man i kinda hate this 3d stuff i feel like if it had no voice over or at least if it was less stilted and also just had it be standard 16bit graphics this would be significantly more popular old man is best party member i want a ringabel man i really dont know much about voice acting call me tasteless but i really dont know what makes a good voice actor and what makes a bad one fat bastard walks in at that particular moment in that particular scene he decides to retell the entire story of primeroses current situation as a dancer up until now that is some heavy handed exposition oh wow 3d dot game heroes hd remix 25d looks astonishing i think i realized whats so off about the voice acting it really needs a detailed character portrait a la fire emblem or persona hearing voices just from the sprites makes it a little weird the random battles make me a little sad i prefer the chrono triggerearthbound way but everything else has me completely on board can everyone just please shut the fuck up about this voice act drama seriously enough is fucking enough just appreciate the gameplay oh jeeze watching vinny flail his arms about during that bandit fight has got me retching its like an unimpressive golden sun 10627 nobody becomes a swole boss like gaston oh wow this here comment section is literally the only place where ive encountered negativity about this amazing demo the voice acting is great idk what insanely high standards you weebs are on about just turn down the music volume and truly give the voices a listen this is one of the best demos ive ever seen the vas were all great aside from the derisive dancers the music was phenomenal and it looks amazing japanese va is better because i cant understand the language to judge the delivery of lines weebs go home everyones always gotta complain about the voice acting when in this case it isnt even that bad nobody can even tell if the japanese takes were any good but because it just sounds different theyll instantly leap to it because they cant hear any problems it itself might have it always irks me especially since vas in english are all becoming far better than they ever were years ago why do people think that the voice acting is bad am i crazy the va seems pretty great to me i dont really have a problem with any of it the artstyle is really charming imo its like a high res version of old ps1 rpgs that combined sprite characters and 3d environments but ill agree the voice acting is off characters probably need mouth animations or speech busts like persona used personally i really loved this game the visuals are beautiful and the music is great voice acting was decent save for philip the combat was also fun going into boost mode and dealing like 2000 damage in one hit is damn fun that voice acting for philip ruptured my eardrums ive played the demo and enjoyed everything about it i love the artstyle the music i find the va alright te story of both characters intriqued me primroses part was surprisingly dark my only problem was that you cannot skip any of the main dialogue sequences which makes loosing a boss fight feel extra punishing as you have to keymash through the dialogues for a solid minute before fighting again overall i cant wait for the full game and see the other 6 characters and also im curious on how long each story arc will be do yourself a favour vin change the voice acting to japanese or just turn it off this game is honestly amazing ive already sunk at least 4 hours into and ill probably still have another 4 to go beautiful art style to go along with the really good music that weve heard thus far and the small sample stories that weve gotten in the demo seem to be pretty well put together also surprising how much postgame content there is in this demo all in all ive really enjoyed the demo and really look forward to the full release the music playing when vinny sneaks out of the tavern reminds me of that from elfen lied the only real issue with this game as of right now are the english vas other than that looks like an amazing game as expected of the producers of bravely default olberic seems to have the same va as kana from pillars of eternity basically the same voice and all outside of really minor differences anyway this game doesnt seem to understand the concept of show dont tell i gotta say that that opening is way too talky and exposition heavy and unnatural even without the vo its a bit much the voice acting just exasberates it really shouldve pulled it out through convos with other npcs than have obericky here tell his life story to a wall imo voice acted sprites just dont work for me something about it makes it hard for me to take the story seriously its a good thing they give you an option to turn most of the voices off 14 minutes before game starts dayme i really love the sprites and art style imagine a chrono game like this it feels like a low budget indie rpg that tried to take on a style that massively lowers the cost and production time then again what do you expect from a game thats so far is called project octopath traveler the name is one of the defining points of a game to be this late in development and still having a name that honestly made me think this was some weird japanese game relating to octopuses when i first heard of it also they better have improved upon the bravely default battle system if theyre going to put it in another game oh and the voice over sounds like some shoddy indie rpg as well saying that if the dubs were rushed for the demo and none of the dubs will be found in the final release then i guess its not too bad turn off game voice sound octopus translator we of australia need no sleep seriously though this game looked fucking awesome specially live and i really hope the full thing is as amazing as the demo this could be the next big jrpg in fact it almost definitely will be i successfully buttered up vinny primrose is 100 a t h o t only one disc for the soundtrack thought it would be four disc definitely buying this amazing i got one for 80 so its not all bad i guess lol im genuinely torn so i need some help so im going out of state for an anime and in general strapped for cash is the 40 bucks plus shipping worth it i mean the pop up book was nice but i assumed it was 8 separate pages since i cant display it feels odd well is 20 in germany55game 75total but without the cd i try not to buy but i dont know how long i can stand if the book was like an art book or journal and ccame with a figure then hell yea why couldnt the uk have got the same edition we didnt even get the cd and our map was printed on paper meaning it has awful fold creases whichever side you choose to display i want this so fricken bad i am no joke about to keep selling my possessions until i have enough money to by this update i have enough money butt its sold out lol i got it for 80 guys think about it if the coin was made with real gold then it cost 400 or more if the pop up book was bound in real leather and have gold or silver leaf on the page edges then it would be worth 100 or more if the cd had the whole sound track then it will cost 20 and i live in europe i really hate it when there is no due respect for the product when openning just openning and unwrapping stuff is not an unboxing handle it with care very cool i was assuming the book would be its own item instead of being glued to the case i wanted to have it on display has anyone been able to display it some kind of way or been able to completely take the book out carefully hmm 100 dollars for something that will be lost in some boxes within the next 2 years nah better not its really nice but im happy with just the game haha im saving for my ps4 pro spiderman and tomb raider games and next month we happy few id say its worth maybe 70 at most where or when was this 100 the lowest ive seen is 170usd or 240cad if this was cheaper like 8000 i would buy it but 10000 is a bit too pricey imo 150 who says popup books are for little kids that book is really cool the popup book looks pretty dope but its too expensive for my taste though would have bought it separately if it was possible it is really interesting that when camera zoom in that book you do feel like you are watching ingame footage awesome pop up book game seems fine and the collectors edition looks nice but its very expensive for what it is lets go has a extra controller for the same price range with dark souls eventually coming smash 5 pokemon wolfenstein 2 and captain toad coming 100 is stretching especially when dark soulscaptain toad is 100 with another game full price lol 100 for that is asking a lot its maybe worth 20 more the base game i bought mine at gamestop which comes with an extra set of stickers of all the sprites and characters for the game and them a card deck of each of the characters in holofolil its amazing dont worry no microtransaction or something like that get my fuckin money dude not worth it since the only extra worth having is the soundtrack maybe if there was an art book too would like to play this but the graphics makes my eyes hurt after a few mins i think im gonna get this game when it goes out on sale fore 40 or 30 just because i dont normally play rpgs like this dont worry theres no microtransations its ashame that has to be a disclaimer in this day and age sooooo its saga frontier i miss the days when games already had the map in the box what a bunch of crap for such a nice game thanks for this exelent unboxing regards what a bunch of expensive paper and trash not the game tho thanks for the unboxing as a collector i always really care about the game case itself and from what i understand it has a different back on this edition can you guys show that more in future unboxings reminds me of ff on nes im not a big jrpg fan because i find them confusing but im considering getting this is it beginner friendly indie going to the next level love it the popup book looks like the attractive one to get took an incredible amount of effort yet looks great really sad that the european version doesnt have the cd why isnt ign box a thing anymore a bit too overpriced the only thing i would want is the soundtrack but its not sold separately i got an octopath traveler ad on this video xdd in canada its 14622 damn i would love the coin and the cloth and the cd as well the music is amazing a great collectors edition just too expensive but not overpriced why the hell would you start the video with showing everything when its an unboxing 100 for what i need these companies to get fuckin real and stop with all the bullshit making it seem like we need this to be a true fan yet are unwilling to give you something substantial for your money if youre willing to shell out more than what the game is worth too be honest the way the industry has been going im fuckin surprised a game even comes in this 100 package thats an easy extra 20 can love the game but i dont think this stuff is really worth an extra 40 with the game it is really really cool not sure if its worth a hundred dollars though i didnt even know it was out yet in australia we get everything except for the soundtrack cd it seems we often dont get the music maybe because of idiotic rights management issues but other than that it is indeed a gorgeous special edition for an amazing game cool special edition i love how excited ryan is for this game and i share his excitement for the game got my copy had to cancel the 100 dollar one tho not worth it cyrus is best choice was there a pre order bonus for the warfare edition its nice but i dont think its really worth 100 i wanted to buy it but im poor d i wish the pop up book was separate from the box instead being stuck together ill stick with a normal copy wow the map is actually cloth in europe we just get nice paper sooo the game is a dissapoinment huh why is the european version not including the cd hmmm i hope i get the edition it looks pretty dope got it today beautiful collector item first man i wish i could buy this game but my backlog is crazy bad everyone is related to the gate of finis wait is graham the redeye i got absolutely wrecked on part one of the final boss and my characters are like 15 20 levels higher than yours you are literally a genius i aint doing this boss cause i cant do it so i watched the ending via your video not going to lie i was a bit disappointed with how it all ends can you leave and save after you beat each boss wait what was the point of making therion a cleric and ophelia a hunter in the galdera fight how does ur light rune do so much dmg my party is like 2030 levels higher than ur party and light rune only does around 5000 dmg when the shield is broken and only 10002000 dmg when its not urs does like 30000 when it is and 15000 when its not 4759 darn you had your party all reduced to 1 hp talk about a miracle xd and one freshly served cheese flavoured galdera for table 9 my only wish for this game is to have three more of these types of missions so sad when everything is completed for those that dont know what the spurring ribbon does it basically wards of all random encounters neat isnt it why do i get serious bravely default vibes from the final boss feels mildly similar to ouroboros better than a snare eh was yet another great strategy to utterly destroy phase 2 personaaaa oh wait that not it well when i see shadow how could i not summon thee this is so interesting to me so the travelers treat each others stories as long haul side quests but their tales are largely their own hence why they do not count other travelers presence in story cutscenes the fact that the final boss is completely optional yet tied to a recurring npc says a lot about the npc namely that kit could have been your 9th traveler 1 that poor tiger in the beginning wrecked alphass face and had no idea what it was in for with the travelers 2 eight bosses that must be refought in the final level didnt realize this was a dang mega man game 3 does the party realize they keep arranging themselves so as to spell out octopath its a little uncanny 4 oh man oh man how is omega gonna wreck this boss 20 levels lower than my barelywonbytheskinofmyteeth attempt holy crap thats how i did not realize divination and fortitude could be of such use and that rune spam on the first form 5 this is the best goddamn final boss theme ive heard in literally decades 6 fantastic playthrough omega and i look forward to your next one final boss i will destroy the world me that cute final boss met omega the guy who has kills uncountable scores of gods demons and weirdos that has god complex or a screwbrain loose mind you it often in the most hilarious way and you my ugly looking fleshish blob are going to be another tally on his oversize record uh kefka is that you cyrus defending olberic seems off especially when olberics a former knight xd that had to be the mostbadass thing i have seen in an rpg in quiet a while the story telling is amazing thanks for taking us on this long journey omega looking forward to the next play through and as always good shit and keep up the good work hopefully you can get some rest now whoa dude this final boss reminds me of kefkas final forms in ff6 hmmmm what the fuck just happened i find it impressive that they actually managed to weave multiple parts from previous stories into this final boss well done kind of offputting for this to only be a side quest but a fitting end to this game that was one ballsy strat for the second phase there paid off super well though im disappointed there was no voice acting at all for the final boss segment and none of the characters made any individual comments at least the fight itself was great damn you made this look trivial nearly 30 levels lower than i was and you did it twice as fast then again it looked like you used patience and second serving and whatnot dont know why but i absolutely refused to use them took me 4 tries and nearly 30 minutes not counting the boss rush each time i guess i just wanted it to feel longer and more gratifying when i did beat it finally well done omega now i feel like a total scrub its kinda unfortunate though you missed like all of the bosss cool phases because you beat it so quickly though i understand little about girls love bad boys or internet romance but holy shit what kind of sick women would marry that u cannot go back if u pass this door merchant walk in and be likeeh i get paid for this y not and thus omegas journey came to an end after a fantastic voyage through a wonderful story i really was hyped for octopath and i wasnt disappointed at all thanks for your playthrough omega d thanks for the video omega always great content that final boss music is one of my fav pieces of music ever does this still work ok thx undertow cave near rippletide gives good money each fire stone you pass in the cave gives you more money just go in and go out and you easily can make 650 in 12 seconds how do you even get there i just started playing a few hours ago how did you get 3000000 takes almost 13 h with your method this method is terrible i tested all the popular tressa methods on youtube and this is by far the worst all of the loading screen time builds up so fast the marsalim catacombs method is twice as fast to get the 38 mil shown in youre thumbnail even by youre time of 22 secs would take over half a day considering this is the first video that pops up for quick easy money is dangerous for the octopath community great video thank you for sharing this find so just by spotting the money you automatically pic it up i am confused thx so much for this technique amazing video fun fact in the undertow cave farm spot the amount that tressa picks up scales directly with how far in you go ive found that the furthest you can safely go around level 1215 is to the save point to the south which will net you 22002500 gold pieces per entrance without having to walk around outside again after 3 who is the unfortunate soul that keeps dropping all this money damn i need money to buy stuff in preparation of the viper boss but ive already activated alfyns chapter 1 so i cant leave are there any areas in clearbrook that are really good to farm doesnt this affect with your level tressa why even have a job when you can just do a jog every morning and find random money everywhere holy crap wow this is awesome thanks for sharing great job man very helpful i can finally get money for all the equipment i need edit why thank you for the heart and also for the video how do you lower encounter rate i liked the vid for the thumbnail cool videoi will try it we have been blessed with an upload from daddy yep golden axe at my first try i was prepared for an hour of reset but lucky me tried 60 times now and havent gotten it yet zzz zzz not amused that you make it sound so easy you do realise 3 is a stupidly low chance right i also have got this axe on my third try maybe that 3 is just a stunt the actual possibility of getting it is much bigger ngl i legit was trying to steal the golden axe at the same time as you were in the video and then i heard the steal sound go off what a coincidence xd 3 minutes for both axes it seems my rng luck is turning around can i start with therion first and still get the axe thanks for beginning your uniquestyle of videos to this game nn li i watched and studied a lot of your xenoblade chronicles 2 videos and had my fingers crossed this would be your next endeavor man its almost as if you play the same games i do at the same time which is great i found an enemy that apparently gives a lot of xp i didnt see the name of it but i did encounter one i got it on my first try i couldnt believe my luck i need to be level 25 before i can challenge her wtf did they patch it hey nn li i got a question about fe warriors how do you give a characters weapon its full power ive seen you with all your op weapons and im here with the base power please tell me and if you answer thanks could you just buy this with tressa ive been lurking on your channel for quite awhile your xenoblade and few vids are super great this video though is what finally got me to sub there is a actual game called golden axe you can save after the battle against the young girl in front of the house so you dont have to do the fight everytime you reset burn all the full bursts someones been playing plenty of xenoblade recently lol how far are you in the game now if only there was actually an offensive character that used this for powerful skills this is a pretty cool find but i fail to see an actual practical use yes xbc2 and hyrule warriors and now octopath traveler dude youre so helpful o man i did the dancer first after successfully stealing just start alfyns chapter 1 it resets your reputation to when you first entered the village so it doesnt soft lock you when you have to use your path interactions please do more octopath traveler videos so glad to see an octopath traveler video from you please keep making them oh god the guides of octopath have started can you save after the fight so you do not have to always repeat the fight now this is a game im really looking forward for you to cover with your amazing guides i actually stole both the argent and golden axe consecutively when i went there couldnt stop smiling for the next few days thanks for clarifying the location i didnt realize you could get it so early so i just remembered the name clearbrook i thought it was a chapter 2 item at the earliest xd still waiting for amazon to ship me this game been waiting impatiently and meanwhile looking forward to more octopath videos from you d hey is there a way to switch you leader in octopath also will you make more octopath traveler videos i love this game or you can just play the game normally wow i never realized how exploitable steal is that is if i ever want to go that route i discovered this methode by myself when i was in therions town and want to stole the bracelet which gives 80 extra mana mysticalenchantress sucks it makes me really sad that they didnt do the relay in octo order you know ophilia cyrus tressa etc lol jello mvp lost for the people i love the combat system in this game the plot was just alright this is great but i feel like you lose a lot of the personality by not having a facecam fing loved this gamethanks guys tell me this will be free please its been 3 months and i havent heard about this or the sequel that was confirmed but anyways fuck this mobile game and of course ill wait for the sequel to be released on console its been confirmed this game of course will have inapp purchases a candyland method of saying lootboxes and microtransactions for a single player mobile rpg while i loved the first this second coming is getting a fat dick in the ass from me the combat system isweirdo heres a new amazing switch game i hope you guys enjoy it ha heres a prequel on mobile what the actual fuck just why ugh nice divide the fan base and make one half feel like theyll never have the complete octopath experience minds well make the next main game strictly for xbox while your at it and dont bother making a physical release either no one ever cared about those great way to treat fans by feeding them crap for god fucking sake square enix take my money already but please put theses masterpieces on switch nnot some garbage phone aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa im more excited because of what this means for the sequel all eight travelers in a fight count me in just take my money already this is gonna run only on 1999 phones dont know japanese still love it still going to play it mobile release grab couldve easily made this as switch dlc but they dont want your measly onetime payment of 20 they want those sneaky microtransactions cant believe this cancer has infiltrated the basically classic jrpg domain gasp 8 against 1 sounds fair lol if the first letter of the eight protagonists names dont spell out traveler it aint worth getting i already see the criticism of the mobile game which in my opinion is maybe not the best choice but i can see where they stand on it this is mainly because from different news articles and a tweet from the official octopath traveler twitter the sequel is already in production for the switch but is taking more time than expected they are only releasing the mobile game to keep us busy while waiting for the sequel and to invest in some possible backstories and explanation that wasnt touched on in the main game besides a few months after the original game released they were already talking about a sequel for it so please be patient and at least give the mobile game a try i honestly love octopath and wish to see more of it and this made me quite happy seeing more of it come to us comment below by me are links to the tweet and a couple of news articles i was so hyped for this until it became clear it was that awful final fantasy mobile game how could they do this to you octopath already w you were so young and full of potential this is bullshit nobody asked for a mobile prequel square enix just stop atlus from software ssha with iap im not sure how i feel about having all 8 party members at once it kind of takes away from some of the strategic planning im sure itll be great though just as long as there arent microtransactions switch release when 3 those characters look really cool and maybe if its a prequel they could be those powerful old people you find in the starting towns also i found an npc who was reading a book about eight travelers in ot and it couldnt possibly have been the party members by the way am i the only one here to actually be interested in ot nobody ever mentions it and the fandom lacks so many things like theories fan art good memes etc and the comment sections are just full of overused battle quotes its almost creepy mobile why sorry but this prequel for ios and android pales in comparison to the original nintendo switch exclusive title not worth the purchase on your mobile device see this is where you start to fail please bring this to switch as well i will buy it full price i do not game on mobile the controls suck please release on both mobile and switch or dlc whatever i will buy it why on smartphone bring this sequel to the switch as well please its interesting that the random encounters seem to be gone not sure how i feel about that given this games aesthetic super excited to give it a try though nice no micro trans please sell it ill pay 20 bucks for it as long as i dont gave to buy crap on it well they just mess with the soundtracks what square should of done is gave this prequel to those who bought the game as a expansion but no they have to be greedy with this game and turn it to a mobile game the prequel pls no micro trans and ill be happy now this is a brilliant idea why do they have so many on a team mobilewtf did my best to avoid any story spoilers so far im really liking the game cant wait to see what the later parts of the game have in store for me i didnt find it grindy but im 60hours in and still am just half way through it still waiting on bravely third news a lot of reviewers are like theres no grind to this game im like where did you find the difficulty setting art style its just the same as suikoden 2 which would be cool to get a remasted version i never had to grind because i love to explore the game and go places i ought not to go to get really powerful equipment as long as you dont run away from battles within your party level there should never be a point where you are grinding imo best jrp in 20 years hannit is easily my favorite character at the moment but that is also because i havent played with all 8 just yet so i dont know if i will like another more i chose to split my game up into 2 groups of 4 so i am playing my first playthrough with haanit ophillia olberic and tressa it has been a blast so far lastly i dunno about this whole mage theory olberic starts out pretty powerful i also dont mind grinding at all i actually expect to serious grind in all jrpgs recently the bravely games come to serious mind i have never cared for turn based games other than pokemon on gameboy but this game draws me in for some reason and i want to play it asap its a bit grindy i bought a switch for this and botw i am not disappointed brokeboy2018 if you just play the game you dont have to grind really exploring with no guides doing chapters and just following your curiosity will easily net you more than enough xp and jp 50 hours in and i havent had to grind once im hesitating on buying this game for 60 its not because of anything relating to the game itself but rather my budget i made a few impulse buys that threw me off i finally decided to play the prologue demo today to see what it was all about ophelias story is probably not the most exciting to start off with but i liked it and i kinda want to own this game now i can even see that the game is worth full price why havent i bought it yet well i am wondering if this game is worth pushing my backlog away for now or if this game is fine being on the waiting list would this be an impulse buy that makes my wallet feel good again im 6ish hours in so far just doing olberics part atm visually phenomenal gameplay good story is next teer generic bull just for the record if you know what youre doing you shouldnt need to grind it should help a lot if you dont use fast travel i dont think the games difficulty was exactly balanced with fast travel in mind and also try to avoid equipping the evasive maneuvers support skill from the scholar job while you are in an area that is levelappropriate for your team octopath was not made by the same team that made bravely default that game was developed by silicon studios octopath was made by acquire why are so many youtubers spreading that misinformation you re handsome awesome video i am loving this game im over 45 hours into it but only have about 3 of the chapter 2 finishalso im only grinding to the recommendation levels for the chapters i dont know if there is a retro game style category for video game awards but this is probably my game of the year so far im curious what people mean when they say theyre grinding in this game to me grinding means you are just content strictly for the gain of character progression i havent had to do that once with octopath traveler ive gotten plenty of levels by simply playing through most of the chapters and exploring the random side dungeon ok you dont need to farm or grind in this game i have finished the 8 main stories i have done most of the optional dungeons and not even once i had to stop to farm experience i didnt feel underpowered against any boss encounter you can do areas that are 5 above your level without much problems and you can even do areas that are 10 above your level if you are skilled and go prepared in the main story if you try to kill an optional boss that its 10 levels above you he will provably destroy you optional bosses in lvl 50 dungeons or more are 5 times stronger than story bosses of lvl 45 im hopeful that with how successful this game is looking that they might be considering making a sequel or second game to this series one that doesnt give us all new characters or single character stories but a large compelling story that allows for true interaction between the characters i dont know if it would work at all but id be interested to see what they could do ive been having lots of fun with this game i honestly have not disliked grinding to get to a stronger level because i find the battle system super fun its strategic but at the same time deceptively simple which can be nice for newcomers and interesting for experienced players to learn better and faster strategies to get stronger and better also haanit is best character the only thing i dont like its that you are doing only exploring for treasure and that the 8 character dont really talk to each other you know i mean it would have been awesome that the more adventure you do the more cut scene you get and the 8 of them do a bon you know what i mean idk like cyrus wants to learn stuff everyday it would be funny that there would be a scene with him and the dancer i forgot her name and he ask stuff about girls and girls parts and ofc she would react differently or call him a pervert you know what i mean anyways this game its look and unique for a 2018 game grinding is kinda easy just get to a spot where danger is 57 levels higher than you and try to win one battle specially if you have one character with lower level then watch that xp bar at the end fly you almost gain 23 levels for weaker members and 1 level for better ones also yes cyrrus is powerful but you dont need to save mana because it regens everytime you level up i always spend like crazy and i never had to use mana curing items unless im in a boss fight the fact that you can go to harder level danger places is cool im surprised you didnt mention that i really wanted to like this game but i hate hate the visual filtering going on in the game it looks like someone smeared crisco on the screen i wish they had an option to turn off that filter and just have crisp pixel graphics it just looks like horrible tv smoothing filter gone into overdrive when have you needed to grind done maybe 6 chapter 1s and 3 chapter 2s and have never needed to stop to grind if anything im typically over leveled thats why i started skipping chapter 1s so i could enjoy more challenge ive been sick since it came out so i havent been able to play it yet octopath traveler is a great game dont let the graphics fool you it has an incredible and interesting story and the gameplay is addictive also the music is some of the best ive ever heard from a video game in a long while if you are still uncertain just try out the demo on the eshop how anyone can pay this shit and cal it gaming boring take turns slapping each other utter trash turn based bore fest next titles enneapath traveler and decapath traveler it is a fun game the graphics are cool it is like a beautiful mix of old school and new school the character storylines are interesting and each person has their own strengths and weaknesses there is one big thing i dislike about this game im not super far into the game but i got a good idea how the rest of the game will play out there is no interactions between the characters you meet one they say i need your help and thats it when u reach the area of that persons storyline they do everything by themselves except the battles there is no group of strangers becoming great friends during a great journey from the outside looking in it looks like you got 8 different ways to play the game but really you can experience all 8 stories in one play through still a good game i just think it would be better if the stories all blended together and there was indepth interactions between all the heros maybe i just suck and dont know what im doing but the way it gates you by forced grinding is getting old anytime i want to continue with someone elses character im always way underleveled and have to grind so right now im doing olberlics chapter 2 and he is severely under leveled because i didnt have him in my party doing the other stuff knowing that as soon as i finish his chapter and will have to repeat the same grinding process with primrose for her chapter 2 makes me lose interest grew on up jrpgs but this is ruining the experience for me at 30 years old now stvttersysmastersysrlghstsysheresysforssvresysrevlewedtechedusabesbl5cshsysofsthlshvhsbltcshsys feels like what you need is just a merchant or items and dancer sub to be able to boost cyrus in one turn and finish the battle in that same turn i really want to buy a switch just for this game the only thing i dont like is the lighting is maybe too exaggerated i think nintendo has the best hand held technology at this moment i hope other game companies follow game provided by nintendo do you feel comfortable giving bad reviews i only took 4 characters to make the exact team i wanted and finished their stories never had to grind been feeling pretty low this week ive found spawnwave to be huge source of comfort love your work john i would get this if it wasnt so expensive i dont understand why this cost the same as final fantasy it looks like a hd ps1 game this game is one of my favorites in a long time a true return to the jrpg it fills me with a lot of nostalgia when i play it some of the fighting does get a little tedious since the move diversity is not that vast sadly grinding in this game exploring you dont have to grind for one second before you are done with all 8 characters stories 100 you need to grind for end game stuff obviously but for the early parts of the game you should just explore i did nothing but explored side dungeons and got every chest in every zone and i never needed to grind and was always well over the recommended level for the quests i did you could technically call it grinding but thats the way i always play through games explore explore explore also why souls games are probably my favorite franchise of all time since there are no better games to explore in if this game was higher resolution than 720p the pixels would look jagged and over pixelated on a 4k tv in fact if you set the tv output resolution on the switch system settings to 480p all retro games look smoother and as they did on older monitors new games and system menus look blah but when you see the retro game you are playing it will be a trip back in time octopath is what i want its jrgp that i like and prefer a return to roots i want more jrpgs like this not ff15 i havent gotten too far into octopath traveler but so far this is my favorite game of the year dont have ps4 so havent played god of war im only like 5 hours in but i am totally addicted to this game already i definitely suggest that anyone who is even a tad bit interested in jrpgs to pick this game up and give it a try the graphics story voice acting gameplay and music are all phenomenal in this game the music is a real stand out to me my cyrus is lvl 37 now and he hits for 7k times 2 with the spells for 22 if he is max boosted and hitting a stunned enemie my team comp for anyone looking for ideas haanit with warrior cyrus with cleric without ophilia but anything i need with ophilia ex apothecary for the snake charmer dude primrose with merchant cyrus getting breaking 20000with alephan against a boss needs bp and whoever fourth u need for their story and i like to put them on either thief or dancer for debuffing the enemy or buffing cyrus and freeing up turns for primrose also i say when u grind go for somewhere pretty hard for the most efficiency and dont be afraid to use items i just popped it in last night after playing the 3 hour demo i really love it have never been a jrpg guy but the art style and the fact that this is a switch exclusive sold me on it the switch has a way of just making genres you wouldnt necessarily play accessible i like what digital foundry does but this really does confirm that their analysis effects how some people view games even if they believe the game looks good initially once df releases an analysis it could change their opinion which i just done understand proves some gamers are more wrapped up in numbers than what the gameplay and their own eyes tell them i thought the game was 900p playing on my 4k tv but even after finding out it is indeed 720p it still holds up well i do wonder if nintendo releases the successor to the switch if developers would go back and update games such as this one for a full resolution bump as well as framerate dont think a game like this would really look that much better but maybe cleaner in any case having fun i do think im underleveled so i may have to grind which is really my least favorite thing to do in jrpgs also the quest system is pretty bad details are vague and reminds me much of the divinity games so i picked 4 characters and dont plan on using the other 4 until a 2nd playthrough unless you need to 20 hours and done 3 chapter 2s i just got some sub classes and it is crazy how indepth this game gets dont see me beating this game anytime soon brooooo this game is fkn shit so overhyped and overrated the skill that moves the cap to 99999 also works with magic damage with my fully buffed and boosted level 70 cyrus im able to deal around 250000 damage in one turn i just kinda passively grind so i dont notice it too much just taking the time to explore everything and find all the chests in an area while fighting every random encounter will help is alf op look at his hp and hes the healer and does decent damage im having loads o fun with hands of fate 2 seeing this gameplay makes the game look a lot more fun the demo really turned me off though the story wasnt interesting imo and i went to the first boss area and was fighting the random enemies in that area and they were all taking like 20 turns it was just super slow and not fun at all it might be because i started with cyrus in the demo but i was really excited for this game and then i played both demos and kinda hated it and i do enjoy jrpgs even ones with less then stellar gameplay at the start as long as the story pulls me in like xenoblade chronicles 2 this one didnt have a gripping story though imo love this game but honestly its a love letter to my childhood i would give it a 100 out of 10 im only 3 hours in but i love it already and i know that ill be sinking quite a few hours into this game rip my python studies thanks again for the collectors amazon recommendation awesome first thoughts vid jonsw the game is tremendous i am playing as the thief really enjoying his story so far just met up with the chick with her dog so ill her story next overall the game is dope wheres the nearest tavern im in the chapters 2 for the story it is fun and even tho it looks like a supps1 rpg its really pretty in some ways reminds me of xenogears on ps1 it is just really nice playing this game it in a way is refreshing no save the world plot just 8 people doing there own thing it s really cool this is a great game the only thing i have to say i wish was a bit different is that i would like more interaction with the 8 characters however the reason i believe this does not happen is because there is the option of never picking up all if them so i guess it would be hard to make that kind of option when you as a maker would have no idea the order they would be picked or even picked at all so with that rant i believe all in all this maybe one of the most memorable rpgs in the past 8 years or so i havent really had to grind at all i just walked to every location and battled every enemy i found was pretty much always at or above recommended level 16 hours in and grinding like hell and this game is amazing not sure if this is clear from this video but you can also build up boost points by doing a regular attack you dont have to skip turns so for instance you can do a straightforward attack with the warrior for three turns break the enemys shield and then boost up your fourth attack to hit harder now if only konami will bring out a new suikoden i dont understand why people are complaining about this game being grindy a little tip for this kind of people 1 dont play with guide complete every single quest in ur town that you have visited before visiting the next of course not all can be completed right away because of level or exploration restriction ull get lost and keep going here and there like a madman 2 keep rotating your characters people tend to whine because the character that theyre supposed to do story on is so underleveled ure basically playing with 3 characters and 1 deadweight 3 always always go all out in battles u wont die from lack of supplies if ure low on sp too often to keep your party from wiping always fast travel back to town rest up go to ur destination again eventually ull keep up it wont feel like a grind if u keep fighting for ur dear life in every single combat so i just got my first paycheck in a while due to medical issues im going thru the first thing i buy after bills octopath traveler i start olberins story get about 35 minutes into it and my power goes out due to a bad storm skip to this morning mote than 13 hours later and were still out of power all my groceries i just bought and put in the fridge spoiled and im in a shitty apt that i doubt will do anything about it after everything is said and done talk about some bad luck and this is just a normal friday in my world sigh trying to stay positive but its hard i just wanted to chill out and play a good game hoping they get our electric back on soon bastards cheers you all im gonna pick this up tomorrow im so excited i want some of the original final fantasys on switch so bad ive never got too far in the original one but i love the gameplay and battles so much and i want it on switch so i can bury hella hours into it it wasnt until i was 13 hours in that i noticed that the enemy names colour show how near to death they are and somehow i didnt notice that there is a side quest tracker until i complained to my friend at 19 hours in how there isnt one and she informed me that actuallythere is and its not even a little bit hidden im 20 hours in and loving it so far my only big complaint is that haanit is basically unplayable due to her terrible dialogue style im playing with japanese voices and even just reading the text is a chore i skipped most of her chapter 1 and took her immediately out of my team i have no plans to ever put her back in so for me it will be heptapath traveller if theyed have put octopath on 3ds i wud have got it lol well at least i still got fire emblem awakening to play was it just the demo or do the party members ever talk to each other other than those awkward onesided youll help me recruitment conversations playing it now and it is and awesome game they did a really great job on it the demo bored me to death i dont like it visually if it was sprites ok if it was low poly 3d like bravely second or ff ds remakes great but this golden aura 3d models with 2d style is boring and ulgy to me the gameplay is fun but the story is a slog i like grinding to its not a negative i think its the preaentation oh no grinding in an rpg thats almost unfounded and rare and should be a point to complain about that game looks amazing i think its about time to pickup a switch can you play with just one character through the whole game so you can play eight different times i love it its a game i didnt know i wanted when it was announced i wasnt even interested but that three hour demo had me hooked and desperate to get the full game what you havent talked about it before the audacity of people on metacritic lollololol poor graphics graphics aint impressive terrible graphics too many fights lmaoo bye felicia i feel sooo bad that you got a free game you wanted then had to play it point and case title of video is misleading i already beat it it was alright nothing special im still waiting for mine sunday baby great review or partial review this game is dope def worth 60 story and polish are for the most part on point i dont dig the font in the game but i can get over that i saw other reviews saying that you dont need to grind in this game and im 10 hours in and never had to grind and i feel actually overleved so i dont know maybe it depends on the person if you go into dungeons underleved you can gain level pretty quickly at most its an ok game goty worthy i wouldnt say yes but its decent enough until i watched this video i didnt even think once about resolution or frame rates been enjoying this game too much to worry about petty fake gamer nonsense therion is my favorite cyrus is by far the best character to start with imosince your starting character will always be in your party cyrus is very useful in many ways early on in the game and he scales very well into the later of the game because of his magic skills normally im not really into turned based rpgs besides pokemon and digimon i more of an action rpg person stuff like kingdom hearts and nier automata but honestly i might pick this up i think if anyone is judging the visuals from a first glance if you were to show them the lighting and effects that theyve managed to apply to these sprites they would change their tune i have been blown away on many occasions by the lightingshadowseffects and i think they are some of the best i have seen this year its really visually striking beyond what a screenshot can show someone and i think theyve accomplished something pretty incredible here with the visuals the fact that ive stopped and just took in scenery for a few minutes or keep stopping to snap screenshots just like i would in an impressive 3d world says it all the gameplay isnt my cup of tea but i watch the videos because its just so damn pretty what do you mean youve been talking about opt for weeks lmao im about 10 hours into the game so far im enjoying the stories i agree with the text thing i have a similar idea for doom where they make the crosshair a native resolution as i believe that it is the most noticeable lowres detail thanks for posting this im 5 hrs in this is my first jrpg much to learn if youre not into grinding youre just a whinny entitled millennial who gets angry if everything isnt given to them in other words youre trash ugh i want this game so bad playing it slow but i love it omg i cant put this game down love this game im about 12 hours in and i love it definitely worth the 60 bucks how many octopath videos do we gotta endure through aint noone playing this shit i preordered the game but i did not start playing day 1 i was finishing up ys 8 when octopath came out currently i am around 78 hours in spent some time grinding when i got primrose right now i am about to get therion and haanit is my last character to recruit i get the characters along octopath order one thing i am not used to in this game especially just finished ys 8 is that i will always find the save point happy that i can warp to it then realize that i am not playing ys 8 not a complaint i just need to retrain my brain to forget what i learned in ys 8 i absolutely love this game its the old school jrpg ive been waiting for for a very long time i love the visuals i love the voice acting i love the characters and i find myself whistling the battle themes when im not playing it this is the best 60 ive spent in a long time you need to get on those second job classes especially being in the 30s already lol loven itnot even all charas in but a grand rpgor is it jrpg does anyone know where to efficiently find essences in this game i was out of essence of plum when using concoct too much so far i loooove this game and the only thing is a real shame is not to have the characters interacting or becoming a part in the narrative of each otheror at least appearing in the listen to the story short as acknowledging the help given by the party random battles and grinding use to grind me a bit but now i tend to realize that it gives more longevity for a game especially this masterpiece and this is just the first one can only imagine how big the second one with be with a third to make it a trilogy we need more games like octopath travelers im enjoying the game so far i just got cyrus in my party now i need the cleric skipping out on octopath but it does looks pretty cool with the retro style this game is stupid and garbage its 2018 if i wanted to play old games i would pull out my nes lazily made game 1025 thats a lie everybodys got wind i call boost x3 super saiyan and boost x4 super saiyan blue lol im slowly but surely not liking you as much as i when i first subscribe to you we talk way too much and you drag things way too long im about 18hrs in and im absolutely in love with this game from the art style to the gameplay and storylinevoice acting best 60 i spent on a jrpg in my opinion i love the challenges and how its a complete game thats easily 80hrs the way i have my team set up olberic hunter can have a 50 chance to attack twice and i believe he should have the strongest physical stat out of everyone else it also allows him to use bows and axes haanit warrior she seems more physical based and having her as warrior could boost her attack power even more cyrus cleric can use healing light along with fire ice and lightning plus this could boost his sp count allowing him to use more spells should also have high elemental attack so this should work well ophilia apothecary basically allows her to be the best healer in the game already has high amount of sp and being able to heal and remove ailments this was a no brainer tressa theif being a merchant should already give some sweet bonuses to the thief job plus using swords and daggers along with bows and spears should be a great coverage to her arsenal therion dancer being able to buff and debuff would make him a strong asset since he has pretty good evasion to play this game without needing to grind step 1 find all characters step 2 do all chapter 1s and find all basic class shrines while your at it and run dual classes i recommend running cryus and assign a scholar to another step 3 do all chapter 2 step 4 do all chapter 3 now you are as far as i have gotten and im pushing level 50 on my main party without grinding i run merchantscholar scholarmerchant huntresswarrior insert story required character here possibly subclassed as cleric love this game im about 12 hours in and loving it so far dude i thumbed up this before watching it lol i dont like jrpgs but the hype makes me want to octocrap is so boring please end this videos theres a lot of grinding imo i tried to do cyrus chap 2 when my highest level was 21 therion ended up going to primrose chap 2 also its quite difficult in leveling team while keeping balance of the 4 not being used why cant the benched 4 chars get exp but not as much as the 4 ones were using the grinding isnt that bad cause you can just go through some optional caves the game is pretty good but i m not slurping it off like the masses are am i the only one who think primrose is the best ive never been into rpgs but this has me interested might be picking it up to see if i can get into these games you do not have to grind not sure why people keep saying you do i am 32 hours in and never had to grind bravely defaults strategy twist in the combat was horrible i did not like it at all the combat was lackluster and an ultra grind 99 of the time the combat is my favorite part of a jrpg i actually liked the overworld gameplay more in bravely this looks a lot better goty gtfoh nobody will be playing this a year from now lol its like you said art style trumps realistically looking graphics always this game will be talked about years maybe decades from now for the doubters check final fantasy 4 and 6 romancing saga 3 chrono trigger among others im almost 27 hours in picked haanit as my main just finished her chapter 2 about 20 minutes ago im really digging it 10 outta 10 i love this game but the only issue i have with this game is that encounter rate is too damn high and yes i know about the reduce encounter rate skill that cyrus has they could have tweeked this feature a bit differently though also haanit is best waifu of the game and i dont care what anyone says p thank you for your disclaimer in the beginning however i suggest you expand on it state if anyone had any input to your video be it something they edited or added made you say something or if it was sponsored something like this would suffice this product was provided by nintendo and this review is my own that no one providers name had any input in to making this review or this product was sponsored by nintendo and nintendo did editreview this review video to make sure what they wanted in the video was correct something more detailed like that to give us a full understanding i love your content keep it up i want to watch you succeed ive got this sitting waiting to be played but i was stupid and started xenoblade chronicles 2 a couple weeks ago and cant pull away 500 its worth mentioning that you need max boost to use a divine skill 1420 personally i like to belive that its the ff9 mentality there is tagline in ff9 that says you dont need a reason to help someone and the thing is that there are many people not only in jrpgs but probably media in general that kinda embody that mentality granted i still havent played the game so i cant really say for sure its just something i like to believe i have to talk about octopath traveler jesus christ again love how most of the kids in the game have candy you can steal from them i got a good laugh form that does the story switch up if u choose a certain character before another i found cyrus quite weak in the demohmm just collected my 8th homie love the game make sure you dont grind too much the bosses at level are a very appropriate challenge i am really loving this game and had a lot of fun so far the art style is cool the music is awesome and the battle and job system gives you many different possibilities to approach the different bosses the only thing that does bother me a bit i did not finish the game so maybe this will change later is that the different story lines dont feel connected at all like you said the characters dont really have a good motivation to help each other it feels more like you are playing 8 different games which take place in the same world and give you access to the same party this game truly is something especial can you build a gaming pc screen and keyboard included into a suitcasebriefcase and if all possible make it battery powered im currently 3 characters and about 6 hours in and i havent seen any reason to grind my characters have been well over the recommended level although bosses are still challenging maybe i explore more than the average player but all im doing is collecting the treasure chests in each story dungeon i hope this doesnt change as i get farther in but truth is i dont mind grinder either if it comes to it because i enjoy experimenting with battle strategies i started with haanit and well been playing it since qnd i guess i got stuck easy in how to actually progress i thought that the baby should have been awarded custody but the landlord on the other hand had proof of his drug test so that was not eligible to hold grounds for the coupon to save on those air filters big boss in octopath traveler confirmed im just walking through the game finishing up the episode 3s of every character and have to say i didnt had the feeling i have to grind at all sure i fight every encounter but never had any problems as long as i avoid the areas that are clearly for higher level im about 21 hrs in and i still one more character to get im taking my sweet time loving this game i havent bought this game yet but im a little worried the stories arent that good i feel accomplished for spending 34 hours to grind up 10 or so levels just so i can wipe out a boss in under 3 minutes winwin please explain the word grinding when related to a video game the positive news coming from octopath traveler is tempting me to update my 300 firmware switch my view of this game is its a bit like dungeons and dragons mixed with a traditional jrpg the characters dont really have the most compelling reason to be together the stories are pretty separate and you can interact with the world largely how youd like to all kinds like dnd if u are buying octopath bc ur graphics obsessed then its not for u this gam is beautiful to me and is by far my favorite game of this year seems like a wonderful game cant wait to buy it next year along with pokemon how on earth are you only 15 hours in and you already have everyone level 30 lol im 30 hours in and i havent even grinded in any area yet i just circled the map for the first time and im going for my first ch 2 mission my highest level character is olberic on 26 and my main tressa is 24 maybe im just going slow but i havent even died yet my main squad is tressa olberic prim and ophelia got notification for this video being live as im watrching it thanks youtube i may get this game soon though i have a couple of questions about this game 1 is this a long game 2 whats the difficulty like if youre a novice in this genre gotta love when people hate a game so much they watch a video just to complain i just played the demo and hopefully getting the full game soon they should show enemies health thats the only downside of the game at least for me thats 30 hour to beat and 50 hours for 100 and that was with taking my time grinding out enemies for long periods of time to capture summon mobs you dont need great game but that 4050 hour estimate with the 100 hour completionist claim is way off i bought nintendo switch to play games from the 80s what an absolute power house of a console cyrus is the best magicians are gods tressa is my favorite im just putting this out there for whoever thinks this way if you think octopath isnt worth the price because of its artstyle and ignore the large amount of content dont sit here and try to justify pokemon lets go pikachus 60 price tag because thats when you start to become a hypocrite am i the only one wondering who the fuck evan is has this channel had a hidden ghost writerreviewer all long is this guy just the face gahh i can only imagine what this evan guy looks like if thats the case i really to grind for money i need better equipment olberic is the man therion who i have to wait till its cheaper im at a point where cyrus and ophilia basically have infinite sp i love this game why is there a picture of a vagina on 0923 i really like this game i played both demos and i had mixed feelings i decided after watching a few videos to pick it up i wanted a physical copy of course have had it for 2 days and i really love it what a great game for the switch i feel like a lot of people really dont know much about this game ive talked to at least 10 people with switches and none have heard of it i love this so much reminds me a lot of old school rpgs that i truly love with a twist of the new graphics hd the water at the way the backgrounds are the wages sprouts up an hd truly truly amazing rpg anyone think this game will come to pc in a year i have finished all the characters main quests in about 65 hours but i think i do have at least 15 to 20 more to finish up all the quests and do the secret dungeons depending on how hard they actually get the game was pretty amazing edit i played the demo therion is the best character and i dont care what anyone says p 30 hours for me 8 characters lvl 30 party 4 secondary jobs unlocked solid jrpg game the story is good the battle is fluid and quick and those visuals are awesome looking forward for your full review i understand everyone has their taste in games and no judgement here but this looks so boring im about 20 hours in and i havent felt the need to grind maybe it comes up later but all my characters are up to lvl and im currently going around completing all chapter 2 maybe because i explore the mini caves areas around the first towns that im not running into grinding problems i think the biggest issue by far of this game is that it has 8 characters like it somehow tries to sell this as a unique selling point but it is not almost every old school jrpg has about that many characters but octopath does it in such a way that it is more detrimental than anything first the stories are all separated there is zero interaction between the party members you really cannot count that tiny bit of travel banter which is kind of awkward because this way every time you enter a story relevant place the cutscenes dont even have the other characters in it and that even to the point where it contradicts the story like why would therion the thief travel together with these 7 strangers in the first place when his entire first chapter is about how he refuses to team up because he lost his partner in the past and this 8 character structure causes other problems as well first the grind one party has 4 characters in it and you got 8 sooo two parties that you ca do you have any suggestions on how to make grinding more tolerable if youve played bravely default the same team has a knack on connecting the name of the game onto its plot i havent had time to enjoy octopath my job is making us work 7 days a week like right now i wanna play it so bad but i dont have the energy to lol rpgost of the year if not for red dead 2 it would be goty its my goty so far timestamps 000 i have to talk about octopath traveler 1602 end i was really surprised its only 720p docked its beautiful but doesnt see particularly demanding time stamps 0000 octopath traveler ive been wanting to talk about octopath traveller for a while now youve done nothing but talk about octopath traveller for weeks good to see your loving it now go away so i can get back to playing more octopath lol in all honesty seeing octopath traveler gets me even more excited to see and buy the upcoming rpgs on the switch like fire emblem and pokmon i absolutely love this game 238 we finally get i like this game jesus where was the timestamp guy when we really need him the switch rolling all right for people playing octopath heres how i blow your mind without spoiling the game ophelia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion haanit i feel so dumb for not realizing this sooner the first name init spellout game 000 start 400 despacito 2 announcement 600 octopath traveler 1603 end octopath traveler sucks i burnt my copy and sent it to hell for people playing octopath heres how i blow your mind without spoiling the game ophelia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion haanit i feel so dumb for not realizing this sooner 4 chapters per character 32 chapters total took me 15hours to complete all 8 chapter 1s whilst grinding and exploring i am definitely getting my moneys worth with this game the art style is simply wonderful love the blend of 16 bit and hd lightingeffects im about around 15 hours too ive been falling asleep at some points of the story but dont mind the combat i like this game haaint is best girl sorry i dont make the rules just picked up octopath traveler today very much reminds me of ff6 i was very jealous last week when everyone else got it and i was stuck watching people talk about playing it can this comment get 0 likes hopefully not first can you guys just stfu so annoying i want to say rest in peace to the baleful blade holy frik everything about this is like nostalgia 20 new and improved i am so effing in one thing im not a fan of in this game is the way the shops work there are other examples i could pull but final fantasy is what people are most familiar with so ill stick with that but thinking back to final fantasys vii and ix the shops have a lot of character to them remember how neat the shops at wall market were or the weapon shop in lindblum with the buster sword on the wall and the suit of armor that steiner likes yet zidane thinks is a piece of junk or the shop in treno with fightable monsters underneath it they assist in adding depth to the world turning a shop into a menu sucks i remember how excited i was to visit a shop in ffviii when it first came out and how let down i was when i realized there werent any i can understand not including a physical shop because of memoryhardware limitations which may have been the case with ffviii but that shouldnt be allowed to be an excuse in 2017 theyve modeled all of these other interiors yet they cant eve what it reminds me suikoden 2 breath of fire 2 3 in the end of the demo logo its written in latin ad spem respondere translated is in risposta alla speranza or an answer of hope my translate may be wrong im not good with latin or even english but ad spem mean hope and respondere mean answer watching these four in particular play this together was an absolute delight would be thrilled to watch them get together and play any more of it in the future this game reminds me of the good old soleil rpg days on snes with its art style and ff tactics combat downloaded the demo today and its rly fun demo considered me buying this game when its out btw when its out is this the most beautiful game ever not sure but it is a strong candidate at least liked that they stopped right where they fought the demo would end when there was more to her part are there any games like this on the vita ps3 or ps4 nothing says a retro nintendo exclusive like prostitution i demand i ff6 remake in this style the voice acting in this game is so out of place its great seeing other peoples first experience with this game d also the old dude with the clutch baleful blade xd this reminds me of ff6 and ff tactics sprites the sprites hold this game back if they use much better and modern 2d sprites too compliment the beatiful backrounds this is the thing i hate about ff16 player sprites are bad damn that was so good looks like i need to buy a switch put your phones away loved the demo would be better if they paid attention to the conversations instead of speaking over the top of themotherwise a good video this game makes me want to own a switch totally original final fantasy feel to this loving it 4758 oh no she didnt 5359 helgenish dying like a fat evil nes link clone this game is so great i want to see what happens with prim next also balefull blade wow that looks amazing normally i dont go for these types of turn based rpgs but everything about this is incredibly enticing now if only i had a switch wow this was really intriguing seriously considering getting a switch for this little gem you can switch the voices to japanese love it lovely looking game great it will be on pc and probably mobiles too still considering to buy a switch for this you can continue playing as primrose wish they would have hit the button you should have used the elemental increase then 3 boost points and then midnight waltz for the strongest attack you forgot to buy some more healing grapes xd yusufa focus on the sad scene dont joke around tt rimrose should have said you are my friend sounds so mean with were might not cross cool its like he didnt listen what a beautiful little gem this is it just makes me feel al warm inside and im not even playing the game bravely default already had such a good style and soundtrack an now this if only they could do a xenogears remake in this style or ff6 and chrono trigger it would suit these games perfectly so much character the perspective is so awesome then there are these light effect and that music what it is with square and music magically awesome wauw what a game they just sent the email for the survey go write your feedback and lets make this game superb hard to watch you know once the boss is broken you can boost a skill for massive dmg i completely share jones anticipation for animal crossing on switch the old guy i think will have a part to play in the story he may even know prim is and was looking for her oh man love the creepy guy with the wine theres a growing feeling that i must have this game now wow this looks freaking great i expected it to be good it looks way better than i expected really looking forward to seeing the other character streamed as i dont have a switch yet once this game has been out for a couple years i hope we can see ff6 remade in this same style olberic definitely has the most interesting demo story and stages i actually teared up at the end cause the va thw writing everything was so perfectly well done i really do hope that they did not just give us the best characters in the game mastapeece this is some godtier rpg prefuckingordered better than that casual pos dudebro ff15 fuck that trash more like this please se switch is killing it with octopath and xc2 the go to system for rpgs cant wait for this god the switch is getting so many good games well after watching the ni no kuni 2 demo httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcpnpv0xyl3k this project octopath traveler definitely is not a console seller game for me instead of buying the switch for this game i better save my money to get ni no kuni 2 next year even level5 wants to try something fresh by incorporating real time strategy like gameplay into jrpg in 2017 and they are able to maintain chibi characters design using current technology instead of imitating the outdated 16bit art style could you guys play the second part of the demo with olberic because i really enjoyed seeing you guys play this my hype for this went from 0 to 100 after playing it not usually a jrpg fan finally somebody that actually beat her demo good commentary too you can continue to the next town with primorose and add the other character to your party you gus ffwdd through helgenishs slapping of primrose the impact really solidly seats you on her side when it happens unexpectedly in a nintendo game reminds me of romancing saga would not be surprised if its announced as one whoa that soundtrack is intense 3 this playthrough was so hype i havent had this much fun with a jrpg in a long time the master sounds like bens rp of the warlock in tabletop escapades the demo boss animation of this game 5000 vs ff7 first boss animation httpsyoutubedoqnrhunmk4 one may sugarcoat a low budget animation as style retro feel original hd 2d or whatever i am not impressed by that loop animated gif style boss in this game at all the demo was actually not done after this you can still venture forth with your compagnion im exploring cobbleston with baleful blade villager atm d i dont get the whole animal crossing thing but whatever if you really think a mediocre game series will do better than nintendos best than go ahead u can do the boost before they r broken so u can break someones armor in one go if u boost im really torn on the sharp tonal shift this game has its visuals are very classic snes era final fantasy but its dialogue is very adult this is not a kids game and thats not a bad thing but the style just does not match the mature subject matter for me very misleading and its a wasted opportunity because the writing does seem decent and its a shame a younger audience isnt allowed to experience this because everything else is such classic ff that i feel we are sorely missing now in gaming final fantasy 6 and 7 had dark moments but it was used tastefully and never written in a way that suggested too much reality a lot of kids wouldnt even know what was going during the raunchy cross dressing scenes in ff7 but in this game they are literally bringing up sex masturbation oral sex and slave work that just seems really weird with the cute pixelated graphics for an independent game this would be just considered edgey but coming from square enix it just doesnt feel li heres an interesting idea full playthrough of this game but each of the allies plays a different character the only thing that bugs me is that the heroes dont get full detailed sprites like the enemies in battle lol but everyrhingt else is pretty dope i need this game in my life kamoshida feel there about the boss this game feel so good this is what games is about dude i was totally thinking of dont you love me baby doing the opening scene 740 i guess its time for me to make the switch how can you like animal crossing let alone that much in 2017 square enix produce a full price game on a machine much more powerful than the first playstation but the animation in the game is not even on a par with final fantasy 7 in 1997 a low budget game and hoping for getting a decent profit from high margin even a low end mobile machine can handle a little more complex animation like httpsyoutubefnunfliku6q a f2p mobile game from a russian developer kefir square enix should respect the power of the switch and put more investment on the animation department of this game well maybe they dont expect to sell many copies of this game so they depend on making profit from high margin just an opinion i want this on ps4 in this game the high degree of freedom of progress and the atmosphere reminds of the saga series from square httpsmyoutubecomwatchvwhim1sjwpdm also about graphic we can easily imagine that producer tomoya asano liked rpg in snes era the only thing i liked was the combat and the music bad va predictable bland story which so far seems very unoriginal im definitely not digging the art style omg eight characters eight paths octopath travelers mind blown looks pretty neat but im surprised that its only coming to the switch and not 3ds this game bleeds classic xbox is so pathetic right now its not even funny im super glad that stuff like this is becoming a style beyond dismissive claims of it being retro i think pixels create a more cohesive and lifelike world than ultra aliased hd sprites do the world isnt full of sharp edges things blend into one another i feel like pixels communicate that much more strongly this is my current party cyrus therion tressa oberyn team taco therion hunter alfyn merchant cyrus dancer olberic apothecary hi im trying to look for a very simple team to use i have unlocked all the sub classes and looking to beat everyones story not good with a lot of mechanics like bp or sp but i enjoy classic holy trinity like warriorsmage and clerics any advice thank you my team is cyrus therion ophilia and olberic cyrus for elemental damage put as a cleric for them light magic and heals therion provides a decent stream of sp to party and makes it so bosses dont one shot me hes also a merchant which gives him bp sharing and wind magic ophilia who is the healer and dancer to provide all the buffs and dark magic and finally olberic who is the tank and physical attacker when needed he is also a hunter to round out all the weapons with this party i can get cyrus with peacock alephan and alferic pull out the magic the enemy is weak against and they die also olberics divine skill is pretty good too r8 my team olberic hunter primrose scholar tressa apothecary therion cleric i use cyrus ophelia haanit and primrose ophelia heals really well plus shes got light magic cyrus has powerful elemental attacks haanit has just the most op abilities so thats an obvious one and primroses buffs and dark magic basically just boost all of this my favourite parties are olberic warmaster hunter cyrus sorcerer apocathery tressa rune lord warrior ophilia star seer dancer or primrose star seer cleric alyfn runelord scholar therion sorcerer merchant haanit war master warrior i have cyrus as starseer so he has every element and is supportive tressa as runelord transferrune and sidestep are op together as damage dealer olberic as warmaster or ophilia as sorcerer sehs an elementar charakter and makes a lot of damage and healing and one of the other characters alfyn as cleric therion as apothecary haanit as dancer primrose as thief i cant choose between tressa and cyrus i have yet to complete the game but i made a physical oriented team and just kinda cheesed most of the chapters by having warriorhunter hunterwarrior thiefmerchant healerthief its honestly not great but it had a fun mix of moves like the steal sp share sp then spam aoe moves but yeah its not great but if you just wanna run in and clobber everyone i switch back and fourth between all of them my build is tressa starter cyrus second character haanit third character alfyn fourth character im still early game but i hope to make tressa a theif cyrus a healer alfyn a tank and haanit as a second tank if thats an option my favourite party is cyrus tressa ophilia and therion i have cyrus and tressa almost everywhere as cyrus is my main and tressa money i picked up this game recently and while i dont dedicate myself to one static team i try to keep everybody evenly leveled and progressed i do always keep apothecary olberic and cleric cyrus with me olberic is simply an unstoppable beast at this point sporting a 10 level lead over everybody else double the amount of hp the second highest damage output of any character and the ability to almost fully heal all other characters with first aid meanwhile cyrus has the amazing elemental coverage that olberic lacks and the highest damage output of all of my characters while also being able to scout out all enemy weaknesses and easily heal as well as ophilia not to mention that holy light and luminescence seem to be scaling very well with elemental damage my main team is sorcerer cyrus runelord tressa warmaster therion and cleric alfyn my second team is apothecary obleric starseer primrose merchant haanit and scholar ophilia this was the team i used to defeat galdera where my characters were all around level 70 my main team might be the worst thing out there my main team is therion ophilia cyrus and tressa i dont particularly like tressa but she has more levels than primrose sadly therion scholar ophilia thief cyrus dancer tressa cleric i found out that a lot of early enemies are pretty much weak to ice so and i havent found the merchant nor apothecary jobs yet im only 20 hrs in and my team might change d thats funny i havent seen my combination yet i have therion cleric primrosestarseer haanitwarmaster and cyrussorcerer tressa in every party point blank i have ophelia cyrus and olberic always and then the fourth is either the last path ability or whoevers story chapter my team is this therion haanit cyrus ophelia i started the game as therion then my team is therion olbreric and cyrus i change the last one up based on what story i need to complete i like therioncleric for fast healing and sp stealing cyrusdancer for magic attack buffing and dark magic addition olbericthief for hp stealing the last i switch here and there and dont really use as a hard spot in my team como so i started out as therion and tbh i wasted a lot of the nuts too early currently i have it at therion with hunter as a fast physical attacker cyrus w sorcerer as fast elemental attacker olberec w apothecary or sometimes hunter as physical tank tanking a lot of physical damage and dealing a lot of physical damage and ophilia on dancer or scholar as the support and elemental tank debating replacing therion with haanit and have her on warrior going back to the nuts i probably shouldve waited to use my attack nuts on haanit instead of therion because even if she is at the same level as him his attack stat would be higher also yes i have finished therions story so i can take him out of my party now i think my team will be when i am done with therions story so i can change him out alfyn because i think he is the best healer and is also decent in battle olberic because his damage output is insane cyrus because he is an amazing elemental attacker haanit because her ability to summon and catch monsters is like pokemon and i love pokemon ima heavy hitter olberic haanit alfyn and therion 545 wheres that dungeon i never found this one olberichaanitcyrusprimrose laughs in daughter of the dark god cyrus ophilia olberic and tressa any good should i drop olberic for someone like alfyn he seems better suited for my mostly magic team as a tank with high damage who can debuff and remove debuffs also concort is amazing my main party is tressa thief olberic hunter ophilia dancer cyrus apothecary im only at around level 40 for everyone right now and this set up seems to work the best my main team is haanit the physical attacker cyrus the elemental attacker olberic the tank and ophelia the support im not far in but im rocking primrose scholar hannit warrior tressa thief ophelia dancer no apothecary presence but well see just found your channel and really enjoying your content style consider me subbed just got the game last week wish i got it sooner at chapter 3 now with all characters tressa scholar olberic either thief or apothecary cyrus cleric or dancer and the 4th is whomever chapter im doing subbed for a healer class assuming its not alfyn because theyre underleveled and wont be dealing damage anyways but man alfyns concoct action is pretty op as in breaking elemental weaknesses on bosses cant wait to indulge on the advanced classes probably sometime after chapter 3 pretty much any party can work in the game each character shines in their own way my main team is therion ophelia cyrus and prim um the dancer this is my party for the first 4 stories and then im running the others for the next 4 olberic therion ophilia primrose i picked this one so that i would have a pretty balanced party for both sets of story lines i wouldve liked to know this when i started the game therion dancer tressa runeblade ophilia starseer primrose sorc olberic ophilia cyrus primrose 3 i saw a nice looking team online and i am going to try it in my first run therion alvyn tressa and orphilia therion and tressa produce items for alvyn and orphilia is some kind of secondary healer with dd in this team combination unfortunately the perfect team doesnt help for the spoilers secret final battle where you are forced to use all 8 travelers in 2 teams well my is girly team hannit theressa primose ophilia in this line up thressa and primrose is very important if both combine give buff to either hannit it deliver devasting damage thressa bp support primrose either physical or elemental support ophlia mix attacker and support and hannit pure offensive power house pregame team 1 elemental dps 1 physical dps 2 utility supports with healing and sp recovery therion is my shining star cleric his high evasion compensates for his lack of defense and elemental defense and doesnt necessarily mean he is squishy just patch up with high elemental defense for the elemental damage you cant avoid while increasing his healing potential with the right equipment he can have a staple 350 defense and 450 elemental defense also my main supplier for sp best support that supplies the teams necessities with everyone having saving grace for the overheal its safe to not have a tank if everyone in team is healthy and abundant of sp he is still useful for debuffing primrose having the highest speed in the game makes her a great scholar its almost always her turn first before the enemy has a chance to fight with the right build she hits hard like a truck while having great evasion stat tressa apothecarydancer for that awesome utility for t considering the comments i see that only some can weild alfyns opness i believe my party iswill be t the end cyrus start olberic alfyn and tressa edit basically olberic damage alfyn main healer tressa can be anything and cyrus because i am so indecisive and can never decide anything so im sticking with 1 character i know i will end up using because detective i use haanit as an apothecary ophilia as a thief primrose as a merchantfor the bp and tressa as a scholar because her sp usage is halved i have therion alphyn primrose and haanit i use primrose olberic tressa and cyrus primrose does elemental damage gives buffs olberic is the physical damage powerhouse tressa can basically be a jack of all trades depending on what her secondary job is cyrus also does eternal damage plus his study foe ability is super useful give at least one of them a secondary job that lets them heal and i think thats a pretty balanced party tressa with scholar olberic with apothecary alfyn with thief and haanit with merchant im in the middle of chapter three and these four do work olberic and alfyn are myvhealers and sheild breakers while haanit feeds my tressa bp to spam her divine skill bsomething bounty and supports with take aim cyrus cleric tressa apothecary olberic hunter primrose thief note i havent found the hidden jobs yet right now i have hannit alfyn therion and olberic pls give advice if any to fix my team mine is hannit olberic cyrus and opilia not sure if this is ok so happy i started with tressa collect is so good earlygame im only on everyones chapter ones but i suspect ill finish her storyline first so i can swap her out for someone else in the mid to lategame when i have plenty of money this is good balancing information as id constantly changed my team out during the main story chapters and am at a bit of a loss with who to go into the finale with my main team is ophelia cyrus primrose and olbrik my team is tressa main character ophilia for the heal primrose olbreric d i just started octopath traveler and i am really enjoying this game thank you for the help in this video as well as the comments in here i love all the characters though i used ophelia alfyn and primrose as my main core and had therion as my forced protagonist ophelia spends every turn before a break using heal all and then uses all saved up bp on high powered spells alfyn was the main reviver ophelia needs to spend bp in order to revive properly backup healer and had concoct which i mostly used with pomegranate to get ophelias 4x spell damage twice in a single break primrose buffed magic attack therion provided a steady stream of pomegranate essence throughout the game and in postgame he became a backup runelord buffer basic attack ophelia with a rune enhancement dealt significantly more damage than using a 4x magic spell letting her keep bp for healing everyone has the double attack skill from hunter maximizes breaking and doubling dps when equipped with a rune and a few with spare slots had the other ones from thief dancer ophiliadancer or sorcerer tressarunelord therionmerchant and haanitwarmaster is it a good team if not ld like to know whats wrong with it thanks btw l started the game with tressa hannit cyrus ophillia and then the fourth switches between all the others teresa when i need to collect primose to grind with bewelder olbreric when its his chapter and therion when i want to steal stuff and change it up so far i think my party is kinda weird but its been working pretty well for me primrose secondary hunter alfyn secondary cleric therion secondary warrior cyrus secondary merchant my reasoning behind this was that alfyn would be my general healer and debuff cure along with being fairly tanky primrose was already supportive because of the dancer class so i added hunter for the good breaking of arrowstorm along with the critical and accuracy buff weirdly i turned therion into a pretty good tank with his natural hp and sp sustain along with warrior buffs and the warrior class offers some good aoe physical damage cyrus is my main damage source with his huge elemental attacks and giving him merchant allowed him access to another element along with some extra utility im only about 25 hours in and my characters are around level 30 so theres probably a lot for me to learn and improve but this has been working pretty well for me im not in post game yetbut i thought it would be fun to hear what others think about my teamplease tell my if my team would need some editing tressa merchant cyrus scholar ophilia healer hannit hunter my main is cyrus started off as him and hes the beast of my party tressa primrose and haanit my team is threion haanta primrose and olbreik whats your friend code 30 hours in and halfway through the chapter 2s ideally my main party would be olbericprimrosecyrusophelia but i chose haanit as my protagonist going into the game before i knew anything about it lol so for now i make do by having haanit cyrus and primrose be my main party with ophelia coming in when im doing either of their chapters and the others being rotated into the party in place of ophelia when i do their chapters i like to focus on the units that have the best stats for the roles i want them to play along with if i like the characters themselves olberic seems like the ideal physical juggernaut pdamage tank primrose i like for having really speedevasionmatk so she can be a bufferoffmagic damagedebuffer running scholar or thief as a subclass cyrus running cleric is pretty amazing allowing for him to be an offhealer when i dont need his damage and ophelia takes care of most healing along with curing status as an apothecary subclass alfyn would p i liked using primrosecyrusopheliatherion having two summons to help with the extra break is amazing on top of all the support from opheliatherionprimrose its quite the party right now i have primrose with apothecarymain hpdef tank therion with warmasterhunterevasion tank is best ophelia with sorc and cyrus with cleric can never have too many healing options am i right d just pick this game up how do we build our parties my main team was merchant therion cleric afyn lol kinda pointless but aoe healing or single healing in one character is useful hunter primrose scholar olberic i run dancer tressa cleric cyrus warrior alfyn and hunter olberic i feel like haanit is extremely good for the main reason of leghold trap completely destroys bosses team hact haanit alfyn cyrus therion primrose therion alfyn other prim mainly lived as a dark mage and buffer therion was my debuffer and secondary dps alfyn was my primary healerthough i did swap out ophilia as my healer for parts his early sp management made my life easier to boot and my last slot was generally filled with whoevers quest i was doing at the time and now im into post game and my party really hasnt changed xd how i use them hasthough i still main prim therion and alfyn this was largely inspired by how much i like them as characters as well as their usefulness in battle prim has become my mage therion my primary dps and alfyn has remained my healer though he heals as a runelord xd i loved this vid really helped explain the characters roles in a team better didnt know much about the hero i picked when i started seeing tressa as a support character makes team building more understandable i love every class and hero in this game cant wait for part 2 also what recording software do you use for your switch is it cheap im interested in making my own channel your runelord video got deleted why did that happen primrose is a better mage than cyrus cyrus and therion are probably the weakest characters in the game did you upload another part of this video and then delete it just making sure im not going crazy lol my main team is consistently therion starter thiefwarrior is basically a priority heavy hitter who can avoid a bunch of attacks which paired with incite makes for an easy battle ophelia is my clericstarseer who while is great at healing and buffing specifically starsong on therion to make aebers reckoning stronger she has high magic damage for shooting star cyrus as a scholarsorcerer since hes amazing at dealing damage the last character i change constantly usually between primrose for her buffs and haanit for her physical prowess and summon beast ability my main party is ophilia cyrus tressa and hannit subclassed as dancer apothecary thief and warrior respectively youve really sold me on alfyn though will have to start a run with him on my next playthrough as i picked ophilia first and cant swap her out so i saw this posted in a forum and thought it was a pretty decent build haanit hunterwarrior for all weapon break cyrus scholarmerchant for wind and 12 sp and rune lancebow give you more element atk boost therion thiefcleric for support with sp share and light magic lets you open purple chests and steal golden axe alfyn apothecarydancer so you can have dark spell and buffer so haanit and cyrus can just deal massive damage mt partt is cryus ophiliatressaand therion i love these guys now let be fair best physical attaquer is cyrus hunter eagle eye runelord stat swap warmaster fortitude since his hp will alwas be low how to you like me now kof kof cyrus isnt a good physical attaquer say every one p any way nice video i just startet the game and i already have therion haanit and cyrus in my team i like all of them but im struggling with my 4rd party member maybe ophilia my favorite teamjobs cyruscleric therionmerchant primrosescholar alphynhunter im using haanit tressa therion and alfyn my favorite is haanit main primrose tressa cyrus guys i think therion is the canon protagonist of octopath traveler i started with him so i dont know what his recruit dialogue is like i mean all i can imagine is i need to rob this mansion why did they do something wrong nah just wanna steal shit to make me look good ok lets go also my main team has been therion haanit ophelia and cyrus i personally use cyrus ophilia haanit and primrose ophiliadancer teressarunelord cyruswarmaster alfynhunter cyrustheif ophelia dancer olbeiric hunter tressa apothecary all elemental covered all physical weapons covered cyrus can use sp steal and share to keep him powers ophelia buffs olberic and he uses incite to make an ultimate tank i wanted to have all the classes in my team all 8 characters can self heal too so its great my team is therionhunter ophiliawarior primroseapothicary cyrusmarchant haanitdancer class because of the skini mean its the best she looks like a valkyrie i started with alfyn therion olberic and ophilia olberic spends a lot of time using group attacks and breaking weaknesses with the hunter subclass therion gives him sp while stealingcollecting and using hired help mercenary to buff the teams phys def ophilia has scholar and alfyn is my bae i hope theres a class with group buffs no spoilers pls thats all i really want atm my team is therion olberic ophilia and cyrus i need help with the boss i lost four times unscrambled below minor spoiler true final boss my favorites are tressa ophilia cyrus primrose is that a good team i go for primrosesorcerer cyrusstarseer tressarunelord olbericwarmaster cyrus is outclassed once you get the secret classes because one of them is just like cyrus except stronger and so theres no point to put it on cyrus because itd be wasted and then tressa though with the right secret classholy shit she is the best match for one of those secret classes because it can make her 100 dodge become party wide damn awesome for the heavy hitting bosses and the bonus is that she is also pretty tanky theron ophelia primrose and cyrus is my main team haanit later thief ophilia later dancer cyrus later merchant and olberic later apothecary or therion later hunter tessa later scholar primrose later cleric and alfyn later warrior you have a ballanced team in the beginning and have all 8 jobs within 1 team in late game my main team is cyrus ophilia haanit and therion 2 elemental attackers and 2 physical attackers which encompasses 2 buff characters and 1 healing i really like olbreric and primrose as well so they head up my secondary team alfyn and tressa are definitely my least favorite since theyre kinda in the middle of the pack they dont have super strong elemental or physical attack alfyns concoct is nice but i find myself wanting to save all of the ingredients for boss battles great video ive been hoping someone would make a video just like this who should i start with in general please dont say my choice lol like who is the most useful character from start to finish seeing standard jobs coming pretty early in the game considering them for your setup is not a bad idea advanced jobs are more lateendgame oriented with that said i run the following haanit hunterscholar with her beasts and elemental attacks she actually makes for a very potent hybrid attacker and is very much able to be the solo carry if need be alfyn apothecarycleric concoct is just too good give him aoe heals on top and your party wont ever die bp spam is honestly all he needs to do therion thiefmerchant sounds weird but does work honestly i only take him with me so i can open purple treasure chests merchant gives me wind element and collect for extra money also share sp rest is a great skill combo might swap for tressa with thief secondary later tho primrose dancerapothecary ye no warrior class i just dont like it prim is here to close all left open gaps of my team last path action dark element access and damage boosting buffs i personally use haanitwarmaster tressarunelord cyrussorcerer primrosestarseer i just want the sheer damage i mainly run therionscholar cyrussorcerer ophiliaapothecary haanitwarrior it works very well and i beat most bosses first run through i just defeated 3 chapter 2 bossesomar the blood wizard guy from cyrus chapter and the schollar who has one of the dragon gemstones and im thinking my main team is gonna be therionapothocary haanitwarrior ophilliadancer tressaschollar haanit is gonna be my main physical atacker and tank therion is gonna debuff and occasionaly heal and remove debuffs from party member sand has pretty decent attack and speed kinda like a jackof all traits ophillia is gonna heal and buff my team and also has acces to light and dark elemental attacks if needed and tressa is has acces to all the elemental atacks accept light and dark but ophillia already has that covered so she can do all the elemental damage and sometimes do other stuff any differences i should make or is this team ok therion roguehunterrunelord for end game bosses cyrussorcerer primrose starseer olbric warmaster cyrus is my main he is also just the main damage dealer olbric has a secondary class of apothecary giving him insane health i use olbric to use incite so he takes all the damage then i have thereon with cleric second class the spell reflect is mandatory for me on some boss fights the heal is also important therion is the person so i always have someone to open purple chests primrose with merchant secondary gives her all sorts of utility donate bp is a go to along with all the many dances to give boosts therion is the worst character on the game why is he even considered all i know is that i will use ophillia no idea after that tho because every other character i try where interesting but nothing like special ctoh where all good in there owen way but whitout anything really extremlly good tho i guess i was quite impress by c magic damage and scan ability i was just impress by ophilia healing aoe and her ability to revive alie and also how hard she hit whit her light attaque also her physical isnt too bad too quite impress but what i was the most impress is how ophilia is super tanky whit he physical and magic bulk being really good for someone that can self heal herself she gain a thing that make her able to over heal i think makeing her bulk really good probably since i only play the beta but it was nothing to laught at takeing like 5 damage at some point whene blocking ive been working on gathering info about the game because i really love jrpgs your videos are the best and most informative keep it up ill watch every one would it be better to have warrior alfyn or apothecary olberic currently with therion prim tressa cyrus i was using therion cyrus alfyn and alternating between prim and tressa but i popped a 100x exp on a boss battle when alfyn wasnt in my team while i decided on tressa and prim so for now until i figure out who to replace with him thatll be my party your 100 current tho alfyn is a beast and when i stared using his concoct ability i was impressed almost immediately reminded me of rikku from ffx but wayyyy better i want alfyn to possibly be an apothecary thief to represent rikku haha alfyn my boiiii my team alfyn main warrior cyrus merchantcleric i cant choose tressa thief primrose scoolar i think it should be noted that haanits shackle foe is the best debuff in the game i chose cyrus to start cause ive always loved the mage style in all jrpgs and my main team started out as cyrus therion haanit and alfyn i soon replaced alfyn with olberic as i always over level myself so i didnt need the healing and wanted the damage after sub jobs my team is now cyrus as a scholarcleric haanit as a hunterwarrior therion as a thiefdancer and olberic as a warriorapothecary from time to time i like to swap olberic out with alfyn as an apothecarymerchant if anyone has any suggestions for me to upgrade id be really grateful for any advice you can give me theriontheif cleric haanithunter warmaster ophiliacleric starseer cyrusscholar sorcerer is my alrounder party therion cyrus tressa and ophilia therions divine skill does over 10000 on all enemies 20000 when broken its insane also hes selfsustaining cyrus as sorcerer is just my elemental breaker and beast for damage tressa because self healing and sidestep especially with runelord giving everyone sidestep ophilia because dat heal im not saying i dislike this video its a good idea but where is the hidden jobs video nice video bud i started as the thief meet up with the huntress and defeated that nasty woodland beast so i am only a two person party at tho mo the party team i would like too have overall probably stick with the thief and huntress plus add oberlic cuz he is strong courageous n wise but i am struggling with who else i should pick tho great video as the usual when wishful thinking uploads whoever let those guys in front of a camera should immediatly be fired i like the battles but the game seems restrictive in travel you are running paths and when you hit a story you are locked to that drama or character story construction being on a modem computer youd expect far more openness and interaction with chattel like searching furniture and environments for goods whats on olberic which gives him 100hp6sp on his each turn does the other guard drop swords too just as one could have expected after the enchanted sword drop by alphas in bolderfall another rare item drop in a challenge fight i guess you really need a thief subclass for olberic so he can steal a possible drop during the fight already i wonder which other challengable highrank npc would give you valuable random drops thanks for sharing and great work im guessing it only works if you challengeprovoke it and couldnt be stealedpurchased how long was the flight originally lol why is everyone harping on this guy he didnt call the video best farming endgame op exp its just a normal farming method if you have a better one then good for you but theres no need to be assholes about it at least he actually made a video of his this video is inaccurate sorcerer with high elem atk 900 80 speed necklace will almost always go first you can literally fire off ignis ardere in less than 1 second and it will vaporize every encounter in the forest of purgation instantly except for the big rocky boi you have a 3 chance of getting in that case you can steal a revitalizing jam from it after using ignis ardere and still wipe it in either turn 1 or turn 2 you will level up ungodly fast this way use the captains badge and all that jazz then equip 4 alluring ribbons and the forbidden bow to get encounters on average every 23 seconds rake in the exp this strategy works much earlier as well with faster battles i had olberic with the best gear and sword i could find and someone using the hunter job rain of arrows breaks everyone right away then a single boosted level slash from olberic wipes out the wolves snow leopards may take another hit but super quick and easy to grind levels before hitting up chapter 4s and the secret job dungeons great video maybe slow your roll on the speed talking though hard to understand at times i like the effort here but you should honestly go to the forest of purgation and use the one shot alfynn setup btw the support skills for that are bp eater surpassing power fortitude and physical prowess than just equip warrior on alfynn use incite get rid of all armor equipped and let the enemies kill you then just flee or finish the enemies after that use ophelia to raise to 1 hp and give him the memorial axe and warlord and you should be able to do an average of around 3000040000 damage on one charge to get even higher than that use tressas donate bp to get alfynns bp to 3 and then use the critical chance raiser from starseer and do 99999 dmg have fun ps use the alluring thingy you get from different places to get enemies to come to you faster if the video isnt efficient the method isnt either you can also find the thiccc caits in the forest i found that that location is much better for grinding since you can pop every enemy in there with a sorcerer actually no i cant remember who but some other youtuber made a comparison between maw of the dragon and forest of purgation over a few hours of grinding and the forest is more efficient overall this is taking waaay too long at level 70 im getting exp 1000 average im about to quit this method is not efficient at all sorcerer along in area forest of purgation can easily grant entire team with average 1500 exp per battle i always have one dancer in my team so that whenever the dancer happened to move ahead of the sorcerer i let her dance if i get expjp multiplier i get it if i dont i dont i have therion as my sorcerer and at level 70 with the fire boosting dagger and sword and boost start bp eater i can one shot everything in the forest of purgation and maw of the ice dragon with the exception of the bosses it makes grinding a lot faster because you never need to use other characters to do anything and when you run out of sp you can just use steal sp to get everything back where to grind from 50 to 80 can someone explain how my linde got from strength 3 to strength 4 i finished olberics story completely and that quest npc is not there in wellspring donovan isnt in his location either is there some other prerequisite forrest is much better unless you can get the caits every ten encounter you are literally making less xp with all my characters at 88 i can confirm that forest is way better than maw like i said unless you can the caits every so often you are literally making less xp per battle you might as well just go for the npc fight in swarki for those revitalizing jams i encounter a grand total of 1 dire wolf boss in all of my time in the ice cave thank you for this assumed you have the captains badge and extra experience for grinding badge of friendship and that one other passive skill for increased jp forgot what it was alluring ribbons and forbidden bow is also nice for increased encounters which speeds up your grinding not sure if it stacks but correct me if im wrong i prefer having haanit and another hunter spamming arrowstorms with a sorcerer preferably cyrus to get the break exp bonus and having a better chance of beating monster faster and reliably gives around 12k18k exp cait family encounters give around 6k exp when you defeat them another area is the famous forest of purgation located at the west of wispermill which is best suited once again with a sorcerer and warbringer haanit which is mainly for the dual coverage with all attacking bow and axe skills the goats give the most exp gives around 12k21k exp w captains badge and extra experience support skill also has occasional chubby cait encounters so does lions dance still buffs haanit with physical prowess equiped haanit has phy atk buff already buffing her with dancer is pointless as its the same buff thats just wasted timeefficiency lol the cait family isnt worth it because its so rare in my opinion i think that the forest of purgation is better because you average about 1500 per encounter your method could be significantly improved by using the sorcerer speed 80 for him so that he goes first and then just boost 2 times and use the wind skill you also get the break experience boost from it and its much faster than your method great spot for kill fast mobs already beat the final boss but maybe i get my toons to 99 i noticed a little mistake on your part you said that to get the captains badge one has to travel to saintsbridge and inquire with an old man in the cathedral however you actually need to visit goldshores cathedral and inquire with bishop donovan to finish the quest on a side note the quest isnt called donovans status but rather back with bale still thank you for taking your time to inform us about this method i would have just kept grinding in a level 58 area but if i can encounter entire groups of caits i will gladly move to a level 45 area cool you can replace surpassing power with boost start to be almost guaranteed to get a 1 hit ko with haanit you can also give primrose starseer because starseer can easily kill all enemies with one skill as well i used those two and cyrus to level in the forest of purgation or only cyrus and haanit when levelling 2 other characters it looks like you didnt mention bewildering grace where rarely you can roll exp x2 5 10 or 100 and its the same for jp i just got done getting to level 40 lol now to finish all the chapters and get the subclasses phase 1 319 phase 2 3022 team 1 cyrus scholarcleric alfyn apothecarywarrior therion thiefdancer haanit hunterwarmaster team 2 ophilia clericstarseer tressa merchantrunelord olberic warriorhunter primrose dancersorcerer the eye is realistic it makes it unsettling took me a couple days to beat this fucker i hate how some jrpgs are usually a cakewalk glad to finally be challenged in one for once love this game went through all the bosses before galdera figured final boss would be tough sees that its a team battle most of my characters arent past lvl 30 ya i just resigned myself to defeat in the first phase xd not going to bother with grinding out all the other characters to 70 i kind of regret saying wouldnt it be fun if there was a boss that was god but was extremely difficult to beat i didnt know the first 32 chapters of the game were just a tutorial for this boss i still think it would have been beneficial for story purposes if there was actual voice acting in this fight and its scenes it also would have been cool if the right characters had something to say to each other or lyblac them being silent like we were back in classic ff1 or 3 or what have you kind of took me out of it i did love the boss a lot though felt very rewarding to win against him it them i thought that to watch this full video i would skip around because it was so long but i watched the whole thing and if anything i went back to replay some parts very memorizing knowing i could never do this in my game it took 30 hours of additional grinding but i beat this son of a bitch i lost after fighting for 5 hours so i figured id just come here and see what happens rather than spend another 20 hours grinding my guys to the right level to fight this thing i like turn based stuff and im alright with some grinding but i dont feel like going to the insane extent needed to beat this boss still like the game though kudos to whoever can beat this boss jesus not what i was expecting freaking tharizdun could have been cooler if all 8 heroes fought him didnt know therion is sarcastic in english dub he sounds very aloof in japanese dub love haanits va on both languages though finished all characters ch4 around lvl 40 i dont want grinding just to beat this boss so here i am watching it instead lets get down to buisness ooof no twinaxe for phase one is rough i was happy to beat this boss if for no other reason than the music being absolute garbage i just did this fight and it was fun very rough but i did manage to beat it on my 2nd try i didnt really look up anything about octopath beforehand so i was surprised while watching this video to see tressa can give everyone sidestep as a runelord somehow i never thought of that i had olberic as my runelord to give everyone a defense buff instead 2nd phase was scary since turn one three of my characters were killed but luckily i was able to recover i just had to spend many many turns trying to heal and set up and slowly whittle away at leblac and the other two pieces before i was able to actually set up and do damage patience is too op gyigas in new graphics music is spectacular reminds me of exdeath final form neo exdeath i want to kick you and shout use refreshing jams its the last freaking boss using healing grapes and inspiring plums really i refuse to beat this guy why because the only way i could beat him the way i wanted to is if i leveled up to 99 it too hours just to get to 80 on everyone this game was great and all but i just hate extremely hard final bosses that you have to grind for or just have the perfect team set up its a dumb thing and i wish so many rpgs didnt rely on it he certainly doesnt disappoint i give up seems it is impossible to beat this with conventional methods when i realised those little little demon shits will keep regenerating if not defeated both at once i just had to turn the game off i was going to give this game a 99 now its a 09 for me what i just noticed that lyblanc is a part of galderas body wtf i used the same teams but with other support skills i also love this fight might be my favorite fight a list of gear used would be extremely helpful can we can that info was i the only one who expected the final boss to be some sort of octopus hah noooo thank you the boss rush was fun but after getting smooshed by galdera i quickly reconsidered finishing this game ill pass great game but an anticlimactic ending i hope squareaquire makes more stuff with these art assetsgame engine though cuz got damn its gorgeous 3 worst final boss ever does anyone know where you can find kit after this if you can i literally just beat this boss finally but i dont want to look for him everywhere yeah just got to this guy myself right now got up to this guy myself i grinded for a couple hours got my mainbest 4 fighters up to to around 65 felt confident in my party and managed to beat the 8 previous bosses with relative ease then i get to this part where not only do i need to use all 8 members with the other 4 consisting of level 35s but i thereby get my assed kicked within ironically 8 turns of the first phase wasting the last 12 hours of the 8 previous bosses sighs going back to 40 more hours of grinding wow good to know square enix recycled the lost babil fight i know this boss might not be so hard for some people but holy crap its one of the hardest bosses ive encountered in a game update i have beaten the boss finally whats up with rpgs final bosses being gods always lmao alfyn dies im sorryguys revives immediatly thats what im here for i finally did it i defeated galdera but i did it with the help of chubby caits sorry i just wanted to finally beat the game the second phase wasnt really difficult i killed every part of the body very fast and after that i defeated galdera himself within a few rounds my playtime after that fight about 140 hours and 20 minutes howre you not affected by the toxic field oo good lordits like kefka and giygas had a child and they named it galdera aside from that this fight looks tough and tedious as all hell no pun intended seeing as you need to level grind for all 8 characters and pretty much max them all out in order to win jesus its like ff6 all over again everyone bitching about spoilers you searched for it not the uploader for the future try not to put super spoiler stuff out there like this itll ruin the experience of people who havent beaten the game ive beaten the game but this showed up in my recommendations despite me never looking up info on the final bosses yeah nice spoiler you could avoid writing the final boss name in the title and showing his two forms in the thumbnail thats just disrespectful towards whoever hasnt finished the game yet and finds this video in his recommendations also dont come at me with the why did you click on the video bullshit the spoiler is in the title and thumbnail btw ive already finished the game i just find this really disturbing and wanted to point it out boss is almost dead me lets use bewildering grace your foe is revitalized he has full hp and stat buffs for 5 turns fuck i do love spoiler thumbnails i thought the game was over when you beat all 8 stories so how did this happen i havent gotten near enough into this point yet but ill try wish me luck you are some special kinda asshole whyy do you put thumbnail and title spoilers in your damn video you even went out of your way to show both phases dislike the boss is really difficult but you can imo cheese the first phase with alfyn dancer olberic apothecary ophilia starseer cyrus sorcerer for the second phase i used therion cleric hannit warmaster tressa runelord primrise merchant my characters were lvl 60 i nearly defeated the whole boss with a 55s party with my first try what is actually the recommended level i beat him in my 65s actually galdera is not a very hard boss with an optimal team setup it took me arround 15 mins to finish the battle and im sure there is ppl finishg it in less than 10 come if you dare thwack have i failed fighting against galdera will be one of the last things i do despite this video it looks incredibly hard but its still an amazing video something very helpful is that alfyn can use concoct to remove all enemy buffs and prevent them for multiple turns to buff themselfes up again this turns lyblac basically useless for multiple rounds and reduces the damage you take greatly i managed to beat the boss with lv 6067 thanks to that without slapping saving grace on everybody wheres the best place to grind to 75 and any tricks to speed up the process so you suggust to have all party members atleast lvl 70 dammit i need to come up with a strategy other than deal 250k damage on turn 3 and pray it kills them i hate doing things the intended way phase 1 i dont know is your dad a giant fking skeleton made out of ribcages and hatred ballsdeep69 aka klein phase 2 ps you might wanna keep your eyes peeled for the personification of death itself kirito the first half was easy enough with sorc cyrus so i just cheesed the second part with 1hp fortitude hannit spammed the hell outta pomegranates and bursted him b4 he became any sort of problem i swear this boss is extravagantly luckbased if he goes before any of your characters in the 2nd phase and uses the ice attack youre done congrats man you were a big help through my play through i didnt know there was a second phase and i only had my main team leveled up you can say i was destroyed this boss reminds me of so many things ive seen in other games wow its one cool looking boss jesus which pit of hell did he came from thanks guys for rescuing square enix thanks for this incredible game please launch nintendo switch in india please make bravely third for the switch or at least an hd version of default and second play marios evil jerk he tried to kill a baby the daddy come on nintendo your tank sucks man tank sucks bowser jr is very smart how do you explain that nintendo how do you explain that bowser jr being a smarty pants nintendo at least put all your youtube videos on the nintendo switch all the players are missing this kind of content i like nintendo minute but its not enough thanks this game gives me hope for a final fantasy game on switch especially ff6 nintendo can you psl giv me a free geme l want mincraft i wish they had learnt how to say listening though graphical work is amazing i hope gameplay will not be repetetive and be fresh can you put octoling in super smash bros on the nintendo switch life is strange for the switch please for others no there wasnt a

switch arms bundle is there a benefit downloading the demo if i own the game already like how pokemon sun and moon gave you ash greninja do you get an exclusive item nintendo sues to shut down two big rom sites which offers nintendo games for free that are twenty years and older nintendo itself doesnt sell old games anymore so leave them alone can gta5 be realeast on switch really fun qa glad they added features to enhance the turn based experience square enix should buy the rights for suikoden from konami and have this exact team remake 2 itd be a huge hit please korean i love this game thanks only thing i disliked was that everyone was for themselfes and didnt interact bravely default was in that aspect stronger but still a great game add baldi in smash bros more dev teams need to take the same approach these guys did with the demo and feedback this allows them to tweak the game while its still in development instead of releasing a day one patch or something further down the line i love octopath traveler the music the graphics the gameplay the developers is there anything not to love about this game please continue with your great work i would buy ot2 ot3 ot4 all in a heartbeat this is a difrent story but is super maro 3d world coming to swich im sorry for this qusten but i dont know how to contact nintendo my dream of this team will be a remake of final fantasy tactics or a sequel thankyouthankyouthankyou what a beautiful and amazing game kudos also to mr nishiki who composed these darn hummable melodies i hope korean to be added i wanted to play too but i could not buy it please im glad this game is out because now whenever nintendo says heres a special announcement it will actually be something important ha just kidding it will probably be something about that bee game love these dudes thanks for making this amazing game thx square i need this game right now its amazing its fantastic its fantasy pls make more for nintendo or switch i love all ur works you need to buy this team asap nintendo i just love this game but now i want ff7 original in this graphical style what a match made in heaven it would be now that the game is successful nintendo is publishing a lot more stuff about it yknow the artwork on this game does show some semblance of them looking like they were to travel together but that wasnt the case at all they do have conversations though but its as though only 4 of them are on the journey the 4 you chose to bring along with you thank you guys for a slenpid classic in this modern gaming era if you guys can see this would it be possible to revisit saga frontier and implement this game engine with it i concept of saga frontier is pretty much the same game except you had a 5 party system and fusion combo attacks mr nishiki is a literal god i love this team i hope you guys make more in the future best game of 2018 for me make nintendos most powerful console the nintendo nx im starting to think japan is trying to retake power in gaming with all these great games a 4th golden sun game would look gorgeous in this kind of graphics just saying great game great developers horrible interview why were they asked questions we already knew the answers to i was pumped to see another one of their videos since i enjoyed their demo feedback videos and developer updates but this was lame why did we ask them about the title we already knew that this interview looks like it was created for people who have never heard of the game it would be great if we could see the different subclass sprites in the overworld as well not just in combat great job guys awesome game the wife and i love it they look pixelly tired your game is awesome thanks nintendo pr uk for our copy of the game this game is so good i love everything about it gameplay retro inspired graphics music its awesome this is the best square game since ff7 the enix portion we will talk later for the eleventh time yes there is a huge interest in jrpgs in the west thanks for creating a game that you you would actually want to play and not one to pander to a western audience also thanks for making a complete game with no dlc to patch up the story keep up the excellent work please rerelease bravely default and bravely second as a bundle on one cartridge for the switch yeah and why does it run at 720p30fps octopath traveler have the best marketing from nintendo in years i mean they release two demos the first one for feedpack purposes and second one as a taste of final taste which give you even the possibility to keep the save and continue to main game if you buy it also nintendo presented the octopath a lot of times by various nintendo directs and presentations i hope to follow the same model for next exclusives games in corporation with third parties games like bayonneta 2 and wonderful 101 on wiiu unfortunately didnt have the same marketing support the prologue demo convinced me to buy this awesome game i instantly got hooked this was a damn good game its not perfect but its a lot fun ill keep playing this for a very long time i really love this game is remarkable an gorgeus the only thing i think is weird its no weird really it doesnt have a negative influence in the entire game its the link between characters and their stories if the developers make a secuel or a saga they may be consider all the feedback from the people to make in the future an epic and amazing game great work guys so im a bit confused are there 8 separate stories with the protagonists all going their separate ways or do all of the protagonists eventually band together and if so would the character you pick first change the way the story plays out meeting all of the other characters does anyone have any thoughts on these does this game have the portuguese language option hi i am from india i am a very huge fan of nintendo but i cant buy it due to some problems i am requesting you to plzzzzzzzzz give me a 3ds console any second hand or first hand in which i can play 3ds games i am very huge fan of pokemon games also and the best pokemon games are only played on nintendo 3ds and i think nintendo is a very huge comapany so it can give a giveaway type one 3ds console plzzzz give me a 3ds console and if you are giving me plzzzzzzzzz call me on my number 8218644324 or send me a message on this gmail plzzz i will give you my address details fantastic looking game definitely on my pick up list its hard being an rpg fan and keeping up with games while thoroughly completing the ones you already have the game looks so fun and beautiful i wish i had the time and money to get this game in my hands already but it looks like ill have to wait another month or two nintendo is treating this game like first party d so excited for octopath travelers success it deserves all the credit more of this please i was born in 1983 and grew up in the golden age of snes jrpgs it feels great to pick up a game like this again octopath is also an anagram for all the protagonists names im so happy this game has sold like hot cakes im having such a great time playing it the writing and the combat are the best things about this game for me 3 i also really love the changes to the combat in octopath traveler compared to bravely default my biggest gripe with bd was starting back at level 1 tt i personally like to be able to continue playing through the story without the need to have to grind exp to level new classeslike in old pokemon and final fantasy i much rather the vocation system in dragon quest thank you for the great game i need this game right now im not into these games so i didnt know what it was and i clicked the vid thinking it was splatoon 2 xd i have an idea for the next console and i was wondering nintendo if you are interested great interview glad to see that the devs still love 2d art im from their generation as well you did a great job guys and im also from 85 like the director thank you for making such an amazing game octopathtravellersubscribe really nintendo good video though and that soundtrack is incredible pls add destiny 2 pls for free octopath travlerocto expansion need chinese support thank you for putting hello neighbor on to the nintendo switch im so happy about this one can we get cuphead on the switch plz thank you so much for this amazing game oh my gosh thank youuuuu i love you much love from canada sea of thieves pls sea of thieves pls sea of thieves pls sea of thieves pls our of curiousity who did you all start with i started with tessa myself very passionate developers i love this game the soundtrack of this game is pure masterpiece and the game itself too damn so addictive thanks for crafting a beautiful game question of the day can we get a proper super mario rpg sequel now that octopath traveler exceeded sales expectations on the switch i played the demo and cant get enough of it but the physical copy is nowhere to be found and all i have is cash whats octopath means do mario tennis aces new character september is come please does octopath reference the eightfold path seeing as buddhism is such a prevelant religion in japan as well awesome game and great interview i chose haanit as my main protagonist and it was fun seeing her being the base for the team in the footage for this interview 20 hours in and loving it oh and tress chapter 2 boss omar is a beast one of the switchs best games fighting agent 8 at the end is probably the best bonus boss in jrpg history the art combat and music are phenomenal the only aspect i wish had more of a priority during the development process is the story i havent finished the game yet as i just recently got it so hope therere some plot twists that satiate me i wonder if there are minigames too octopath traveler sequel honestly a game of the year contender in my eyes wish there would be some dlc but i understand the reasoning heres hoping for octopath 2 ophilia cyrus tressa olberic primrose alfyn therion haanit nice this game is beautiful and it seens awesome well done guys the game is amazing game of the year for me they look so young for their age mr miyauchi looks like his 19 and what surprises me the most is that he is actually a year older than mr takahashi when is the 2d mario game coming out im waiting at the end they say thank you for watching no just no thank you for making such a gorgeusfun game that feels fresh while remembers me too when i was a child playing final fantasy this is my years favourite game 3 awesome game so happy for their success with it they should have a sale for this game 60 dollars is kinda ridiculous im so glad to see turnbased rpg come back ive been a fan of games like chrono cross pokemon final fantasy x and golden sun i really do hope golden sun comes back as a remastered port or sequel for the switch because 1 and 2 were so good the two dudes from square enix truly deserve worldwide accolades for octopath traveler i surely do hope they would make a sequel for the switch or future nintendo hybrid platform beyond 2020 ot is the 1 game at the north american eshop buy it either online or at retail players the game has its issues but its pretty good so far loving this game in my opinion its better than bravely default for a variety of reasons octopath might not be as complex as brave in terms of the job system but i think its better in bravely it was downright overwhelming to manage all the different job combinations while also enjoying the story i would always accidentally overlevel trying to get a specific combination of abilities which ended up stunting the difficulty nintendo team up with hasbro so the fans can have my little pony splatfest im super happy this game is selljng out much tp my saddness of not getting it in time from the moment i saw it in the switch announcement i was like this game alone is gonna make me buy a switch and the more andd more i saw the more hyped i got waiting for it congrats you two you made us all happy i have hated since 2004 the direction square enix is taking with their franchise i truly preferred it when it was only squaresoft i am glad they allow some developpers to go back to their core the very reason they gain fame in the first place octopath traveler is what ff6 should have been if they have the time to remake that masterpiece which is way more fun and deep than ff7 please get these guys on more man this game is so good i cant stop playing great to see the success i just pirated this game and i have to say its quite good in terms of storyline but the gameplay can get kind of annoying very 710 game but worth playing god bless u japan why cant you the enemies health thats my problem i love this game takahashi is one handsome guy the game looks fun its a shame the 8 paths barely connect even taking into consideration the posth game stuff its more like 8 mini rpgs good job guys i love you proyect its a great game if you like jrpgs and good story telling i highly recommend you get this game great job on this awesome game simply adorable i love it when the devs speak about their games i just finished all the main story quests for all characters took me 70 hours i have finished almost all side quests before then i have a couple of dungeons left then im ready for post game content what a damn amazing game there is so much content the game is extrodinarily well written and designed i enjoyed every single second playing it i hope to see more of this in the near future from now on new game plus job outfits in open world use arena postgame more continents to explore since theres so many emblems above the map love the game think im bout 40 hours deep octopath has this like nostalgia feelin to it but modern at the same time what a great

hit 90 out of 10 square enix should now start considering developing and bringing their mainline japanese franchises final octopath is officially one of my top 3 favorite games of all time well done everyone looking forward to more games similar to this one lovely game playing it now for 20 hours and it gets more fun and challeging what ive heard is that because of the great sells they are planning a second game with more story depth like the man in the video says we first want to make an good introduction of all 8 characters but in octopath traveler 2 the story continues with way more depth of conversation with the characters next stotyline will have more personal emotion in it excellent game thank you love my jrpgs and this game is great so far do wish there were more turnbased i get its slower but i think it makes up in depth and good decision making skipped this game because of how much time it might take to complete all 8 stories might require more time than i have i also thought the nonunified story was a bit unappealing to me seeing gameplay on youtube videos and livestreams i dont feel like im missing out on much its nothing too special battle systemwise looks like a solid game but not one that im dying to play hope others are enjoying it enough that they make a sequel i need this game it would be a great time killer or a good streaming game 3 they should have changed that available now in the end as sold out lol unfortunately this isnt knack 3 nice try reggie duodecimpath traveler when damn that dude produced square enix by himself square please let this team reimagine chrono trigger with octopath travelers art directionim begging you ive heard nothing but good things will have to wait to play it until next year though still have to get odyssey and donkey kong for the wife by then mario party pokmon and super smash will start rolling out so happy this game is doing well sucks that you cant find a physical copy anyehere port this to wii u not my usual taste in game but after playing the demo i bought it today and im hooked its so good its amazing omg i need to play more curse you work i cant get over how beautiful this game is it refreshing to see a new take on retro graphics seeing as about all we get these days are 3d style or the classic retro looking titles dont get me wrong those games are great but its nice to see something new and different oh and dont get me started on the soundtrack ive been humming that battle theme ever since i got the game so good keep up the great work guys and i cant wait to see what you have in store for us in the future thanks for so much jrpg pleasure why the stories are that short thank you so much for this amazing game i cant begin to tell you how much i love the game its one of the best jrpg games ive played i wish i could get a nintendo swich and this game however the switch is over 540 where i am when are you going to lower the price well obviously japan would remember octopus because hentai im loving octopath traverler and i love all the hard work and effort this team has put into it i hope they continue the bravely series after this though as they are some of my favorite rpgs ever your game is actually the best based on how its sold out everywhere its like the game hasnt even come out yet why does this game cost so much one of the greatest jrpgs i have ever played such a phenomenal game with love and care and hard work built into it i cant wait to see what you guys bring in the future great characters beautiful graphics and such a spectacular soundtrack that can set the mood for the games settings so well thank you for a such an amazing game cant stop playing this game absolutely love it more games from this team please also ports of bravely default and second and bring third greate game thanks to octopath team bless this team and their work with the success of the bravely series and octopath hopefully this revives turn based combat in rpgs and shows theres an interest in these types of games direct when wheres final fantasy 7 remake dammit lol jk octopath is amazing great job square i wanna suck them 8 questions huh i see what you did there great games guys thank you for such an epic title can we get a part 2 or atleast more future titles that resemble this type of storytelling gameplay and old school feel again thanks for ot first the silly voices are making me piss myself nice one cant wait to get this game also in every vid u do pee wee voice all the time keep it up also love watching ur streams mike i need to get this game i need to find time to watch ur play threws im gonna love it i want to play this but im not buying another video game system to do it fuck me those stupid voices this is worse than any of the ones with his donald duck impressions voice over is hilarious beat the porridge out of those kids what are your thoughts about the new godzilla trailer i gotta get this with the switch for sure im 18 hours in i love this game mike are you a fan of fallout new vegas id love to see a stream of that game from you good thinking starting with my boi ol ber please review this an open world turn based zelda game by square would be so damn good mike we do want these we also want a playthrough of 6 and chrono i bust out laughing at humon honestly i cant believe that anyone can watch his whole streams he is such a noob on all new games that i see him play it looks like my own grandpa trying to figure it out how the game works thot shamming in a nintendo game now i seen it all lol glad mike is enjoying the atmosphere and dialogue instead of making random comments and impersonations oh wait lol im not big into jrpg games but its really fun something as a demo seriously mike whod buy a fucking switch for the original donkey kong you might have a massive nostalgia boner for the 80s arcades but im not sure that has any form of mass appeal donkey kong was cool when i was a kid but i have no desire to ever touch it again ever in my life there are games where mikes mindless babbling and impersonations are highly obnoxious this is one of them great game cant wait to see whenif mike learns how to play it so far nada cant find the time to finish games currently still playing horizon zero dawn need to catch up hi mike matei best of you tube for friends thank you veedeo i need to remember that you do live streams lol am i the only person who is feeling the nostalgia for saga frontier when i see this game 2 gripes with this game just give me more interactionsdialogue between my party and the ability to go into shopsinns is this a new game i need to pick this up played through the three hours they allowed with the prologue demo and loved it started with olberic which super helped come primrose start and her boss this game looks fun ive only played a lil of it so far this could be painful to watch oh wait it is this looks great big tities you cant mass sidestep also seems the dammage is nerfed ive only played for some time but i love this game so far not sure how therions prologue compares to the others but i played the demo started with him and i loved it so i bought the game your shmeskliency there much i want to say about the negativity about the game but the one thing i really want to is the game story tells how some events of the characters lifes effects others in the story like the after war times animals greed in powermoney and graham crossfield has a big part in some lives people the game is grindy the same people no i have never played etrian odyssey i loved this game from the moment i laid eyes upon it every review made me want to play it more and more even the ones that included a handful of criticisms although most reviews i saw were mostly positive now that i finally own a switch i will definitely be getting around to it at some point however my first 3 games are breath of the wild super mario odyssey and hollow knightso itll be a good 34 months minimum before im ready for another game one of my biggest grips of the game i that there is no auto advance for the voice acted lines like it most text heavy rpgs ie the shin megami tensei games i love you my friend i and all my friends look youalways im from austriaviennaand i buy 2 tshirts and the coming to me thy are so cool on all fans the merch is sooo cool thx beat big hug olso from my girlfriend you my nr1 people should follow your review strategy because sounds like a bunch of clones out there ah jeesh sorry im a year late commenting anyways i have this game i wanted to get back into it so i decided to look stuff up to hype myself up lol just wanted to say who fiddly diddly cares if the characters dont interact with eachother much lol game is beautifull btw thats what attracted me to this game i also just like jrpgs final fantasy stuff i love this game i may be a bit slow 20 hours only chapter ones done but i still love it so much this moron still screaming in his videos its like a 3am info commercial this characters with individual stories thing thats said to be innovative is it ive played a fair few rpgs in my 38 years so far ive played plenty of them whereyou have a main character the as you go along you recruit new characters to your party and they come with their own individual quest lines attached to them that you play through this is not a revolutionary concept lol he says its not grindy now wait till he gets to the secret final boss yes i know im one year late i love this game i am 50hours into it no offense man the writing is horrible the stories are so clich strong men weak females the characters dont interact at all party banter is ludicrous no comparison to ff vi or ix i kinda wish they were eight seperate smaller games meeting up near the end when darkness falls and teaming up at the very end for an epic boss fight they have enough characters within each chapter to make a smaller game you know it wouldve been more work but im willing to wait if i can get a great game i like the game but cant get in it 915 you seem to be using the exact same party as me therion uses steal sp and share sp to fuel cyrus whos equipped with all the elemental attack up stuff to nearly max out his elemental attack stat ophelia can heal and for a while i was using her as a dancer to buff his elemental attack and i was using merchant on cyrus to give more bp to cyrus sometimes buffed up cyrus can kill most enemy parties 10 levels above your own in a single turn random battles end up going really fast as a result and i found myself way overleveled from about 13 of the game onward using evasive maneuvers the entire time to reduce the random encounter rate and not grinding at all even before i had that setup haanit has that arrow attack that hits all enemies 58 times and the knight dude has his rapid spear attack youd have to be really bad at the game or just trying to blast through a single characters story as fast as possible in order to be underleveled in this game i think the battle system is not a grind but people need to realize its more of a strategy based combat system you need to pay attention to the turns your ability to break down an opponents shields and your own break points and abilities you cant just attack because then it probably would become a grind as far as the characters experiencing their stories alone i actually imagine them together as the party of 4 maybe the other 3 are in the background or in the next room but i always imagine the other 3 somewhere to back up that character the travel banter makes me feel like they are all friends helping each other along their own journey and the fact that they are friends despite their different personalities is a magical thing one of my favorite travel banter thus far is when haanit says she doesnt like the idea of thievery but she will put aside her judgements because they are comrades and the fact that travel banter only happens amongst the party members makes this game i played a demo because of your recommendation and then couldnt stop playing it was up at night and couldnt wait to go out and buy it so bought the nintendo eshop version my excellency cheating the system why is this game just liveaevil livealive octopath has better and deeper gameplaybattle mechanics than ff15 take it from someone has both stop yelling jesus christ man is this something new 12 year olds enjoy in 2019 games ought to be fully voicedgone are the reams and reams of blah blah text we had before i mean i played the game its pretty good i would recomend for long trips or boring days but dont play too long as then the game loses itself by that i mean you want to play it piece by piece synopsis of this video all those people who say this game sucks are fucknuts i love therion this game is awesome kind of reminds me of golden sun seriesim on olbridge chapter 1 with all the starting charactersprimrose story was a tragedy travel banter makes me whole me well sorry wallet but looks like we have another one to add to the list wallet silently starts to cry thats why name is donkey the final boss behind that gate was bs you shouldnt have to fight him all over again and the 8 pre fights just because he one shots you in his second stage this game was really good i was well made it not 100 perpect but it one of the best rpg i played in awhile people who complained about grinding in this game must have never played any final fantasy game i know im late but i just got this game and am having fun the grind is part of the fun christ on a bike i hope you dont pop up on my recommendation list again this video is unwatchable because of the shouting hes doing the crikey dance like arlo said im trying to like this game but i really dont the writing is just awful and cringy to me i also dont like how the npc characters dont acknowledge that you have other characters with you doing the fighting with you that really annoyed me what this tells me is the market is starving for a good turn based rpg despite what developers tell us thanks for clearing my doubt youre the best keep it up galdera is annoying dont care spoiling i just hate its guts about that grinding thing i never had to grind except once for the most part my party consisted of ophelia cyrus therion and tressa swapping tressa for whoevers story i was doing i also focused on specific characters after completed my partys second chapters the only time i had to grind and am still grinding for is that sidequest not gonna spoil anything of course the game is good popular players are just bad bro let them know that you can play a demo its 3 hours not going to lie i am not big into turn based games but this game is absolutely amazing i like the story so far from the demo and the old school graphics also with hd graphics together its amazing i cant wait to get the full game keep up the good work man your take on octopath made me want to try it good thing i did okay ive been avoiding this game for awhile now now youve convinced me to pick it up i just got a switch and cant wait to play this game cocktopath sucker this is either just my stupidity or the game didnt give me enough warnings so for most of the game i had 1 team that i only used and only swapping characters out for story stuff so i was very unprepared for the true final boss stuff the 8 boss rush were fine but then the main battle was an absolute wipe for me plus the highest level place is like 55 or something when i need to be at level 70s also not being able to save after the 8 boss rush really is a mistake on the developers as the final boss is such a grind to go through and having to fight the bosses all over again for another shot is just an absolute slog issues get off youtube the game is prestige af there are no issues if you dont think theres issues then dont bring up other peoples issues tf dunkey is an idiot he played probably an hour and wanted to bash on a game because he losses in fortnite on the daily dunkey is not credible hes a whiney baby that rages over anything i kind of understand what people are getting at the formula they used for the ch 1 sections for each character was extremely similar and while each storyline was unique it was dungeon boss rinse repeat with a fairly similar initial theme for all characters except therion ch 2 was much better along with the sidequests and actually being able to go to some inaccessible dungeonscaves did i have to grind yes but i did so in those hard dungeonscaves that are scattered around on the map they even have their own bosses and several chests with some nice items if you decide to grind elsewhere it is slow and tedious hence the dungeons with their own bosses which makes for a sweet challenge since they also give an item once they are defeated plus secondary jobs omg yes no longer is ophelia just a healbot with some light moves that are hardly handy and those special skills if you put every character through each secondary jobs and choosing skills that best suit the ch i bought the game because of youre review i love this game so much the random encounters remind me of pokmon lol i feel like this game is deeply influenced by the saga frontier games for the playstation arrg you chiter at first i was reluctant to buy this game it is now easily among my favorite games of all time i didnt have to grind either and the battle system is so fun and fast paced that i dont mind anyway the only thing i would like is for the stories to connect more later on in the game great video very downtoearth you seem so excited to do the review the game glad to see that someone at least spent a lot more time with the game for a better and longer review with all the good and bad in the game ive seen some reviewers complaining a lot about the graphics issues like the brightness the dungeon black screen bars and a myriad of other things especially the options to turn them on or off or lack thereof entirely im still on the fence about buying this game personally but i will definitely keep an eye on it and check the reviews as they come in i feel that it would be waaaaay too complicated and difficult to make all the characters interact or talk to each other because this game was made for multiple and different playthroughs so maybe we didnt get it because it would be too hard to make that possible but maybe some dlc would be a good idea to fix that issue like maybe 3040 more hours of gameplay where after you finished all the character stories where after everyone finishes there adventures they all come across each other because they figure out the truth behind all their problems and somehow there connected by a high up enemy and they all have to work together and help each other to defeat the main enemy behind everything that happened what do you think of that whats your opinion on the way haanit talks you said this is your favorite switch game i just bought this for 48 at best buy and im already stoked not sure why you would make this video of negative stuff 80 hours into the game and its one of my all time favorite games i totally agree with your rebuttals so wait instead of cutting parts of the video of you praising the game you cut parts addressing the issues i feel like you were just trying to make people buy the game i bought the switch for this game d theres issues nah i dont think so pretty much what i get from these reviews is that the game starts out real slow and starts to pick up after 10 hours i like to think the other characters are just waiting in town while i complete the chapter for each character wow thank god youre not shouting anymore like this stop screaming best lines from this game i appreciate it reeealllly my blade is unbending maybe i am a fool but trust is a sentiment that i want to believe in and its one worth fighting for and of coursethe peacock shall strut ok you seem to have a screaming phase please dial it down good review tho your exellency you are how i imagine people who write everything in caps genuinely panicked when this came up in my recommended after receiving my copy today play final fantasy if you want a fun rpg end of story this is the worst game ive ever played the only thing what make me happy is that this a beautiful old school style game with modern mix of 2d3d spites graphic not the fact that this is square enix and please stop creaming this is horrible are you a kid or what dislike for screaming why does everyone care so much if he shouts just stop complaining i like this dude keep shouting bro probably my favorite game ever its grindy i like to explore in games like these but it eventually gets really annoying when random encounters happen every other bloody step why cant you stop and read the comments regarding your volume levels and you screaming why not just take the criticism and stop shouting its like you do it on purpose at this point dragon quest iv has a layout similar to this where each story is separate until they are all combined in the last chapter its fucking called octo path not one path when you do have to grindjust use the time to play with different game mechanics and different setupsjobssupport skillsetc ots grind is fun the peacock shall strut sold it therion is an edge lord thats why octopath traveler is the best rpg game ive ever played final fantasy 7 is a close 2nd super mario rpg is 3rd as far as leveling in this game goes for each character in each chapter on the world map it shows the level recommend you should be at i have the volume almost all the way off jesus the yelling lol this was my 2nd time visiting this video i did watch this video in the first week and because of this video you really did help with my decision to bought octopath traveller but i dont immediately played the game after bought it because i still finishing other games in my collection now after theres no video in youtube i visit this video again to check you caught me something very interesting not only the character change dress after had 2 jobs they also had their jobs dialog in their own voice raised the peacock in cyrus voice lol i never noticed that therion sucks cyrus being a dancer is the natural order if things 8 path traveler it all makes sence now a truly phenomenal experience this will be one of the top turn based ive played for years to come dude i live your stuff your reviews are amazing and if im about to drop money on something i see if you did a review first because its genuine thoughts heads up away journey to the unexpected is coming out soon hit that up and let me know why are you shouting were sat right here best jrpg in years i actually hated the 8 stories but i loved the gameplay and i loved the post game story but they could really do some more interesting and more interacting 8 stories wood hawker if u love the game i dont understand why would u have issues with it i died when that donkey guy came in screaming he sounds like a puppet looooool i understand because i make my subordinates call me your exellency this and breath of the wild are the two best games on switch cant wait for the next installment my primary problem with the story is very related to the initial story the game feels empty and gamey in the first chapter none of the characters seem to have a reason to be partied in fact being partied seems to contradict their goals they are all going to different ends of the continent for chapter two except a couple of them i get they need help but the pacing makes the story itself feel like a grind had to click off immediately the screaming is just ridiculous is the switch worth buying i am thinking of getting one 90 is too expensive on the eshop whos with me i love this game however it really is a grindfest if you wish to complete the final boss battle after completing all chapter 4 stories my highest level character is still 30 levels too low for the final boss i in no way skipped around too often missing out on xp i felt really overpowered by the time i finished up all the stories and i have the best gear in the game i kept going and got 1 shot by a side quest boss which is said to be much easier than the final boss sooo yeeaaaa just finished the game myself and i can relate to a lot of thee issues the character do not interact with each other the witty dialogues between them can hardly be called interaction why they travel together makes no sense why the caracters with high moral values olberic and cyrus tag along with therion to steal dragon egg makes no sense the game is indeed octopath meaning eight separate paths i didnt once feel like i was playing one amazing story involving 8 characters i felt like i was playing 8 good stories im not saying you shouldnt like the game as i liked it myself but they def dont interact at all which was very weird it was my 2nd game on switch and in a sense i bought a switch for it and zelda but man it didnt live up to the hype beatemups love your reviews your excellency gosh this was one amazing game that i didnt like i have to agree with dunky random freaking encounters am i the only one that didnt enjoy the demo so didnt end up buying it the beginning was just so slow and boring even 2 hours into the demo i love games like this but i just couldnt get into it i heard it gets better later on but the demo didnt hook me in why is he yelling at me awesome game my only complaint so far is that i found the english voice acting very corny and annoying especially during battles but you can switch it to japanese which imo makes the characters seem more natural anyone who thinks this is a grind fest game has never played persona im still bitter you dont like xenoblade 2 i have put as many hours in xc2 as i have persona 5 if that tells you anything psh this doesnt even compare to bookworm adventures deluxe cringe my biggest problem in this game has to be the level gatekeeping the game does it claims to give you freedom but then gate keeps you from accessing later chapters if youre too low a level for the random incounters just use cyruss skill evasive maneuvers i skated around a level 50 area being only level 20 without getting into any random battles had to take it really slow though and save often lol dislike for click bait my problem after playing for a few hours is the amount of random battles every 2 steps its a new battle now im thirsty for dr pepper stop yelling interesting thing on the your excellency ophillia when talking to josef the your excellency dude before she sets off on her journey they are having a heart to heart and she ends up calling him father for the first time in the game made it super impactful for me anyways so the meme actually had a point cool will give it a go on y recommendation isnt this made by the ones who made bravely default the grinding starts when you gotta prepare for the true final boss i guess well well looks like i have to buy it too many good reviews damn im buying nintendo switch becsuse of the following reasons 1 octopath 2 zelda 3 mario odyssey the end lol play bravely default best final fantasy game in years why and when in the development of this video did you make the artistic decision to yell the entire script did you think your mic was broken nice videl i just start the game but i dont know how to rsolve secondary quest i have only one issue with the gameits not on pc the peacock shall strut why should you have to wait 10 hours until characters build relationships imagine if it was the case in golden sun and how lame it would have been when you have a large party its especially important to show how characters interact to be able to understand them i have a ps4 and really want this game i cant afford a switch so glad he acknowledged xenoblade 2 cause the flood gates of angry comments including myself may have opened love that he shouts cause it shows his passion dont change who you are also curious how this game compares to chrono trigger this game going for 30 on eshop is a fkin steal such a good game i finally bought this game from amazon after watching a review from youcause i love rpgs to deathmy favorites are tactical games however i cant get into persona i mean just make an hour video and leave it whats with this oh an hour is too ling must escape to 15 min length lol pulling out the fire emblem banter scenes thief talk about a bargain respectively with the only party alongside the main thing i dont like about this game is that the only way you can make your characters stronger is levelling up and buying new gear i would love it if you could upgrade gear and skills also i think it would be awesome if you could get different materials from different areas which you could use to craft new gear it would just make progression feel a bit less linear doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over again to just level up is so boring and theres no variety also i havent completed any of the stories yet but ive done three of ophilias chapters and basically nothing has happened its so boring am the story so far is literally just read pointlessboring dialogue and then fight a boss nothing else seems to happen my opinions on the characters arevaried i think ophelia is annoying and has little personality i think cyrus is pretty annoying so far but ive only played his first chapter which was kinda dull i think therion tries too hard to be i think turn base rpg are perfect for the switch square enix made a damn near perfect game they dont need to change anything i absolutely love this gem of an rpg i love how gamers these days call anything they have to work for grindy give me a break 845 stares at romancing saga 1 and mostly at 2 want to avoid too much grinding then get all your characters and rotate them when your playing their stories kill any caits you find and go to higher level dungeons you actually have to grind to be able to beat the secret final boss being avalable after compliting the normal stories before fighting against this final boss there is also many information about characters from the stories of every of your 8 main characters and now with a connection to each other beatemups i just came across your channel and really like your content so far one criticism thoughplease stop yelling it is so freaking annoyingany other commenters agree with me im not gonna lie im only in the first chapters and thats the problem i had i havent seen any reviews but i do plan to finish the game tho just got it this week im confused july you loved it it was the best and august its a boring game damn man you gotta be an actual spokes person aye if you look at ot as a 1 char game control the main char is what im meaning instead of an octopath game you wont like it that was my flaw thus why i didnt buy it however finding out all of that makes me slightly intrigued edit ah you literally say that oops omg i was about to make cyrus a dancer cause im missing darkness element in my party xd im 20 hours into this game and ive done almost nothing but grind and steal and i love it i wish i had this game octopath for smash please straight up only bought this game because of your review xd awesome game was anybody able to get the wisdom from the shrine of the starseer archmage warbringer this video makes me want to buy this game even though it wasnt that interesting to me before i like rpgs but some of them get vet slow and grindy and that bothers me a lot but i might try this one one of this characters are going to be in smash as square enix rep i love this game but i do have a few problems 1 i wish that your inactive party members experience would go up as well like in persona probably only about 2030 of what your active members get but its just that if i have a team that i really like then the other four characters are going to stay at level 5 while everyone else is level 30 2 i would decrease the amount of random battles by maybe 10 i like the fact that they dont show up on the screen while youre walking around but i sometimes feel like im walking around for less than 10 seconds before another enemy jumps out of nowhere this also sort of puts me off getting treasure chests because 99 of the time there is an enemy waiting to ambush you near them and sometimes i just want to explore and get to where i want to go 3 the game severely punishes you for not having therion in your party he is able to steal items from pretty much every single character in the game plus hes the only one that can open the p 430 im not sure youre going to see my comment but you are wrong there it was done before look up live a live a jrpg exclusively release in japan for the snes clickbait its same like saga games what are you expect people never play saga series huh i came from dunkeys video people here commenting that hes yelling because they cant support dunkeys arguments my big problem with this game is how it flows and the combat feels too grindy after first 10 hours just made it to chapter 2 and i am struggling to want to play it more the grind comes in post game to be able to defeat the hidden bosses next time give a spoiler warning i would really really love to play that game but where i live nintendo switch is very expensice i mean like very much so i hope i could buy it in the future and so i can play this very good game the grinding starts when you have 3 ch4s complete the interactions are just so uninteresting and has no chemistry between whoevers talking whatsoever everyones just lol haha ur the apothecary u make medicine or haha ur a dancer u must be good at wiggling ur hips every 20 seconds not to mention as individual characters theyre not great either yeah this game is not grindy in fact levels dont do a ton for your stats equipment is super important for the most part bosses can be defeated by playing smarter why are you shouting dude you make interesting videos you seem really sincere and knowledgeable but please for the love of god stop shouting it makes you very difficult to listen to with such an amount of characters some of them might not be used once their story is finished something that could be interesting to see would be if the developers did something in the style of 4 heroes of light where some characters get cut off at certain points of the story eg a b c and d get split up where a and b meet e while c and d meet f before rejoing at the endgame that way there isnt a problem with too many characters in one story while still having that interaction there is nothing to be surprised about considering the success squareenix had with their games on the 3ds with games like bravely defaultsecond and multiple dragon quest ports i will get this gem at a later stage currently still busy with my backlog of other games grinding in this game isnt necessary you can pick up all the characters go complete their chapters and hit a couple of caves and side quests go to areas that are higher level than your characters you dont really have to grind unless youre trying to catch a cait they make it easy to skip character interactions so that is optional as well you can pretty much play the game the way you choose to most of my complaints are minor over all we really enjoyed octopath traveler and hope to see another continent of this world in the future dude there was just a toilet ad in the middle of your video you need to discuss that placement with youtube lots of stock left at softmap in akihabara a few days ago looks like a great old school style game i love you and your channel but come on the wii u wasnt a travesty it was just poorly brandedmarketed we both know we loved that console and there was plenty of pure gold to be found on it it wasnt the next generations n64 like i believe the switch will be but just like you skipped the snes a lot of this generation skipped the wii u i got a switch just for octopath traveler i cant wait to get this game the amounts of voice cracks lmao anyways thanks to you i get to know that this game exist slow claps for acknowledging the xenoblade review literally watched this video as i was grinding because my hannit was level 11 and the rest of my party was level 40 when i got to her chapter 2 i have 2 major issues with this game i guess im alone in feeling like these are problems does no one else care about these problems or is it just me 1 no exp share system i will explain in great detail why i see this as a problem below 2 while all the other chapters have staggered level requirements to give a good flow all chapter 4 quests are exactly the same level so after you complete 1 or 2 of the chapter 4 quests the rest of them become completely trivial in difficulty and feel more like a chore then overcoming the characters ultimate challenge in any rpg you can expect to get more characters then you can use in combat at a time and normally its fine to just pick your favorite characters and ignore everyone else but octopath essentially has 8 main quests so there are times when you have to have a particular character in your party i was generally fine having 3 of the 4 people from my a team carry the one person who was 20 levels below their recommended l your excellency i just played barely an hour and a half on octopath and i sincerely adore the game as far as your excellencys yelling is concerned i absolutely find it excellent and i do mean it though the repetitiveness on the word excellencyexcellent is an intended pun as i cannot scream it out in this text best regards from poland random encounters are a leftover from a time when it was technically impossible to have enemy sprites on the overworld they add nothing and in fact interrupt exploration and the pace they really dont add anything i still love many rpgs with them but lets not defend absolutely everything in the games we like if we want them to be good i actually hope for battles so i can upgrade i know i am going to win so i welcome the battles so basically this game is awesome and people are babies it sold well and its one of the best titles on switch and best titles ever period i love octopath traveler im still replaying it the peacock shall strut its pretty expected for dunkey to not like the game since he hates hates jrpgs with a few exceptions please stop yelling xd really this game sold out i didnt have that much trouble getting it its not the best switch game breath of the wild is better my issues is that you have to level grind for possibly hours in some parts which is annoying and sidequests are also so vague that i need a guide on how to do them it can also be difficult to tell what equipment is stronger and i usually need a calculator just to find out which is a hassle i like ophelia she voices shantae and sounds like her yeah the characters have seperate stories im not even sure why the thief tags along since hes the kind of the guy who works alone xenoblade chronicles 2 had nice cutscenes but i dont like the combat 807 you could have edited that better the peacock shall strut 1210 the peacock shall strut lol love rpgs but have never been a fan of jrpgs even though ive never played one not even final fantasy just never appealed to me after this review i think im going to pick it up today and give it a shot i feel like the interaction thing is kinda bad its like theres a chance that you can an interaction i just wish that allies could have lines on the over world or have comments on other allies attacks and the grinding i never like but i feel like the grinding is needed to make the game more longer i just wish i wasnt so impatient i am a grindy person i always get to lvl 20 before leaving destiny island in kh its not coz i want the game to be easy its coz i want all the cool abilities and skills to play with i like doing my levelling early so the story doesnt halt occasionally while im playing but i have dont 0 grinding in octopath traveler the world is just so fascinating and beautiful that i tend to level as i wonder round and explore places at no point have i felt ive stopped to do nothing but level up im honestly loving it bravely octopath what i cant hear you youre speaking too loud oh my god janet stop shouting 8 individual stories surrounded by a single overarching themeplot still playing but so far the secret relgion and destroyed kingdom pop up alot this lowkey makes me want to buy octopath hm should i wait for an eshop sale what about saga frontier not an original idea more like they dusted off the old ip and reworked it into a new title dont get me wrong not hating just dont agree that its completely original and fresh if i ever snag a switch this will probably be one on the list of must haves people complain about random encounters ever played pokmon or final fantasy its in the name octo 8 path roadstory traveler they are traveling this game is so good dont knock it till you try it plzz 1kyw i accidentally challenged someone with olberic beated him and then saw that i needed him for a side quest even donkey said it himself that the whole point of a reviewer is constancy everybody knows how donkey hate jrpgs it would be surprising if he actually likes the game i put 30 hours into xenoblade 2 and it was still not good for me suikoden iii is similar to this in terms of its structure with character development radiant historia is similar to this in terms of its retro style presentation my point is that this is objectively a great game but depending on how familiar you are with rpg conventions i can understand how one can become jaded while playing this i played the original demo when i first got the switch you could pick one of two characters at that time and being a girl i picked the dancer character which turned out to be a euphemism for prostitute maybe 10 minutes into the demo her pimp attempts to rape her completely destroyed my interest in the game i mean dragon quest 4 did something similar but all the stories linked up in the final chapter in my opinion dq4 did the premise for effectivly i agree that i dont find octopath traveler interesting cause it just looks like a generic jrpg going for nostalgia and i love xenoblade chronicles 2 and cant wait for torna the golden country i absolutely love the idea of the game and cant wait to get it and play the full thing for myself it reminds me kind of alliance alive for 3ds which is similar but is more like one large story featuring these six or seven characters cant exactly remember what i loved about that game is that you got to see a new side of each character by playing not only as them but seeing how they interact with the others in the different aspects of the story and i look forward to octopath being something that is similar and expands upon that the clash of the sprites and the background imo are just odd and sometimes i found the enemies to be a bit cheap sometimes but after all this time im still playing this because i cared so much of the characters and what they go through it felt personal and down to earth relatable in a sense and the music is the best part late to the party but discovered your channel today i agree with you i think some people are finding the game too formulaic its 8 medium stories about 8 travelers that meet by chance on the roads of a fantasy world and the whole game is build in this eightfolded way from the characters to the cities and areasso i can see how people can feel its too artificial but it didnt bothered me in fact it reminded of a game i played on the snes romancing saga 3 a strange game where you choose one character among 8 at the beginning and can recruit other characters in the world to justexplore you can ignore the other starting character if you encounter them later and recruit other seemingly random characters and the overarching story while it exists is told exclusively through exploration random npc dialogues items dungeons and boss themes and looks with almost no cutscene in that regard octopath traveler is this concept pushed a little further and fleshed who was your protagonist mine was alfyn and i never regretted it because of last stand and amputation jrpg griding no surprise there so some reviewers are lazy imagine my shock can someone tell me what happens when you lose a battle do you just go back to your last save you have convinced me i will be buying this game if the characters interacted a little bit more during the stories this game would be godtier chaos rings 3 is better tbh the only part where i truly had to grind is spoilers before the gate of finis therion is best boy just talk buddy just softly speak i love dunkey he explains really well in one of his videos about how disagreeing with someone on a game shouldnt be a big deal because one of the main strengths in a youtuber like dunkey or beat em ups is the consistency they offer whereas a larger review site like ign is just all over the place i still feel the lack of actual character interaction a negative there is literally no reason given for why these characters would join together especially egregious for therion and primrose i still love the game and i enjoy the individual stories and i think that trying to make the stories joined up would leave to a narrative mess and would lead to a lessing of the individual stories so i understand why they did what they did and think that it serves for great individualsl stories but i cant help but struggle a little with the suspension of disbelief for them traveling together i just threw the game aside olberic chapter 3 spoilers olberic chapter 3 beat the lizard boss had to fight old friend guy lost game over back to last save before the fcking lizard fight absolute crap as i didnt even have the chance to save crap idk i just cant do characters that arent interesting i get your points and stuff but these characters are just not interesting to me i suppose you can love it and im glad big companies might work with nintendo now thats great love it its a shame that switch dont have even small amount of true old rpg personally in the demo the long boss battle i played was very repetitive and ive heard that there are bosses like that throughout the whole game i love the story bit ive seen but if every boss battle is really long then im probably not going to like it that much the constant wild encounters were annoying to so im even more scared to get it maybe it gets better though i dont know people talk about grinding as a bad thing ill never understand it this is an rpg what do you expect this is one of my fav channels and it always has high quality content but i had to stop the video because it felt like youre yelling everything lol my review of this game i love it but jesus even after all the grinding i do i still get slaughtered to the chapter 2 bosses need to buy another switch keep fighting with the wife over whose turn it is to play octopath at frist i didnt like it because of the 2d but then i tried the demo man was i wrong i loved the game im trying to get the game now i watch dunkey mostly for entertainment but i do like his interesting opinions sometime ill watch your videos angry joes and other reviewer videos before buying a new game my only problem with these types of games is that i massively prefer fun gameplay over storytelling its not a bad game or a bad way to create a game but its not something i would ever buy just because i cant find interest in a lot of the storys a game creates and if a lot of people are stopping before completing the first chapter than maybe the game wasnt as engaging in the first chapter if you stuck around for longer than you must actually love these games but if you leave than you just didnt care much for the story they were building up i think the random encounters is still an issue that you should just be able to toggle off yes it will stop you from leveling up but just turn it back on when you need which is why i say toggle its not hard to just bind it somewhere braverly default has a random encounter chance which makes it a lot better for people who do and dont prefer this i do think the dialogue isnt to badits not bad at all it just wasnt someth i understand the point the dev trying to do but still the world seems pretty lifeless i dont know if i use the correct word but let me explain here statement below contains spoilers at the chapter 3 of therion and olberic occurred at the same town and each event doesnt seem to be an event that people in the town would forget so easily but the story or even the npc never mentioned those events like its never happened and at the post game dungeon it never mentioned again how 8 characters come as a group as far as i understand each chapter happened individually and never crossed another but somehow in the post game dungeon or the true boss fight dungeon they are all together without any context which is kinda annoyed me i dont mean that i hate octopath but theres something i just dont like about it see maby they should have released the dragonquest 11 on a handheld 2d version 1million copies of octopath are u hearing that im here for the shouting wow someone else who actually gets the point of the story in octopath thank you for this you have no idea how much it has bothered me that every other reviewer makes that comment that thumbnail is too much your excellency this game is damn near perfect my personal opinion about the game it started as an amazing trip to my past i loved everything about the game then it got repetitive i didnt mind it in the beginning but at some point all stories became more of a chore than an interesting and involving new chapter so that leads us to the end when i got frustrated and almost hated the game so to the details 8 characters on an adventure they are interacting or not whatever when they do interact it doesnt affect anything it doesnt mean much its like a trivia from the loading screen in other games every story in the game plays out the same you come to the city have a bit of a talk then you go to the dungeon fight the boss and have mini finale of the story nothing affects the world nothing affects other characters the huge surprise was when i finished the last chapter of my main character and got the final credits i couldnt believe it i had like 4 more bosses to go but anyway i got really frustrated with the same party as me expect i went ophila h annit therion cyrus still need a couple charcs went into lvl 2 story with only unlocking 5 charcs it was a challenge for a little while but yea this game is def not a grind fest its always good to find different perspectives of your own ocotopah traveler is a great game but it has his flaws personaly my biggest issue with the game is that you got stuck with the first character you pick until finishing hisher chapter 4 that kinda mess with the whole point of having 8 different stories hapening at the same time with no one being more important than any other and thinkingh about gameplay this stuck character in the party might impair the experience of changing characters every chapter when i started the game i was planing to always keep the 4 chacters with lowest levels in my party to change the party every chapter to not fall in the monotony of jrpg staple fights but with the first pick always stuck in the party is impossible do experience the game like that not to mention tha fact that you might potentialy pick a first character you dont like and just realized you have to keep it always with you after the 5th chapter one then you have to choose between reset a 67 hours save or keep playing for 30 tried the demo but soon after firing it up i knew it wasnt my piece of cake its great to see a third party game with big selling numbers i hope there will be more develeopers getting interested in making good games for the system octopaths story structure isnt unique saga games and live a live has done the same thing i dont think that merits as a good point grindheavy i dunno where that idea comes from but ive had quite the opposite effecti didnt want to gain xp at some point because my lv 60 party already kills every boss in chapter 4 with almost no effort legit bought this game based solely on his original review of it loving it so far the people that complain about grinding what if you move around the map a little if you dont run away from fights and switch your characters every now and then at no point in the game should you ever be underleveled and in the necessity of grinding i can say this because thats just what ive done i just roamed around every new area i found looking for the chests or any alternate path tackling any random encounter that popped up and what not and at no point during my very long gameplay have i felt ive been behind because my numbers are low heck even when i found myself overwhelmed by a boss all i had to do was change my party a little put more tought behind my strategy and boom problem solved the only kind of enemies that could requiere grinding would be the secret or side bosses those huge mofos with thousands and thousands of hp that can attack aoe and 23 shot your whole party if not confronted wisely but heck thats the point of secret bosses testing your st 50 hrs in and absolutely loving the game my only major issue with it is the lack of a bestiary when im all out of a captured beast i would like to know where i can go to get more rn now i just have to guess same goes for the summons sometimes i have a great summon but when they leave the party i cant remember where i got them meh if i wanted to play an excellent jrpg id go play the original golden sun oh man bet you cant wait to actually beat the game and see the ending my main party is haanit protagonist therion ophilia and cyrus your excellency 017 1 in every 20 switch owners have bought this game but bro you got 2 copies great video tho dont really like it that much either are you going to criticize it because you have a low attention span like with xenoblade 2 i do really enjoy octopathwithin the first four days of buying it i put in about 36 hours but one of my problems with it is that some of the stories are boring while others are amazing for example tressas story started off decently but in her chapter four they just placed in a random chick to steal her notebook just for a boss fight her reasoning behind taking it isnt even explained you just take the book watch the next cutscene and then boom storyline done meanwhile stories like cyrus and primroses are engaging enough to be their own games or maybe even shows they keep you invested throughout each chapter and have a valid reason for each boss fight like primrose and the crows or cyrus and the demonpeoplethings ophilias story on the other hand is boring up until the end of her chapter three with her boring pilgrimage getting interupted by a rival religion however those are just nitpicks otherwise i think the game is amazing and one of my friends bough thumbs up for unsullied why are you shouting to the camera stop yelling the game is nostalgic honestly the story is bland but still its a good game and that lord of the forest was one of the toughest to beat in chapter 2 ive been debating between mario oddessy and breath of the wild for the game i buy first for my switch but im honestly thinking about getting octopath ive spent many a summer playing rpgs on my gba and this just looks fantastic m y b l a d e i s u n b e n d i n g heres the main issue i have with the gameits nonlinear i think that developers believe they need to pander to this current generation of gamers that are used to open world make your own unique experienceand that linearity somehow doesnt allow that the problem with this is that turn based rpgs usually require a structure in order for their systems to work properly part of what i enjoyed about a game like final fantasy 5 is that new spells were gated you had to reach a point in the game and buy it from a shop then you also had to unlock the ability within the jobclass in order to be able to carry it over to your other class this was all appropriately scaled to the progression of the story new bosses had different strengths and weaknesses which required a bit of strategy octopath doesnt really require much strategy at all you just equip your secondary job and can almost instantly have access to half of their abilities you have a multitude of ways of breaking th people complaining about grinding must have never played rpgs before in their lives all rpgs require extensive grinding i dont know if a single rpg where you are not required to just fight random enemies to level up your characters thats just part of the genre and if you dont like it dont play it i havent found it grundy yet i did get bodied by the chapter 2 difficulty spike tressas boss he was hitting me harder than i could heal or break but i went away did some side quests and bought new gear gained a few levels and took him out with a nice level of difficulty the only thing i can see people calling a grind is levelling inactive party members a complete game sold i definitly bought it finally found a physical copy today super excited to play why are u screaming why are you yelling at me havent played a jrpg since the ps1 days but this game makes me want to get back into them the visuals are amazing i need to make cyrus a dancer oml if people are complaining about random encounters then it is clear they havent played any of the older jrpgs that was pretty much a staple in the genre for a long time i will admit i have had to grind a little here and there but not really too much that it got annoying i also liked exploring different dungeons and that is where i would get my grinding apart from that choosing not to fast travel has pretty much handled my leveling up i am giving the demo another try but there are things thag jusg dont keep me going i will try to finsih the demo first i slowly starting to like this game i finally finish the story of one of the characters and i would also like to address some of the complaints show here 1the lack of a main story this is still an issue to me livealive did something similar to octopath traveler many decades ago but it was still able to link all of it 7 stories and create an overall plot by end of the game i dont have too much to add about it besides the fact that i notice that there a evil organization behind the events happening in all 8 stories and that the lore of the world also establish some connections 2grinding in game grinding in this game is very easy and fast my party is tressa thief cyrus dancer ophelia apothecary and hannit warrior and waves of enemies in 23 turns after breaking the enemy one spell of cyrus is all i need to clear a random encounter also if the player doesnt want to deal with random encounters the mage and cleric classes have skills that lower the encoun to those reviewers who didnt get past the first chapter to quote brentalfloss after 12 hours your opinon is conjecture isnt the game supposed to be like a similar sort of concept like live a live where theres 8 characters with their own stories i dont see how anyone couldnt see that its 8 individual stories like around each characters chapter 23 alot of the characters end up in the same towns so it would make sense that therion is in x town creeping around ready to steal these dragon stones while another character lets say cyrus is trying to find information on this lost tome its like okay we have our own stuff to do but we are going to the same places so lets tag along and if we get into trouble we can bail each other out my problem with the game is 4 out of the 8 characters are underleveled so you have to lvl them up so half of the storys are slow and not fun because you spend so much time and money into characters that you dont want to use when your in boss fights you have 3 good ones and 1 garbage one an easy fix is not having to use the character the story is for btw the diolauge is crap and bosses are too op talking xenoblade chronicles 2 just start it and its true slow start but get better after a small farm and some patience xd its second party actually love the game still currently playing it however it sometimes annoys me when i come up against certain monsters and there sprites just look awful but has nobody else got a problem with the final fantasy 6 graphics i mean everyone goes on about how beautiful this game is but i just dont see it with 90s ps1 graphics and everything looks edgy even ff7 graphics where massively better than this wood pls send me a switch i have no money and wanna play this game and zelda only issue ive had with this game is a stupid annoying brightness bug i change the brightness then it resets to default every time i enter a different area anyone else have this problem octopath traveller follows the same formula of saga frontier for ps1 havent played it yet but will do if you want to know the whole story in saga frontier you have to finish the game with each character 8 freaking times not boring at all go check it out it looks kind of interesting but i cant see it being worth 60 i watched yahtzee compare it to ff6 which was a great game maybe at some point ill pick it up 1000 i only have the demo version of octopath traveler and i have played almost all of the 1st chapters only primrose left i only have had to repeat ophelia and cyruss boss fights in my experience i had to change my strategy on both to finally beat the bosses however while i did grind a little with cyrus to ensure i could get better equipment and a new skill i honestly do not think i could have tackled ophelias boss with her alone i used hannit to help her this showed me that while this game does have a good focus on strategy and learning the ropes it may not be as random as it seems some characters do not appear to be strong enough to tackle their bosses solo i beated tressas boss fight while tagging with olberic dont think i could have done it without him what do you mean it has not been done before go play dragon quest 4 ugh i dont get it this game doesnt look interesting at all i think those sales have more to do with the lack of exclusives for the switch what else are your going to play xenoblade has also bee uninteresting thus farbut i will go back to it when i can i guess storytelling in this game is the biggest problem its a lackluster clusterfuck helpful video to help me make my choice on buying octopath also looking good i started with therion and ran with haagit to victors hollow at like lvl 11 and managed to steal the sword with 152 atk and 80 crit easiest start ever my main gripe with dunkys review is not that he didnt like the game everyone can like and dislike whatever they want thats how life works my main issue is that if you have watched dunky before he has stated that he doesnt like jrpgs yet in this review he didnt state that general dislike and he just flat out said the game was bad not that it wasnt for him that it was just bad so while people who know him will understand that he doesnt like jrpgs and take his opinion on them with a grain of salt newcomers who are just looking for reviews of the game to decide whether they should pick it up or not will see that dunky has a lot of views on his review and if they dont go to other sources possibly assume the game just sucks why do you only do nintendo videos now wel a large majority of your videos are switch shouldent take 10 hours to the game to fix a problem i hate when someone says they have an issue and some just says well if you go through however long the game is good you shouldent have to get through bad stuff before a game gets good biggest question is when your channel stops with these outrageous controversial clickbaits dammit i really really want this game play saga frontier d square enix games doing well isnt that amazing tbh so far is not grinding at all as normal jrpg or rpg has to grind level very good points and yes i dont get why people are complaining aboutthe stories not coming together its called octopath for a reason like saying the game sucks because of that is unacceptable its a dumb reason to bag on this game the peacock shall strut if you guys wanna minimize the time it takes to beat bosses have tressa have the runelord job have ophilia be a scholar have primose be a cleric and the last one can be whoever you want i guarantee you will finish bosses so much faster why are you shouting hit the subscribe button and quickly hit unsubscribe if you are not being honest and doesnt include issues in your reviews how do we trust it you should judge a game for all and not just good stuff keeping your viewers in dark about the issues in a game is bad i tried the demo when the demo was released and to be honest i dont really trust the hype around octopath the graphics and overal quality are of that of an indie game but the game is being hyped like it is the next final fantasy well oke its a square enix game right that should be enough promise tho but i didnt got much exited about the demo still maybe it was because i still was playing xenoblade so i had other things to discover first and btw indeed i didnt even finish playing the demo yet tho so maybe this game has qualities in other areas that i did not focus on but overal im more of a graphics guy not such a big fan of pixel art games unless its made really beautiful but octopath looks a bit too simple if you ask me im a huge fan of games like risk of rain tho which look in fact much more simple lol dunno what it is i never take this guy seriously he never finishes the games he reviews he repeats similar things from other channels notice his video is never the first one out there his lame attempt at xc2 was embarrassing i feel like this happens with every squeenix title like genuinly people who didnt grow up playing jrpgs are reviewing them for a generalised audience and are nit picking about traditional jrpg elements in a fairly niche game its stupid or they know its popular and decide to have an opposing opinion for clicks and views and an active comment section or they really just dont like jrpgs or are part of the squeenix hate train therefore their opinion is moot i am setsuna and lost sphere got bashed too and while not as interesting as octopath still offered what people enjoyed about retro jrpgs 99 percent of the comments are why are you screaming octopath isnt a bad gameif it was released during the snes era but i am happy that a 3rd party game is doing well on the switch so that hopefully others will follow i purchased 3 copies 1 limited edition and 2 regular ones lmao one being a gift of course i played the demo and really enjoyed the gameplay but jesus christ the stories are so fucking bad theyre all so predictable and dull that it feels insulting to my intelligence is there a way to let squareenix know that there is an annoying bug in the game brightness slider in the menu is broken brighteness keeps resetting itself when you go from an area to another but the slider stays the same you can try to put in on the darkest optionthen go out the city and back and boom everything is bright again but slider still on minimum reducing brightness reduces the green or red shadows in some specific areas such as sunshade city however brightness doesnt stay how you set it altough in the menu the slider indicates otherwise so the brighteness resets itself and the shadows go back to greenred and its so annoying i hope they do something about it ive only had it for a day played for 8 hours so far and im in love with this game and i am not a huge jrpg fan only a handful of jrpgs that i fall in love with this is now one of them the only big problem i have with the game is that the protagonist you choose at the start is unable to be taken out of the party hannit is kinda overleveled because of it also i kinda ended up neglecting olberic so while everyone else is in the late 30s and 40s hes like lv 28 oops i am torn if i should get this game or not i played the demo somemore reading then anything the combat is fun no reviewers are really saying anyhting about the story depth now i get it its an rpgi love myself a great rpg story going in fresh but most been sayingits a good storythats like someone asking how big is gta 5 world to run around in and the reply is big how deep is this story deep does it really get you involved you can say alot without saying alot i did love ff10 i know its not close to ff from what i have been reading but how is the replay jrpg games tend to have that one run and done feeling is there anything that helps push you you to want to play more then one time in the game can not wait to hear back i am sooooo close to getting this game other then the questions i had keep doing the reviews the way tyou do i liked your genuine original review the peacock shall strut 10 hours i used 17 hours to get all the characters i really love this game but the voice acting for some characters was cringe inducing the biggest culprit was the huntress and her whole town i ended up switching the audio to japanese solely because of that storyline thanks for this video i love this game i love ys viii as far as switch games go ive come to see that my tastes align with yours cheers this is similar to vandal hearts released in 1996for ps1 boards on the window mail by the door what would anybody leave so quickly for ophelia where have you gone the old neighborhood just aint the same nobody knows just what became of ophelia tell me what went wrong chorus was it something that somebody said mama i know we broke the rules was somebody up against the law honey you know id die for you ashes of laughter the ghost is clear why do the best things always disappear like ophelia please darken my door guitar solo was it something that somebody said honey you know we broke the rules was somebody up against the law honey you know id die for you they got your number scared and running but im still waiting for the second coming of ophelia come back home instrumental outro why the f are you screaming problem for me isi dont care for the game never was a huge rpggood for square enix for the salesbut this looks like a small dev indie title so far to me and looks meh have people lost their volume button seems silly to be talking about shouting as this gent only has a loud voice also loving the game in short most socalled game journalists today are morons theyre reviewing games thay barely played grindgrindgrindgrindtext speechgrindgrindgrindat 60 hours i think i have had my fun and am ready to move oni enjoyed it but there is not enough variety there to keep goinggreat game though 60 dollars though for a 2d game ill wait i agree with donkey or what ever is his name the game sucks is just flat boring i trust wood and i never watch any other reviews i was always going to pick this up when i had the cash but this has cemented it for me and just to make you jealous i had some genuine octopath traveller food at the square enix cafe in tokyo the other week power up you should watch kingks video about this game its pretty good and he says what you said but in a sexier voice when there is bullshit like switchforce on youtube this channel is a breath of fresh air this dude may hype stuff up but he seems more honest to me in case you were wondering when he actually starts talking about issues it is at 311 i needed this video i was so uncertain about getting this game i wanted the experience but the bad reviews were kinda turning me off love your shirt wood so i see why people have the its a grind issue because i have it they didnt pick a main team im leveling all 8 characters at once so therion my main baby is higher leveled than the rest but i keep switching in the lowest leveled characters so they level up too i dont think the grind is still that bad i play games where i dont enjoy the grind cough wow cough but in octopath i like it i like having the ever rotating cast of characters learning how its bad to put two healers on your team because you werent thinking about damage and lack of weapons per round and i like when ive got therion throwing bp out to those who need it and just hitting really hard nobody will ever play the game the exact same was as someone else because there are so many branching paths im aiming for a complete completionist game here and im loving it grindbedamned its a good game i love the storyline im into chapter two now i cant wait to see what comes up f the peacock shall strut love your channel but stop shouting man you can be excited or passionate without being loud ive played the demo and now i dream to get this game i like it when reviewers actually play their games before reviewing them not watching reviews first was a good call too is that a caterpie behind you or a link you didnt even address why people dont like random encounters and instead argued against one other possible solution enemies being visible on the field isnt the only other possible encounter system i have something in mind but for reference here are some pros and cons off the top of my head for the two encounter systems in question random encounters pros can enjoy scenery to its fullest no need to avoid specific spots that would have enemies if the other system was used battles are often so you consistently strengthen youre characters cons constant battles get old fast especially against the same set of enemies makes minimal movement optimal to avoid encounters exploration becomes a chore so the player may want to move on without doing so causing them to miss out on treasure and scenery field enemy system pros 1 a reasonable set number of encounters per each area loaded 2 exploration is not constantly punished 3 player ca am i the only one that thought my focus is unparalleled would be the top comment rather than your excellency thanks for this video correcting some of the misinformation out there is very needed man if people calling octopath grindy i hope they dont play mmos lol xd maybe they should make the beginnings of games more interesting it shouldnt take 1015 hours for the game to get good im absolutely in love with this game im liking the game but im interested in some storys more than others but its a great game with amazing gameplay the peacock shall strutt this game is getting flack now but i bet in 6 or 7 years it will be on the same pedestal as earthbound ocarina of time undertale and the like or at least close to that type of fame or infamy depending who you ask beatemups your trash and a copy cat get fucked found this video because i just bought ot love your content man keep it up lol dunkey hates rpgs he enjoyed persona 5 though the peacock shall strut holy smolies guy or beatemups as you go buy lol fitting the repetitive flipping a d v e r t i s e m e n t s flipping a d v e r t i s e m e n t s flipping a d v e r t i s e m e n t s flipping a d v e r t i s e m e n t s stop yelling the game is beautiful but honestly all the characters are boring lol my favourite part of the game was the bit when you go to a town use your character specific ability and then go through a linear dungeon to face a boss im glad it only happens once rather than 500000 times or the game would get boring i have to beat the play through that im currently on and then go back and use a different team so that i get different interactions during the later chapters i have only completed 2 of the stories and already put in just under 80 hours yes i am addicted and in love with this game i thought this video was about technical issues i have noticed that this game makes my switch get really hot and the fan goes to max speed for several minutes if i play the game for a few hours doesnt happen all the time but ive noticed a few times already and this has never happened with any other game ive played xenoblade 2 or any jrpg 15 hours in is like pokemon before your first starter i watched dunkeys review then i watched your review i was very confused you guys are ridiculous about him screaming he is excited nothing wrong with that it is a fantastic game wondering to pick up this game or ys viii been playing octopath demo and already done all the female characters their own prologue going and adventuring out and liking it so far yo wood have you ever played bravely default this game is a work of geniuss ive only played the demobut mother of god its amazing i just started playing octopath and was worried about it but i truly understand your love for this game i also realize something about the your excellency repetition it has to do with respect and admiration in the story of ophelia and even though her adopted father thinks of her as a daughter she doesnt think she is deserving also the reason why she says it so much is that this comes from japanese culture they believe in respect when addressing their elders and i think that gets lost in translation for north americans im from toronto canada myself but ive watched enough anime and played enough games to understand that on the flip side however the dialogue itself not being bad with hannit the way it is written is slightly offensive to shakespear lol either way the stories so far are whole heartedly good and music is beautiful thats what i love about these type of rpgs the battle system is so much fun too once you understand the various mechanics to it i to i really enjoy your opinions on switch games i couldnt agree more with your perspectives your excellency because if dunkey i wasnt gana get it but this review changed my mind good stuff i found the game a bit slow i am not use to the turn based fighting any more favorite game is super mario rpg i feel like i dont have as much time as i did as a kid to read through all the stories and appreciate the game is it just me or did i think he was going to say one million likes i think the game is mad fun i had my doubts about it at first but now im about 45 hours in and barely halfway through the chapter 3s new game plus dlc opportunities a party story where they are all together perhaps the peacock shall strut wood why is it you just are yelling in every video i hate how you cant change the first character picked along with the fact that they dont tell you that you cant its a great game but none of the characters have a mc feel to them so i dont understand having a mc i like having all my party even leveled so having one op characters is kinda boring it might not be grindy now but after you beat the game youll need to grind all your characters to level 6070 ish i agree with what you said the issues i had with the game initially are not really issues in the long term character connections and so on once you understand why this has been designed this way it was simpler and more cost efficient for the team i mean can you imagine how they could design character interactions during the actual gameplay if you dont have the full 8 characters team also i think this is a smart way to save on costs which is probablye one of the required specs for this game to exist in the first place squareenix probably wanted to take low risk for this first exclusive so considering this i am ok with these concessions for the fact the game exists now their next games has to be more ambitious obviously to the guy saying the characters are not interesting i disagree these characters are simply not exaggeration of what we always see elsewhere most jrpgs have clich and waifu stupid references in octopath things are a little bit less stupid i love this gameim not too far in yetbut ophelia chapter 1 is soooooo boring re grindfest i actually thought i had this issue as well and then i realized that cyrus 1st trait reduces wild encounters once you disable this trait you level on pace and there isnt any real grinding required random encountersi really tend not to like them i dont enjoy having my progress interrupted suddenly and then forgetting which way im goinggoing one way and then turning around when i realise its wrong and then getting attacked again xd that being said i am playing some old jrpgs on ds and gba and because they are portable it makes a difference because it feels more like a casual game i can dip in and out of grinding is just a thing to do for 5 minutes to an hour to relax this is different on a home console however as the pick up and play nature isnt there and you cant just do it for example for a few minutes before you fall asleep at night or on the bus nice to hear this isnt grindy anyway so many people post reviews without completing games these days its not right if i want an initial opinion ill look for it if i want to see a review i want a holistic impression of a game imagine if somebody based their experience of a final fantasy game based on the first dungeon only or if a fighting game reviewer only played as half the characters its good that you posted your impression of xenoblade 2 and refused to review it that is fair at least this was how final fantasy was thats why i like the game because it brings me back to those good o days grinding and leveling up like this is fun games nowadays only last 610 hours graphics doesnt matter to me as long as the storyline is good i had people say this game isnt for them because of that reason graphics isnt everything wood there a lot of people on here telling you to stop screaming dont listen to them yell scream shout do it all it shows your passion and that is an incredible thing so let me get it you played a game it had good and bad things so you cut down the bad ones in editing do you consider this serious gaming review are you for real and pleasestopshouting im out looking for some real game reviewer bye why are you screaming im lovin octopath traveler i was shocked how addicted i was to this game thanks beatemups for the videos for octopath traveler a personal gripe for me is that a lot of the assets from the game do repeat themselves quite often a lot of time i was asking myself havent i been here before but still it is a must for oldschool gamers who grew up with the snes or who love oldschool rpgs ive detected only 1 issue while playing octopath my switch overheats like mad its the first time i ever heard my active cooling work people are crazy this is probably one of the best rpg games i have played and probably the second best game of the switch library at the moment i love this game funny you talk about dunkeys review of the game most of his vdeos are not really serious reviews but yeah he didnt like octopath one way or another there is this video httpsyoutubelg2dxobaxlit1m20s in this video he talked about reviewers and how there is always bias therefore he as said in the time i put shouldnt be taken seriously for lets say jrpgs as he doesnt like then since you did a follow up ill do a follow up too got about 14 hours logged which isnt much in the grand scheme of things but the stories for each character open up a lot after the 1st chapter and they become so much more cool in my eyes tressas story is my favorite so far her chapter 2 was awesome the grinding to get the characters up is still a problem especially if you start with a core 4 and wanna swap em out i tried with alfyn mostly and i just couldnt do it i didnt want to dedicate the time or resources which is fine i liked the 4 characters i chose so both my main issues kinda got resolved i guess but the problem of having the characters interact is a little weird it got to the point where i was thinking to myself do these characters actually interact with each other then i hit the chapter 2 sequences and the travel banter hit reminded me a lot of fire emblem awakening the way they did it so that also got resolved kind of still an awesome i really like the game for the first 20 hours or so but the amount of grinding for each story advancement was daunting yeah as long as you do all of the stories of a set of 4 characters one at a time for each level of story there is no artificial grinding why is he yelling my only wish was that i wished the traveler interactions were voice acted i would have loved to hear these traveler actually conversations vs reading them i would disagree with the hasnt been done before argument from dragon quest iv and wild arms prologues to arc the lad 4 and even a few other old games like live a live and 7th saga on the snes seiken densetsu 3 you could also make a comparisson that this fits perfectly as a new romancing saga even i love your energy and passion for this game bless i havent even bought my copy yet i havent even bought my copy yet i think you made the right decision by not watching other reviews before doing your own the whole wisdom of crowds thing only works when you can consider multiple independently formed opinions i like the way they have individual story arcs because it gives you the freedom to play how and with whoever you want for instance you can completely ignore haanit if you dont like the way she talkens octopath is definitely not a grindfest i have cyrus as a main and equipped the skill evasive maneuvers which lowers encounter rate and havent needed to grind up to chapter 4 at all that being said ive been playing chapters in order of levels next vid when beatemups have you seen this rumored switch game list and what you say httpsimgurcome8altm9 honestly like your videos but have you considered not yelling the entire time it genuinely feels harsh against my ears and i cant always bring myself to watch the whole thing i would of loved a chapter 5 where the 8 arcs combine the potential link is there already for some stories great video as always would be great for me at least if you could keep your voice down keep up the good work stop shouting already its nauseating im one of the owners of octopath traveler honestly being a guy who love rpgs but having a hard time finishing them because most of them cant keep me interested enough this game is perfect in alot of ways the only real gripe i have is the individual story progression you have to jump between so many bitesized stories that its hard to feel connected to the characters oh and the worst part about the game is the voiceacting for the 2 animals hgen and whatever its just some idiot making sharp loud noices way too close to the microphone making the quality of the sound drop significantly and making the speakers sound borderline busted lot of hate in these comments i like how vibrant and fun your videos are you have a lot of charisma octopath 8 path8 storywell at least its not false advertising please stop shouting for over 10 minutes straight oh my god it doesnt make your video more enjoyable or make yourself seem more pumped to record or more pumped to talk about what youre going to talk about it just makes the video tedious and headacheinducing to sit through for the love of god please stop shouting so much itll benefit you and your viewers tremendously in the long run omg octopath traveler is a playable sens8 your excellency is literally just to her father and makes it more significant when she finally calls him father great game and absolutely agree with everything in this video im beating the chap 3s right now and havent gotten any interactions yet do i need to be in the right place with the right characters there are octo individual paths i know you are a huge nintendo fanboy but thats what i want in a reviewer however you cutout the large problems with the game you were reviewing thats makes me feel like i cant trust your reviews edit but i really appreciate you making another video to address thisthats top tier made cyrus a dancer for the sole reason that i loved primrose and cyrus little banter where he told her he wished he could dance but he had two left feet dont let your dreams be dreams cyrus this reminds me of bravely default and they give you an option to listen to party chat with each other i always listen because i want to experience the story fully cant wait to play this soon so i have a question have you tried playing the naruto series on the switch lol na good vids homie ive never watched a non innertainong vid from here tbh its hard to tell if dunkey really likes a game because of his comedy style he played league of legends for years and always bagged on it lol doctor pepper not a sponser what do you stream on ok so im gonna give my honest and probably unpopular opinion real quick and get murdered for it since i am but a faceless person behind a screen this is my own fault in more ways than one but i just kinda lost interest the longer i played to start i overplayed the demo i played through it probably 6 or 7 times which is too much but oh well i loved what it had and i really wanted to beat an npc i didnt anyway once the actual game came out i continued on from where i last left off getting my party together and going from there but i already knew my favorites and didnt bother with the others until after my mains chapter 2s my other problem is i played it wrong extremely wrong like i had endgame equipment and jobs while i was in level 20 areas for story it didnt necessarily make it boring i still enjoyed the main partys story but thats another thing i wasnt emotionally invested in these other 4 characters i begrudgingly replaced one party member for anothe im sleeping on this game idk if i want this tho 60 for me is too much for a jrpg i understand keeping the 8 stories separate was a stylistic choice i just really hate it it felt really gimmicky and pretentious that said i still love the game overall the combat system is fantastic the leveling speed is just right and i like how the weakness system makes me feel really clever just for matching little shapes i think it would have been a better game if theyd just put in some real interparty dialog rather than just the weird isolated little asides but it has enough good in it for me to still enjoy and recommend it i hope its success sends a positive message about turn based rpgs we bought persona 5 too what does it take nice collection of the issues i love this game a lot my opinion about the issues story relation this one was a big one for me seeing primrose ride the carriage by herself to then arrive with a full party just felt inconsistent it would be great if they used therion to steal the carriage or olberichanitwfajwhatever to challenge the driver the stories could preserve their individuality even with a little more relevant interaction difficulty the game gets very easy at the end of each chapter i would have loved a little more scaling to keep constant challenge grind theres absolutely no grind in this game if you are good with strategy you can rush it random fights cmon that system is awesome one of the biggest issues for me the permanent party leader the initial character selection might be the most important decision you make in the whole game as you can never switch it it will become the strongest character no matter what and you will be obligated hate hate random encounters your excellency i dont believe thats true i watched your other video about octopath on friday night and i went to buy the game the yesterday morning i actually got the last copy awesome game no regrets this is an amazing game its a very original game plus its like having 8 rpgs in one game i want another octopath traveler game in terms of interaction between characters ive no real beef with it the banters are pretty funny however having each story leading to the one same goal at the end of the game somehow ive had to grind somewhat but for the most part its all about how you deploy your characters and tactics basic definition of an jrpg your face on every fucking thumbnail please stop i got it the day it came out and so far im really enjoying the game and theres not really any big complaints except i dont really like the side quests at the moment and i feel like there is a lot of places in towns where there are houses and people that are only there for scenery but other then that its a great game let him talk guys i got the game after your first video all i have to say is thank you lol fresh story its boring to beat the imperials or some kind of overlord every jrpg game the job system is really good i just dont like that the use of the 2nd job clothes are a must visuals sound are a dream sooo good ive never played a less grindy game in my life im finishing chapter 3 but the bosses have been easy for a genre veteran captions octopuss traveller hehehe im was so unsure about this game but now im addicted it gets better once you start unlocking more characters and more skills the bosses are so fun cause theyre challenging dunkey doesnt like rpgs though i dont watch his reviews of rpgs because i know he doesnt really get them and i get that im not mad at him for not liking them as we all have our preferences i just know i have a higher tolerance for problems in an rpg game than someone who hasnt grown up with the genres conventions how only ten hours through all the chapters ones im literally 13 hours in and only have 4 characters you gotta come up with better thumbnails they are so cringey a lot of the issues people have seem to be just blatant criticism for the sake of it it just really seems like some people want any jrpg to be bad a lot of the issues people have are fixed almost immediately or nonexistent at all the game isnt grindy in the slightest i only felt the need to grind for 20 minutes once in the entire game and thats because i completely went through each characters story once at a time ie i completed therions entire story before moving on to another characters story from ch2 onward and that definitely isnt the expected or intended way to play the game im just weird and the characters not interacting was a concern for me as well but that was fixed almost immediately after i got everyone when they started popping up with little skits like in tales it is totally understandable why this doesnt happen in the first chapters since it would be super hard to implement right at the beginning when the game is unsure if you have everyone everyone bought this game because theres nothing else to play on it yep ive only grinded once or twice thanks for saying that oh just wait until he gets to the final boss hopefully ill see you at game on expo next weekend please stop the clickbait titles i had to put the game down for a week because of working 15 hour days im excited to get back into it tomorrow god dammit i want this so badly but i dont have enough money heeeeelp i have plenty of issues with this poo game my team 1protagonist thief therrion 2 cleric ophillia 3 magicianscholar cyrus 4 warrior olberic you need to use all the characters as progression in the game takes place through chapter completions of each eight individual characters dunkey is basically a sony stooge on every video he talks about how good sony games are because they have no gameplay those thumbnails have been so cringy why is this longhaired man yelling constantly i hope thats how he talks to people in public there is not even one moment in this video where he is not yelling its interesting to see a person whose delivery is always yelling theres something really contrived about it maybe he should be a personality on the disney channel loving the game so far really wish it wasnt throwing back to the hidden passages behind walls that you have to turn while youre in thing to get some of the chests but when thats my biggest actual issue with the game its pretty damn solid for me but im only about 40 hours in just rounding out the chapter 2s huge jrpg fan here but really just wasnt feeling this game doesnt mean its bad its just not for me this was the same kind of anime plot twist that i felt when you hated on xenoblade 2 except i didnt change my opinion t h e p e a c o c k s h a l l s t r u t my gripe after playing the demo is the bosses are very huge human ones this also includes the bandits mobs when your enemies that are human that is huge than you i feel like my character disconnected from the game the grind people are running into with this game relies on whether or not you use fast travel dont use it and you never have to grind why dont reviewers know this this game is awesome if there was any complaint to be made its the side quests they dont really direct you very well thats my single complaint ive googled so many side quests now after spending hours just running around robbing everyone and knocking out everyone i could i just quit and moved to google thanks to everyone who made videos on how to beat those quests amazon fucked me so hard on octopath they sent me the wayfare edition twice opened with the coin and map missing and are refusing to replace it for a 3rd they fucked me so hard i lost it when the snorlax appeared me at gamestop do you guys have a red and blue switch in stock guy at the counter let me check yepp me and do you have octopath traveler guy at the counter let me see yepp me okay ill take both of those really glad you did this i was scared away from the game based on dunkeys review i might give it a shot now i love dunkey but i know rpgs arent really his thing talking against random enemy encounter in an rpg is like saying that action games are too fast paced or that sports games are too competitive its a freaking jrpg random enemy encounter is supposed to be there and thats one of the many aspects fans of the squaresoft golden era were asking for for a very long time not sure how you can say you only had to grind for 15 minutes i am using haanit and when i reached stonegard i had close to 15 hours in but was at lvl 19 still with her 2nd chapter recommending lvl 27 still xenoblade chronicles 2 octopath traveler for me octopath is good but the story of xb2 is great and i feel the characters have more personality and that you are connected with them theres no grinding if you play the game as its designed to be played but sure if you dont want to bother with the battle system and want to cheese fights you need to grind cant get over the retro graphics the graphics could have been much better glad its doing well cause i love square enix and maybe the next one will kick the visuals out of the park ok ive played all the first chapters so this is my experience so far the dialogue and cut scenes stand out as being far too long and quite boring im not super into the stories as none of them interest me that much however some that stand out are primrose therion cyrus and olberic it is not grindy at all unless youre bad im sorry i have no idea why people are saying that it does strike me as odd that there are even 8 people when their stories dont intertwine why have 8 in the first place if their stories are disconnected despite this it is a cracking game and definitely worth a go ive heard that the cut scenes shorten as you go on and that basically it becomes more enjoyable later in the game which is fair enough apparently this has 200 hours of game play so well see what happens not even my type of game but i went out on a whim and got this game im amazed beautiful graphics and such a rich story im so happy i decided to get it i have a friend who plans to do a solo character run tbf i love dunkey hes one of my favourite yootoobers but dunkey is pretty biased towards jrpgs should i buy a switch just to play this game i still have so many amazing games to finish on the 3ds and i was gonna wait for the switch price to drop but this game look amazing s plus one i just bought it and im waiting for it to be delivered the day after tomorrow d thanks now all i can think about for jobs now is that cyrus dancer the characters do not talk with each other in the first chapter because you can get them to join your party in any order the devs would need an impresive number of conditions and variables in order to make the dialog count so they focused the first chapter on each character so i do not see this as a negative thing at all i like you but you are a bit too shouty to watch all the way through sorry ive completed the first 3 chapters of all the characters and have not experienced them speak to each other even once how am i missing this you should make a video about your thoughts on hotel transylvania 3 for switch im gonna get mario odyssey first and then this when i get my switch main problem i had with the demo is that the two bosses i fought just took forever and that is because i had therion and opillia only and they where not the strongest people im trying to imagine you trying to get the thumbnail picture of yourself im happy with the 8 split stories they are nice quaint little stories that fit each character i feel like its refreshing you are not the chosen group to save the world from an over arching threat its nice to have a change of pace not grindy you have to level up 8 different characters just to complete their chapter and you arent allowed to stay with one team reminds me of golden sun maybe would play i t oh cool another video from the nintendo switch channel i can not believe you can make it through without grinding blows my mind id buy it but im broke and not working this summer the issue was that you made this video it can be grindy tho tbh idk y someone would knock this kinda game for that tho this game is worth the grind just based in music writing and aesthetic alone great video love this game but it can be grindy ot sucks i have played this game for over 200 hours completing it 100 and its one of the best games i have ever played in my life my issue with it is i cant stop playing it wana buy this game but its sprites will you review dead cells yet you still didnt addressed ot main story issueits always the sameget to a town hear a story go to a dungeon fight a boss repeat cycle 32 timesi mean i like the game im looking at 60 hours atm but i do feel its getting a bit repetitive combat system is great most of the stories are horriblegenericboring class system is mediocre especially the way you obtain secondary jobs very lazy and uninspired progression is just way too rinse and repeat start a chapter listen to garbage filler talking aka story for 1520 minutes and use your characters out of combat skill walk 10 feet away from the town to find a dungeon with a boss repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat i ended up just skipping haanits cutscenes because they were so awful i cant stress how uninteresting this game is out of combatthat being said i enjoy the combat so much i would still recommend the game and have had a lot of fun and put many hours on it its not a perfect game but its worth buying without a doubt this is a great follow up agree with much of what youve said here and andits exclusive that feeling when you see someone calling octopaths method of storytelling in a jrpg unique and you remember that youre in the minority of people in the west whove played games like livealive seiken densetsu 3 and the saga series granted he did specify that he meant unique to him but still more people need to check those games out because they are awesome and do basically what a lot of people were hoping this game would do in terms of story as someone who has kept olberic ophilia and haanit in his party most of the game all i can say is comen here thou blade is unbending you excellency player i hate random battle encounters tales of phantasia on the super famicom youre cute thanks for the video beatemups i didnt think i needed a clarification review or response review but it was just what i need havent bought the game because i was kinda on the fence with some of the issues you brought up i think the problem some people are having is that they are not really into jrpgs rpgs or into turned based games they bought it for hype reasons and didnt realize what theyre getting into im not a fan of the genre but having played the demo and having grown up playing pokmon and paper mario 64 i completely fell in love with the premise of the game sorry the grinding part is not true you have to grind in order to keep your characters at the suggested level am i the only one who doesnt have any problem with him yelling i dont like turn based combat at all i force myself to play turn based combat game i still complain about turn based combat whats wrong with me because im donkey it still wont be as good as knack 2 babbbyyyy the only thing that has me on the fence is how much of the game is gonna be story i dont want to read the game i want to play it saw dunkeys vid and based on his level you can tell he didnt get too far in the game 40 hours in and im in love with it it reminds me to the days i used to play chrono trigger seiken densetsu 3 final fantasy 4 5 and 6 etc etc etc i have to know because it was nigth and i was sleepy did you took down a video of youre that says i disappear and lets cheer the fk up or something like that only issue with the game is some frame rate issues docked but thats an easy fix i love this game to death i dont mind grinding im at level 42 with hannit and i havent even started her 2nd chapter yet yells the entire video to give the illusion of excitement dont know what the big deal about this game is found it pretty boring while most people were saying how much they disliked the game your review is the one that made me get it and ive been hooked on the game since also i love how cyrus actually tells primrose he wants to be a dancer and then i see you have him as a dancer if you want full freedom you cant have much charakter interaction i feel like octopath had a perfect charakter interaction for the freedom the game brings i love the game hate ur thumbnails if only i could get it so you recorded a crap ton of footage about your negatives of the game decide to omit all said negatives just to upload a post review video talking about the negative claims and spent the entire video defending said game from the negative opinions people had oh lol its called octco path because there are 8 different charactersstories you can take lol makes sense now i am loving this game flaws and all i might of been turned off alittle if the characters never once interacted in the game but the side interactions that begin to happen chapter 2 and onward put that to rest on the grinding bit i have never once in my 60 hours had to grind and i used different characters during each story part besides my main who is like 15 levels higher then everyone else i did die 3 times through the game once to alfyns third story boss and twice to random mobs that hit my party with massive aoe while i was trying to figure out there weak spots i still have some chapter 4 stories to finish as well as my runelord warmaster bosss to beat im also hearing about a secret boss i will have to go after looking forward overall its a very solid 810 in my books could always be better but here is hoping for a sequel congrats on the 1 million units sold whoo i found a copy yesterday last one left and bought it yeee all your fucking vids need to reach that 10m mark sigh i hope bravely third comes to the switch you have the worst thumbnail why make those face lol normal face will look much more interesting like its a trap subscribed keep it up man i really love your content great rpg but no masterpiece a masterpiece will arrive 49 not enough zanny face for me sounds like garbage and im not talking about the game the difficulty level spikes so high that the game becomes grindy i have a feeling that these people have never played a jrpg before may i introduce them to xenoblade or countless other games nah bro i love random encounter old school grindy turn based rpgs call me old school but im sad that turn based seems to be dying out if i had a switch id play the crap out of this till then ill stick with all the retro rpgs on my psp its awesome to see a game like this doing so well im glad you made a follow up i am loving the game so i was shocked by just how negative the honest game trailer was i know they criticize games on purpose but this one was brutal i ended up looking up the reviews and couldnt fathom why it was getting such subpar reviews i think your hypothesis on people not actually playing past the first chapter is correct man i want this game so badly i love this game especially the turnbased battle system but there are 2 flaws ive crossed one flaw is there is no central conflict that makes these characters travel together at first they simply travel together for no reason thats a writing flaw as there should be some type of conflict or other reason that makes them want to travel together my 2nd qualm is the games difficulty is not balanced a boss in one particular area 26 levels below my level mind you handed my to me otherwise i love it great follow up im glad you addressed the issues other people seem to be stuck on i have really enjoyed octopath traveler and the issues other people have had with the game dont bother me at all i see it for what it is and what it was designed to be keep up the great work what if the octopath travelers are sense8 like the netflix series im only 30 hours into the game but what if the 8 characters just meet in the beginning afterwards they are on their own adventures but share a psychic link when they go into battle they are actually solo but embody each others skills and fight as one like in the show as they travel the overworld you see four of them but like in the show they can see each other as if they were all in the same place the banter system also suggests they could be sense8 as it seems disembodied from the moment i think it fits nicely best game ever this is why nintendo needs to have more aaa developers on the switch complaining about random encounters in a jrpg is like complaining about shouting in a beatemups video great video and great defense of the game but im disappointed you didnt talk about the purple chests my only problem with this game is that i dont have this game ooo the humanity i felt like the game was much too short and much too easy i enjoyed the game a ton it was beautiful in every area the combat was real fun i loved the characters and their stories but goddamn it was just way too short and easy i think i died one time im not even a jrpg guy so can someone please explain how this game lasted them longer than 45 hours and how it challenged them the only big boss battle i had problems with were the gods that you fight in order to unlock the advanced job classes each one has a specific theme with the way they are designed to fight and it makes the battles that much more enjoyable when you find that one combination of characters and classes that finally puts them down i still havent finished all the characters yet so i probably set myself up for easy mode when it comes to finishing the different character arcs i just dont like that the game is broken up in parts per character i loved the way they did it with 8 characters and feel the opposite as a lot of people im tired of the save the world stories and feel they get cliched and samey i loved the banter between characters because i found it provided depth dude calm down you dont need to scream during the whole video i like your channel but lately your videos are consistent screaming and shouting just to present your review point etc your excellency has made another great video as a huge rpg fan i actually dislike people who try point out that a games storyexperience only picks up after x amount of hours if a games story doesnt hold someones interest within the 1st 34 hours they have every right to have a negative opinion and an understandable one at that a story game should consistently draw in the player make them constantly want to see what happens next enjoy the story if that is the main part of the game which most rpgs are dont make the excuse that the game gets more interesting 203040 hours in it should not take that long for a player to become interested in a game this could also be said for many other things too battle systems mechanics characters features if someone doesnt enjoy the game after the first few hours then i feel that their negative opinion is more then justifiable and doesnt need excuses made for it on why they think that or they clearly didnt get to a certain point in the game rpgs i had a glitch were i got stuck in the floor i dont think many have done the final secret dungeon yet either which i understand you have to look for it and it requires completing all eight stories as well as two series of side quests and even then you have to look for the guy to start it but oh boy is it a crazy dungeon its a true gauntlet of boss fights 8 hard battles and a ninth that is just off the charts that you have to complete without saving it also connects the stories of all 8 travelers in a very unique and unexpected way its riddled with deeply satisfying lore this shouting gives an impression that the game is not good but im glad that the game is selling well i played so much rpg that when i see these graphics and that style of fighting with the static characters i lose all my interest i dont hate the game but the fighting style could have more animation i completely agree with your assessment of octopath and the issues therein for me theyre not issues at all i wish perhaps their relationship could develop a little more but the presentation is superb and without any hesitation a phenomenal game nice rereview stop yelling it was murdereoh wait wrong video i think octopath is a grind fest but its ok i think it may have been done though it reminds me of an old game called solo frontier if i recall where you have 812 characters you can choose when you start then there stories mix together note im not 100 complete on the game while i love the game and i agree with nearly everything you mentioned i still feel it would be nice to have all their stories slowly intertwine into one grand story against a typical greater evil theres a ton of opportunities from each storyline to do lead us down that path with these 8 characters but just seems like a missed opportunity to make it even more epic perhaps if se makes a second one nonopath traveller they could do the same but give a much more interaction driven story that includes more than the 2 player cutscene chats generic uninteresting characters the characters are the entire point of the game stop shouting seriously tiring to listen to your content might be ok but its unbearable to listen to really loving this game so far 36 hours in and have 5 stories left to go in chapter 3 the grind has not been an issue however i have issues with the story mostly the fact that the characters completely disappear during the story elements making it hard for me to believe what is happening the end of prisma s chapter 3 story ends in a cliffhanger but it just doesnt make sense to me because the other characters were there 2 seconds ago and could have prevented this im a huge wrestling fan so suspending my disbelief is usually easy for me i just cant enjoy the story as much because of this but it still wont stop me from playing the game as i love the gameplay so much man i get banters all the time people dont get that writing and coding for the kind of game people thought it was would be pretty hard to do that would mean 56 different stories 8x7 and the lost of your liberty and would lead to a lot on inconsistency i want to buy it but i didnt feel during the demo that it was worth so much money i would totally buy it for 3545 i feel like opinion videos on opinion videos is that persons way of controlling a debate and making themselves feel right no matter what shame on me ot is my first jrpg so i really want to like this game but i have some big issues with it as a beginner i dont get it why i have to use these personal skills why i have to steal to become better and better dont laugh but it is against my moral to steal ether in a game why i have to do these second jobs or these quests to have better weapons and better opportunities in this game yeah maybe i am too stupid to play this game but ot isnt so much friendly to beginners i like the videos i just struggle to concentrate listening with the loud speaking just putting it out there can someone please post a comprehensive list of all the dumb mfer pos reviewers that lied to us no interest in those websitechannels the people calling this game a grindfest have never heard of dancing could you make a new channel where you put all the reviews uncut no he cant stop yellin thats just the way he talks i need this game getting a switch soon just for it clickbait as always i could understand someone thinking this game is unique if they havent played a lot of jrpgs but havent saga games been doing this way before octopath plus i dont really understand how people are so thrilled with this game based off the combat alone since ive heard the stories arent that good but dont most people play rpgs for the story i dunno i guess it just doesnt seem as unique as i hoped it would be the demo is why it sold so well im playing hollow knight rn ill get this game when it drops in price its 90 in aus rn if anyones complaint is that the game isnt on ps4 screw off if you want the game get a switch im sick and tired of people wanting nintendo to go third party namely because its not a good idea for example how many extremely good games has sega came out with since going that route a decent amount sure but a huge amount no i am now of the mind that sega and nintendo only really do well playing in their own playgrounds not going with another companys rules im really enjoying this game brings me back to the good old days but the writing is particularly clunky dialogue isnt repetitive but its so onthenosecharacters bloviate on their stories themes aloud as if we arent smart enough to follow along i hadnt seen dunkeys review but hes absolutely on point about the generic nature of the characters and their stories which is a big letdown for me i can forgive it though but the gameplay art design etc is topnotch i also really appreciate the fact that the stories dont fall into the worlduniverse is going to end and only this haphazardly assembled band of misfits can save it trap i love that trap or trope rather but its nice to have a smaller scale plot whose stakes remain high because they are significant on a personal level its even sold out in my town in poland where nintendo is very rarely bought in comparison to sony and microsoft consoles why are there so many posts about shouting is their volume setting alright all his videos have him be enthusiastic the peacock shall strut love your videos man i totally agree with what you said in fact i had the opposite problem with grinding i over leveled because i did two bosses and got a x100 exp boost with bewildering dance went from level 40 to 74 in two battles bet gam it 2 grindy i just realized theres a izuku midoriya and katsuki bakugo model in the background i would of picked this game up but it looks indie from a big developer and it costs 60 dollars im glad you addressed this and i think you make good points i still dont know how to feel about this game i havent gone back after beating the 8th chapter 1 all i want is dragon age origins on the switchbest rpg in my opinion real talk the hunter characters dialogue made me want to fucking die everything about her speech pattern is cringy i totally agree with grinding i was able to get all the classes and put together all 8 classes in my team therion thief merchant ophilia cleric warrior cyrus caster apothecary primrose dancer hunter and i guess its op the combo and every one will have it if you have all 8 classes is have cyrus use his super all moves that focus multiple targets focus one at increased damage and ophilia uses her super to mean cyrus move goes twice with more damage on a single target have primrose peacock strut cyrus and have therion merchant 3 bp to cyrus the next round you get a x4 move that hits twice doubled to four times as well as increased damage and striking bosses like a monster i have capped my damage so much im tempted to make him the warrior so i can do all the damage he could be p this combo has carried me dude i really like you as a person and want to support your channel im having a hard time appreciating your videos lately though i find them kind of shouty and meandering its hard on my ears and meanwhile i struggle to follow your points im really sorry if this hurts your feelings and i have no desire to attack you personally at all just hoping to give feedback dude dude there is 90m players on switch i actually like that the stories dont get bogged in long long exposition and every party member has to comment on the current situation it makes jrpgs a slog i liked playing chrono trigger but there were times i wanted to skip the chit chat and keep moving octopath is the first jrpg i love playing chrono i really liked but started playing it last year so i dont have rosecolored memories like i will with octopath i also feel octopath has better combat than chrono and dare i say itslightly better music and even if chrono were orchestrated it would be hard to beat octos soundtrack why are you shouting well heres the deal its called a niche the demogrfic is kind of specific to begin with so thats a thing people who didnt enjoyed the 1st 8 hours of one game are out of that niche and thats okay ive been in games for 20 hours and hated them regardless cause ive had my own personal issues with them as a jrpg fan the biggest description id give for it its a very traditional rpg game styled very much like a pseudo retro rpg it reminded me a lot to the 1st time ive played final fantasy and thats pretty much what most people say good old times and even if that wasnt the case i do enjoy traditional rpgs in a way it also reminded me to one of my absolute favorites hexyz force the deal breaker is that you have 8 stories being told in one i havent seen everything the game has to offer im taking it way too slow phased because of work and stuff the problem with dialogue i dont think scripts were bad at all but ive noticed t my biggest issue with octopath traveller that awful fake shakespearean dialect i wish the translators would have put more effort into that it just sounds awful in regards to difficulty and the grind i really havent had to grind much but ive never once used fast travel and ive explored quite a lot so possibly those finding they need to grind a lot are just fast travelling between towns for the next chapter i wish ys viii got this much hype behind it because its a awesome game and in my top 2 jrpg on the switch right now if ppl complain about random encounters just equip evasive manuevers its a skill from cyrus your awesome turn down the volume if you think hes yelling its that simple why in the world do u have the volume all the way up anyway would love to play this game i just dont have the 60 bucks its just not do able for me right now tbh im not a big fan during the demo i got frustrated with the amount of battles going in and out of rural areas from the caves to the towns it felt constant pretty annoying anyone else love this wayyy more then xenoblade 2 the peacock shall s t r u t i just realised why this is octopath wood when twewy final remix comes out in the fall will you review it id love to hear your opinion on the game just a couple days until i start my playthrough d you have such an amazing outlook on games keep it up after the wii and the wii ui am glad nintendo is releasing great games again 60 dollars for an snes game yeah dunkey intentionally made the game look bad for example using only standard attacks in the combat he didnt do that in persona 5 he utilized the combat system i respect his opinion but its painfully obvious hes intentionally making it look bad a pathetic desperate attempt at that i can see where the wild encounter too much grind arguments are somewhat valid but i dont have a problem with it because i like the battles and enjoy the amazing music that plays during them when i was playing the game i always thought that the repetitive use of your excellency was super intentional lianna called the archbishop father and called ophilia her sister ophilia called lianna her sister but not the archbishop her father then at the very end of the first chapter when archbishop josef gets sicker she calls him father super awesome character development dont know why people didnt see that the peacock shal strut dont know why everyone says your yelling you are just excited and theres a volume button if its really too loud for someone love the content keep it up and im here still playing xenoblade 2 so much games not enough time dunkey not liking jrpgs is okay dunkey purposefully lying about the battle system with a deceptive video clip to make the game look boring is not okay dunkey wails on a snail with one character with a weapon its strong against knowing full well that it was weak to daggers his olberic was above level 20 meaning that after hours into the game and knowing how to play he purposefully went out of his way to remove all other members of the party and used the wrong weapon dance beatemups dance im so glad to see you make another video about this awesome game i just got the game a few hours ago and am absolutely loving it so far i think i am one of those who likes his shouting on his videos as it gives off a feeling that he is more enthusiastic with what he is doing and what he is playing other youtubers bores me when they talk about a game and talk like they are doing a presentation game is really grindy look at the huge spike in the recommended levels in between chapters for example chapter 1 is recommended level 5 while chapter 2 is recommended levels 22 to 27 wtf you dont gain enough levels in between chapters to continue without grinding why is everyone talking about you yelling seems like theres a lot on this video lol i just made cyrus into a dancer and now there is no way he wont be it for the sole purpose of the peacock shall strut is it just me or was he screaming throughout the entire video i agree with dunkey but love this game 2 death he hates turn based tho lol cyrus best damage dealer alfyn best personality hes just good primrose best darkest story her first boss i never wanted to kill a boss so badly haanit cool ability capture tressa shes got amazing drive ophilia best healer also her sister caught me off guard olberic his story was simply cool therion i loved to steal from everyone everyone this game is spectacular but like you said this game has to be seen as 8 different stories very good stories at that i just had a blast with this game the peacock shall strut why are you shouting you thick lump of gristle i honestly cannot find this game where i live and cant get game fly to send it either cause supplies are at very low levels tried for two weeks sad you are really really making me want to buy the game your excellency im so confused if i should buy it or not every reviewer tells me something different and the same goes for the comment sections i kinda liked the demo but it felt a little bit repetitiv but people often tell me you just have to progress far enough in the story till it gets interesting some say its to hard and grindy and others its easy and got a great combat system is this the kind of game whether your simply like it or not i want to play this but hate turned based games i only like pokemon but i havent played that for years random encounters should be thrown in the trash overrated subbed you are a really good reviewer its true that is the whole point of octapath 8 different stories and not one big story i picked it up as a bday present using the 20 bucks my brother gave me for the nintendo eshop and as much as i wanted a physical version i got it digitally and im happy with what im playing through i can see issues with how they meet up and just accept each other so easily but that doesnt deter much for me as i like the gameplay and the story elements will eventually pull together to hook me even more game looks beautiful but the who turn based combat with all the stats and stuff overwhelms me and puts me off i bought xenoblade 2 and didnt like exactly because of that so one question i have is why are people criticizing the grind i havent actually played this game id like to but the grind is just playing the game its the same with monster hunter if you dont like the grind you dont like playing the game why are you hear if anything the grind would make me want the game more ive never been into jrpgs or rpgs in general but this game this game looks amazing its nice to see someone have feelings on this game so similar to mine my thoughts hearing those critiques were the same as yours and i also found the game easy perhaps too easy and ive also had cyrus as a dancer since i unlocked the job lol you gotta stop making octopatch specific videos almost certain they will make a octopath traveler 2 or style of game and hopefully they interconnect the story between characters and i guess would need a new world please stop yelling you name is wood i like you please stop yelling at me enthusiasm can be expressed in many other ways i really dont get why people say this game is a grind fast not only i havent grinded at all but i finished 4 stories already and decided to finish my main character soon cause he was overleveled and all my characters where getting overleveled so i dividided into 2 teams of 4 so i did each team directly and avoided getting too powerful everytime i faced a wall i jist changed strategy or spent some of the thousands of job points i saved its pixelated and looks cool af but no switch means i cant buy one thanks dude great review as always i bought octopath traveler as my first nintendo switchs game because of your original review of it glad i made the decision cheers i guess im the unique peruvian watching your videos very good video amigo i love your eccentricity wood keep up the good work man 3 i picked cyrus as my starting character and after having him as a cleric i feel like it is necessary to make him the new dancer thank you soooo much for this video ive only seen people be negative about this game in the most picky of ways and it put me in a sour mood so thank you again for being positive about this game i love it to death i find it interesting that this game is basically very well liked or very disliked also i think its funny when people are like wow there is like 8 different story lines and they dont interact i mean thats kind of the point its 8 seperate stories i hate rpg games but octopath is awesome i agree with dunkey game is trash i think the problem with grinding is that people are trying to level up in areas theyre already super overlevelled for so they spend hours accomplishing what you could in a more difficult area i am not getting notified of your new vids youtubecanbeabitchsometimes yo wood even though you dont fancy xenoblade 2 that much you should give the torna dlc a shot its getting its own physical release as a standalone game so youre probably gonna have to get it anyway for your collection its decently long but not as much as the main game so you wont require a huge time sink to finish it the battle system is going to be a bit different so thats worth checking out and the director himself talked about in an interview recently about how hes going for a mature adult theme with the story which may be enough that youll enjoy the story of it and since you dont plan on finishing xenoblade 2 you dont have to be worried about spoilers for the main game its a prequel story with a mostly different cast and it will also give you access to options for the main game that fix problems you had with it such as turning off enemy aggro for high level enemies etcbut thats a whole different suggestion anyways check out the torna lmao good followup my g one note i wanted to comment on is comparing this to xenoblade 2 id almost go to say that xenoblade 2 was objectively better than octopath in whole and heres why both games have a lot of problems in the gameplay department so they story becomes the most important factor and in the story department xenoblade 2 blows octopath out of the water tbh sounds like you need to give xenoblade another go d the person people who said they dont interact wit each other deserve a punch in the face lets fin gooooooo the game is awesome wood and i never played a jrpg but i had to give this a shot and i love it great review have pretty much the same point of view why are people complaining about him shouting i just tone down the volume a bit great game im really enjoying playing it i thought about buying it but i wanted skyrim more and cant go spending money left and right smh fucking love you man keep doing your thing if it takes over 10 hours for a game to get good its not a good game i gave up after a little over 2 hours into the demo very repetitive and dull slow moving game i liked the concept but poorly executed the issue i have with the game is that the individual stories feel too shallow and id rather have less characters with more time spent on them i love the rest of the game but the characters just feel like tools to use with with barely any investment into them funny enough i actually watched dunkeys review first the peacock shall strut my issue with this game is the danger level is not really accurate even when i am trained to that level the monsters still seems damn tough well since there is not many options on first and third party exlusives on the switch dry year so far its not suprising it sold well play fortnite live i also dont understand people saying its grindy i think it could be grindy if youre the type of person who doesnt enjoy exploring and tries to smash through the main storylines as fast as possible however id think that the typical jrpg fan enjoys the journey of exploring every nook and cranny on the map and when you do that with octopath traveler youll find youre perfectly levelled for the situations that arise i love this fucking game so much my only dislikes are the amount of grinding you need to do to get the characters you dont frequently use is irritating like i never use the hunter or the dancer other than that i wish that the characters did have a bit more meaningful interplay like characters in a more fleshed out rpg all of these things though are forgivable in light of the best soundtrack in years great gameplay touching stories for each character and an amazing graphical melding of retro and modern this is art really glad you did the two different vids i was on the fence after seeing not amazing reviews because i was really amped to see if the game would end up being a great experience or not but i really trust your opinions and im glad you went more in depth with the issues of the game i think im finally decided that this is the next switch game on my list to play uberpool traveler there are a couple of things you didnt mention the random things the characters say that usually doesnt accurately match the dialogue gets very repetitive also the things they say after each fight gets repetitive and one more thing i find it odd that therion is even welcome with this supposed party of heroes it doesnt make much sense but i guess the separated storylines help with that have played the game basicaly day 1 loved it got annoyed by dunkeys review too lol but just a small thing u shouldve showcased some of the three person banter to give them more credit lol might need to make the warriors secondary class a dancer to see how hilarious that looks i will not dance for your reviews no more your review and the demo convinced me to get this game and i love it im not big on jrpgs but something hooked me on this why is he so freakin amped and yelling smoke a j and chill out dude i believe that they shouldve done the story like secret of mana 2 seiken densetsu 3 where the characters stories intertwine which allows them to interact but that game is an action rpg so it would be a bit harder to do that dunkeys video was more about how he hated jrpgs rather than an actual review of octopath traveller it was all very opinionated and you probably shouldnt go to his videos for reviews anyway since he mainly does comedy i hope you go back to xenoblade 2 eventually it really is fantastic but if you didnt like the core gameplay i understand it you are correct the game is not grindy its more about how you tackle a fight than anything else am i the only one who is not into this game at all honestly this is why i do not watch reviews because not everyone thinks the same so a person could say that a game is bad and i wouldnt try it because of that even though i may like it personally i love your excitement it really shows how much you like the game and im right there with you brother i love this game so much has anyone here played saga frontier i was hoping for a story simular to that still great but i think they missed the mark there actually they talk to each other in the 1st chapter we can choose to see the prologue for each character but after we start our journey the characters are telling us their tale and asking if we want to come with them so you did a good job of addressing a lot of complaints but one complaint that was not addressed that i think is completely valid is that the dungeons are all short simple and a bit dull it lacks the labyrithine dungeons of jrpgs of yore where taking the wrong path was a risk and sometimes finding the right path involved some effort ive played through all of the major content including some content i wont spoil here and this never changes wait square enix is a third party its definitely not as bad as dunkey said it was its a decent game but in my opinion its way way overhyped thank you for making a video debunking the failed attempts to make this game sound bad your excellency love these videos definitely needed someone to come out and explain things these other reviewers werent quite right about i love octopath its become one of my favorite games ever tbh thanks for the awesome content man you should make an end game octopath review after youve finished it entirely my issues are that i cant kill anything i agree with your sentiments regarding other peoples issues did yall know that fear wrote the games scenarios how cool is that my issues with octopath traveler are the path actions and some of the traits if you dont have therion with you you cant open purple chests so either you bring him with you or retread most dungeons twice cyrus study foe trait is amazing when you enter a new area as is his analyze ability its almost essential if you want to cut down on the difficulty andor make fights quicker especially for bosses but even if you give someone else the scholar job they wont get the study foe freebie on the other hand cyrus scrutinize path action is a mostly crappier version of alfyns inquire so basically whenever you enter a new town if you arent using him you might as well go to the tavern and swap him in to sweep the place i feel like stealpurchase could have been more interesting the reputation system is mostly annoying save scum y my only problem is that i bought the game but there wasnt the game pros great graphics great turn based combat cons bland characters bland story very little character interaction very linear exploration dont get me wrong i love playing the game just for the wrong reasons i love playing it for the combat and gameplay but the game really really falls short when it comes to story and character development and because of that i find it really hard to love this game i was hoping for a good old school rpg with great story and combat and im extremely sad that the only good part of the game is the combat and graphics i love the game thats it thank you i chose alfyn as my first traveler and i love the conversation between therion and alfyn lol i kind of feel like this game is losing potential by not having some kind of overarching story and i will be honest it seems like a lot of these things have been done before tales of games were some of the first to do the party banter and they do it really well and the battle and job systems are very similar to bravely defaults which makes sense since its the same team but there were a lot more jobs in the latter with the ability mix and match and level up each due to these similarities this game seems very underwhelming to me minus the artstyle which is very pretty i just couldt finish the game beat almost all chapter 4s but the story sucks so much that im just not interested to see the endgame anymore and yes it is grindy it got me kinda tired too battle system and jobs are fun but not enough to get me to the end i could swallow the repetitiveness if the story was decent i would like a nintendo switch because youre videos about nintendo are so interrested i love this game the combat is excellent this ni no kuni 2 and upcoming western release of dragon quest 11 boy its good year for rpg fans for a lot of jrpg fans myself included character and team dynamics are a big part of the experience this is definitely octopath travelers biggest downfall theres never a group conversation 90 of conversations are 2way 9 are 3way and about 1 are 4way this could be good enough if the conversations felt organic or at least less generic but alas these conversations are generally trite the second biggest issue octopath has is along the same lines not only is there a lack of interplay in conversation but between storylines even in the post game dungeon the stories dont properly converge in a way that feels like they ever existed together theres a point of connection but more than effecting the 8 stories you already played its more like it effects a 9th with a character youve never paid attention to before after 92 hours that was a huge disappointment to me people also complain about grinding to be fair this is a complaint i had until i discovered ways u should do a video reviewing dawn of the breakers for switch please and i agree about the fact that in this game we dont need to grind because im used to be a bad in rpgs like this one for exemple bravely default or persona because for me these game you need to grind im a bit shity but for me octopath is esay in the way that you dont need to waist time in endless battles so you can enjoy the story in a smoothly way play it in japanese language with english subs of course its better voice overs are way better imo seriously you must have missed out on the jrpgs of the 90s because compared to say saga frontier a 20 year old game by the way this game is trash you should do a whole video where you just whisper lol i feel that because you have all these characters with there own stories youre going to get to a point in someones story where youre going to forget whats going on with their story because you were focusing on other characters i mean trying to keep track of up to 4 different stories at a time is unique but its not really a good thing i love you and i love octopath i still didnt recieved the dancer secondary job but i have already decided to give that sj to cyrus because that in the primroses 2 chapter he says to prim that he would love to dance and also because i realy see cyrus prety sexy with the dancer outfit but now that the peacock shall strut i just died i love his loud style damn it and i love dark humorits up there with earthbound and all tha great rpgshes a golden hearted dude mad proos to you i just wish the game was actually your main character going around this world helping out other main characters with their own trials and tribulations but instead of those main characters just experiencing their story it was your main character the character you started with experiencing the others story as well as their own so each time play through youre watching the stories unfold in a different light one where you see how primrose sees the event or where you just see cyruss view of primroses story its just disappointing to see that even though during the course of everyones story that you have your entire team and when you fight your entire team is with you but they have no say or conflict with each other during the stories so you might as well have forgone everyone and just went through the story solo one of the reasons why games like final fantasy vi or chrono trigger which are games that seemingly inspired this game are so incredible is because yo how funny we formed the same party lol the design and the graphics of the game are the same as a gameboy game and thats a turn off for me and come on 60 dollars like really idk thats just my opinion and i know that a lot of people that are in love with the game but i guess its just not for me personally i have not found it an issue in terms of characters not interacting with one another too much i prefer it this way if there was too much cross over then it would damage the replay value you hit on this point though great video my favorite challenges in this game are the boss battles to acquire the secret classes such long fights but the jobs are so worth it theres one thing i dont understand about the game why only 4 advanced job classes i mean its octopath why not 8 advanced jobs anyone phrases you only hear in reference to jrpgs get past the first ten hours if you got past the first ten hours of a call of duty game youd have ploughed through three games games that actually have long term playability make me happy amen brother you have to remember that there are a lot of knuckle draggers out there and complete and total stupid people that go all the way up to being able to be qualified as idiots to be able to see a lot of the premise that you are bringing to light remember there are reasons why they have the darwin award every year steel saving money get nintendo switch everyone is lucky ubisoft and bethesda primrose is best girl primrose is best girl dunkeys been pretty vocal about hating pretty much any rpg ever made so i took his review with a grain of salt man your videos are always really good but those thumbnails are the worst i seriously love your content but those get on my nerves to no end you just needed to give us the hour review uncut come aaaaaan octopath traveler mastapeace i am i will call them out cause misinformation is misinformation i would also say if you do not like jrpgs dont play it cause you will not like it the game is gorgeous and well done kinda like what i would have wanted in ff6 dunkey is higly overrated why is he always yelling reminds me of the whats up guy who is also a nintendo yter do nintendo youtubers yell more in order to appear more enthusiastic than say a playstation 4xboxpc yter it always drives me crazy how i immediately have to lower my volume when i click on one of these videos i dont want to unsub but if this is how it will be from now on and then those alia type video titles with the clickbait im getting a bad feeling about where this channel is headed i still want this game but unfortunately bills have to be paid this type of game has been done before kind of a jrpg japan exclusive snes game called live a live you kind of like this game i want a copy so bad but i cant get one around here people bought them and are selling them for way too much online youve got to give se props for that hefty hefty demo thanks to those three hours of gameplay anyone who really doesnt like the game doesnt have to spend money on it i never knew asta had a youtube channel no i wont say it so ycnellecxe rouy shining resonance refrain octopath traveler dont me no game is perfect love the video man your truthful and honest i remember the 7th saga did something similar but in that game the other characters you dont pick at the beginning can become your enemies or allies in your journey so in the first couple of chapters of this game i would switch through all 8 characters to stay caught up with all of the chapters with everyone so some characters especially the main that is locked into your party will be higher leveled of course than others so if you play in that manner then i find that i do have to grind at times so i sort of agree with that issue the bad review that donkey gave the game is mostly bc he doesnt like jrpgs i lov donkey but he has said that before so i didnt understand why he even reviewed the game read the comments on his video and you will see the same that im saying from his fans i wonder of how many 1 milion players that got this game beat the last last last boss oooh someone finally just went all out and admitted the wiiu was a travesty dragon quest iv did exactly what this game did in terms of story you just couldnt choose the sequence of characters on top of all of this the game is massive i finished the first chapter for all of the characters in 12 hours and if you say im slow its because i do side quests and read the story entirely just based on the graphics i wish this game was my style lol 135 so you dont want people to watch your videos im 35 hours into it and feel like its a great game i cant play it for multiple hours straight but its really good ive been grinding really good gear and am seriously overleveled i think im level 40 with almost all forsaken weapons at chapter 2 for most characters this game is so good it ruined my social life and im loving it every second of it im level 30 on my 4 characters have all the job shrines and applied the jobs to my party i still cant beat olberics last boss on chapter 2 and this is my first chapter 2 grinding is a must so good on you for not having to grind maybe because you started with another characters chapter 2 i love all your videos but i kept looking at your amazing tshirt i have to have one i finish all character and i really like it this game have unique way for story telling not just 8 main path but every character build the world you will enjoy if you accept and understand how this game work i love the demo cant wait to buy the game i wish i could find a physical copy in the uk i found mine two towns away at a walmart its a good game i read a review in which they said the interactions between characters are just chit chat to make it feel like they are conected somehow therefore turned in to the biggest lie ever while i was doing chapter 2 for cyrus he gets called by his colleague as a pretty dense guy who doesnt understand women and i had primrose ofilia and haanit on the party yet every interaction they had was making reference toward his indiference with women and how he praises them and is flirty without even noticing idk what happens with a different dialogue with men party members but i believe that creating an atmosphere to make the player realize that yeah the game and characters take into consideration the personality of a party member for dialogue development this totally crushes bad reviews toward the story of the game and the so called blandness of the characters that ive seen in a lot of reviews imma go out and say it i didnt pass the first 20 minutes but i dont like it snorlaxgod i love you woodahem i mean your excellency i downloaded the demo just to see if i was wrong about the visuals being garbage this game is not a beautiful game its full of blurry pixelart i love pixel art but this is an abomination i also dont know what all the complaints about grinding are about i guess its just the way i play and like to level all characters evenly as possible i do take my time and have never used cyrus ability to reduce encounters i even fought a boss in an optional dungeon i thought i was going to get wrecked on and beat it ive only done 2 chapter 2 stories so far and highest ranked character is level 32 i believe by the time im ready to move to chapter 3s he should be over level 40 wait for darksouls remastered to come on switch thats gonna blow up i litrally bought this console for the game for solaire praisethesunbrothers 510 hasnt been done before dragon quest 4 has a word to say the peacock shall strut when people said that octopath traveler is grindy i wonder how many of them actually played a lot of jrpg i ship therion primrose theyd be a great couple one minor thing and it in no way took away from my enjoyment of the game but at one point i did switch from handheld to docked when moving around my apartment and it crashed and of course through nature of fate i hadnt saved my game for like an hour or so and had to replay a good chunk just a warning to those playing is yt your only job only thing i hate are the 2 drops because my luck is trash ive been at this for around 10 hours and i still dont have one drop lol im obsessed with this game all the stories are connected but you dont find out how until later still cant find it where i live but a store in my town said he will bring it next week i cant wait to get my copy i love the game but its very long it takes 10 hours to just collect all the characters and get thier intro stories some sp games nowadays are over in 1015 hours im glad its long but if your thinking about picking it up be aware your going to invest time tied with zelda as my 1 switch game your excellency i literally had to order a brand new version of octopath traveler on ebay everywhere was out of stock gotta wait to tuesday lol im so late thank you for the upload your excellency game is easy imo finished the game overall was really fun but what it truly needed was uniting all the characters stories into a single main plot as it stands to me its 8 mini games in one glad the game is doing well and will hopefully help nintendo in the future i mostly just really dont like jrpg turn based games while the music and art is pretty cool but thats not enough for me so i didnt buy after trying the demo rather than let hype let me down thx for uploading this video i also think there is too much negativity about this game i didnt play the full game but i really enjoyed the demo absolutely loving this game so far my favorite character is cyrus this is why i like beatemups reviews you know he is being honest and will explain his reasons for not enjoying the game unlike those who just call it a bad game because its not their type of game am i the only one who cant stand the visuals of this game i mean im a huge fan of pixel art games and i played ragnarok online for several years which has a similar 3d world with 2d sprites thing going on and loved it but i just cant get into this games visual style the weird diorama look its got to it just looks so disgusting to me between that and the first 1520 minutes of the demo being just so slow and boring i just could not bring myself to buy this game i love this game so much ive only put in 7 hours but im having a blast great vid as always when you start therion he actually is alone until you get caught stealling the gem then you can go search for other characters so i think the stories are separate because you can start with any character you want and at first youre all alone im 40 hours in and it gets better and better you can use other characters weapons and all cool game love your energy and cant stop watching your videos i recently bought my gf a switch starter kit for her upcoming birthday its admittedly for us both its contents include a new switch with 2 pro controllers breath of the wild mario kart 8 mario odyssey bayonetta 12 lets go pikachu and smash ultimate also after seeing yesterdays video i decided i could wait no longer to pick up a copy of octopath and i plan on investing in a memory card to up the storage as there are a ton of eshop games we will wanna download is this good for starters is there anything obvious that im missing what dream lineup of games would you want if you skipped the last generation went straight to the switch and someone were buying you a similar gift dunkis review was one of the most dishonest things ive ever seen on the internet i am so proud of the switch come 3rd party devlopers come to me switch looking gay in the thumbnail my focus is unparallel why are you yelling at me what did i do i love this game so much i gave my switch away to my brother for the month of august so i can get to work without distraction ive already spent 40 hours on it am almost done all chapter 2s and have loved every minute of it could it be better sure i bet there are a few ways the game could be better but its still really damn good i give it a 94 one point below god of war ps4 i played the demo and i thought it was slow and boring pleasestopscreaming its meh who careth what others thinketh just playeth people nowadays dont read just read the text and you will notice the amount of character building the developers put into this game could be better yes but its enough to give you an idea about each character wood can you look into saga frontier on ps1 its just like this game made by square i only point this game out because its the grandpa to octopath like seriously octopath is almost a spiritual successor in terms pf the way the story and characters are handled youre explanation of characters interacting was exactly what i was thinking also your example with thereon was both hilarious and a good point honestly i was bummed about the lack of interaction between characters but when you shed light on it like this i see it differently and can appreciate it its like instead of one main character being focused on and some side characters thrown in each character is equally important and has their own thing instead of beatemups your channel should be named nintendo hype man because after watching a video of yours i get the feeling like i should run out and buy whatever game you talk about well the game is still boring too me then again i cant stand rpgs or jrpgs btw you looked great in the aquaman trailer i love the not connected enough haters because the game was advertised everywhere as 8 characters 8 stories to play so not sure what they were expecting ive played the demo of this game but i dont like it after 1 hour and a half xenoblade 2 looks interesting however should i buy xenoblade never played jrpg before you cant listen to everyones reviews this is just as good as xenoblade chronicles 2 or better the peacock shall strut dunkey even openly admitted in that very video hes not into jrpgs why do people even take anything past that line or rather in that entire video for godgiven facts lol a lot of people throw around terms like grindfest without even knowing exactly what that is i think those people who think you need to grind to progress say that because they expected to pick one character and go straight to the end of their story if you dont want to go around and finish others chapters then yes you will have to grind a lot playing each different chapter and leveling up from that is not grinding grinding is staying in some place leveling up without moving anywhere in the game the other possibility would be that they are terrible and want to brute force through without using strategy in battle which is pretty common for the new generation of gamers please stop shouting you make interesting videos dont there is no need to constantly shout to make a point btw ot is a terrible game theres no manual to speak of and the sprites get hidden behind objects and the camera is unmovable paths are hard to see i used the demo and couldnt get out of the first town wound up going back and forth multiple times before i gave up on this game it does look good though watched and loved your videos for a long time so please dont take this the wrong way but the constant shouting through out the entire video is starting to spoil it just take it down a couple of notches well when i played the demo i had to grind a lot for the boss and i lost either way i bought it but to say theres is no grinding is a big lie please upload the hour of review im so proud too ive never played it reeee this is a chicken wing this is a applebees honestly the only reviews i trust are yahtzees a good way to solve the character interaction issue would be to have them in little mini teams and pairs or a group of characters are involved with one persons story at any given time and it intersects with all 7 others stories in different ways its hard to explain but the best example of this i could think of is sonic adventure think about how a large chunk of sonics story spoiler alert revolved around tracking down amy in the egg carrier and spoilers once again how big and e102 gamma influenced each others stories pretty substantially by gamma capturing froggy and big trying to get him back i dont know man this was a pretty big thing to mess up since i and many many others usually play rpgs for the story great video bro care with spoilers pls honestly this sounds a lot like saga frontier to me love the game and glad to see it doin well another great video your excellency i hate myself for only being 25 hours in the internet always tries to find something negative about everything good and unfortunately you just cant avoid it my advice is to just form your own opinion ive put in about 90 hours already and just now am i doing the very last chapter of alfin and then well i know that their stories will come together in the end after finishing the last one the big boss battle is yet to come the game is easily something to dump in 100 hours without even considering doing all the side quests the value is just insane havent played an as good game since breath of the wild with only 1hr30min of gameplay i know its a grinder you may not consider normal grinding as grinding but it really does consider it and require it my left joy con broke the joystick doesnt work i was on the phone with nintendo trying to get it fixed and i get put on hold the music is the hyrule field theme my dad walks in and says what is this crappie music then he hears breath of the wild and says what kind of a game is that triggered video starts mewhat just happened im still doing chapter 2s and i enjoy them game awhole lot my only issue right now is that weaponsarmor are too pricey maybe just me dunkey dosent really like rpgs he said it in his game critic video it has to be amazing for dunk to like does anyone know how to delete a save in octopath plz awnser do you have your voice in surround i feel like you dance left and right in my headphones xd or just play the demo honestly the only point where grinding felt forced and annoying was just before the final boss no spoilers but 48 of my characters ended up being way underpowered and the game made no effort to tell me that i needed to beef them up beforehand it wasnt necessary before that i feel like phily with the hunter job is the biggest glow up love square enix but hate random encounter rpgs not buying but sad because of it people complain about the random encounters and it being grindy its an old school rpg what do they expect lol it isnt even a difficult game and i havent had to grind at all people complain about everything however in the beginning i was also a bit dissapointed in the characters dont talk to each other until i realized they do however i was kind of expecting beforehand that their stories would criss cross and so on and that the different parties would have different dialogues ala final fantasy but when you put it like that it wouldnt be octopath traveller anymore if it did so yeah i kind of this system im still at chapter 2 for some of the characters this game is freaking long so 1 million copies quick math assume square enix gets 45 per copy 45 x 1 million 45 million dollars yep id say that was a profitable release hey dude great vid i love the content man i say if youre into these sort of games you definitely should try it and the damage control begins the name of the game is freaking octopath meaning 8 paths not 1 so it makes perfect sense that there would be 8 separate stories in this game not 1 linear story line for 8 characters duuhhh octopath travelers backstory is tied the real story is the generation prior to these ones these seemingly unaffiliated characters are just destined to deal with issues that happened prior to them its actually an amazing lorerich world beating the final dungeon confirms all of this you either like it or you dont i get that but it was done well i feel like im the only person who doesnt like this game i actually like the random encounters and the grinding is almost none maybe 30 minutes from transfering from lvl to lvl cmon now we all know octopath was overrated from the get go ive never been a person that needs reviews to figure out what i should buy but since getting more into indy games i just watch you and rgt85 lol this game though i bought before watching your review because i buy anything square enix keep doing what you doing bro im glad you are back well as a switch owner and a long time nintendo supporter i am not sold on getting octopath traveler i like the art style and think its rather clever i just feel the story wont get me hooked like pokemon or golden sun did for me i guess im not a big jrpg gamer even though pokmon i my all time favorite video game franchise i also played ffx so i can appreciate legendary rpgs octopath just isnt calling my name though 1 shipped is not sold 2 its still an opinion so dont get upset about it theyre the types of opinion you should be listening to so glad you said its not a grinding game got tired of hearing that over and over grinding is not required im up to chapter 4 with everyone and like you have done next to no grinding at all you just need to have the right combo of characters for the boss fights and understand the battle system mechanics i think its very well balanced boss battles should be difficult thank you i love you and i have a suggestion what about making video about the best free games on switch or talking about every free game on eshop and does it worth the time to download it or no im so on the fence with thisits 50 quidthe demo was good but a bit sameyhmmmmm decisions decisions hey wood just wanted to let you know that your livestream yesterday meant a lot to me and to a lot of others as well keep up the great work brother we love ya octopath is going to go down as a classic from the switch era this game is amazing i refuse to even hear any negative octopath talk with that said id bid u all good day and prey keep travelling the second job i discovered was the thief class and i immediately thought i giving this to tressa cause who doesnt want the innocent child merchant to secretly be a thief by night you say on nintendo switch like its not an exclusive game why are you yelling at me the gameplay is repetitive once you start going through multiple chapters very quickly in the same way all games are repetitive there is a certain pattern to the way the chapters are structured just like every fortnite game has a pattern to the way you go about it just like every mario level has a pattern in the way you interact with the environment and just like every other game is built to incorporate its own style of gameplay the problem that people have i think is that theyre skipping the dialogue entirely because they dont seem to understand that while the combat is superb in this game the game itself is a storyfocused game if you spend the time to read the cut scenes and dialogue in the chapters then thats where you will start to see the unique aspects of each character story and chapter i really dont see the issues people are having with the game i agree with you though i feel like most reviewers didnt get passed chapter 1 i love this freakin game i have a small review on the game but plan on doing a full review once i finish the game on my channel great video wood i love all your content hope youre feeling better the grinding is honestly part of fun for me atleast dunkey hates turn based combat so it was expected both xenoblade chronicles 2 and octopath traveler are absolute must buys on the switch for anyone who is a fan of rpgs im with you on the grinding part i havent had to grind at all and find the boss fights while sometimes difficult not impossible to get through the first time around havent you heard wood sjws offended by primrose character are absolute hypocrites its in the dna of sjws contradict themselves saying its not refreshingly different but say they dont like how the story works lol hypocrites i dont see why the characters cant engage in other characters paths when theyre literally traveling together the character whose path youre on will still be in the center its definitely a huge negative that keeps me from buying it along with other issues this is probably why square enix will still try to push final fantasy out of turn based battles because of newcomers btching about it being what it used to be a fcking rpg and no doubt people with or without any experiences with rpgs will still sht on it just like they did with octopath traveler regardless of the massive positivity its been receiving so in conclusion no game or rpg for that matter is perfect and lastly a single game cant please everyone anyways so heres to square enix to finally pull the trigger into making a true mainline final fantasy successor complete with turn based combat in some shape or form and not to be a total tool for turning it into an action rpg why are you screaming hes sweating thanks for the reviews and the livestream yesterday it selling too much thats the issue smh i feel like he is the guy who never closes caps lock from by the way he talks its awesome this game lacks sexy wamen nothing but chibi sprites all the time it gets boring and repetitive they could have added large sized illustrations during the dialogues or somethingits a very big flaw for a jrpg it doesnt feel the same without ecchi illustrations of females wearing scantily clad armours thats my main dissapointment in this game along with the simplicity of the sidequests i dont even care for jrpgs anymore and i love octopath why are you shouting throughout this whole video just talk normally the peacock shall strut me looks up from playing me what that funny moment aside i dont have octopath traveler because i still have unfinished games and i want to finish them one day ill play octopath when i have the chance the game is not grindy when you go with 4 characters but when you want to do all 8 characters at the same time you need to do some grinding this is because when you are doing a few stories with a few characters your other characters get behind for me rn my main protaganist is lvl 45 haanit and the rest is pre 35 because of the altarations still a great game though octopath deserves this this is the first game that iv truly been attracted to in almost a year 353 i mean 10 hours is the length of an entire game a lot of the time but at least thats not as long as the length you have to go through in xenoblade chronicles 2 why is olberics sprite brown in your previews and blue in my game the peacock shall strut 100 agree what can ya say haters gonna hate this game is for jrpg lovers its sort of hardcore the reg gamer will hate it im sure the game reminds me of ff tatics the style and plays like a classic ff game my big issue was the lack of character interaction but im glad to see there is at least some interaction later on so that being said my new main issue is the placement of the flee option in the battle menu my classic jrpg experience has me trained that the bottom option on the menu is items so i always accidentally flee from battles when i mean to use an item honestly though this game is nearly perfect im the same when it comes to either reviewing a game or before i play the game for a first time that i dont like to watch other peoples reviews as in the past i have been swayed only to discover down the line that the game was good and i should have just bought it great video been watching your channel for a while and finally decided to leave a comment never played an jrpg should i buy it i love this game so much it hurts even after putting 105 hours into it i almost want to start over just to level up again and see the great story a second time 3 shout shout let it all out these are the things i can do without ffs why do you shout in these vids and not the others which are much better to watch not watching while i think its good your praising the game i do think that what you say isnt entire true there has been a game that has done much of the very same thing many years ago it was called saga frontier multiple characters who all have their own uniques stories that are not affected by others stories unique battle system and over arching world where you can explore even after the games end to be honest octopath traveller isnt really new different or ground breaking at all for squares line up franchises its just a saga series game with a different name and given proper marketing and released at a time where it cant be overshadowed i debating between octopath traveler and skyrim what do you think i should get i dont take dunkeys opinion on anything seriously for anyone still on the fence with this game i highly recommend you download the prologue demo from the eshop after playing the 3 hr demo i knew for sure whether or not i would buy it then dont leave out negative parts of your reviews cut out other stuff to have that in there it doesnt count as a review if you leave off half of it if there are issues then it has to be addressed people tend to forget dunkey hates jrpgs and believe what he says is the ultimate truth well the game sold a lot of copies and their is bound to be people that dont like the game even more so the people who got the game and dont like jrpgs and well if you dont like jrpgs your bound to not like this game as well i love xenoblade but right now i have not found the time for octopath traveler looks great but i just have not found the time the grind isnt bad for the main stories but if you try to do the true final boss fight as soon as you clear the stories with no additional grinding you probably arent going to have a good time wii u wasnt really a failure the game looks good but i aint much of a jrpg guy which is kinda weird because i love kingdom hearts and that has a lot of jrpg elements in it i glad you talked the characters interacting with each other in banter sections because it drove me crazy how other channels lied or didnt went far enough to figure it out so that makes them a bad reviewers so great job sir im about 25 hours into the game and things are getting repetitive each chapter at this point is talking for 20 minutes a short 5 minute dungeon and then a boss that takes 20 to 30 minutes im getting bored with the same formula and am wondering if ill even finish the game finally i miss you dude love the video man i think its fine to review a game without finishing it just as long as you are honest and forthcoming with that since the last few videos i feel like you r screaming the whole video would be nice if u could calm down a bit xd this game is awesome 75 hours in i think the way people have hyped this game is the only issue some people say its the best jrpg of all time for some people it is and that is fine but other people find out its not for them and they try to find flaws which it has just not that many i personally love the game i dont play it too much but its so easy to pick up and play the music is great and i really like all the little stories instead of a save the world kind of plot like pretty much any other game overall a very enjoyable game if you dont like it fine but a lot of people do and its great to see its doing so well signed your excellency i hate that game what character did you guys start off with i cant listen to you yelling slow down breathe and calm yourself mate youre out of your element i like dunkey i know he doesnt generally like jrpgs or anything with turn based combat so it depends what you like dont think ill pick this up mostly because im a jrpg beginner and there are a lot more games in the genre that require my attention great to see u back to your happy self bro stay up dawggy we all been down its how u get back up that defines you not how you fall the more time spent grinding is proportional to the lack of understanding of the combat system and game mechanics i love the game so i know you mean the only issue is that the game isnt on any other platform but im glad its a switch exclusive at the same time only true issue you can have with it is its price but i think its worth the full 60 but i can understand why people wouldnt want to buy it at a full price this hasnt been done before valkyrie profile would like a word now it makes me wonder if this title and all its hype will manage to make it a system seller back in the days i remembered getting a ps1 to get to pkay ff7 wonder if anyone might get a switch specially for octopathi doubt it will tho at this point octopath is gonna surpass xenoblade in sales im really not a big fan of turnbased games or jrpg in general but i bought it anyway just to see what the fuss is all about look i agree to all of dunkeys opinions about this game but i just couldnt stop myself from playing it from star to finish i love the game the only issue i have is that i dont know how to do side quest call me dumb if you want but to be honest none of the side quests are straightforward i think dunkey was overreacting the game is actually amazing and i love how you broke all their dumb cons negatives easily people just have to dump on this game because they only played 4 hours and got bored i respect their opinions if they dislike the game but you cant just crap on the game like its a 210 this game at least deserves an 810 in my opinion but i give this 1010 this game is almost perfect if you are thinking of buying this game go see reviews from any channels other than ign and dunkey their points are easily dismissed because they havent touched the surface of the chapter 2s the music is amazing the language is beautiful im in love with the different stories its not perfect but its a beautiful thirdparty game you could make 1000 videos on octopath traveler id watch them all scine i loge this game and love hearing you talk about it did you pick the best team ha i challenge you my team cyrus mage ophilia support healer hannit op pokemon trainer olberic tank talks about misinformation but says octopath traveler sold 1 million copies it only shipped that amount that doesnt equal sold bought octopath traveler when i went to nintendo new york i love the game i play it so much and your review of this game is phenomenal keep up the great work why the yelling always the yelling chill dude and the clickity bait thumbnail overreact face is fucking cringe man this makes me wanna buy the switch sadly i cant until next may because i am about to get the xbox one x im in chapter 3how did you get cyrus cast peacock strut also ive done zero grinding youre correct the scaling is in point well i still love it we all have opinions game of the year other than knack 2 i pre ordered a month before it came out and i havent played much of it but i think it would be kinda cool if there was more interaction but again this is probably squares test run with new ideas wood your awesome why didnt you review fifa 18 on the switch your thumbnails arent clickbait they kust make you look autistic i had to laugh at dunkeys video not because it was funny because he said it takes too long to kill enemies if anyone wants to know a good combo to start with tessatherionhaanit tessa can learn an ability to donate bp to haanit for haanit to use a max boosted arrowstorm oh her first turn therion fits in becuse he can steal sp and donate it to haanit as well as steal a 80sp accessory from an npc early on which is important because haanits arrowstorm costs 24sp using this method you will obliterate pretty much every pack of mobs early on while traveling the map to collect your other characters man i just got octopath becuse of u and i love it thanks my only gripe is that getting new charecters feels repatitive even though i only have got there people love ur vids but u should take a brake man ur pumping out great content likie how playstation be pumpin out switch hate dude please stop shouting i swear to god i have no fucking idea why youre shouting the game also has some end game content and the stories do converge once you beat everyone story im super happy good points its criticized for not being the same as other games and then criticized for not being different enough lol dude maybe its your style but your whole delivery is basically just shouting absolutely loving this game about to get the last of the 4 secret jobs and have cleared 2 stories so far id say its switchs 2nd best game next to breath of the wild im happier now man ive got to play this game some more i havent run into any goombas or a snorlax yet and i just sold my nintendo switch oh well i dont understand why you feel like you have to defend this game big deal if other people dont like it your exellency wood people saying its a grind fest its a jrpg like what did they expect a surprisingly great game gotta love the addicting job system feels like ff tactics which is why i love it so much lol i dont like it but its good that its doing well and others are enjoying it my only issue is finding it id rather have 8 separate stories than the save the world story done over and over again your excellency beatemups bows im about to get a switch and i can afford three games to get i dont want zelda because i beat that on wii u what game should i get look at the pit stains hes sweating please stop shouting and just be yourself good to see you back making awesome videos thank you for the review your excellency i think with the random encounters and this is an issue i have with the game as well but i still accept its unevitable but because of how deep the combat is and how you need to boost and think about your turns a lot instead of autopiloting through it makes random encounters tedious because not only do you have to actuall use a lot of personal effort to get through them but they do take a chunk of time and they come up really often if youre not using cyruss support skill the more i play it the more painfully average it is its a good game i dont feel its a great game glad its doing well just a thought why dont you try a two part review for big games like this in this way you dont have to cut out important issues for time you also talk alot which is not a bad thing love the content wood so i am a little conflicted about this game i have it on my switch but never got to play it up until now the reason is that i have other games to finish first and octopath will probably take a lot of time now im a completionist i wanna see every single aspect and enemy of the game reveal its weaknesses and strengths of course i also want to know everything about the characters now i started with therion cause i thought having a thief early on would be pretty valuable i was right 3 i got into the town cyrus is and could reqruite him since im play through therions story will i be able to play cyrus story with the same save file as well or do i need to choose cyrus as my main character does it work the same way for all the others if it was said in the video im sorry but i couldnt watch it till the end since i didnt have much time octopath traveler is a nintendo ip it is not owned by square enix actually my honest score for octopath traveler is 410 because i have played other games that are significantly better and better at modernizing the turn based rpg bravely default being 610 bravely second being 1010 and the alliance alive atlus game for 3ds came out this year you have to check it out is also 1010 this is octopath travelers score compared to these three games two of which is done by the same team best game on switch better than botw and oddessy im head over heels for this game omg youre a dunkey fan octopath traveler is such a good game sadly i dont have enough money to bye octopath shipped not sold still happy its doing pretty well i literally bought this game without reading or watching a single review the fact that it was an old school style jrpg from square was enough for me if you own a switch and love jrpgs you need this game in all honesty you can play the first 3 hours of the game for free i think playing said demo will tell you whether or not to buy it than someone elses opinion dunkey usually hates hates jrpgs his hating octopath is not a shock i also dont care for dunkey i had to cancel my preorder because it still hadnt come so i either have to download it or get it somewhere else and breath of the wild takes up like 19 gb and beatemups likes dunkey this is the greatest dont you just hate when people say they hate jrpgs and turn based but then tell you that they love kingdom hearts and pokemon like wtf will this stay an exclusive though youre very shouty lately just talk i have it but havent got round to it yet probably after ive finished super mystery dungeon though were absolutely loving this game at our house my boyfriend keeps asking did that youtube guy you watch upload anything else about octopath hell be happy to see this video hey im kinda new to this channel and i wanna know where he streams like does he stream on youtube or twitch its square enix wood talk about code of princess for the switch its a beat em up my only problem is that i dont have a nintendo switch to play it on sad music plays im so glad this game is doing so well honestly your videos help me out so much while im going through a rough time in my life thank you for these amazing videos i love you wood notif squad i want it i missed you a lot of you probably already know this but its for those who are still trying to inquire and scrutinize me about the best farming location also for those still farming the mountain goats make sure to subscribe for more octopath traveler maybe only bewildering grace the goats that could be better idk tho oh man the grind is real that kill barely move your bar wow no unnecessary talking just right to the point thanks man thx for this ohrichard now i at least have an idea on what to do now can you find caits triple family in here like in the ice dragon cave or just the chubby cait solo where is this place though wheres a good place to get nuts seems pretty wrong that the best place to grind is level 58 when its possible to go up to like 99 isnt it youd think theyd add harder areas post game this is what i need thanks well i only get 1000xp there whats my problem my characters all 8 are level 30 40 where do i farm without getting hit without getting with 500 or 1000 evrytime thats where i farm lol any idea for farming with level 40 what skillsequipment did you use to do that much damage my characters only are hitting for about half that damage with the same classes and moves hmm what do you think of maw of the ice dragon since they have the best rates for cait spawns even compared to the forest of purgation im in everhold right now and im not seeing xp numbers like this just killed a group and it gave me 411 am i missing something so im chapter 2 and my highest character is therion lv30 what is my best option right now find gear and grind to whatever level or just go on with the story regularly this game has be so torn on what to do i absolutely love your content everything about it makes me enjoy and learn thank you so much this look great could you please tell me the classes you have for the heroes very helpful would be nice if you could include the location of the forest next time but i found a comment informing me of this thanks hey what classesjobs do you use for your characters also i couldnt find what gearskills to use to boost xp thanks if you can help is this suitable for lower levels my party is currently lvl 35 if not any other recommended spots me at 30h into the game what is going onnnn xd well i was hoping this for lower level grinding not level 95 grinding it will be useful if i ever get that high though dont forget with the dancer ability with a random effect forget the name currently you can get x2 x5 or even x100 exp per battle as well just subbed man loving your octopath traveler content and the game any tips for the final boss ive beaten first phase all characs around lv 70 ut i get absolutely demolished on 2nd phase even with everyone having saving grace and reviving them to 9999 health if you dont mind me asking you say the whole party can one shot any mob whats the build on tressa that can also just watched the olbric video lold at him with 1hp please make a video about locations and shops for end game weapons and armor if you can love the videos you put out nice nice now im at lv90s even with 1800 exp per round one shot everything in 20sec still takes me hours to just get one level im slowly dying inside where is this forest tho spam dancer grace skill for xp boost and jp boost i cannot find this place can someone tell me where is it haanit as a sorcerer interesting i love your content man keep it up ive put a lot of hours into this and your videos help a lot would like to note revanants or we they are called the big golems can be one shot but require a sorc with a max matk b a weapon with increase damage of x type and you hit them with that type this does seem to be the better alternative farming location for late game would you still recommend bgcait hunting for say level 40 or lower i really appreciate the effort youre putting in especially since the game is so new anyone know what the alter in the back of the forest is for being its not the miniboss and can you capture that miniboss ive tried for hours here to see if he would show up again and hasnt im assuming he doesnt randomly popped bewildering grace during cyruss chapter 4 and it gave me exp x 100 everyone leveled 15 times sorcerer haanit why how bruh i love these videos helps out my own playthrough d thanks this will help d got owned on last boss second form my party too weak d damn looks like need to get the other 4 jobs before farming this nice but i think ive finished everything xd how do you find the badge for expjp bonus hey richard could u make a video of where u can get good weapons or the weapons we can see in ur vids i would love to see it i also farm here too where is this area oh hey ive been farming in this place because if its high danger level i used to farm in the everhold tunnels but i only found this forest yesterday funny you made a video about the two places v umoshiroi brilliant cheers from rio loved the game but now i also want acquire to make a new way of the samurai or tenchu in ue4 octopath traveler is still one of my favorites on switch such an underappreciated game really nice style love it even being a hardcore graphics fan only usually when is the sequel coming the art perspective blend with sprites in 3d looks fantastic great job i really hope that anime stuff dont start to invade unrealdont want to see that unreal is only game engine for anime games in future i wonder how much they struggled with paper2d and if they got paperzd to help with the 2d side of things or if they programmed the whole 2d animation tools themselves from a company who made a game about stripping clothes off people in public im quite impressed also i would love final fantasy vi remade in this style the british already have a good name for penis its tallywhacker happy to see some of the octopath traveler demo it looks fantastic definitely worth keeping an eye on as it nears release watching this from the future the moment where kaiser says one day ill be louis ck oh no kaiser please dont clearly the best answer for sesame streets new character is mr hoopers ghost im having trouble getting hyped for octopath to be honest i like that its retro but the gimmick reminds me too much of legend of legacy only octopath has eight instead of legends sixfrog and legend was made by atlus when its released ill give it a fair shot still for now i wanna go play final fantasy tactics around 1515 for those ppl who are wondering why they dont play xenogears anymore man i really want to play fft so what youre saying is well get to see a fft or war of the lions lets play soon i joke but that would actually be actually would that be fun for you guys im not sure how youd like a turnbased strategy game with multiple people there oh well easy come easy go i guess i would love to see a xenoblade blind stream im not sure how many people would watch since it would take a really long time and the gameplay isnt exciting to watch but is fun to play so i doubt they will do it but i would love to see their reaction to the story also just throwing it out there as lani keeps bringing up the xenogears thing i can only speak for my self but i personally wait till a series is done if it looks like one that i would like to binge watch ending a playthrough before finishing a game is one of my greatest petpeevs that a youtuber can do im still sour about nier at the moment im guilty of it too due to salt and sanctuary my recording became a mess and i am not sure how to fix it not to mention youtube editor is going down today my point is xenogears is a game that i would love to watch once its finished as i have fond memories of watching my brother play it once upon a time but the fact that you arent going to finish the series makes me not want to start it something so story heavy is meant to be binged i love the fact that i get an applebees ad before this am i the only one who was getting dizzu watching from both camera perspectives in the beginning can we get this but final fantasy tactics that would be fucking amazing while we are at it dig up tactics ogreogre battle or even xenogears for this and suikoden would probably look good in this kinda thing though youd need to change some stuff a bit also ripping the rights and ip of suikoden from konami i personally prefer quip lash over use your words feels faster i missed medieval jrpgs so fucking much i cant wait to buy a switch so i can play this game you can boost defense to survive the milk maid fight okay just gonna point this out octopath traveler is a game with not 8 but 4 move sprites so shouldnt it be quadpath traveller im usually not good at remembering birthdays so im going to say this now before i forget happy birthday lanipator grant first he ruins dbza and now he makes lanni get up to raise his mic volume will somebody please stop this monster the kai final chapters episodes also seem to have the music mixed in way too loudly fools every day is casual friday when you walk around in your tighty whities is that the king of games i hear also is that patrick seitz i love how its great voice acting and then the fighting animation is just bonk dead omg you guys are so funny and edgy i never heard that trump is a joke that is so funny you are so creative i cant believe you would say that pathetic creatures that pander to the lowest fruit and say they are entertaining do not deserve any praise or attention it is unoriginal and i thought below this group but apparently they will do anything for attention could you play some metroid samus returns how is the voice actor of olberic not typecast as dio they should do a playthrough of this the intro scared my dog lol love tfs honestly this game has a lot of potential it can even become the seiken densetsu 3 of this generation oh so thats why they stopped xenogears i kinda figured but it sucks cause i was really hoping they would finish it oh well still like everything else could you guys please play arslan the game really sucks that the enemies attacks arent animated its really jarring snes style sprite on very detailed 3d with very good looking lightingshaders im not a fan of that combination hey tfs crew i love and appreciate your videos thank you for making them im fine with voice acting cause it helps me get more into the story plus it seems pretty good so far thiss a game ill love you guys to do a series on octopath not jackbox cause we have plenty o that oh how i wish i could meet them first am i suppose to say that hello bruh what chapter 4 alf that zone has alot of mobs easy for grinding however it was more on the exp side where this video seemed to have a few more jp dreadwolf is the best encounter because with snatch you can steal 2xrevitalizing jams along with bp boost and you can steal on the second turn 10 shields is a lot but with 2 axe users and 2 double tomahawks available they dont last long why are all of these for low level early game im trying to level up for the final side quest not alfyn chapter fucking 2 i just used bewildering grace with 2 boost giving me 3 of it 1st gave me x5 jp 2nd gave me x2 xp and the third summoned a monster dealing 9999 damage to all enemies killing them immediately all these fast xp thing claming to level up early always need some level 40 for it work thats lame even better the area right outside marsalim in that small bazaar looking spot is a guaranteed 4 enemies that your sorcerer can 1 shot with only a single ice spell it breaks the scorpions so you get extra exp too with the starseer ability that increases jp you get about 400 every battle i have 2 alluring ribbons and a forbidden bow on to attract enemies insanely instantly my sorc is cyrus with knowledge staff bishop hat transcendent bow of shadows 2 elemental augment charms this boosts my elem attack by about 600 but without the gear i still 1 shot with the skills and using bp eater boost start augmented elements and elemental augmentation skills from sorc starseer scholar all i do is uses the ice spell once and boom 1100 exp and 400 jp also i didnt have the exp and jp badges on when i started this from olberic and ophelia side quests after ch4 and those were the base rewards for a break and domination pretty hefty i did however have the increase exp and jp im level 65 lol and i havent did the first chapter got all sub and adv classes i love the freedom of this game you could get powerful early weapons classds early explore the whole world to get you to that level another good one is just outside grandport with the kingfishers arrowstorm donate bp to scholar scholar with knowledge staff about 550almost 600 exp it is also great because you will right next to town with a safepoint and a tavern for switching out characters any ideas on how to grind xp above lvl 50 thanks for the video ive been looking for a place to grind for chapter 3 hoping to take on the secret job bosses soon what is aoe damage first you need a character lvl 40 or it wont work good work here man hope this helps people struggling to get leveled up yeah this is a good spot ran into a triple cait battle but ended up killing myself with bewildering grace trying to get an exp boost feels bad man how to easily level from 1040 in 3 easy steps first create a party of 4 50 characters its already been proven that unless your dancer is always 1st and youre running bp boost then dont use the dance just grind to one shot kill or one turn kill its much faster exp just killing this is such a good game i just unboxed it and its amazing d why isnt this on pc it looks so good the problem is by the time you get to this point there is no reason to do it could someone please explain why a peacock dance doesnt work with runelords abilitys when first time i played this game without referring any guide i chose thessa as a main i like her at first sight turns out she is the best teenage money grubber unique class in rpg history ever how many hours do you have i bought this game around september and played it for a while but i got bored of it pretty fast i also got my ps4 a little after buying this game might have had something to do with it but i recently picked it up again and ive been really enjoying it im about a 100 hours into the game now and havent even beaten all chapter 4s yet but im having a lot of fun building teams and op characters like this one your video definitely helped a lot i hate that primrose is so usefull because i really dislike her i had hanit as a theif equiped with double tomahawk so in addition to being a debuff god she also breaks anything super consistently for tressa to wipe the boss with also if alfyn lines up his concocts sometimes means i can just ignore the breaks and kill the boss with 2 balagor blade over 2 turns tressa for smash ultimate you could use hired help to summon random characters from octopath and summon the eight heroes as a final smash to beat the shit of opponents i personally like abusing runes with second serving and stat swap as needed on other characters as needed generally results in a lot more damage than this especially when cyrus or olberic get their turn it also doesnt really require bp youre gonna murder them with basic attacks which you can save for other important things how does he get stat buffs at the beginning of the fight question what weapons slots does the starseer job add to your character tressa deserves more love because she is the best i made primrose the runelord i made tressa the starseer olberic the warbringer and cyrus the sorcerer isnt there a better lance for elemental damage or are u using that one for the extra fire i am stuck on the high level bosses i was loving this game then mmxlc came out then i got gungeon i was playing dead cells then i started a minecraft world i love how many more games i play on switch this build is a bit of a one trick pony good stuff just not my cup of tea i dont get why you dont swap tressa and cyrus i mean tressa is better as a runelord overall but if you want to oneshot cyrus damage is much higher my cyrus with double elemental augmentor has 999 elem atk and tressa makes an excellent sorcerer wow ok im currently building up tressa actually so im going to use this build as a blueprint for mine this is great good video still working my way through the advanced job bosses but i already have tressa as my runelord so im on the right track would she be better for the first or second phase of the final boss do you have more videos like this for the other travelers im trying to get ready for the final battle tressa is best girl elemental aid is quite costly no lol its not only if you use elemental attacks a normal attack costs nothing so double of nothing is no sp used elemental aid is damn good for runelord also battletested shield is great for sp regen with elemental gear each of the party members can do 50k for a normal hit with tressas runelord buff i got a party build that uses no attack skills they only do normal attacks to save sp dear lord please do more of these build videos they are really structured and informative ill definitely be using this to beat galdera why not use alfyn and boost the entire party to 3 bp right off the bat instead of spamming donate bp wow nice build good stuff you can actually get 1 more elemental augmentor by doing the quest of the guy next to the entrance of wispermill and i think you need to kill the direwolf in the forest of purgation would this build work for cyrus primroses dance tnat gives you random buffsdebuffs is so good ive gotten the jp5 twice in one round of combat sotimes 10 you are the man if you finish the game you can go into final boss fight again is there a way to get more than 2 elemental augmentors ultra instinct tressa i like making cyrus into an god sorcerer elemental edgeelemental aidbpboostsurpassing power is really good when cyrus has a bishop staff and over 900 elem atk with only one elem augmentators is really broken hes also only at lvl 60 thanks for the videos i was stuck in the hidden dungeon after i found your content i used a few pointers from you and finally finished the game runelord is the only job i dont have now meanwhile my tressa is level 15 and i havent done any chapter 3s ill be way op when i continue the story best girl once again surprise the party with her talent you can probably swap out elemental edge for augmented elements and use peacock strut since its the same buff this build has 2 dancers that are faster than tressa so you can reliably pull that off i mean it doesnt matter because the bosses are already dead but its a way to get a little more damage is it better for tressa to have speed or max sp not all heroes wear capes but this one does this is why tressa is best girl oh my god this is the octopath version of the kosmos herald qtpi build hey i was wondering sometimes when i use leghold trap it doesnt change the turn order for the current or following turn at all so i sometimes have to wait for the next turn after the ones shown is there a reason for this it just seems kind of odd especially when i see it changing things immediately like in this video what are your thoughts on apothocary cyrus giving him the battle tested axe and the sub zero staff will make him a scary ice based nuke when tressa gives him an ice rune and he uses last stand 2 to ice and a 1 to lightning is nothing to scoff at i was wondering if there was a build similar to the herald qtpi build in xc2 in octopath i guess this is what i was looking for cant wait to finish the game and start doing those builds ill try this too nice build

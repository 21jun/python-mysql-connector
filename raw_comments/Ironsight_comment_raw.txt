ironsight call of duty this game looks 1 to 1 like call of duty what server did you use to get 250 ping i get 350 in na what server should i use for the best ping sa or eu im from australia ironsight try to copy cod not even close i thought warface was the worst fps game but comparing to this game warface actually good even its p2w game they paid a lot of money to the youtubers to promote their game this game is lack of update and content and they done nothing to the cheaters who destroyed their game the problem with ironsight matchmaking hitboxe high ping bullet registration netcode and of course the cheaters will destroy you ever single match this game will die soon its free you jackass you dont have any right to criticize anything that is free if you dont like it then fuck off and paly something else if wiple can move away from aeriagames which i understand why and kinda of somewhat know why due to all of the games aeriagames once held under them that no longer exist or has completely died if wiple does move to steam like how bungie did with destiny 2 after they parted with activision then yes wiple can fully revive ironsight as theyre on a platform thatll fully support them compare to aeriagames that likes to do thing their way if not then they simply keep them in the shadow without no form of support whenever i watch people as good as you mow down people online it reminds me of why i dont like online fps games lol i just started playing this game today and its so much fun but when you say there is coming nothing new is it even worth starting to find a ranked match i need over 20 min and casual is kinda bad my kd can be good as it want but we still losing because afk players and players that dont understand the object most underrated f2p game this game has only 245 players on steam right now this game is awesome if your bored of mw its worth your time what i learned from the first 42 seconds revival didnt go viral sticky all enemy down good work good job sarah i hope it does not undergo the same process as wolfteam i just saw ironsight has a steam page now httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp715220ironsight whats the best game to practice your aim if they will not add weapons and fixesthe game will die soon also we waited for a single map too much than the korean version and it never random when lobby creates why does a free to play game even need a publisher any way im waiting for it to come to steamstill not available on steam yet this game is just wannabe cod its going downhill just like black light retribution we have all those updates now on the global version this game really scratches my old school cod itch im loving it hi ironsight have an update lately it has more map new gun new gun category shield new skin and new season hope you can review this game again the weapon balance in this game is atrocious different bullet types need to be removed and the damage for all weapons needs to be reworked dead now due to modern warfare and warface too many hackers i played hours and then all of a sudden the client wasnt recognizing my account and i couldnt get into the game thats why i gave up so whats the name of the game then hmmmmmmmmmmmmm m mm i used to play ironsight during 8 month only ironsight no other game but it went from bad to worse and i let it down after 8 month of non playing i came back but nothing had changed march 2019 i think when there was a 30 steps event i played a few during kinda 3 weeks just to complete the event and left lets give it some last try boom they just added ballistic shields today im still upset they havent added their client onto steam yet asians will have different view too u know if ironsight wont have asian servers as we have to play the ironight global with about 400 ms its such a great game really hope the steam release is soon i loves it but i quit cause of the netcode kill trading 543 549 so minecraft literally minecraft this is a good game if they got this put on the ps and xbox stores it would have a massive player base i love my teammates in that game just arguing about the ping lol i mean its true this game needs to come to console i love it is this game coming to steam and console my fav fps game csgo warface ironsight just downloaded the game yesterday and i love it much more fun than apex pubg or fortnite its nonstop action put it on ps4 and xbot too then add a few updates and maybe it wont be trash anymore tried the game got tired of getting killed by people who arent there in my screen im playing since a couple of months now level 32 and im loving this game its real fun but its really frustrating to hear we wont see any updates very soon really want new maps haha u need skill in this types of gameno luck so no one play man i really just need this game to do one thing fix the god damm fpsperformanceoptimization like holy shit i can play vr at constant 90fps i can play battlefield 1 at almost max setting at 60fps and i cant play this game whitout constantly drop to 20fps im pretty sure all support for the global version is gone there are no weapons available for rent you have to buy them all with currency permanently and a lot of the things in the shop and loadout menu are buggy dont work or are missing what happened it is def still playable and fun can you do dirty bomb its also a f2p game and i really realyy like it i downloaded game today i entered the battle and i was been selected with someone who is 140 level it wasnt good for me thx so much for making this video i played it so much and now i found it thx to you its amazing free to play fps thats been in openbeta since march 2018 if not earlier the game has been in openbeta for 2 years buy a real game the game has bad hit boxes ping based must lead shot worse netcode and pay to use weapons my favriote to have the pay 2 win aspect in open beta shows what the game will be about to unlock attachments for weapons is a grind the game doesnt have potential sadly as its a knockoff with no originality the weapon system seems copied from blacklight retribution is this on xbox man i honestly dont know why more games like this arent on console theres so many ppl who own consoles and there is little amount of games like this its call of duty and that is pretty much it the selection of shooters is so lame is insane does anyone know any ironsight like games wish there were iron sight you tubers i thought you meant a gun without sights very disappointed i feel like this games gone nowhere since its been released sucks cus i do really like it looks sickkkkk i hope they get back to updating can we use the same acc european server or global account on steam asia just play the asia version on steam if youre ausnz me and all my aus mates play it i uninstalled after they ruined the quickscoping in the game and made it an smg run and shoot with no ads never installing this shit again i just dont want to lose any of my progress if they merge global and asia i have every gun and tons of gp i really dont want to grind gp again after they already nerfed the amount you get need to release on ps4 same with insurgency ww3 when i see iron sight in steam i instantly download it ironsight was a lot of fun a shamemaybe it can recover maybe wiple will take over global idk is that a higher fov that 90 i cant tell on my phone would you ever play my game someone help me out a sec and tell me if i should get iron sight lets give an f to aeriagames wiplegames needs to make the asia version worldwide i cant download it on steam i used to love that game but i wish they wouldve turned it more into a esport with ranks and such its too casual the fps with amd cpu are shit on this game in bo4 i get like 70 80 fps in this 90 and the it drops to 40 is it on ps4 too warface is ded but it even better than this trash game just release this on consoles its not even on steam yet i downloaded iron sight from steam 2 days ago but i have only 2 to 3 unlocked weapons i have seen that this game contains alot of weapons can somebody tell me how can i unlock other weapons there is an option to buy the weapons with gold but the gold is too much rare and i only got 200 to 300 gold per match is there any other way i thought he was talking about cod this game would have been solid on consoles and their business model i didnt like at all but it looks like they missed their chance as mw is around the corner and that game surprisingly looks fantastic hi how can i play ironsight on asian servers or cant i its because its an indie game and once they screwed their launch with no content the gane died and remains dead there are only 2 good f2p games apex and fortnite dont buy this crap if you want cod just buy it hi im new on the chanel iron sight looks like a cheap call of duty knockoff i being in asia is living off wiple and i can get the shield if i wanted the obt asia version is damn good i have been playing ironsight over a year now way before the steam release i live in asia now whenever i play ironsight through client login thing sometimes i get kicked out of match because of high ping which i do understand now i have interest in steam version of ironsight but i cant seem to transfer my saved progress i have unlocked so many cool skins and guns which i like if only they allowed that then i switch to steam version black squad has better visuals overall game and gun feel but the game is in the process of dying its filled with hackers to the brim the developers no longer care about it and it is going downhill its still playable and if someone hasnt played it can enjoy it for 50 hours because netcode gameplay guns and everything is just so much better than ironsight but beware black squad is not doing well at all ive been saying this since 2018 this is a game that only exists to be milked by publishersdevelopers ive first played in the cbt in november 2017 and since then nothing has changed with the game they only added a few maps they cant fix netcode they cant fix clan wars they havent added any new weapons snipers are quickscoping for years now they only add ugly skins for the cash shop and are so lazy that they make skin creating contests for the community because they are out ideas and want stupid players to make them skins for free this game is going nowhere it just sort of exists until it dies because even the most faithful of players will finally see that the game isnt going to get any better they will leave and it will go down in history as one of the most forgetful and mediocre f2p fps games out there ava blacklight retribution ghost in the shell first assault combat arms soldier front arctic combat etc all had something that made them memorable a this is the first i am hearing about this game and it looks amazing is it on ps4 give us dedicated servers we can host ourselves and something like promod tried it again tonight and what a disappointment few times the lobby just hung had so much potential i agree but think they botched it well at least be happy you guys dont suffer the wrath of the riot shield complete frontal damage block you can still melee with the shield shield bash grenades dont kill the dude deagle sidearm its cancer in form as soon as i heard aeria that was the answer your thoughts on rogue company upcoming hirez game its a free to play game it is probably not so easy to constantly make updates just a thought its a great p2w game when is it coming to steam though but global isnt on steam 10 k views thats what happening to iron sight edit btw i am from india and i am gonna try this game soon any recommendations for better ping its so sad on the direction this game is going i really wanted to get back into this game but someone hacked one of my accounts that i did so well with i cant even play it lol cause its removed in my country for some reason if i click on start nothing happens who can help me pls they need to put ironsight on console it will make ironsight popular and if they keep momentum can pass fortnite the question you should answer is why playing a shooting game called ironsight and not csgo i think krunkerio is better please subskribent to my channel if you want to see a gameplay answer not bloody too much i mean ffs we still havent got the eu client on steam for crying out loud also these community events are a joke whoever dreamed of this sd event should be fired thanks but i aint gonna play 100 sd to get slightly better rewards when there is such a minuscule playerbase in global to begin with and yes i am really angry because i want this game to succed but so far this aint happening this call of duty not get any updates thats normal activison fault xd i know its not cod this is just a joke where is your video for sf2 skill special force 2 servers are now offline i dont know i still think they are working on something special to meet eu and na quality standards and thats the reason it is taking so long i could be wrong but you can only hope this is my favorite youtuber i didnt know aeria games is publishing this game now i know why it has such a troubled development this game died as fast as it came the asian version gets a lot of update these past few months from optimization to features and map updates gamigo seems to be swallowing a really big job cuz it struggles to communicate specially now that they are releasing a b2p version non p2w of arch age they just got boosted up from being a mobile game dev it should be like the global version is one or two patch behind the original version thats not how it is in gamigos handling there are more hackers i quit for this big problem just buy cod black ops 4 just look at counter strike online version in diffrent country and counter strike nexon zombie update all the version have diffrent update when will it be available on steam i tested itthe shield sucks a bit im a agressive player what do yo recommend me subfusil or fusil but i think subfusil is with no experience saludos desde colombia warface or ironsight im done playing this game because the gun was overpowered no balance team smg guns are shit offensive drone is useless they need to remove ammo upgrade and lots of hacker ps4 version please aeriagames is notorious for publishing a solid game and killing it can u help my friend youtube channel qubeo vlogs and gaminf you should check out hired ops wait for the steam realease and the well see i think when will exactly the block start the block will be effective starting from january 14th 2019 what will happen to my account if im in one of the blocked countries your aeria game account will remain available and you will be able to play our other games as usual however access to ironsight will be blocked what countries does it affect the countries affected are the following russian federation republic of armenia republic of azerbaijan republic of belarus republic of estonia republic of kazakhstan kyrgyz republic republic of latvia lithuania republic of moldova republic of tajikistan turkmenistan republic of uzbekistan georgia ukraine why are you blocking us your access to ironsight will be blocked since aeria games will no longer have the publishing rights for your region so global yes well then fuck you bruh you cant play if you are near russia it sucks ass fuck dis gam love this game wish it got more publicity i need to get back into it remember line of sight lol your ping problem is not because of your connection problem it is a problem with asia servers sometime i got throw into singapore server 3040 ms but sometime i get the korean server 100 ms or more so yeahin the roadmap they said that they would fix this so try log back in to see if ping is better doesnt matter when they finally release na and eu versions to steam it will instantly take off or so i hope i want to download ironsight now but my pc is broken lmao i subscribe and like the video can you play ironsight atm if so where do i download is iron sight demanding iron sight problems list 1 the game is still on beta after more than a year 2 the matchmaking is horrible 3 the ranked mode is inexistant 4 the clan wars doesnt exist 5 more cheaters are coming in or still play this game 6 the netcode is one of the worst ive ever seen on a fps game 7 dsync is everywhere on this game 9 the servers lag like they were hosted on a server host for pigeons 10 the snipers are way too op they must be nerfed 11 no competitons 12 aeria games so we know how the game is gonna finish 13 no update no fix after a long long time and no informations 14 the forum of the game is half dead already 15 glitch spawnkill and get killed while running to hide behind a wall 16 a lot of macro users which is illegal btw 17 crym0de and hacker clans are known for their illegal use of wh and aimkey and are still playing freely 18 more than half of stars levels are cheaters thats worst than sf2 while there low levels were the one cheating the most 19 no new g once ironsight gets on steam it will kill battalion 1944 can i please get a voucher for krunkerio i dont have money to buy krunkies if they can make a gun game mode with a huge content update and a steam release in the same update the game would sky rocket and then they would have to keep updating to keep up the momentum like you said undercover bro just came here to say that i miss the fucking combat arms ripcae kinda like how with elsword the korean servers where getting patches months if not almost a year in advance hmmm the game is good but aeria games just sucks they didnt manage to bring out one game that was long time fun for me 200 the game is techically split into 3 ironsight global eu americas ironsight russia ussr countries and ironsight asia tbh i literally forgot about this game snipers are soooooo annoyingly easy to use and get kills in this game u are very good in fps games ironsight is going to be my last chance for pc gaming if it is a hacker fest pc gaming is dead i played it a few months ago and loved it but i need to see how it will do on steam this game is really good but it has nothing interesting and gets repetitive i play it as warm up before apex legends and thats it just dont like the running animation if krunker gets released on steam will more people play krunker great i cant play it because the site just says 404 error cant open site or something like that now you know how the eu players felt befor nexon put eu and na together im never gonna get used to that intro am i why i cant download it from steam p this game is gonna die off within the year atleast for the global version the problem is that i really want to play this game but whenever is start this game and play matches or training after a couple of seconds the server kicks me out because reaching ping limit any fixes please reply if this game went to steam people would go ape shit over this game do black squad to support it the player base is bad finally somehting else except krunker make a video on hired ops sad man this game is so dead i heard you mention ironside asia quite a bit the russian version is the farthest and version that hasnt been mentioned by you once in the roadmap that wiple games posted it says they will add more servers on other region hope they will cover australia too i hadnt played the game for months i go to the launcher and it tells me i have to re download the game cause the update couldnt extract or something my net is trash in victoria so just gave up lol gonna wait for the steam global it should have been on steam from the beginning imo i hope aeria games sees this video and starts changing and updating this game im a huge fan of this game and i would be so sad if dies game dies aeria games please do something i saw the asian versions roadmap yesterday on ironsights discord and i wasnt sure if it was 100 real or not this video pretty much confirms my fears and yes im scared for this game because it feels like it might be abandoned while there is a small dedicated player base there is nothing that makes me want to continue playing it ive unlocked all the guns and even made a second account to continue that sense of progression but the game feels dead to me its sad to see the global version of the game in this state because while i dont play the game anymore i still log in everyday to collect the daily rewards so that i would be prepared for the next update its been a few months since their last major update and im losing hope that this game will grow ive made a bunch of ironsight lets plays in the past there are only two videos are on my channel because i decided to delete the others and i would definitely love to continue making videos on this game even skipping when is iron sight coming to southafrica i cant download it on steam im not even able to play this game because its not available in my region if you play the ironsight asia heres the ip address of the sea which is in singapore server 11023420251 you can use it to track which server you are connecting to and block connection to the kr and jp servers such that the game connects you to the sea one in the ironsight wiple games discord a guy by the name neocelestium who did this to get a decent ping you can also use the ip address and use cmds ping command to know what kind of ping you will get i have a feeling in your previous video the game connected you to the kr server because the singapore server was in maintaince that week however lately wiple games have been trying to update and improve the server routing so you may not need to do this anymore but still could be useful later what a coincidence i just redownloded it yesterday and played nonstop i was so hyped because i was doing good undercoverdudes i hope ironsight wont die its too good game to let it shut and what do you think about hired ops free to play ive played it several times and its not bad but i expected something better and playerbase could be bigger too is there another f2p call of duty like fps game now except warface that different how do you record in ironsight its kinda normal that asia as more updates as free games work better there its kinda normal that asia as more updates as free games work better there try to play apb reloaded iron sight is the most underrated fps game in my opinion this game is kinda a huge dissapointment its not wiples fault theyre doing a great job as you mentioned in the video this game has a lot of potiential as a kind of content creator myself im quite dissapointed in the lack of updates the core gameplay is great and i think wiple should build on that few player play ironsight steam now but or just me though but its super smooth on lower end pc and i think tge movement late is fix and some bugs fix its cool now but after that the player started to disappeared but overall its super cool and awesome i really wanna play this but im on vaca planetside arena if finally coming sept 19 hey its my bday it would mean a lot if you guys said happy bday 512 how do you get hit by that thats so bullshit xd i love krunker and i just got a legendary skull head thing and purple sniper skin in my only 2 elite spins i am lucky today its batter win you play krunker yo ive been thinking about playing ironsight this video really encouraged me to download it i firs write this comment how will you do the kr giveaway hey is the global version released now im locked in asia server it is better to buy a game for 60 because all free to play game have same problem like this bad hitreg bad netcode bugs teleports and others shit so buy game from steam stop waste time on trash free to play game d game is crap what the slove of unknown file version datamap ironsightwpg just released globally on steam today d i live in asia and i paly in europe server isnt funny that the game looks as good if not better than the new blyat ops 3 and 4 jackfrags video was sponsered but you can tell that he actually put some time into the game and he really enjoyed it now to address the elephant in the room yes ironsight is heavily inspired by old school cod4black ops 1 era almost to the point of some people calling it a rip off i dont see it that way cod 4 mw was my all time favorite fps besides aa 20 and this game brings me back call it what you will it has very solid gameplay and im loving the low ttk a well placed headshot from the right gun yourre dead its twitch based gameplay at its finest and its exactly what me and many others have been craving since the early cod games these devs are building a game that we wished activisiontreyarch had made more of cant wait for an official steam release so we can get the ball truly rolling with this game sd mode is amazing i just wish they would add a lean mechanic to this game it would make sd just that much better youre forced to play more tactical is this in steam for people in the usa just saying bo4 isnt pay 2 win its pay to win in the sence if the skin but you cant buy a really good weapon too bad i dont see this game making a comeback small player base no rankedcompetative team modes clans are just useless no matchmaking for them a lot of movements is fucked and bugged i have 90 fps on this game with a certain settings and the dustwater on some maps that sparkles out makes it 15 but the biggest issue is that this game isnt well known nor does it have a large active playerbase maybe if they get on steam and bring back ranked modes such as teamclan and solo i can see this game making it you dont have to pay for the battle pass in bo4 playable in estonia with steam is that a multiplayer game can i play with my friends when update steam ironsight date bo4 battle pass is free so how is that pay to win it is actually play to win is ironsight free and can i download it on steam and is there a possibilty that you can download game fast cuz my wifi is actually not that good cant get it on steam is you fps based on max setting is this game payy to win i just started this game today and now im at lvl 20 with a 20 kd wow this game feels amazing ironsght aka call of duty mobile xd why every time i try to download this game it tells me i have malware i dont know what to do im an australian i play the game in australia on asian servers but i dont lag and i get in games easily i also love the game ironsight doesnt work for me wtf yo im in asia and like i aint no chinese nor korean im filipino do ironsight obt have ph servers so when is it coming out for steam i had the normal launcher but i cant login anymore worth 5gb of my storage this game is too good for a free to play game i started playing a week ago and i am loving it in the steam it says that you need to integrate the aeria games account guys what is the current state of the game im thinking about jumping back in last time i played the netcode was horrible and thats why i stopped what are your top 3 fps shooters i really like ironsight but would like to try out other games as well also ive tried warface and i dont like it i cant play the game anymore becose of this ping limit can you see your body when you look down in this game i used to love the game but after i deinstalled i wasnt able to download it aigan it just says the connection to the download server is disrupted and then nothing my internet is fine and aeriagames support is bullshit im still playing combat arms cuz my pc is shit v australia is in oceania not asia lol ive always wanted this game to get bigthey need to make more maps tho i need to wait the developer to remove the freemium it so ridiculous because the noob will always use the armor piercing and magnum round it so annoying does this game have snd thisactually seems like a nice update might have to go back to it now edit nope still shit they still let ppl with 300 ping play the game like for real if i play with any sniper they guy got mp7 i see he splaydding they realy have to fix this thing if they want to have a good game still net code sucks but not like as last time its mach better 1002 but their discord server is updated a lot so its fine for many yes its cool so long as they dont change the fact that this games monetization is perfect they will get my money black ops 4 battlepasses are free to all users i started to play this game when it got released i stopped it because of the bad netcode but im on my way to play it again i hope that they changed the netcode to upd ima get this i cant play this game when i open the game i just get a black screen guys u can download the game on their page how much pay to win is ironsight aka disconnected from server the game not sure i like that trade kills are gone d there are game where you spawn run die and let enemy at 1hp every single time i just dont like how there is different kind of ammunition in this game weaker and stronger ones and youre only able to have them for like 7 days30 etc also avg ping above 400 ms thats way too much cut that down to like 250 or even more someone who is averaging above 200 shouldnt even be on the server black ops 4 is not pay to win the gun variants you get dont change the stats of the weapon just the look its a great game i love how it plays you dont need to buy battlepass in bo4 wtf are u talking about im also an aussie and been playing ironsight almost since the beginning on my second account nowlvl 67 after first one lvl 55 went kaput somehow so if other comments are correct the wiple asia steam version does work for aussies but we cant carry over our beta account as its tied to aeriagames this will make me pretty sad if this is indeed the case i guess thats the price you pay for playing beta anyway huge potential for this game and im still having fun in beta for as long as thats going to last undercoverdudes which do you prefer the asia or the na eu version saw you in the na eu version long ago playing in the same room sad me and my partners accountin the aeria version cannot be accessed in the steams asia version do i have to register on aeriegames or whats it called please make more ironsight vids any more free games available for my low end pc any suggestions i am from south asia but i am having really really high ping sometimes 5000 i mean wth well i m in download this game to try it out frustrating has the letter r in it twice fyi frustrating not fustrating ill take a crack streaming it for you mate im not big or anything in fact i get 1 viewer average but if you think itll help by all means havent been able to play it first because of shitty aus servers years ago whenever i first heard of it and then realising the asian servers were a whole other game download ill play this again eventually but as i started to see it its too late for this game to get some light on it hopefully im wrong also i remember the paying system seemed shitty af but thats speaking years back so hopefully shits changed when i finally jump in again im still waiting july 26 can we get iron sight on xbox next why do we only get nasty p2w warface i have a question i play in the south america servers and i saw u have shotguns i dont understand why we dont have the shotguns do our achievements skins and items have a chance to be transferred to the final version of the game yo i was in this vid add me im hyp4 how u play like 60fps all time while im lagging as fuck will oce servers ever be released in black ops 4 you dont need to buy the battlepass its 100 free the asian version of ironsight on steam already opened server for korea japan and sea so my best bet is they will open one for oce as well yea wiple and aeria games kinda suck at marketing this game why do they have split right to publish and therefore publishing two different versions in different regions makes not sense and as you said their communication is awful along with that they are also bad at calling in new players to game this game look better and less clunky than the new modern warfare i think it goes like this warframenever played it tf 2 ironsight paladins are you from nz the snipers are op you dont buy the battle pass in bo4 will it ever be possible to play on console is there a decent oce community for this game surely they can get oce servers at some point people waiting for a steam release but you can download it right from their website for na httpsironsightaeriagamescom pay to win major downside is that the boxes are far too heavily weighted on the shitside of the rewards pool on all boxes basically a box that has 12 rewards in the pool 11 are rare skins the remaining reward is 50 chips 999 of all boxes opened rewards you with chips if they even allow the rare skins in the reward pool at all because i have yet to see any rare drop ever so yeah the one thing i didnt mention when i began my little rant here is that i have for the sake of research purchased 100 of these rare boxes not a single one dropped anything of value so if anyone wants to do the math on what was wasted costs 499 ap to buy 1 box so heres the payment table for ap you do the math 33750ap 25000 19050 15000 12500 10000 6000 5000 2875 2500 1100 1000 500 500 bo4 is pay2win now but battle passes dont cost any money i play the actual game where you have to update and stuff top fragmovie on my channel on game ironsight are there even australian servers i used to play this game religiously i know it was in beta at the time wow yeah but how have they not been sued these maps are 11 ripoffs of black ops maps you are guaranteed to run into cheating hackers in this game it is deliberate there is absolutely no penalty for it if you want to try out making aim hacks online this game is your sandbox but ps4 and xbox is there a controller support once this game hits consules its gonna be big after they fix everything free game with cod style cool p2w sad but they need money to keep the game alive gun repair no respect at all for the players its the sad truth the thing that killed it for me was the servers and the buggy launcher now that they have massively improved both those things and released it on steam i will be definitely be playing free to play fps games ironsight and splitgate i played ironsight like a year ago got really good and then it got boring i might pick it up again after watching tho jeez ironsight only for asia and then roe only for na if im not mistaken you dont pay at all for the bo4 battlepass its kind of pay to win but the thing is those dlc weapons are equal or not as good compared to the weapons already in the game you can get some more fun but less combat effective weapons probably shouldve checked up yes technically to some degree its pay to win but its nowhere near as bad as you put it i hope this game come to console black ops 4 battle pass is free im in australia and its annoying as my internet is horrible 500mpbs download this sucks because i experience so many ping errors they need to get oceania servers soon or give us access to the asia servers or i might not play until nbn comes if you dont mind can you tell me youre sensitivity unfortunately i gave up on the game when they transfered post ussr country players to mailru servers i truly loved it had a blast playing it but i neither understand russian nor do i want to play on russian servers theyre cancerous either ways i hope the game will have bright future i remember trying to download this game on the site it was a hard process for some reason and it never worked out i was getting booted for high ping even though my ping says 40ms too bad cant play it ive played ironsight a bit and in my opinion it is garbage for me it didnt seem like any fun i just got it and its literally so amazing i bet this game is owned by activision but under a different name i need some time to adapt from warface to ironsight black ops 4 is everything but call of duty only br retards like bo4 glad its getting these update but they should have done this much earlier while the game still retain it popularity does the game still have some of the bs free to play transactions it had at the beginning i remember unlocking ammogrenades and stuff and it expired after a few days so you would like rent items it felt really shitty to play and was eventually the reason my buddy and i quit bo4 never had a paid season pass but now the activision effect is in full swing and they be like money money money money money money money money fps isue solved or no i miss my pc now im stuck playing d2 on xbox im in that game play my gamer tag is thunderw01f another pay to win fps nice copy of warface pretty good game havent played since the update though my somewhat outdated opinion is that the core gameplay is smooth and enjoyable the guns kinda all felt a bit samey to me though and the maps werent really all to my liking but for a free game its hard to deny how well put together the whole thing actually is im for sure gonna give this another look now that i knows theres been a fairly substantial update overall i would say if you like cod style fps games and hate shitty mtx systems then this game is worth a try and not just because its free this is amazing news it means that more people will try it out in the future which means that the game will be more popular i love the game and i hope more people will download it there gonna need console if they want to be revolutionary more cheaters in this game auto aim i love getting soo much ping in this gamett they need to add battle royale mode black ops 4s battle pass is free tf2 review 2019 when s the gaming minority aussies great to see this game is on steam i hope they can go the extra mile and bring it to console so even more people can enjoy this wonderful game im so tired of seeing reviews of how good a game is then you download it and log on and theres like 10 people online i hate how pretty much every single game is getting a battlepass why you have to pay to gain access to the items in it and then actually play the game in most cases you have to play the game a lot to get the items am i the only one who thinks its bad i hope they add ctf to this game the game is awesome it will be nice if they make a zombie mode or pvp infection mode nice now there is an asian server now asians assemble why are there mixed reviews on the game oo ps4 release last i checked bo4 battle pass is free 105 the future of it should be porting it to console plain and simple are there bots on this game im not familiar with how to use mouse and keyboard and would like to practice before playing with people ive always wanted to play ironsight but the only thing thats holding me back is that inclusion of the battle pass system im honestly really tired of doing battle passes since almost every multiplayer game ive played has one unless i want to support the developers this item is currently unavailable in your region oh well dont even bother with the game they cant even get their shit together enough to properly release it i just dont like how most of the people i play with just hip fire only and never aim down sight but when you have ping limited that just not fun why isnt this game on ps4 still waiting for a optimization for amd cpus and gpuscuz the game is unplayable you can you pls check out bullsf its an old free fps i really like black ops 4s battle pass is free it changes every operation the people who get the weapons are the ones who play when they are active i love ucd but the most fustrating thing about this video is his inability to pronounce the word itself ive heard of ironsight before and people always said it was bad so i never downloaded it but after watching this video i think i might try it and great video first time watching this channel and i subbed keep up the awesome content any help with links to the new launcher i downloaded from the oficial game site and after downloading the game says its old should be deleted and reinstalled i did it again and still the same i even manually downloaded and installed from a link i got on reddit then it goes black screen im really liking it from the videos but i mean how are people going to get into the game with these problems im from south afrika hope i will eve able to play on eu servers what game is this looking forward to this as the game launcher doesnt work on my pc just buy titanfall 2 for ironsight im scared only from reloading animation in skinned weps that require real money can be faster than regularfree one oh really i need to buy dope guns i might check it out again thanks malaysia cant use asia version bruh activation should be very concerned about a free to play game that nails the old style call of duty feeling in my opinion the joke is i cant run it undercoverdudes wiple games have their own discord server through which you can talk to them directly engeneral is at the bottom the link to their discord is at their facebook page try looking for someone called wiplechris ive made a thread in the ironsight forums where i show all differences between the asian client and the aeria client theres is some differences in content like a new map lootboxes changes bullet attachments etc i wouldnt say bo4 is pay to win but its definitely anti consumer a lot of the weapons that you can get buy gambling your money are terrible or average compared to base game weapons play realm royale pls tradekills are fair more then not i like that thing cause if u shot more precise like hs but the one u go against is weaker aim but he is greater backstabbing and u kill each other its fair both of u are great but in diff areas its fair u or me only die i always hated it i saw that asia only has ironsight for steam and so want to play again but on steam bo4 multiplayer isnt pay to win by any means if you lose alot and blame it on the dlc weapons that you dont have it means you suck for the first time thank god i am asian i so hype for this game i am kinda addicted it will not let me log in even tho i know the password been like this for weeks please help sir your pc specs you dont need to buy the battle pass that has weapons in it those are free you only have to buy cosmetic one but still sucks notice service territory preobt ver httpssteamcommunitycomgames783770announcementsdetail1593626866154570918 bro i was in this vid im hyp4 im an australian and the asian steam server works perfectly for me but i had to make a new account i think the accounts are region locked is the game dead or is just me cause i cant find any games its not letting me download didnt it did i like this game but if you dont pay you can still earn the gunswhich have worse stats than other stock guns just put some time in id say alot of the battlepass for bo4 is cosmetic i have not spent a dime on bo4 however i still have a few of the guns that you can get from the battlepass you are not forced to buy dlc and i have noticed that if you have the dlc its harder to find games when the game dies out that is can anyone explain to me why he would say these things i really have no clue would u play roblox phantom forces if this game were to come to console it would dethrone all call of duty games wanna hear something funny i used to get around 100150ms on eu servers but now that the asian version is out us middle east players are region locked out of the aeriagames version and now i cant get less than 250ms d you know that the battlepass in bo4 is free i know that voiceare you pewdiepie i used to play this game back when it was first getting popular unfortunately the game just kinda died out because the didnt really update it im glad it has been getting some love and the steam release is great thinking of getting back into it 3 just aeria games being aeria games m8 regarding the battlepass stuffwhy no f2p title has any good free battle passyou talked about bo4 and its battle pass being p2w but for me there is no diference in paying o get lots of stuff and playing free to get up to 4 rewards in a lot of play timeyea theres no pay to win elements but there is little to no free cosmetics in the game and already way too much tuff despite the game not being old at allbattle passes for me could be the solution for these problens making you play to get nice looking cosmetics for free but noif you want pretty much any you need to paynot saying its bad since the game is endeed f2p with no p2w elements at all but come on m8the game has soo many skinsmany characters and soo little of this customization is available for free playersjust make a battle pass with less fancy skins but with actual stuff for free not the old 30 levels4 itens you can getmake female characters available without the need of spend yeeeesss please steam release i bet this comment will get 1m likes info by sxt4rvz currently top 10 in ranked member of hackers clan ranked is almost dead most people in this game are really bad or not intrested in sd if you solo que you wont find a game unless hackers clan or imm0rtals is queing and than you will lose 05 in about 5 minutes whats annoying is that we have to bait people into ranked by going in the generel chat tell the players when a match is finished so they can que and tell them that you get rewards like in csgo were you can get a drop in the end most of the time we are trying to play ranked for 2 hours and in total get 35 games each game we win gets us 1 up to 7 points the ranked one player is platinum vit goes up to grandmaster if we lose so far only happend 9 times we lose 30 points fixes more motivation and tournaments wich will start again soon so finaly a challenge rewards for weekly 5 ranked games or seasonal or like in csgo with random drops ranked as missions netcode way bettersti same thing with middle east players we play on european servers because we get high ping on asian servers but we cannot play the game what is name game 16th lol imho its the best cod like twitch shooter out there at this moment even cod cant touch it it just needs more tlc from the devs the publisher and the community its not that weird that the game is split a lot of games have their own asian version for ages now they have other rules and restrictions they have to comply to in order to have the game out on that market best f2p fps right now would you recommend that i try it out well they just fucked themselves in the ass steam has a piss poor anti cheat im sorry but you dont have to buy the supply stream battle pass in bo4 you have the option to buy tiers in the stream with the recent updates to the game they have added weapons into supply drops which make the game somewhat paytowin i would pay 1030 euros to play this game its amazing though that its completely free and playtowin instead of pay to win like black ops 4 has become still wainting for the steam release its only avaible for asia now c im still playing it bruh wooo its so fun but yes it needs more way things to do and more content would be amazing and maybe more game modes like gun game omg that would be amazing i really love the game but i havent been keeping up with it or playing recently not for us someone disliked before even watching the videopiece of shit you sound like mattcs you should use your perks like quick reloading for ars and quick aim for snipers they are very helpful in tight wars ive played this game for ages and now just got backed to it and it feels alot betetr i reccomend playing it oh this game looks crazy very nice we should play together sometime if ironsight europe had asians updates and been introduced onto steam the game would blow up but since aeriagames is trash and dont wanna let wiplegames manipulate eus side nothing will happen game is pretty good but has a lot of annoying bugs and also the netcode is still not good for people who doesnt understand what i mean players with a higher ping can kill you behind walls expect these aspects the game is really great but the playerbase is really small oh and to correct you you said that the dsr is always a 1shotkill weapon doesnt matter where you hit the enemies thats not really true if you hit the enemy below the stomach its a hitmark and not a one shot kill nice simple game looks fun ive never heard of this hey everyone new video from a fps called ironsight i played this late last year when it was in alpha but they polished it up a whole lot since then you can download it for free thanks for watching squad this game need a campaign sweet game im gonna try it out u ripped off a video bruh even the footage of the gameplay and the commentary like nigga plz did you only discover this in 2018 lol controller support early will bring kids into the game unfortunately and in a beta kids arent good is this on xbox we need this in console bro i just fell in love with this game its an awesome game whats your sensitivity then again this is just open beta you never know what they will add to it to make it even better agreed but you can easily use a controller with ironsight using steam big picture mode i made a 2 min tutorial check it out i just started playing this game today and i have to say it has to be the most fun ive had in an fps game in a very long time theres no bullshit if you die its your fault no stupid abilities to reward shit players guns are balanced streaks are powerful in the right hands but they arent annoying by any means and can all be shot down fairly easilythey even have a partner program for content creators in a nutshell this game is everything cod used to be for free this game will killllllllllll call of duty with 3 reason it fking free to play low system requirements but graphics is very beautifull dont need much storage plz send the data folder to me of ironsight one of the map wpg fipe has corrupted plz hardly cod is better imagine killing everyone with a gold akdamn boi with unbiased opinion i can confirm it is indeed better than cod honestly everygame is better then cod finally a new fps game that actually has a potential cod has zombies and campaign but as multiplayer goes much better guys its cod mw2 they made cod and thats it like what you want me to say i want this on console what specs pc you need to play this do more of this i dont see how ppl are shocked that a f2p game is better than cod yeah and ps2 is a f2p game better than bf whats your point are you going to do more ironsight stuff i know that bo4 is coming soon but the content would be much appreciated this game honestly sucks a wanna use anything but an smg too bad cuz if you use anything but an smg you die instantly from getting melted just hip fire everything then you win literally the bots with their clunky ai and over sensitive aimbot are more fun to play against then real people sniping is a joke if you want something fun to do and wanna give this a try then go ahead cuz its free but just cuz its free doesnt mean its good this game is possibly the best game does it have an asian or sea server 150 wow your gtx 1080 ti didnt drop frames below 140 on this game that looks incredibly mediocre hope i see you in the game you will get rekted so this is usas version of the chinese game cod online fuckin china man they get all the good shit i wander how much they payed you to say this shitty game was awesome this game is like bf4 cod crossover this weapon already captures 16 of my screen how am i suppose to play this game my issue with this game is the rented ammo this is complete game changer and shouldnt be monetized like that in my mind ironsighth is like jesus open his arms for old school cod players while he saying come my brothers you guys no longer need to fight for the the promised land good new cod just chill your ass on ironsigth playing sabatonthe last stand it looks free why the hell would i pay for cosmetics yess i like it a lot its like black ops 2 and modern warfare 2 in one 2018 game this looks like a lot of fun will be checking it out if this came to ps4xbox cod would go bye bye if battlefield and call of duty had a child it would look like this gold cam on nubtube gp game points what a dipshit gtx 1080 but you arent used to playing mouse and keyboard lol they need better asian servers does it come on steam i was worried about the settings on my 1080ti the best card you can get right now hey guys check ouy my sniper montage the sniper in this game is amazing pc requirements and pc download size this is better then cod just started gaming i play cod ww2 tdm an i was thinking it would be cool if you could talk to the other team in game i think it would get alot more people on mics which im assuming be better for the game its not like players are using mics to tactically win tdm dont get fooled guys he is sponsored ofcourse he will say positive things only the netcode is really fucking awful and the map design is bad too are the kill times still too long are u mad ironsight vs bo2 we all know who wins warface is coming to console and is available on pc very similar to ironsight maybe you could check this out too so many games i wanna play but cant coz the ping in my country is just crazy when is that law suit from activision and treyarch coming do some challenges hopefully this game is good with lowend pcs wait u cant use controller on this game hey guys have you tried special forces 2 its also a good fps online game with good details it was made by unreal tho the title is misleading everything is better than cod remastered xv it should be more like the game that would finally put the last nail to the coffin just played this game on intel hd4000 graphics hp elite folio laptop 60 fps playable not bad decent shooter yea fortnit duh lost me at explosive throwing knives so this is better then warface in my opinion ever game is better than new cod they should add it to steam was all good until you said no controller support so fuck this game its so damn much to download it jesus dont download i downloaded it from the link in the description and avast antivirus found a virus this game actually isnt good at all ill be honest with you guys ive played 10 matches the game is decent but sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo typical of a cod competitor its so grenade spammy and the maps are average at best if the maps were improved and the explosives were toned down i could recommend it over cod tbh give me any game ill only use a sniper nothing else if the game dosent have a sniper ill try pistol or knife ironsight has mentioned in a public statement that they dont plan on releasing this game on console because they simply just dont have the resources neither do they have the technology nor the people as those require money money which ironsight atm doesnt have a aaa title has a staff of 500 people these days while ironsight only has 2040 crawlerfireflybladedrone sure they arnt biiig and powerful but they are great point streaks that can help each other stak up for constant supply of walking bombs suicide balls and guided missles 3 small but painful 3 would really love an ac130 in the game but is chill 3 looks like cod plays like cod takes zero skill like cod should do well like cod you have to go through so much just to download the game i mean seriously thats the thing about pc use what you want bro i want this game for ps4 hows wit me facts this right here is my black ops 4 hey i recon they should add it to console cause im so digging the game this is what all og cod players were waiting for absolute perfection i need this game for console thank you ironsight thank you copyright strike inbound this needs to be on console is this on ps4 it really looks like combat arms wtf only if it was on ps4 any news if it will come to console im loving this game so far gets sued by cod better than fortnite i thought it look like csgo i started this game today love it i have a 10603gb and run the game on ultra in crazy fps it is amazing is this on ps4 thats probably the best thing about ironsight is that its optimized for almost any pc hope it comes to xbox i just made a ironsight video check it out if your interested when its sponserd xd 400 ping for me and still got 31 kills that proof how garbage eu and american are in pvp and that was it never ever touching again one of the easiest game ever this looks amazing im downloading right now at glance this free online fps looks so awesome but still no stronger than cod cod was a worldwide brand fps in the gamers world but iron sight was developed by south korea game studio it hasnt still famous can you play his on a mac why is this game so perfect this does not feel like a free game at all it just feels good hope it comes out on xbox one and ps4 can i get on xbox at this point every game is better that cod xd youre so late on this train ok fine i will give this game a try lets see if its really good or not it is better than cod it feels like cod new cods have everything nerfed and its fucking boring please support xbox one and xbox gampad thank u for this video been waiting for a free to play game like this thank u i dont why people just cant do research you dont need to spend 1 thousand dollars on a pc to run games if thats what you think your kinda dumb a good gaming pc is in the range of 345 to 1000 in that range kidos you can run what ever you wanna play any other pc player can tell you the same nah battlefield is better this game is sick has to make it to console at some point yes play more ironsight games like this and fortnite need to be widespread because of their non ptw gameplay is it on ps4 i want more of this it runs well on crappy pcs be nice to see a survuail mode added damn this shit is good i will download that latter saying its better than cod isnt saying much lets not forget how game companies which makes free shooters makes money supply boxes and unlockable weapons with game currency i dont prefer this kind of broken system still feels like its pay 2 win hope it stays free when it is full release literally prestige goes on rants about cosmetic items in video games and how its exploitative of kids but sacrifices his principles as soon as some money is dangled in his face youtube revenue must be that shitty ima true xbox player and are going to pc recently to get better with a keyboard and mouse play a simple game with not many keybinds and then move to a more advanced game it messes with ur computer when u make a nonused call sign the game crashes once it crashed your unable to open task manager and crtl alt del gets disabled well warframe puts destiny in the fucking ground so i mean is it on console i got the game played it once and then my launcher kept saying not responding come to console ww2 dry as a desert i love the look of this game this is what happens when cod and fortnite come together cant find this on steam inb4 cod sues them lmao bring this to console bo4 wont even make it to release its like a blend between combat arms and bo2 is it on console not on steam no thanks 32879456 ads under video no thanks never trust an ad whore already better than cod prestige is key thats funnybefore i watched this video i sent a message to the developer of the game and asked them to add controller support looks good i think the graphics are a bit dated but it looks fun i just hope they get the marketing right to get a good player community only pc this honestly looks like call of duty if halo had modern military weaponry this would be that game we gotta stop and recognize that cod is shit right now and it will not fail because of fans sub for more ironsite content looks like knock off bf4 with a futuristic vibe this game is shit i just downloaded it takes 20 minutes to get into a game trash it takes forever to even find its download its on fucking google horse shit game still better than cod how about black squad more plsi want it pn ps4 i am a console player and i do have a pc and i wanted to download this and after like 2 days of playing i got really used to it why is it so similar to the metal gear 5 online mode bruh its the same thing as cod but shit i think its pretty alright i guess honestly almost any game is better then cod at this point u can carry streaks through death but if u have a streak or 2 up and u switch load outs you will cancel the streaks d i learned this the hard way lol when a free to play games runs better then 60 game you know firms employ wrong people okay this is a great game but comparing it to cod lolcod is for gay babies how do i get this game if this game comes to console i want to pay for it even if its free to play i send 70 to the devs it has just one damn map are you crazy how much do they pay you lmao def wanna see more bro gotta spread the word of this game so it can come to console quicker and so activision will start to act right lol its almost the fortnite of fps its free and thy do transaction almost perfect is it coming to xbox oneps4 can you use a controller on this game thats how you know cod is better when you have to compare a game to it lol smh so i just played this game to all the people saying its going to take over cod hell the fuck no its not this game is a straight rip off of warface another trash free to play game that does nothing different what kind of joystick do yall use or how do you hook it up to play it literally cod could have released this exact game and charged 100 for it and people would be saying it was a great cod sooo um do they have scavenger i feel like the maps and style of the game seems like bo2 but all the customization sounds like cod online im tired of the futuristic crap and im sure everyone else is bo4 will die after a couple months just like infinite warefare and well ww2 but that was in the past but if anything i feel like bo3 lived longer than either this tho reminds me of bo2 or siege which i love it is p2w you need to buy weapons and attachments ironsight is black ops 4 black ops 4 is no more this game is complete shit so much delay and feels like dogshit dont get it bo2 game play and b01 style purchases i like it already i support it hope its a console game id definitely play this if it was on console my pc broke back in 2012 and i still have yet to get a new one the good gaming pc are way too damn expensive for me and i dont have a clue how to build one i still havent learned any of the technical jargon like 4k fps weird numbersletters and shit like that so i wouldnt know what to even buy is it on pc we need this game in console so many kids in the comments arguing about which console is better smh the video is about ironsight game not fucking console comparasion it has downloading problems and it lags really hard dont trust this guy if this blows up and ends up on every system i garuntee theyre gonna have cod and battlefield sending lawsuits there way for somewhat copying them it happens to the greatest they get all salty about it and resort to government help will ironsight come out on ps4 this looks like a rip off of siege but with different killstreaks nice try though when will it be on xbox i swear this comment section is more cancer then an overwatch vs paradins sub reddit no its not wym this looks dope af wish it was on ps4 this looks dope cod always sucked this video is giving me a massive polished mw2 and mw3 look and vibe literally looks like plaza from bo2 this needs a ps4 port asap what console is this on this game looks pretty lit is it on ps4 to so its a pc game only better than bluff trash turd ops 4 with fucking microtransaction by treyarch played by their cult members this game reminds me of black squad if it develops a battle royale feature and goes third person it is gonna take off does this game still have kill trading the console peasants are begging us to grant them the opportunity to play on their inferior consoles bo4 looks good though definitely downloding it it sounds and seems like it feels like bo4 this needs to be put on consoles soon even though at times cod is annoying ill stick to that 15 year old game even stole the black ops 2 sounds wow such a robbery via videogame what a rip off why is it so fucking hard to download is this on ps4 please help me hit 1k before december what platforms is this available on also how does the game handle the most annoying scum campers play more i think your good go shill ur shit game elsewhere faget horseshit gameyou got sponsored this game have been in this stage for years and you cant even install it from its launcher thats how bad it isyou have to download the file that one of dev uploaded in google drivelolamd the graphics is preety shitand literelly it provides nothing to the shooting gameboringbut 100 better than 60 call of duty though and nobody plays this so only one lobby you have to wait for it to fill up interesting is this on console or coming to console i dont think its going to run on my trash computer why no console port pls let this game come to console gets 1 sponsor calls it better than cod can i run it on laptop no matter how much they pay you this game fucking reeks this is some straight up competition to warface edit to those who dont know warface is another freetoplay fps game thats kinda like cod and battlefield mixed together the first map is basically plaza looks amazing is it just pc or is it on ps4 this looks like cod in its prime we need this is it coming to console woah i remember this guys videos from mw3 road to gold series lol its been a while prestige youve grown so much congrats but is it for console which console is this game for in the future about another 5 years this game will conquer call of duty on sum rs this game needs to come to ps4asap downloading now this game looks fun and i hope it comes to console soon its been a few months since i played this game but it is really fun anything is better than cod right now when will it be available on ps4 but the one question is is there a combat knife in iron sight this looks similar to a steam games called warface any one play it not on xbox yet if this goes for xbox one i would be so happy d why isint it on console they could capitalize off of the massive player base i like it but aint this literally cod xbox needs this this channel is so dead answer to title yes call of duty black ops 2 is one of the best game out there thank you sir i will never watch you again nothing better than the old cod but its good to play not even close brownnosing the game lolpathetic the renting system for weapons i think i first saw on combat arms like 10 years ago awesome free game why it is not in steam so tom clancy rainbow six seige mixed with cod on better than cods are you high this game looks better than any call of duty that has come out in the past 5 years i will be trying it out later this evening why do console players want this is it actually that bad over there its a solid game but jesus its not anything special gets boring after a while and its quite easy to be good at to bad i dont have a pc to run it i love the content your putting out i hope to see more of this game will it come out for ps4 tho if not meh is this on ps4 with a title like that who wouldnt watch lol it looks good i wish u had mentioned the different game types tho this comment section filled with microsoft and sony fanboys discussing which console should get this game and little kids defending activision and their bullcrap i want to inform and correct them all but where do i start i was thinking csgo not cod tf is the off brand my main complaint is that they need to work on the netcode shots register pretty late in most matches is there a party system to play with your friends looks awesome cough cough blacklight retribution cough yes its better just wish it was on ps4 are you the youtube matimio im broke add ps4 to this dont compare to call of duty compare to rainbow six siege this doesnt look better than cod ive been playing ironsight for about 2 months and its pretty fun warface is also a good game make it for console and get outa here cod this sounds fun anything is better than cod nowdays its ridiculous how many influencers the publisher is paying to promote this game this game has one of the worst netcodes out of current multiplayer shooters at times even pubg netcode seems great compared to ironsights from the short time i was following it i have a bad feeling this is just a new publisher picking up a dead game that was shut down in korea to milk some money out of it by rehashing korean content i want to be wrong about it but for now this just sits installed on my hard drive with a to play when its fixed note this better come to console as well ive been waiting for a game like this on ps4 cmon ironsight well be good is this staying free its 2018 and the only innovation we have in fps games is microtransactions ffs this is a great looking game cant wait to try it and yes play this and upload how much did they pay u for the title of this video we need this on console if its not on consoles then it wont blow up ironsightblack ops 4 ww3 battlefield 5 is it for xbox ehh looks like every other free to play game out right now tbh one problem i play on console please try to get them to bring it to console if you can somehow id buy it on xbox instantly actually nobody cares about the graphics its about having fun does this game work in mac why so much hate at cod what did the game do to you guys salty much this needs to come to ps4 tell me this game will come to consoles plz lie to me if you have to need to title this pc only lmao it looks more like roblox then cod any game is better than cod yess please more ironsight that shit looks live af cod isnt my fav game but this game has repair costs for all weapons and attachments i would rather permanently buy a weapon that i didnt have to repair its a hassle do a live stream is it going to be on ps4 cod people still play that lol this game is good looking and feels smooth still yet to try it cod eats dick hey prestige this is some good s i like the gameplay and a especially its free i agree i prefer controller but like you said we all need a little kick in the pants when it comes to mouse and keyboard lets get it bro im downloading it now would be awesome on console i would support this game so muchhlike seriously this better be ported to nintendo switch is it on ps4 is it sad that im more interested in this game than the upcoming cod black ops 4 only pc btw post this shit cods dying and this game looks amazing the game only really needs a bit more tweaks to gameplay and in just my personal opinion i would like to see the game get more fleshed out animations for some reloads and climbing also this game would get alot more attention if the beta would come out on the ps4 or xbox this is a small thing but i wish the game had sprint cancelling you know when you want to cancel your reload to either skip the tail end of the animation or because youre in danger also wish it was on steam nothing wrong with its launcher or its forums but the larger audience and getting a steam community hub would be great i know the game is still considered a beta so things are subject to change what made me stop playing it though is the small but still present input lag i get high frame rates but setting the graphics settings to low improved the lag slightly seems like an optimization issue yo this game looks awesome it needs to be on consoles tbh u dont need much to beat cod ps4 please any game is better than cod at this point how much they payed you for some reason i feel like its something has to do with blacklight retribution ill quit my job and beat my wife if they add it for ps4 iron sight for ps4 bo2 will always be the best game i remember the days where we had clan wars and be quickscopers and if we had beef we will take it to nuketown it inst its pc onlyironsightyou lose im going to try this game but this game also keeps aim excel constantly on no way to turn it off and thats really bad been playing for the last couple of months fantastic game and grind feels so easy and you get so much free stuff too is this on ps4 man this really good better then cod by far if goes free like fortnite i would get it in xbox one playstation switch needs some to but yeah this is a cod ripoff lmao this looks awful better than cod id rather play advanced warfare than this shit wow this looks like what im looking for in a fps with cod abandoning the older fanbase downloaded as it while watching this been missing a modern shooter thanks for the heads up on it the high guys more please been playing this game for a while nowwe need more players story my problem is f2p fps games are never go to console were some are better off at definitely not a fan of deaths dont matter streaks no matter what is there a hardcore mode in that game oh its one of those buyrent weapons games interest gone almost all games a better than cod better than cod it is cod lol ill stick with rs siege at least ubi innovates every once in awhile cod and games like this is the same boring run and gun nonsense that use to be fun during the 360ps3 era thnx bro why do nu games support fuckin mac books literally no games that are a free fps game arent available for mac i feel like this is a copied game of blacklight retribution not many people will know what im talking about as it wasnt that big of a game but is very similar to this its futuristic free on ps4 when he says prestige its so cringe anyone else agree and what about blacklight retribution my left ear hurts put this on the consoles and cod will have real ass competition ill play it if it goes on ps4 if i dont like it i can just undownload my biggest problems with the game are the lack of maps game modes with equipment and ammo type you can only have them for a day or week at a time u sound like michaels son from gta 5 ill only play this if i can snipe in it any good news on that is it a possibility to see this come to the switch anythinf is better than cod and i have got to say that they have really nailed the weapon balance yeah there is that weapon that pop up more than others every now and then but overall there is no that sought after weapon that everyone wants and uses and you can pretty much use any weapon and dominate others if you can master the weapon also sniping is really a thing here its not annoying you are not going to find snipers in ever single game or anything but that sniping and quick scoping rewarding feeling is really amazing and reminds me a lot of cod in old times also maps and modes are constantly being added to the game to refresh it downloading game will fill ur pc with viruses and unwanted programs dont download it it actually is a very very good cod clone cmon devsif you will create multiplayer fps please always consider console playersits like console players are being treated as secondary options onlyand im sad this game is doing the same thing of fortnite making a free game with only cosmetic microtransactions if this game comes out on console the developers are gonna have some mad money trust me this game is almost nothing alike cod ah dont hate i said almost ive never tried it but i recommended it to my brother to try out play blacksquad its great its not better than cod if it doesnt have zombs or its not on consoles lol everything is better than cod now lmao if only cod ww2 didnt release than cod wouldve problably still be alive every gun sounds the samd so what your saying is its a mix of bo2 bf4 and ghostok ill bite this game needs to be on ps4 getting bored of fortnite already looks like bo4 why people love this but hate bo4 now a real cod game about time do you need ps plus to play online on that game iron sight has better graphics than cod xd its not that much of an achievement cod has been trash after black ops 2 blacks ops 4 should be free to play i love this so much please do more videos of it come to ps4 please wanna be black light this looks like csgo and cod black ops ll had a cool baby can you trickshot tho evertime i go to the website it keeps asking me to do a verification and i pass it but it keeps asking for a verification can anyone help me running speed and time to kill is too fast they need to lower those things a bit if its only on pc it aint better than cod downloaded this today and goddamn ive had more fun playing this than ive had playing cod for years the hackers on this game spoils everything not on ps4 huh how original lmfao i hope this come to console one day netcode is fucking shit can u tell them to put it on xbox you prefer controllers crucify him i definitely want to see some more of this this is such a cod rip off but im still gonna play it lol i have a ps4 pro but i enjoy it more on pc im going to download this now looks good new map dropped today with even more content love this game callin it right now this game will take cods place right behind halo infinite at least die hard cod fans dont yell with anger saying it ripped off cod its st i want to play it on xbox i have a lot of shooters with war and story modes bf2 bf3 bf4 bf1 revolution call of duty black ops 3 personally bf4 is my favourite i still play it i wanted to try it but after redownloading the install 5 times and it failing at 5 different files during the install i give up 90 percent of all fps games are better than cod if this comes to console i will play 100 question is can it played on the playstation more please this is great and they dare call black ops 4 inovation p does anyone know if it has sa servers this game is actually terrible if you hated the long time to kill in cod you are gonna hate this game even more i swear people take like 8 bullets in this game to die if not more i played for about an hour and i was done with it just like im done with cod is it available for xbox one you seem prettu competent on mouse and keyboard so dont sweat it damn that gold camo looks tasty looks like other companies have to make better cods and im sorry but there going to be a lawsuit for copyright lol if you wanna make more videos on this game go for it because i personally enjoyed the gameplay and i think grinding for gold on weapons people wouldnt normally go for would be entertaining when this game come to ps4 looks like critical ops on ios if this actually got better graphics and a few tweaks then hit consoles this game could fucking go is this on console any chance this will be released on consoles this game needs to be on xb1 and ps4 like if u agree this game is the reason i cancelled my bo4 preorder where did the refunded money go to this game i spent 100 on this game and i have no regrets i will rather support a developerpublisher that cares about its game and playerbase than a one that doesnt especially after the shitstorm that is the bop free yes better clickbait i wish this will come to consoles this definitely gives me black ops 2 vibes which is my favorite cod game actuly looks really good but im guessing its only on pc and ive got xbox if cod is smart and still wants to be the top fps shooter they should sue them will this come to steam now they just have to release this on steam and console i would like to see ironsight overthrow cod this game looks amazing you should totally cover the game more iron sight should put it on ps4 for people who dont have pc i really enjoy this game im hooked is this pc only ironsight is a great cod style fps i agree with you that migrating to mouse and keyboard is hard but i like learning with a game that feels as familiar as this does make more ironsight videos jeez i hate sponsored game reviews just started playing this after i saw levelcaps vid on it and have been watching pretty much any ironsight vid i can find so yes plese make more vids on this game super entertaining man d keep it up 3 cod bo3 is free aswell lol hit detection is better than all the call of duty games lol ps4 gangthis looks better looks like it plays better then ops3 aw ops3 iw are bs cods this is a facts im wit iron sight but wait this is only on pc damn oh yeah fuc fortnite that future bs cod has been copyin from ghost then everything went down hill mwr is the only good cod on ps4 then u have xbox 1 with baccwards compatibility this game sucks donkey balls we need this on consoles wow longest ad iv ever seen stopped playing it because i got more than 300ms ping i hope that they add an asian server till then deleting this one cover more of it looks better than bo4 graphics are a joke and no dont blame it on artistic design choice im sure the art director didnt say i wanna go for realistic but with ten year old technology lol gameplay looks average map design is ok for what was shown i understand why its free but i could see it being fun with friends cod is not dead but almost rip activision inviting prestige to youtuber events lmao so this is a cod online ripoff oh i mean inspiration how can people not say they took every idea from past cods this game looks awful graphics wise but gameplay wise great free i would be willing to pay for the game can you play this game on console aswell later its fun for about a month then you start to realize that this game goes nowhere still worth trying though they should bring it to console not better its copying jo this game is lit i like how you casually mentioned the fact that you have a gtx 1080ti answer nope shits laggy has hell lol if this game comes on console its a 100 rip to cod is it for ps4 they need to fix the game launcher and iron out all the crappy aspects that make it free need this for xbox do you know if this will be on console so lemme get this straightthe cod community complains about activsion not being innovative and creative but when when another company makes a bo2 20 you guys are excited lol ok is it with xbox or playstation looks like bo2 and rainbow 6 siege mixed together the netcode is garbage wont be playing until they change it its bo1 and bo2 b01 has graphics and the points are like bo1 on ps4 i hope it comes to ps4 my gtx1080ti pulled through what the hell did you expect man its a 1080ti everythings better than cod now ill wait for it to come to steam but it seems promising its a solid feeling game but it probably has one of the worst networks ive ever experienced if csgo was in cod i would love to see this game on console is this game coming to steam sometimes soon wow the site unexpectedly closes when i try to create an account would sure like to try it everybody seeing this video should download and play this game needs and deserves to get bigger im so jealous of pc master race gamer the way my bank account is currently set up ive been looking for a game that will replace cod and this looks like a good candidate tbh tho the only reason i buy console is to play cod and fifa both franchise are currently garbage and are only cash cow im seriously thinking about building a decent pc that can handle titles like this thanks for uploading this vid to show that there are other options would 100 play if they put it on xbox is this on ps4 bruh is it in ps4 lol no were not i feel like most of this review is written by the ppl that works on the game its literally if cod and battlefield had a baby damn nice looking game gonna have to see if my pc can run it i hope soo looks like it feels likw bo2 call of duty look alike lmfao click bait its more like rainbow six siege i cant download the game i get a capcha and if i check the box the page refreshes and i have to do it again i like this game do you then hit the like button and subscribe the videoits free promotion btw and if u like my comment then please like it is this game only for pc still looking for that new game to replace cod fortnite just isnt it still fun though wish it could come to console as a better alternative to call of duty as people like the 6v6 stile of shooters that consoles lack cause call of duty at this point is a terrible experience i come from the black ops days of cod and left after b02 for obvious reasons prestige great video man with the whole mid match map changing that seems like they ripped it off of cod ghosts the game looks great almost as good as you xd do not dovnload this game the netcode is so bad it is worse than escape from tarkov you know bullet force im a legend at it its on pc only so i automatically dont care its like cs with cod when does it come to console but does it have a battle royale what platforms is it on how is this game reflecting a postapocalyptic feeling the buildings are very intact and not touched not even the characters have scrappy gear or anything no a crashed heli is not postapocalyptic needs to be on ps4 i mean you can buy weapons yes please do more content of this game this looks like a cod ripoff i could see a lawsuit coming on this this game already looks dope and i really hope it comes out on console is it on ps4 this game needs to be on consoles i dont like it yet but it seems like a chill free game to waste time on plz make this to xbox look fun to play you dont have to be the best player to get streaks yeah im out bro i played this all last night and i love it this should be on console looks really good better than the last cods gameplay and map layout look great i rather play snake on a nokia phone then play cod its actually good but its kinda easy but still fun yes please d cod from its golden days play as much as you want ill watch it for sure i dont know how much of this currency i get after a match but i personally hate the rent system if i want a gun i want it forever and i dont like the high price for the guns permanently which is pretty common in free to play games at least in warfare you can unlock 38 guns through leveling not this grinding for currency of course its free if its in open beta you fucking knob this game has mouse acceleration fuck that shit i aint playing til they fix it hope to see it on xbox one day i love this game but my old pc cant run it its just a cod ripoff console yet imma have check it the hell with cod i mad you sold out but it doesnt look like that bad a game i might check it out this looks awesome wtf lord i cant stand these mobile app games those it has free for all is this better than mw2 thats the main cod i play on pc is it ps4 this is the first time ive heard more of this game in full commentary great game and wish it was on console for the rest of us i would definitely give this a try damn i dont have a gaming computer but i own a ps4 pro is this coming to the ps4 cause i know that would run it my home pc does not have anything that would run anything like this a intel core i7 graphics card is a intel 520 with 256 mb of graphic ram it does have a 16 gig ram and a tb hard drive but nothing to able to push these graphics would play it on console does this remind anyone else of blacklight retribution looks interesting if only it can make it to ps4 i think when this game hits steam it will blow as fuck i need this on ps4 it just looks like shitty call of duty game this game looks consumer friendly i hate the fucking rent system imo i cant agree horrible net code get killed before people even turn corner on my end i have a ping of 5030 fyi this is what cod 2018 shouldve been they need to put on console thats were the moneys at this is why im building my own pc style to get to play free games that are actually good not pay for some garbage game and top of that pay to play online what if cod goes pubg and sues them if you dont have your game on console nowadays you will not succeed sorry its just a fact am i the only one that doesnt believe a word of a what a youtuber says the second i hear the video is sponsored hey prestige i heard the news i hope youre ok 1 like 1 prayer why is everybody advertising thiss this needs to hit console too bad the netcode sucks black ops 2 one of the best call of duty games thats funny just downloaded this its awesome everybody lets call and message whoever runs consoles and tell them about this asap if this was free for ps4 and xbox one this would be the number one download why cant this come to consoles guys there might not be uploads for a while prestige has been a mortorcyle accident check his twitter if you dont believe me this looks so fun if optimisation is better on pc than cod then im all in if this game came to console it would kill fortnite awesome a sponsored video advertising a game you never played apart from making this video im subbing lol no shame the game your saying is better than cod is sponsoring the video hahahahah pls i would love more videos like this ughadvertisement video at its finest way to finesse people im buying a computer so it basically stole from bo2 and ghost bullshit this looks so dope ill check it out after work tonight they need to bring it to ps4 or you could just buy black ops 2 for 13 dollars on g2a this game is going to be huge i absolutely adore this game every aspect of this game is perfect and fits a perfect first person shooter honestly cod is sadly dead and due to activision and its absurd greed so this game is going to blow up love it please god tell me this is on consoles hell yeah more pls put it in the rotation coach is this only on pc i hope you get well soon prestige i already miss your content can intel hd 2000 graphics run this at low settings and an intel i5 vpro and 8gb ddr3 ram i use a dell elitebook 8460p look better than blacklight retribution wish it was free for consoles enjoy pc players honestly in my opinion ironsight is in a better state than cod at the moment its f2p doesnt appear to be pay to win and is actually stable on pc unlike almost every recent cod man this guy sounds alot like matimio alot not just the voice but the inflection could be matimios alt account yes please i would love to see more of this i started playing this game months ago its actually fun just not too used to mouse and keyboard which is why i dont tend to grind the game if you enjoy pc games and dont mind mouse and keyboard and enjoyed bo2 then this is the game for you this is just like cod lol i love it is there updatee for this like do they add new weapons to keep this game entertaining ps4 or pc looks like solider of fortune 2 with better gfx back in the day sof 2 was great play more bring this game to consoles ironsight send it this game pops up often as good also dont be a heretic man shooters are meant for mouse and keyboard not a controller thats all actuallyidont think is a codlike game80gunson this game have badass hipfire accuracy that didnt need ads especially withlaser light need this on ps4 will this game come to consoles game is gonna go to h ell now it wont be able to handle all the new players curious ive been playing this since i saw summit play it on stream a few months ago really enjoy this game why would anyone play a competitive shooter with a controller why would anyone do that to themself competitive shooters should never be played with a controller most games today are better than cod great job on the video this game looks promising but i wouldnt get my hopes up ive been disappointed before and it sucks cod life i want to see more of iron sight yes to bad i cant get the game lol hoping this comes to ps4 or xbox one at some point only if it was on console looks awesome my pc that has an i36100 with a gtx950 plays this game so well i get about 8090 fps on high to ultra the optimization for this game is amazing d how to download this why cod is in the title it should be on console games great but sketchy what is its size in gb or mb i whould love to see more of this game i like this rainbow six ops i would totally play this every game with guns is better than cod its finally picking up more steam lol is it on ps4 are you ok i heard about your accident you would not say its better than cod it grew your channel anyone remember warface this on xbox also sniping feels way better in this game then cod it actually takes skill no more bull shit sniper deaths this game is not a copy and paste its an entirely new game no other fps has csgo rainbow 6 siege and cod and even a little battlefield mixed in if you help support this game and not let it die it will come to console and best part its free and the microtransactions are not crazy its well balanced its there way of making money and making the game free also you can earn everything without buying anything just takes longer and its not pay to win fortnite is free but this is a trick because youre spending money youre going to say that does not make sense will it does because youre buying it they got some ideas from a game called combat arms yet combat arms has ridiculous amounts of guns accessories and anything else you can think off just put it on consoles and cod will be dead in days if you want to use a controller then use a controller but you shouldnt gain aim assist because of it prestige i heard of the accident im praying for a quick recovery we understand what events are occurring and the healing process may take some time take a break and heal safely were all hoping for the best we could easily make explosive knifes it just wouldnt be practical i wouldnt mind some more vids on ironsight more youre a fucking homo reminds me of red faction mixed with planetside 2 keep playing i played it today it is so much fun sniping reminds of me of the old cod sniping that every body loved highly recommended bring it to ps4 ill play it over cod i hope ironsight comes to console too bad it isnt on ps4 yes end of discussion stop talking like levolution is new bf4 did this years ago at least reference that as inspiration it looks just like bo2 fr no joke it even kinda has the layout of that one night map in bo2 you got mfs thinking it on console when this was released in korea some time back it shut down servers becaue people hated this game since its a cod rip off but since cod is now a punching bag to hate on people actually think this game is good im getting this now lets face it at this point a lot of games are better than cod is it on xbox graphics are from 8 years ago this game needs faster health regeneration everything else is perfect is this on console anything is better than cod to be honest with you i legit want this on console i feel like with the right adjustments and if they made the launch smooth and kept this great monetization system this game could overshadow call of duty this game has so much potential and i hope that this game comes to ps4 and xbox one some day only if this came to console i hope they bring this to console looks cool this looks cool hows your leg character looks like a barbie doll this game looks really fun been playing it since the beginning of this year guys check his twitter he got into a huge accident lucky hes alive so support him there does the ingame currency work like in the first black ops where you just play to earn also i honestly dont understand why most games these days add some form of wager match this plays and looks like battlefield almost like americas army proving grounds did anyone else get the ad about either fighting 100 duck sized horses or fighting 1 horse sized duck so gp is the cod points from black ops one more to me if it isnt on xboxps4 the game isnt shit to me it could be better than call of duty if it was on console had to push it out for that 10 minute video ive been playing iron sight for about a month now and im so bad at mouse and keyboard but this game will definitely help your aim because now i come up top of leader boards every game and even do better on cod and pubg any word on this porting to consoles can i download this game on ps4 is this game on xbox is this on console so its a cod clone this seems like a good game imma download it how do you fix the corrupt file bullshit when downloading the map is the exact mix of a cod and siege map is it for xbox or ps4 ironsight on steam oh yea i def would like to see more videos on this game do some reviews of the weapons it would be dope if they put this on console and make it cross platform ps4 vs xbox no pc allowed lmao this game has laser hipfire spread that has zero delay between running and shooting its not very good or competitive at all this game looks nice if it allowed controller support it would be better if its only on pc thats some trash ass shit looks a million times better than shitty bo3 reskin can you try out black squad its free and not a bad game it runs like csgo so when cod rips off games its not good but when other games clearly rip off cod its fine xd stop i was skeptical at first but after watching this i think this looks pretty cool get a real job no one is going to play this bullshit you advertising like this gets immediate thumbs down enough of these and im out this is such a bullshit promotion the game looks like shit i would love to play if it was on ps4 rip cod im down for more looks way better than ww2 they should bring it out on console is it on ps4 i was turned off once i heard bo2 why does everyone think thats the best cod literally the start of all the future crap we all claim to hate this game is needed on console deadass mw2 vibes from this ill definitely cop this when it shows up on console this would be the cod killer if it was on consoles hands down hopefully they bring this hoe to console bring it on ps4 id play it show more of this game great looking game defo goner download and have a little look yes to iron sight man i hope this game gets put on console will this be coming to console anytime soon this looks pretty good i could easily see this becoming the warframe of firstperson shooters however it not being on console keeps my interest level at zero i played this game for a few weeks when it first came out and it was fun but the netcode was pretty terrible tons of lag comp and really bad hit detection i havent played it in a while and i imagine theyve updated the hell out of it though this is exactly what cod should be ps4 please download it right now really cool game i love how youre only giving this game attention because they payed you to lls its sad how every lil fps game that releases gets compared to cod but the hard truth is the more yall mention cod the longer it stays on top kind of sucks that all the good fps games seem to only come out on pc this game seems really cool and what all the og call of dutys fans really want but its just too similar to cod the map you were playing on looks just like plaza from bo2 its not better than cod rn but with enough work it could become great make more videos on this if this had triple a graphics and stuff i would definitely play i am aware this would be hard and i would pay looks really cool interesting story good gameplay mechanics cool guns i would pay to play this game with better graphics ive been playing this game for a while but every time i try to use obs and record it is just a black screen can anyone help warface could be better is this game on console is it on ps4 the cod killer it took me two hours to get it working i would open the launcher click play and it would flash and the screen would go blank if anyone else has a similar issue i fixed it by right clicking my network in the bottom right and going to advanced settings scroll all the way down and check the boxes for tls 11 and 12 launched with no problem after that looks like they pasted 2018 menus on a 2003 game this actually looks great i hope they release it for consoles that gold camo in the menu looked sexy af as well hope it looks good in game is thid on console too i hope cod 2019 goes back to what made the classics great instead of pushing the esports agenda so hard in all of its designs also wish cod would go back to realistic weapons in a modern setting i want to use guns like the m4a1 m16 scarh mp5 etc we need mw4 with only realistic guns with their original naming ayy i played it seems fun jho prestige would love to see you upload more of this game grinding the crossbow gold camo sounds fun id love to see some more gameplay of this game looks fun this game should come to console cod free for ps plus ugh theres literally hundreds of youtubers asking this same question tired of it why can i see other peoples chat when im not in a game or lobbythanks a free cod best game ever i would love to see more gameplay and videos pls make a series its like call of duty online renting guns i enjoy playing ironsight i agree that controller support for a game nowadays is mandatory only if this came to console it would give activision and call of duty a huge run for their money this game right here is exactly what people look for in cod games the renting system is kinda like cod online this is the fps thatll replace bo4 for me this year i play this game and i got to tell you the snipers are the best ayeee kinda off topic but anyone remember the game brink it was hella repetitive but fun at the same time anyone remember it this game makes me want to buy a pc so many guns take note cod yes it is better than cod im a cod fanboy but i prefer the business practices in this game but its still a beta pubg started out as a promising game even though most of the time it ran like shit look how that turned out went from promising popular indie title to what appears to be being more like activision with locking free crates behind paywalls i have 4gb ram and intel pentium 300 ghz and 550 gtx 1gb can i play it the thumbnail makes it look like a rip off siege im sad this isnt on console i would play this so much if it was on console you say its better than cod but its your own opinion because other people would say different what ram video card and procesor required yo play this game when cod screws the pooch it just takes someone to put out the right game with the right fun factor bring it to console and i am there if this game releases on console then i can see it competing with call of duty but until then theres just no way it can beat cod i played this game a few months ago and the only gripe i had about it was that the health regen felt way too slow i dont know if its been changed since but this game could be amazing if the health regenerated faster let me save you some time its not better than cod its not even close the netcode in is terrible it is so bad that a person can peek a corner gun you down and go back around the corner without you ever seeing the person shooting you map design is average at best weapons are super generic and boring class setup make little to no sense the offensivestreaks are poorly designed ill admit to it being better than most other f2p codclones but the netcode is just so incredibly bad that its just not an option as replacement for cod the american cod online why do people always say alot of games are better than cod alot of games you cant compare them i havent played this game but it looks like it took the best parts of other games and added their own touch on top i like the currency system they have the the rent a gun option i like the idea of getting 1000 kill before unlocking gold your rewarded for using the guns plus it will be fun in cod grinding out headshots is not rewarding or fun it leads to people playing shipment 247 i would very much like to see more of this i want that game where can u download it ps4 xbox 1 pc apple or android my toe cheese is better then cod nowadays ive been playing this game before this video and honestly its such a fun gun this is a bootleg bo2 i been playing this game and its amazing dead ass it just feels good personally i feel like im playing mw1 or bo1 but with the looks of like bo2 and even titan fall the game is smooth af and genuinely made me feel good about grinding for hours on it i cant even download it so bs lawsuit coming know this game looks alot like blacklight retribution i would buy this game if it was on console or at least if they could add in controller support id play it it looks amazing and id love to play but i am terrible at a keyboard mouse so i really dont want to play it unless it has controller support once this game comes out of beta it would be awesome to see some kind of console port or something this game looks so smooth and it could really compete with cod if it was on consoles after watching your video i downloaded and played for several hours it is okay i agree with you though in that if it had controller support i would be more inclined to play it i would love to see a controller option like they have in fortnite where i can plug in my ps4 controller and be good to go imitation is the sincerest form of flattery imitation is also the scummiest form of cashing in ive been playing this for the last month and i really hope it comes to xbox then i can play it on my tv but at the moment my gaming laptop does fine muda fucker you could of say in the beginning that its only pc lol what the fuck is this looks like a psp game is it only on pc i could play this i just prefer playstation also sorta reminds me of blacklight retribution another futuristic fps shit is it on console this game should be on the ps4cant stand the newer cods they are all trash as f i did a video about this a while go lol good viedo tho everybody is comparing it too black ops 4 all ive got too say if this game had the amount of devs as black ops 4 it would plunder black ops 4 it into the ground all you delusionals think bo4 is gonna be good just admit it its gonna be shit from advanced warfare they turned cod it to a cash grab they took campaign out to jump on the battle royale band wagon you have to heal through a item which is taking even more away from the good old days when cod was an amazing game we all just can agree we want good boots on the ground nice balanced weapons and a lot of fun maps in my personal opinion if i could have one game remaster all the same features just better graphics it would be mw2 by far because it was an amazing cod i would sit on for hours and never get bored grinding every day for blue tiger on all weapons god i wish i was 11 again im level 23 in this game and it is so sick me too im not good with a mouse but i think it is better then cod at the moment when is it coming to console this is what us cod players wanted if this was in ps4 id be playing the shit out of this i hate requestions in this you dont lose streaks and its not bad i bet they would have waaay more players and earn way more money if they put this free 2 play game on ps4 did anyone notice another so called free game with supply drops its not a bad thing at all yeah its better but what is the use only europe and us servers are there and am in asia can you talk to the company and get more information for the future of the game really does look like a fun simple game something that ive been wanting for a while would love to see it on console this game was for free and it has customization boi thats fucking dope as hell ill defiantly have to remember to get this when i get a pc this looks really fun i dare you to get gold camo on the kap40 yes more ironsight videos can mac handle this the netcode in this game is just as bad as cod if not worse its a real solid game dont get me wrong but its not a aaa title so dont expect quality this game better be on console yes yes make more videos of ironsight plz this game is great id be more interested in watching your videos of this game if i could play it myself on xbox if u die you should lose your streak sometimes you lose competitive advantage with some micro transaction stuff like neon items is this only on pc guess what crossfire 2 will kill every single fps game looks exactly like bo2 ive been a console user all my life can someone tell me how to get this on pc this game needs to come to ps4 you said that the game isnt pay to win but you can still buy guns hmmm so what is it prestige better than cod fuck of aha this isnt a challenge bc call of duty hasnt been good for a long time it is just kind of a burning dumpster tbh im interested in this game ive never had an issue with youtubers doing ads get your money but this one is so blatant the game is not that good theyre probably paying you a lot lol who created this game if youre in contact with them do the gaming community a super favor and tell them to get ahold of greg hastings im not positive but i believe he might be looking for a developer to make the 3rd greg hastings paintball game i want it on c9nsole hey prestige i clicked on the link and of course there is gonna be im not a robot security and ive been on it for about 10 minutes completing it multiple times and it keeps coming back please respond back and see if i can fix this cause i really wanna play this game thanks i really want this on consoles make the deagle gold damn consoles could really use a consumer friendly fps with good mechanics maps modes and customization if this game comes to xbox one x it will take over cod its in between b ops 12 b ops 1 is my favourite cod i wonder if bluehole will sue them idk i like console and im an xbox guy but i gave this a run on pc and it feels amazing idk about it on console it feels great please play this game this is so similar to bo2 i want them to bring this to console this looks so good man xbox and ps4 are missing out really wish this was on console so i could play with my friends this game already looks better then black ops 4 what isnt better than cod cease desist from treyarch inbound i used your link to sign up gotta support prestige does it have attachments for weapons the call of duty we wont get or play anymore its better than battlefield did they fix the netcode are kill trades still a thing on hitscan weapons id love to see more videos of this game on the channel bruh it even has the kap40 you should take a look at insurgency sandstorm as well excellent game but heavy on micro dlc i wish the video wasnt sponsored i would love to hear your genuine opinion looking how new cod will be a great addition in overwatch franchise i wouldnt mind ironsight being released on ps4xb1 definitely looks interesting anything is better than trash game call of booty ironsight is awesome picked it up a few months ago it deosnt feel like it has the same lasting appeal as cod and theres some weird things about it but its by far the best freetoplay codalike out there it looked more like rainbow six watch this get popular then activision is gonna sue them this looks so badass do another video on this game lets see some gameplay with the scar h i hope this comes to xbox and playstation this is what bo4 should be i play this game more consistently that i did with any of the cods i love this game the hit detection and net code in the game is really bad i fw this game its the shit the hit detection is so smooth low key click baited good to see you this passionate about a game again a break from cod is always good only makes jumping back on that much better activision will probably sue will the full game be free not playing this unless it comes to steam fuck 3rd party links how much did they pay you to say its better than cod lmao watch what you say kids love me more than lunch its fun for awhile but takes forever to get new guns and gets boring after 45 hours is it going to be able to get on ps4 blacklight retribution any chance this would come to xbox one bruh is that blitz in the thumbnail our militaries already use equipment seen in this game and bo2 in fact this and bo2 are more a modern shooter than modern warfare the one one problem i have with this game is the netcode it can be very dodgie sometimes getting shot around corners can be very annoying btw the hellbird sucks if your enjoying it key the keep playing it and ill keep watching you play it as someone whos been a fan of cod since the classics were talking pre mw every thing he said about this game is true i discovered this game randomly like 3 weeks ago and it quickly turned into one of my favorite shooters with enough work and time this could be the next csgo wow i would love 2 play it but i play on ps4 bring it to console its a cool game you should keep going doing everything you like in it at least ill see the videos and i think a lot of more people will too those graphics look amazing ironsight is a great fps shooter that is obviously heavily inspired by cod my one major gripe with the game was how awful the connections were any single match i would join i would get 100 ping and i have great internet and the kinds of people that play go super hard so playing casually is a giant struggle im saving up for pc and this game will be one more reason why well finally we at the pc cod community have a good cod pc port if they make the health regen faster and make the streaks a tiny bit more powerful this game will be 100 better than cod this also shows that the multiplayer cod experience doesnt cost 60 anymore ive personally played ironsight and it would be interesting to see more content about this game just to mix it up from the typical call of duty videos so bummed this isnt on ps4 or i wouldve downloaded it right now that be sweet if you did a road to gold for this what 1440p monitor would u suggest for gaming 300700 it could become better than cod in the future but not now the net code is absolute garbage plz tell me i can play this on console holy shit this looks so smooth and so simple hope this gores on consoles similar to black ops 2 lmao more like modern warefare 2 i thought this was a division 2 video i wasnt disappointed tho great content hi make more videos on the game it looks fun but i dont got a oc levelution made it into a f2p game hahaha awesome i wonder if its better than bf4s probably sucks its not on console wicked hopefully on full release they will bring it to console since youve been sponsored by the developer tell them to release it on console ill even pay for it this looks sick asf i bet this game is gonna get very big i dont have a pc well it ever come to console itd be better than cod if it could actually balance the gun play fix the netcode and fix the hitreg what call of duty needs to go to it is this game is really really fun hopefully it comes to console for more players and more of a story and maybe a implement of a battle royal game mode would be sick my pc is about built and this is at the top of my list and warface this looks better than bo4 already this needs to be on consoles only on pc it has to come to ps4 that is what i want this is the cod i want to play i would have loved to hear about this before thanks for heads up i love watching this game do anything you want do you think it will come to ps4 and xbox one this looks dope will it come to consoles soon this looks so dope might have to go buy a pc just to play so im guessing that this isnt on console do they have this for ps4 more thats the same as black light retribution this on xbox one is this for ios to please do more gameplay videos on the game good vids except cod is big on consoles looks fun tho too bad i cant play it even if its free this game is amazing i already got addicted cod needs to die and then comeback better than ever please do more iron sight and thats not a bad thing at all haha u prob said this 4 times is iron sight for xbox one as well going for the 10 minute mark i see as the great jotaro kujo once said yesyesyesyesyesyes do another video on this that glide bomb was the best looking ive ever seen this game looks fun it would be cool if you kept making videos on it this game sums up what developers just dont seem to get we dont want all the new complicated annoying noob friendly stuff we just want a barebones fps game thats straight to the point good mechanics fun streaks fun guns good maps and no pay to win micro transactions this game seems like the move if you have a pc i know id definitely pay for this on console i play it n i love it but i agree with you im not good on keyboard and mouse i preferred the controller this looks better than blackops 4 this needs to be on console more excited to play this game than bo4 anyone else if this come out on console ohh no if only cod could be like this i would lowkey buy this its nice i was smiling throughout the entire video do anything but call of duty news please prestige play this more please it looks like such a good game this game looks awesome i wish my pc would run it id love to see more the last time i played this around 34 months ago i felt the scorestreaks sucked for example the predator missile like streak never killed anyone for me unless i landed it directly on them i always got hit markers with it but that was months ago so maybe it changed prestige i am really loving the content you have been putting out over the past few months keep up the good work prestige i am really loving the content you have been putting out over the past few months keep up the good work i want to play this game looks cool now i need a mouse and keyboard for my laptop this game looks fun how do the gunfights feel vs cod inb4 cod sues the shit out of these lads every element is exactly taken from cod if they didnt pay you you would have pointed this out everyone hates call of duty yet many developers copy what activision does and call it a different name console whos with me theres no recoil im playing it right now and i love it even though im a console player xd i would love this you should do a gold deagle grind thank you this game needs more attention i come from the competitive side of ironsight and its in need of more players while the game isnt without its flaws its a great game the developers are transparent they have weekly community updates and regularly inform partners of whats happening on top of that the guns reasonably balanced and all around fun almost all ars are usable as well as smgs even in competitive scrims i see a huge variety of weapons used so thank you for looking at this game and showcasing this game it is far better from the current triple a shooters and i havent spent a dime and i have never felt someone has an advantage over me please check this game out it deserves far more attention then it has played it after watching this and its hella fun looks really fun im all in how i can change the fire mode of the an94 is it only on pc or xbox ps4 everyone wants a good cod on nextgen pls give us this d needs to be put on ps4 honestly id play the hell out of this i would like to see live gameplay commentaries on this game it looks fun coming to ps4 btw guys i never heard of this game but i plan on playing it now im glad they reached out to you have they moved away from using tcp to transmit packets it is better then cod will this be available for ps4 hope so soon very very solid game in my opinion definitely will try it out too bad the graphics look like dungeons and dragons best of codbest of fortnite sounds like a w its there a nuke or similar score streak this looks dope af this game looks great you wanna know the problem with character customization and fps ya cant fucking see it only the opponent can do something different like mw2 game mode third person arena shooter atleast i can enjoy the customization i enjoy shooting over the shoulder more then fps of course this is just me tho the weapon unlock system is really stupid unless its like u can get 5000 in a few games i guess ill need to see for myself i would love to see more of this game please upload more of this game bro this looks so much better than bo4 i hopethos comes on the ps4 soon been knowing about this game combat arms youtubers are moving to this game i would love for it to go to ps this is a ripoff of titanfall 2 this looks dope af id definitely play it if it was on xboxps4 shoot im a call of duty head and this game already looks better than call of duty they need to bring it out for the console this game is solid been playing it for weeks ive played this game and it is amazing i love it how the fuck has activision not completely sued the hell out of these developers jack frags showed this off and its awesome i know this is sponsored but if its anything like bo2 than its a good game a free to play fps game with more consumer friendly practices than cod sign me up is it on ps4 ok how are you killing so fast i get about 30ping on this game and get demolished constantly dont tell me i suck love it prestige keep the good work this is game looks better than black ops 4 game looks really good ryan looking promising small note on the gold camo req you need to complete all the weapon kill challenges for that specific weapon the last just is 1000 kills just for that specific tier of the challenge the total number is closer to 2000 kills if i remember correctly hey this is completely unrelated but i got cod 4 remastered and infinite warfare on my ps4 and even with the iw disc in my ps4 it does not detect it anyone know how to fix this i would love for this to come to ps4 need ps4 version asap is this game on the ps4 or only pc pristeig if i would compare it to any fps game it would be me or literally everyone rainbow prestige bo2 me is this for console looks way better than bo4 thats for sure if this game comes out on xbox id play it a lot this game looks really good as somebody who plays cod religiously i cant wait to download and play it its pretty fun but it has skill based match making i wish this was on console i hope this comes to console i would love to play this when call of duty doesnt help with boredom will this be on xbox one ive been playing this for a long time glad youve found it big fan of your videos but this is nothing but a blatant advertisement youd have to be blind to think thats an aaa game dont sell yourself out prestige your leaving other companies decide your content big fan of your videos but this is nothing but a blatant advertisement youd have to be blind to think thats an aaa game dont sell yourself out prestige your leaving other companies decide your content is it only on pc just built my first pc and this video made ironsight the first multiplayer pc game i have ever played thanks for the recommendation i like it so far i like it i would def watch more but why not console lol the link you posted for the game is broken as shit cant get past the captcha codes or click the im not a robot box when it will be on ps4 well their first attempt at gold camo looks better than anything weve ever seen in cod thats pretty sad on cods part i really hope this comes to xbox asap i hate fartnite im not getting bo4 so i definitely wouldnt mind spending money on this if someone can do cod better than cod has been doing im totally on board this game seems great all the people are asking for this kind of fps and activision gives as a mixed rainbow and overwatch game smh any chance it comes to console its not that great its good but not cod or bf good should be on xbox would be lit yes wanna see more gameplay downloading now have you also played warfaceextremely fun but the spawns can be frustrating if its not on console then it doesnt count as a cod killer as cod is mostly played on console bless us more of this beautiful game prestige any game is better than cod now is this on steam yes this game looks great can they put it on ps4 yessssssssss please more gameplay i love this game as much as i love this channel pc only this looks dope af and i fully support you doing more videos for this game and grinding shit out is this on ps4 hey good to see im partnered with ironsight if you need any info hmu twitter is xchocoq free games is the new wave wait is it a pc game overall looks really fun just hopes its not just for pc any info about consoles this game looks great should post more about it something great again were tired of the ww2 nobody plays it and so much games out there that we dont know keep it up prestige really like this game let the end of call of duty youtuber channels begins bring it to ps4 i have 1 main problem with cosmetics its the fact that theyre really pay to win if you really think about it the colors green white orange and brown make you rather blend in on certain maps the enemy will not notice you at all but there still is that chance that you can still be noticed but sometimes our eyes fail to see through camouflage for instance on black ops 3 i use the earth clothes for earthy maps usually people do not notice me in the air which generates me a chance to fuck that person up that is truly the main problem with cosmetics and that cosmetics should only be bright noticeable clothing since the main purpose is to show off right not to have anything else as a purpose console to or just pc i honestly rather see this than bo3bo4 fortnite siege ww2 it looks fresh but old school hit detection looks better than all treyarch games combined did you see the variety of assault rifles there was like 20 there instead of like 6 ars they give you in cod looks fun the maps are better than all the maps in cod ww2 it has flow please come to xbox is this on ps4 is this on the ps4 play this way better than ww2 love the game just saw your channel now and i cant stop watching is this on xbox how will it run on an average laptop i can run fortnite at a solid 60fps on my laptop not highest graphics settings but decent enough any possibility this might come to ps4 pubg and fortnite now cod and ironsight prob not gona go well looks pretty good if it comes to console it will do a lot better and maybe follow the success of fortnite i wish i could play this but i only have a normal windows the thing is when i try to register were it supposed to say enter email adress is being blocked by a giant rectangle that says this site uses cookies and every time i touch okay it doesnt let me so this is just a promo well im out man i want to play because this games sounds amazing but i dont have my pc with me right now and pc only a free to play cod that i dont have to be in china to play im in lol i played this months ago i really want to see that crossbow in bo4 so prestige will shill all kinds of crap as long as they toss money st him i actually really love the look of this game i hope they keep up their work on the game to try and make this even better than it already is anything nowadays is better than cod been playing it from time to time it actually feels pretty nice wish it was on console would decently pay money if it was on console looks better than bo4 do you know whats free and better than iron sight or cod fortnite fortnite is king can u ever play this on console i d like to we really need a new series in the genre im rooting for them not sure why youtubers are being sponsored by this game it is actually a 2 year old game so open beta is bs nothing will change or has changed in the past 3 months or so sniping is easier than mw2 so if you have a good aim youll destroy moneyiskey its like rainbow six seige mixed with call of duty i love this game cool deal mahn thx is this only on pc if this comes to console cod will officially die this looks like a lot of fun but im worried if itll be hit with a cease and desist down the road from activision it just seems a little too similar for it to be considered an original ip looks better than fortnight hell yeah its better than cod is it just for pc this actually looks really good im getting r6s and modern warfare vibes from it more than anything how to make a good game in 2018 make it free and add micro transactions that dont affect your skill or gives you an advantage yeah this game looks really good actually haha might actually be hopping on this looks better than black ops 4 lol is it on ps4 free on what console or pc that map looked like plaza from black ops 2 hopefully it will come to ps4 looks really nice i would like to see more ironsidecontent but not too mucj get a crossbow quad feed can u play this on xbox its kinda like black light retribution with its gun currency and with one of the maps advanced warfare 10 this game looks great wish it was on console makes me wanna build a pc to play i would not be against watching more ironsight from you prestige i played it a small bit myself and i do love this game so far is there any plans for this game to come to ps4 or xbox would be amazing if they could add a better anti cheat system its already starting to get aimbots n stuff maaan fuck free pc games why is fortnite working without hackers but this isnt is it on console or mac for ps4 yes to this game just keep playing with mouse and keyboard consistently and you will definitely improve edit i love this game and would love to see more ps4 please its pretty damn fun but my god the grind i feel like you can say this abt any cod game like hes breaking down any basic cod game i play another game kinda like this called warface that is pretty fun also f2p if i didnt have that already i would definitely be playing this game since my pc doesnt have much storage sounds like cod with a better currency system with dynamic map events and strike chains more iron sight d the call of duty we all really want sony needs to jump on this its awesome its like cod online by better call of duty and games like this are boring they stretched dps games out for to long what platforms is this on pc only or all will this game ever be on ps4 i would be willing to pay full price if it was actually on xbox i want to see more of this game and if it was console i would so get it no call of duty series are completely better and fine of everything including battlefield fps games than other games is it available on ps4 is it only gonna be on pc has a cod ghost feeling yes do more vids on ironsight please idk it reminds me of bo2 for a reason idk if i would play this would get a lot of memories and i dont want to dear ironsight devs please put this on xbox and playstation sincerely a console gamer who cant afford a decent pc been hearing a bit about this game seems interesting but i dont have a good enough computer to run it would like to see more videos on this game if only this game came to console will this be on console and its not a virus infinity wards needs to make their next game like this this game looks pretty fucking good i wish it was on console hope this game gets big and moves to consoles the only con i see is that its only on pc a majority of the fps audience are on console not pc eh no bo2 is not the best bo1 n waw was this game looks wayyyyy better than any cod tbh wow their own engine it looks and runs so smoothly in this video wow this seems like an unofficial call of duty online for non chinese players looks sick i want it im guessing it wont be on ps4 so i guess imma have to try use my laptop ah well am i the only one who got a little kid playing clash for my ad rather get this than bo4 ye it looks good until u actually play it and realize how many fukin issues the games has i would wait until the full game comes out because at its current state its just unplayable is this pc only this would be nice for ps4 any game is better than cod my guy modern guns or heavily inspired by their real counterparts and boots on the ground is all i want from a cod i hoped black ops 4 would be the case but it seems its taking place many years after black ops 2 and a few years before black ops 3 with a little better graphics it could have been easily a new cod title it looks good better than infinite warfare and wwii lol dude just keep trying with the mouse and key youll get it and when you do you will smash your controller and say never again definitely looks cool id give it a try i like this i want more of it anything is better than this gen cod ive tried it and id definitely not it is the same almost bring it to ps4 is it on council i would love to play but dont have pc rip this is bad ass prestige please play more of this game show the world that there are games more worth playing than just cod every year plus indie devs care more than triple a assholes yea this looks pretty interesting lol this is a better blacklight retribution please let it be ps4 does it work for mac call of fortnite this ever coming to concole my only complaint on the game is that the reaction times are faulty like i try to aim then shoot another guy but he kills me because apparently i was too slow like wtf also this game needs controller support do you know if this will ever come to console the rent system is amazing i first saw this system in blacklight retribution another f2p fps been playing this game for a few months i freaking love it yeah it is not perfect and the hitreg is sometimes a bit odd but idk it is fun the cringiest thing of 2018 what systems is it for pc and console or exclusive yes please prestige i would love to see more of this game i dont have a strong pc so at least seeing some gameplay would make me happy is it pc only downloading on my pc now hope it will play it this game is the cod that activision could never make gaming is so dead did you guys play any crysis series the multiplayer was crazy i wish it was on console so its a mashup between bo2 and mw3 pretty cool how the fuck do you verify your email it just sends an email saying this message has no content cause they cant send an email properly is it on ps you should say only pc i hope the servers dont fuck up because of prestige promoting it lol levelcap did it and it happened this game looks awesome would like to see more of it on your channel i would no doubt play this if it was on console does it still have mouse acceleration so you played a knock off of black light retribution do you think lenovo y720 with gtx 1060 6gb can run this game at high setting with 60fps what system is this for i would support this game into full development and hope it comes to consoles this looks like a great shooter i hope in the future this becomes available on console is this for pc only is this on console this looks badass i really hope once its finished it comes to console more ironsight plz potential to kill fortnite but is it on console exactly this looks good hope this comes to consoles it looks better then ww2 please upload more ironsight videos oh its pc only irrelevant i wish this game was on console it looks beast but thiccboi isnt this only on pc i wish i had a pc looks like ima buy one not for just this game for others as well not the first time a free game is better than cod lmao edit damn basically 200 likes i never comment bc its waste of time glad i did though cunts need this on console more iron sights i was 100 gonna play this but when i saw that the weapons are buyrent i hate games that do this this game actually looks pretty good im impressed how much was the sponsorship payment so that even put that title please bring this to console thats not the first game thats free and better than cod coughcough smooth af is it only for pc i love how smooth it plays feels like call of duty used to and i can still play it on my crappy 300 laptop no problem do some videos about some of the different guns also i think you should try rainbow six siege dude i love aeria games i cant believe they actually included a game on their sight to bring in shooter based people i remember the team from eden eternal is it pc only is it for ps4 xbox one right one problme i dont have windows pc lol this looks like the cod game that old school cod fans would makei would buy this game the second comes out on console id love to see this on xbox i got this game a long time ago it was great and good thing you made a video on it i may go back on it i will be saying i wish i had ww2 cause the updates look dope but i just stuck to playing infinite warfare im not gonna get bo4 because honestly fuck treyarch for being dicks to the community and only caring for those with money only for pc its not on ps4 oh welllll i hope you do more videos of this game it looks awesome this is the modern warfare shooter game we need is this on consle too is it a pc game not interested thank you nice video though ryan make ironside a series please it looks awesome if their was a way to support the dev team bring this to console id support it played it its ok also no controller support is good it means no aim assist in not good with mouse n keyboard but ill never use a controller unless its a race game finally i see a video i see of you playing ive been playing it for the past 3 months and im enjoying it everytime i play i love this game cause its fresh and not a piece of shit like the more recent call of dutys have been this game is just like rainbow 6 siege its like cod but it isnt it what cod supposed to be after black ops 2 but it wasnt are you watching this activision copying and pasting a game better watch out for an activition lawsuit lmao is it bad that i feel more hyped over a free to play fps thats probably not even going to be on consle over a triple a title bo4 multiplayer looks like a joke but this game actually looks fun nah fam try warface its free and better pc specs looks better than most cods tbh its free rather play this than ghosts aw iw ww2 been playing this game for a while its pretty damn awesome first map reminded me of plaza this on console shroad played this game and said he would never play it again the game actually looks great and fun and its not just a sponsored vid where you need to speak good but anyway i wish this was on console i actually really like the look of this in a way it looks like black ops 2 but somewhat refined and a tiny bit like black ops 4 recoil looks like mw2 from the video but i cannot tell just from watching of course would love to see this come out on console as i dont personally own a good enough pc to run games but i have a ps4 at hand which i feel would be really good for it to release on and possibly compete with cod on console isit there for ps4 we need the cod youtubers to put pressur on them to bring this game on consoles more ironsight is it on console black ops 2 was not the best cod its either mw2 or world at war js this is literally a shitty ripoff of cod sponsored video much please make more videos on iron sight is this on console or like idk i just got on this video prestige you are awesome even without a controller and you inspire me to do my best please keep playing better than blackops 4 what consoles are it on any plans for ps4 this looks like bo4 except its free how much they pay you to say its better than cod wish it was on xbox cod watch and learn im so happy to see my favorite youtuber playing my favorite game d can they put this on console ps this video is sponsorised by ironside its normal that he talks good about it come out for console please please do more ironsight i have recently played it and it literally feels like a better cod ghosts love it soo much us console plebs will continue to pretend to be interested and then move on as the game isnt available on console good but not cod if they get zombie mode cod would be worried is this on the ps4 def gonna give this a try looks really fun thanks ryan only on pc finally a bigger personality talking about this game i honestly love it but the one big down side to it is their servers they are pretty terrible you die around walls so much but apart from that i give it a 1010 actually looks sick only if i had a pc to play it on lol its not hard to beat cod finally someone speaks out about this game the issue with these asian shooters is that they dont employ the cod spawning system that flips they have set spawns that makes playing the game a lot more repetitive and annoying gonna try it out though is this only pc wish it was on ps4 is this on xbox one bring this to console is this a console game i hope its not locked behind pc black ops was good but modern warfare 2 was the best one in my opinion bro it is a ripoff this reminds me of blacklight retribution from the microtransaction policies and rent a weapon system and the charachter system and the near future setting and the purchasable killstreaks whilst ingame and the diversity of weapons and the free2play model game is epic runs soo smoothly better than cod can we copystrike ironsight at this point anything is better than cod if you want to use a controller you can try ds4windows it works with almost every game the game seems to be nice i would like to see some sniping is it for xbox 1 thank god u made a video on this it is so underrated people havent even heard of this first video of yours ive watched in a while too burnt out on activisions bullshit i work too hard to waste my money on games anymore yeahenjoy this game whatever its called im going to stick with call of duty looks decent would definitely try it out if it was on console i used to play pc for cod4mw2 but lost interest is it on xbox we need this on console this is what cod should be i remember hearing about this game from a different channel months back really want to give it a try i love this game i just hope it doesnt follow the slow p2w path interested but inreally hope that add a bit finesse on the graphics side bit of an eye cancer at the moment like 25 years old would this ever come for ps4 reminds me a bit on the original ut somehow textures environment there were mods in which you could use regular weapons rather than the ut weapons loved that game id like this game on console but thats probably not gonna happen is this game on ps4 prestigeiskey is this game on ps4 someone please tell me i would easily drop 5999 for this old school fps and no microtrasanctions bs if it ever gets to consoles it would be the real cod killer im 67 hours in its real fun but the netcode needs work meh its not for ps4 playstation yes thank you i found this game about a month ago and i love it but its so small that there arnt many iron sight youtubers dont support games that copy basically everything from another ive been playing this game for a while now would love to see you make more content for it and spread it to grow the playerbase this actually looks dope is it on consoles to i can see this game getting big and popular keep playing this game it looks awesome too bad its not on console the graphics and textures are horrible this shit aint better than cod wtf this game looks so awesome would play no there isnt any 6v6 twitch arena shooter that will everbe as polished as cod is but this does come the closest to cod this game looks great hope we see you play this game a bit more is this on console or is it gonna be on console i just hope they dont make the in game currency too hard to get heyy it has health regeneration only pc or is it on console too this game really is good im enjoying the hell out of it it captures the cod feeling better than the new cods i just really hope they dont screw it up after it escapes from the beta phase also i would enjoy seeing more ironsight from you more people would get on this game this needs to be on ps4it already looks better than any cod i would buy this in a minutebut heck its freeif only ps4 is it pc only or is it available for p4 wow this game actually looks super fun thank you for sharing this playing ironsight on your ironside computerthat makes you iron man well lets all hope that activision will lose any lawsuit involving this game cause lets be honest it will probably happen is it on ps4 dude this looks so good i love b02 im getting this right after i smash the like button is it pc only game looks fun just wish it was on xbox and ps4 we should tweet at ironsight and ask kindly if it can come to console is this on console would love to try it but dont have a pc this should go for consoles i would probably play this more than the other fps shooters i have like if you agree wish i had a pc lol ironsight fills the hole cod left in our lives great vid dudelooks like a great game is it coming to console for us peasants how can i play this game on ps4 is it on ps4 is this on ps4 hey man are you going to be getting bfv prestige you would make one helluva salesman you missed your calling love ya sorry ill stick with cod yeah man keep playing this game this game looks fun gonna try it on a i5 2300 is this on ps4 or will it ever come to ps4 dude there are a lot of free games better than cod post apocalypse huh i did not see claptrap at all in this vid i knew it i was just waiting for ryan to review this game great video although this looks badass this still looks and feels like cod was getting a little bored with wwii so i picked this up a while back i liked it when bo4 decided to do the pass the way they did i went to this full time i will be playing this instead unless something changes with bo4 i agree on getting controller support so console players can pick it up and best of all it doesnt take a great pc to play it with good settings and good fps anything is better than cod ask them to bring to console prestige boi reeeeee anyone have any idea if its coming to consoles later yeah go for it prestige i download this game about a month ago and i love the ways its set up so keep playing maybe you can get other cod you tubers to give it a try cause it feel just like cod bo2 needs controller support one concern would there be a copyright infringement lawsuit is it only for pc ironsight feels like you are playing bo2 and mw2 looks really good jusy wish it was on ps4 free for xbox hope this comes to console try out warface bruh this game is hella lit prestige is this only for pc really looking forward for new games like this one so its warface with less stuff ironsight dev team lets take a beloved game and try our best to make a better one activisionthey love it now make me more money infinify ward we got you ghosts cod fanboys face palm i have been waiting for you to cover it do more f2p games great video and god bless the game looks awesome played it and for me its not better than cod not even close i hope this comes to ps4 or xbox1 here comes a lawsuit from activision see how did you get to install the game like i eventually will get an error message when installing please tell me u had this same issue i reached out to the ironsights devs and really werent much of a help i known a lot of people are in the same situation that i am right now no i do not have a crappy pc core i7 1060 gtx ect how did u install this game its been a few months since i tried and eventually gave up installing rye yan 3 it needs to come to consoles i want this on xbox one how can it be better when it looks like a cod copypaste hope they add something like zombies because i mostly play zombies definitely interested iron sight is a great game much better than ww2 in my opinion this game reminds me of warface without scorestreaks and i have to say i like it alot is this available on ps4xb1 this beta was released a long time ago i make videos about this game this game looks really kool cod is dead at this pointnor bo4 is getting respect or lovecod is loosing respectbut i hope activison learns from there mistakessaynotoblackopspass yes play more as soon as i started watching this vid i decided to download it i wanna see this in console ironsight is not better than cod played the beta a couple of months ago and i had lots of fun playing with friends great video prestige i love this game i would like you to make more videos prestigeiskey it will really be cool hope they make a ps4 version id play that all the time if they did its not better due to the fact that its exclusive to pc its crazy that cod is charging 5999 for the game and almost 100 black ops pass and this game is free to play almost the same graphics and faster pacenot stuck in mud walking with ars wow that weapon buying system is so bad xd refreshing pretty sure the only refreshing thing about this game is the increase in your bank account lmao this game seems like its trash will this be coming to ps4 is it like cod online with their gun system i wish this was on console i saw the title and thought it was going to be fortnite can we get this on console if the game is pc exclusive than i dont think so this on pc is this on xbox u stated u liked the idea of buying weapons in black ops the 1070 ti has better specs 110 better than cod damn this is better than black ops 4 when will you be reviewing dlc 3 i started playing this game 5 days ago lol why cant acrivision make something like that why make the games so complicated bo2 mw2 bo1 mw3 cod4 theyre great because theyre simple cosmetic only this is what cod should be this is what made me love cod i might try this game it looks cool is not better if is not on console would be amazing if this was on consoles meh its pretty cool i guess deleted it after a couple matches if this releases on ps4 it might try fighting against cod helleven fortnite thank you prestige i was honestly looking for something else to play lol seems like an awesome game ayy you finally played it 5 months after i told you on twitch d the onlything i would love to see is faster health regen for ps4 pls is this game on xbox i would pay for this on ps4 sooooo is it only on pc is it only on pc or on consoles too wheres that dlc 3 review yea it is its way better notification gang i love this game but i wish it was on console and not just pc i want this on the ps4 ok ok ok ok ok how is this game not as famous as modern warfare they still dont have kill cam i hate it i get rage ey at this but not regular cod can you invest in middle east well fuck you is it worth my time if you can play with all those problems high ping exploits and bugs bad netcode poor hitboxe not really good bad matchmaking will match you with higher rank than you really higher no optimization slow updates lack of content and the worst thing is the cheaters if all of this is fine with you to play the game its worth your time is this free no its free more fun kill cam why enless your that guy that moans all the time do team fortress 2 worth my time how to spot a free to play game 1 too sexy skins not even camo and beneficial 2 customization on skins not attachments and optics 3 multiplayer only 4 a bit asian because of its design and cosplay not even fully military 5 microtransactions 040 this aint pubg shows ros ok this game is basically call of duty lite is the krm 262 here i like iron sight when i played yesterday for the first time and i enjoyed but when i play i try playing tutorial and it didnt work so i back out and exit the game and then reopen the game then try playing it then it decided to work but i played it with a controller and it seem and felt cool trying to get used too and trying to learn how to play it with mouse and everything but the game is still in beta when i played and i hope they improved it in 2020 and make it a good game i like this guy i like his style of video im subscribing keep up the great work dude this game was fun for a while but man devs are so incompetent nice rage quit hole you kicked in the wall there lol ironsight fucking blinks in the taskbar if it found a match holy shit just found out sry for caps but oh my shitting fuck 1100 so if you dont have the money you have to play as anthony padilla just watch this 221 rules of survival sucksid rather play pubg lite dude maybe you are ted from how i met your motheri have just mind blowned from the similarity of the voice 222 when the video actually starts hehe you asked for it i delivered now i am triggered about the pubg part and he shows the game called ros who had the goosebumps when modern warfare showed up hey anthony whats the songs used laugh 1138 duck rage incoming i played ironsight on my laptop but i had to deinstal it becouse my laptop dosent have a god grafiks card but i am going to build my own computer and i am gona reinstall the game on it with warface noobs from cod bo3 jumps into ironsight where is da brrreccciiiiiiiiii bye ironsight hello cod mobile video start at 222 ur wellcome i thought the video about whether using iron sights instead of red dot and other scopes in fps games was worth your time i never heard of this game i guess if i play my now theres hackers or spammers saying some ad for hacks is this game on xbox the simple and clean reference lol i wanted to buy bo4 as thought price woulda gone down by now still 30 pounds thank god i found this game and fuck you blizzard activision i would really play but you cant play in eastern europe hahaha that was a great hilarious review ill check it out this game looks so amazing man installing now great video bud i slapped that sub button 1min 30sec still fucking talking about whats not in the video this is pure trash i wouldnt recommend black ops 2 for multiplayer now every player is ether a hacker or a total sweat i wouldnt recommend black ops 2 for multiplayer now every player is ether a hacker or a total sweat yes you can press f1 f2 f3 wow i didnt even realize until now that all the maps in this game are exactly like certain call of duty maps the repair system is perfectly fine in my opinion it takes a shitload of time to break a gun and it only takes like 4000 to fix it so i dont have a problem with it i used to play the crap out of wolfteam 1029 now you can press the function keys everyone should come back to this game 624 there is a shotgun seems like you missed it i play asian server of this on steam it dont have cool tutorial like this tt i loved this game until they did a crazy update and now i get like no fps have a great day urself xd we are all going to die someday thanks bro this dude got clear sight from an attachment box continues to grind for 20000cp or levels but theres mouse acceleration game is called ironsight everyone literally runs around and hipfires and now its garbage again and still in beta is it worth my time watching this video loved the video man i wish this was on ps4 if it did then i play this game more than other games that i have 721 and i spent most of my time in good ol tdm bruh i practically breathe deathmatchi live deathmatch why are people saying this game is p2w yeah i would kill thousands of people for hours over a duck as well next shit that will be full of cheaters some dayi used simple d3d aimbot and esp created by me iam not pro coder and it works ironsight ur anticheat suks what a nice intro shotguns are secondary weapons 039 pubg shows gameplay of rules of survival i think shotgun is secondary since i have a spas 12 here advice to all who want to play iron sight switch to hold down aim did you know this game made there own engine liked the video even more because i played iron for a long time i made a video on my channel check it out winter is coming i got the game for my crappy laptop i fell in love press f1 f2 or f3 to change weapons while waiting for the to start shotguns are secondary weapons btw the shotguns are in the secondary part please on console dude this was a super good video i liked your combo of you plus your game play i was crackin up earned a sub here which is better iron sight or war face u should do an is quake champions worth my time vid i just realized that the developers are the same developers that made soldier front 2 my second most played steam game that i have 280 hours in glad they didnt fall off of the map and i hope to see this come to steam because im gonna play it for sure i like how its called ironsight when i barley aim in where can i go to get this game on my pc why is there neebsgaming merch quacq anthony quacq indian fan here you would soon reach 1 million loved your video is ironsight on ps4 152 well i actually if u ask me im fan of that can u tell me more games like that umm whats up with him wearing an identitarian logo hat at 937 not to be confused for a halflife logo is anthonycsn a white nationalist or something httpsenwikipediaorgwikiidentitarianmovement i cant get enough of the emotes iron sight 2 well i was searching for a good game to play at lanparty and landed into ironsight after few hours yes seems a cod remake mechanics are solid and the fun is great also there are pve missions and the possibility to run local servers damn it is good there are shotguns they are considered secondary weapons aka you can take a shotgun or a pistol aaa i cant play because of my low end pc man i am too busy these days i need to download call of duty modern warfare modern warfare 2 modern warfare 3 black ops black ops 2 black ops 3 ironsight fortnite destiny 2 far cry 3 4 and 5 battlefield 4 anthony you always say it claims to be free to play it says its free to play is the clan still active i am really interested in getting in to this game why is everything getting old or ancient or retro i dont like this meta hive mind internet culture that refers to something from 2012 back in the day its all about good core game play and tight controls a nd a feeling of fun progression i agree with this hosts thoughts but just pointing out a common trend i am knoticing about everything just imagine if a game like this was out back in 2012 for free as is it would blow up the internet if your reading this play dirty bomb too its amazing free game is it on xbox any loading screen with big title and a image of the map just like cod any loadout screens appear after loading screen just like cod a gray and white screen just like co bitch please how about you compare the whole games with cod if youre comparing all fps games with cod im dead sure you will keep thinking the games are just like cod and besides cod didnt came up with a design that had a title and a image behind it i honeslty dont know why im commenting on this dumb video knowing you wont read it and you wont care because you get money off of it anthony are you still playing ironsight also what happened to your csnc clan i just downloaded this crap i cant join any match because it asks me for password theres lots of things that are different from cod like rubber ducky 1322 its worth his time everybody 604 shotguns are set as secondaries for some reason me sees ros anthony this games nothing like pubg i will join the clan awful haircuts agree to disagree even when the game is a ripoff from bo2 it has no hackers this reminded me of the free cod modern warfare 2 server a decade ago im definitely plaing this one 623 you said no shotguns but i see a jackhammer and a spas12 745 the banner ctrl is the prone key for modern warfare 2 by default so that might explain that keybind the gun play looks soo crispy hold sucks toggle or gtfo you piece of crap i call modern combat versus iron sight mobile i ended up having so much more fun on this than bo4 i watched 5 minutes of this video and got barely any insight about the game come on man please respect the viewers is this better than warface rewatched i play the shit out of this game thanks to this video thank you anthonycsn ye from the look of yourface u definetly prolly dont have much time i played this and loved it since areia sold last chaos to gamigoive been waiting for them to come out with something decent for and older audience this fits the bill shoud i playit very nice review tired of tai lopez getting on my screen on every video iron sight now sucks does heroes and general ww2 and war thunder worth yall time anthony anthony anthony if this game is like cod or is cod there isnt wall run no robot escort andno duck in cod ps not trying to be rude if i sound like it is it still good 151 fast paced run die respawn im in hey bro there are shotguns in ironsight theyre classified as secondary weapons also i cant seem to find your clan u forgot to mention that you dont need steam or anything similar to download the game just head to their site register download and play i want this game who wants to join my ironsight clan its called klu klux thank you so much omg this game is incredible i am going to play this all the flipping time i love it omggggggg thank you anthony when i but a fetus i was always playing bo2bo3 and mw3 on console but when i switched to pcs well games are hella expensive on pc so i cant get alot of games you saved my life now i can go back to a different time thank you downloading ironsights and creative destruction after watching countless videos on firstperson shooters this one surely sold me never played cod never played fortnite but have played a lot of halo games and used to kick some serious buttocks in combat arms i research a lot before i buy a game after years of dealing with money traps i have also realized popular games are not always the best there is a shot gun but it is secondary dear ironsight can you please add native xbox 360 controller support i have an extra pc in the living room and when im on it a controller would be better also add auto lock aim cause a controller sucks for shooting thanks ok so i just downloaded and tried black squad teh other day and this looks exactly the same the shotguns are in the secondary section anthonycsn there is shotgun in game this is how the micro transactions should be optional not too pay to win and free to play if bf5 fallout76off and battlefront all did this there games wouldnt be total garbage rn where ur clan at some how better than cod is watching these videos worth my time is anthonycsn worth my time me of course he is the free game that is a rip off is fortnite a rip off on vbucks and skins but the best on playing xd bitch just say yes or no this game doesnt have an asia server due to loot boxes this game has stolen assets and stolen animations it is too easy to spot this looks like a chinese game lmao the first gun i bought was a vector maybe ironsight isnt worth my time but is this video worth my time either can we change the race i dont like playing as small peepee man its free and i just spent my hard earned money on a pc and dont have any money left its free and its a good game i love it my friend with potatoe pcs can play with me im 14 so i dont get full paid so i earned 4 every hour at restaurant does the amd radeon r5 200 series graphics card work with this game the shotguns are at the secondary i thing ironsight is the same as warface cant i just connect my controller and play with it this video is a waste of my time lol tbh call of duty looks better but does it worth extra 60 maybe i never played any cod which of the older retro titles shud i chkout thx thanks for the video feels like csgo it looks like more fun than fortain i will def download it yay your review is amazing kept me till the end why do your voice is like woody from toy story it looks goodbut ive said the same with warfaceand look what happend is ti optimised though you should be able to t bag at least on pc we get free games that are actually good shotguns are availabe as few as they are as secondaries theres the spas12 which is punchy and has high damage at the cost of a low rate of fire and the jackhammer which does significantly less damage and kicks like a mule but has a high rate of fire just hope that aeria games doesnt screw up everyting making this a pay to win game for a kid who doesnt has money this game is perfect which platform 80 percent comenting me just wathing the video 511 play it on slow mo your review suck like if your time is something to get into consideration is ironsight worth my time guess what who cares go suck one youre really really really good at this game for having just started fresh compare this to warface please looks promising but it doesnt reconize password even after i changed it so after watching a few gameplay videos it looks ok so just for this game im gonna make a new account just go back play black ops 2 umm the issue with this statement is the game isnt monitored anymore so you will come across players using hacks at least when playing the pc version if you plan on going back to play bo2 recommend playing it on console because its harder to use hacks and you will most likely have a decent gaming experience i cant find youre clan i n e e d t h i s to me this is basically cod online but for the us what about cheaters in this game is it flooded there is shotguns for the secondary weapon slot im surprised he didnt tell everyone about the worlds worst netcode any video game has ever seen is ironsight coming to xbox anytime soon thx for the vid it helped me alot i subb cuz youre awesome ytber i feel like u played the game for an hour and then made a video there have been shotguns in the game for a long time they arent primary its under secondary and u need to purchase one with in game gold the weapon repair system is easy to manage without spending any real or grinding for hours on end i cant find your clan name this looks very enjoyable im tired of cod i never liked cod but im really into ironsight atm its really fun dude the shotguns are secondary weapons good no shotguns for toxic non skilled players who rant and boast with a weopon that takes no skillkeep it that way ironsight is the best well it has no asian servers so like wtf i love this game but the one thing i majorly disagree with is fucking snipers this game has massive quickscoper bullshit problems a sniper does literally every thing better than any thing else in the game when your only option to counter a sniper at literally any range is to use a sniper yea its over powered and broken they need to nerf them hard also the vector is actually great all the fast firing smgs are good coming back to say i played this game because of this review and god i dont regret it why the fuck did i just realise hes anthony from neebs gaming my only issue is warface vs ironsight mmmh i think i met you in game i think your vids are honest and u crack me up bro from one tony to another good shit shotguns are secondary weapons and repairing guns is really minor its like 70gp per match to repair but u earn like 600gp a match u can also let it go down until 2500gp cost which would take forever but by that time u already bought 23 guns 150 i love this die hard honesty had a laugh your actually hilarious ive actually shot a vectorkinda lame and not as awsome as i thought itd be what about battlefield are you the kid who tried to sell your dads boat in gta v im just wondering will they make a campaign the beginning made me think yeah this game is a triple a game few years ago like a 10 performance is still kinda modern people have fps drops on a high end pcs nevertheless its a fun game with good gunplay i hope they will add more unique modes and bigger maps switching form cod to cd go was wired and now switching form cd go to cod is wired i like this guy alot i like the music this game sucks bad netcode bugs bad weapons op smgs can kill dmrs super easy ars lack range and shotguns are pointless theres so many issues the video starts here 0000 thank me later just discovered this today from a friend its pretty fucking great ow my god there is a duck in game i must have it in my plate in lunch that game is full of cheatershackers ummm you didnt really look through the menus that well because shotguns are in the game and ontop of that you get the crates for free when you level up and then a better one every 5 lvls i think you messed up by saying that people that dont like cod wont like iron sight because a good chance they will because this game plays way better 624 jackhammer and the spas12 are definitely no shotguns d i didnt even know this was free thought it was a game you had to buy remember this game is still in beta idk why you reviewed it early this looks awesome but i wish it was for ps4 lol even the pts on kill pop up is cod like i got this game a couple weeks ago and oh is it good its crazy how good it is for being free graphics are great and its not pay to win either okayim download this shit right now i just cant handle anymore i am addicted to this game this game is the best f2p shooter out there no p2w u need only skills but the question really is is it worth it wasting time to watch this video fuck off with pubg tell me this 1 more time and i call my nigga gay shit from santa barbara is ironsight worth my time sees a rubber duck hell yeah my favorite gun is the brecci why no brecci say what you will id pay money to play this over the next codbf so long as they are constantly updating it and listing to the community hey the shotguns are in the secondary slot which there is only 2 spas 12 and the jackhammer youre a silly fat youtuber that should cancel your channel straight away well sign me up im gonna go play this just got the game installed and dude this is awsome i watched this video like a month ago and wanted to download the game but got it today the mouse movement is so great i am loving it can you also do one on black squad its pretty much free cs go i wish the repair system is not a feature but they have to make a bit more money cuz its f2p so ok hey there anthony my names hussain and i just started seeing all of of your vids and i really enjoyed my time thanks alot for your vidsoh yeah by the way you see if warfame is worth your time its really nice you hop off to something else but free to play fps looks like warface but id rather play this that knife is technically not a karambit due to the lack of a ring so its just a hawkbill knife cool video funny banter earned a sub bigfrankenberry is my handle add if anyone wants to group where is insert time cod and crossfire combined its highkey fire i play it a lot lmao how do i prevent your videos from popping up in my recommended is ironsight worth my time holy shit we have a real celebrity here xdddddddddddd woahyoud follow adas girl i smell a soap opera a brewin with this shitty game all you need is snipers and fast fire rate weapons to win the netcode is garbage and the devs dont even bother to fix main issues athonys character metrosexsoldier i cant find the clan is it goin to be on consoles dont know why i cant find this game how about size download i have limited data access can anyone tell me how big size download thx im less than half way thru this video and have loled twice you have a fan for life now bro keep them coming this is the first time i am totally loving a total ripoff damn i wish this game was on consoleit reminds so much of black ops 2 vitaly do you still actively play the game or no i personally havent played in awhile but im thinking of picking up the game again i played this and it reminds me of black ops 2 ok one question what game is inspired by overewatch does this have that shit view kick mechanic that cod has doesnt look like it does i can t find the clan i saw the g4tv logo i miss that channel so much xplay was my favorite show better than bo4 nothing like the shit blops wasironsight is similar to the mw series its more like cod 4 mw than any shit treyarch ever made theres shotguns now they cant kill people though do creative destruction worth my time video unless you stay outside of the eu or eastern part of us i miss the old shooter games like socom navy seals i liked those ones cause u dont have all this crazy air support crap and super suits i remember when u had to beat the game on the different difficulties to unlock the weapons no loot boxs no nuke strikes and no extra dlc addons that u end up spend in total 150 for a game the good old days im old as fuck 8 seems like a warface rip off 716 so call of duty aaand titan fall video starts at insert time here its kinda like a mix of all cod wtf you got the light sight already i needed that for my weapons and you got it in the first freaking box im triggered lel the repair cost means nothing its so low and the money you earn when playing makes up for it and more than a good amount aim bots are a big problem but yes the game is gr8 fun all the same lol one of the only videos on iron sight that isnt sponsored with the title saying the better than cod free to play fps omg i tried to play this game but not even the launcher wouldnt work shit devs it stopped working for me if you think about it when he thanks his patreons hes basically stareing at a tv 830 war robots shot guns are secondarys so basically i could play a game for free or 60 bucks if only this game is on mobile i hate cod but i love ironsight they have shotgun but in secondary gun fun review i will sub for somemore games man the game looks very nice and fun but its from aeria so nty played 3 matches of this game on muito shitty pc and made it shutdown couldnt turn it on for a week their not panicking btw their doing the prone tacting search it i went to go do some chores and get ready for bed did my taxes and when i got back anthonys intro was still going shotguns are in secondarys is anthonycsn worth my time shotguns are secondary in this game dont even bother going back to black ops 2 its fucked now to the point of it being unplayble unless your playing zombies or simgleplayer but every multiplayer match i join is full of modders and im not even kidding every lobby ironsight is currently mored call of duty than call of duty video starts at 000 thank me later ik this is 4 months later guys but shotguns were recently added btw futuristic call of duty but boot in ground better and free to play wait repair system is this from warface uhhh dats dropshot will be a cancer sometime there are shotguns they just replace your sidearm instead of your primary and theyre comparable in power i cant even download this shit it always says corrupt file i cant get a good file this game looks fucking sick my gawd im downloading it now 1245 bro there are too many hackers on bo2 its unplayable it would be insane if this game had campaign or singleplayer i think i should have asked myself if this video is worth my time anyone wanne team up this is what all og cod players were waiting for absolute perfection i need this game for console thank you ironsight god bless your review how long is this video is it 45 mins this game looks really cool but it seems so much like cod youd think they would get cease and desistd what prevents this from happening i wish this was on ps4 right into the pros and cons love it glad i got a helmed out of a chest lul i am not sure why people like this game so much the collision models are kinda glitchy and it feels some what more close quatered than cod oh also ranked queueing takes like an hour cuz no one plays ranked lol pubg ripoff a ripoff of a ripoff games are as bad as movies nowadays with original content anyone know the name of the song that plays at the beginning of the video bro this game needs to come to console like now it really looks fun youre awesome its an old video but i gotta add the timer on the guns is because you can buy them for very cheaplike 3 games worth half an hour pretry much to try them then they dont need to be repaired and you can use them for 48h i believe i cant wait to have a duck too ironsight sucks for the sole reason of the guns are strong based on range which is why snipers and lmgs are the strongest guns shotguns suck so bad they are unusable and the game for a free game feels worthless to play for cuz grinding things all feel the same and the guns time to kill a single meter out of your range is exaggerated and takes to long for how the reg feels and works not its not its nothing like cod kill times is horrible guns r clunky n its ftp so dont lie its bothinf like cod except the respawn n die theme damn did you have to make me depressed at the beginning can this be for a phone stop stop stop stop stop shotguns does exist in this game they are just secondary weapons 755 that sight looks so sick im actually loving this game its needs to come out on console it would very popular the shotguns are secondaries why does the shoutout sound like a song lol the netcode of this game is so bad that intro was depressing play warframe this should hit the consoles the game is amazing but what just really kills it for me is the repair system i never like dit in games and never will if they were to remove the repair system itd be a solid 1010 for me i am from india and i get 300 ms ping wtf is this the intro depressed me looks like cod done right says but no shotguns 628 shows jackhammer and spas12 is in the game too lol theyre secondaries dood im on a airplane and it has terrible wifi so it wont let me watch the video but i can still comment nice ive been looking for a nonsponsoredopinion it really seems to be as good as it looks guess ill give it a try i hope the recoil is harder we are all gonna die one day what a gud way to start this guy is the best lol how to download this shit wym outdated this game is way better than bo3 and infinite warfare subscribed for the a game called iron sights makes you use scopes joke if cod does not want to be cod another game will no shotguns pretty sure i saw a shotgun at 624 called the spas 12 no shotguns im sold press f to pay respect for sarah there are shotguns but theres no section for them for some reason downloading now i played cod back in the day cod 1 and 2 and really enjoyed the multiplayer i havent played any of the new ones because well they all looked kinda shitty after 2 imo this however cod clone gameplay aesthetic aside looks like a really fun fast paced arcade style shooter i feel like ill have a lot of fun with this one and hey if i dont guess what i didnt lose any money i cant believe this is the first video of yours ive watched love the vid shotguns are in secondaries wow those totally realistic cod sniper instincts feel so satisfying reminds me of good old intervention days this game actually looks good lmaoo so much better than call of dutyhope this game kills the series hope it gets on steam tho great vid is watching your videos worth my time gonna download that hope that game isnt gonna p2w shit shotguns are secondary fuck if i know why downloaded the game while watching this im excited shotguns are secondary slots tried this and hated it gunplay is clunky and a weird glitch in the menu made me accidentally spend all my gp on a shitty scope theres actually two shotguns in the game but theyre not primary weapons theyre secondarys you will find your favourite cod gun here b r e c c i you could also play roblox phantom forces hit marker sounds like warface the layout and presentation is like cod but the game is like a combo of halo and csgo love your vids btw can you make a is terreria worth terreria is a rpg sandbox game i have played it for 3 years again love your vids i wished cod online goes global call of duty 10 521 i see what you did there tried it and couldnt get past the awful net code at least for my region i would die well behind a wall or even before i turn a corner cool 530 you can buy the vector for 1d for only 4200 to test out a weapon before purchase 607 shotguns are located in the secondary weapons along with special weapons like call of duty mw2 told my friend was looking for games to buy for the summer sale might get this one i would play if the game launcher wasnt so bad and disconnecting midgame for no reason ping so bad i am from russia and prefier get my ass to moon there are actually shotguns as secondaries and omg theres a duck i must have it lmao that earned you a sub dude you switch between different shit too much one sec gameplay half a second later we see your face next second campaign etc i thought this video was gonna be about weapons having iron sight and that you were a fucking idiot glad i am wrong i imagine if this game on steam yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo its ariea games i lost my account on that i was like 500 hours on wolfteam 800 thank you i dont have top of the line software i have a 22 i7 intel core 8gb ram and a nvidia geforce gt 640m so im way outdated but i can still run it pretty smoothly do you earn in game currency oh god aeria games fucking soft cunts who cant understand that ridding a game of hackers could possibly help a game survive evidenced when we saw fear online die pretty quickly neebs gaming exposed if it was on steam i would play it this game is warface without the headshot insta kill mechanic killstreaks and way less fluid movement it is really nice that it looks like it is less locked behind unlocks and credit purchases aka play 10 hours for another mediocre weapon the weapons do not feel powerful at all it feels like youre shooting airsoft guns at someone movement is pretty clunky feeling to me and i honestly think if the headshots were more rewarding then it would be a lot better imo all in all not good not bad just an extremely mediocre game mw2 still has a ton of players struggles for console players i really hope controller support is added i tried joining his clan and it doesnt show up does this game have asian servers play a game for mobile called infinity ops the timed guns are there because you can rent guns for a day so you dont have to pay the full price to test il wait for ps4 release lol you got me a freaking anxiety attack with that intro i glad this game is out rip cod glad something new i hate tutorials lol i dont mind doing it on my own vs forced pray worth ur time yep im getting it i fucking loved black ops 2 it was sadly the last cod game that i loved i thought this was a mobile game anyone notice the neebs gaming thing behind up glad he likes ng blah blah blah holy shit theres a duck i put 10 hours into the game and go tired of getting around corners cod x warface on the low warface has a back story about resources and had gun repair thethe rest is like cod review was entertaining game seems more thanks black ops 2 remastered never liked cods mp not very fond of children screaming at me saying they shagged my mum hopefully this game wont have that they do have shotguns what are u talking about great video and review would have been just as good without the swearing its famas not famos id rather play roblox phantom forces tbh oh god the man bun strikes again 1111 just wanted to say i actually got around to playing this game because of your review and it was definitely worth my time thanks again more of a cod ghost feel 812 you made my google assistant on my phone activate is it a mobile game i use ctrl to crouch as default should i change it whenever they add controller support it will be worth my time to be honest its a free to play shooter its not bad but its not amazing nice game and review this game is extremely good i would defiantly have paid a reasonable price for this if it didnt have micro transactions i was adult going to preorder bo4 but then i came across this game and im not going to anymore i had to grind for this mane if im not mistaken shroud tried it and the game has forced acceleration disgusting for an fps game to have it always on i thought ironsight was a mobile game there are shotguns but theyre in the secondary category this game looks amazing just the things i loved in cod seem to be in here buuuuuuuut its pc so im not playing cos playing on pc sucks lol can you do a gaming review over poketownpetown for androidios great review very funny stuff the last cod i kept playing over a year maybe longer was bo1 fuck bo2 and bo3 never played bo3 i gave up with this game because the company wont allow me to use my call sign craptasticman because it contains a forbidden word fuck these assholes okay this was a great review honestly it mentions everything that should be mentioned and has a touch of humour to it i love it shotguns are avalible theyre located as secondary weapons im using vector is fucking amazing 605 there is a shotgun the spas12 its equpable for sniper class as secondary downloads that crawlerdronesuicideclip at the end reminds a lot of my first usage of it xd lol starts off with we are all gonna die thanks for reassuring that well its free its probably just because most cod douches have that haircut these days lol this was a really great and informative video while being entertaining too great work well that video wasnt worth my time unrelated image it looks like cod more than cod does this game gives me the old cod black opsbo2 feel and its really refreshing and fun imo thanks man you got me playing this game 98 of us will die in our lifetime dope they should make a zombies does it still have the mouse acceleration this cod when it used to be good the only difference between cod and ironsights is that ironsights in actually good who the hell plays black ops 2 when mw2 is still poppin theres some shotguns as secondarys but not sure how they function that tutorial is so cheesy i love it this is waaaay more like cod4mw2 rather than black ops 2 in my opinion thats a sick terminal map d noooooooooo its a call of duty mixed with warface hey anthony ther is a game i like to play and that game is blacklight retrobution could you try it thanks at 1225 i thought he was gonna say its right up my ass now ironsight is an gud game i dont mind the grinding to buy weapons and you have to pay to repair your weapon what used to piss me off after having the game an while the next patch i couldnt play the game at all i start the game go in a lobby game is about to start then sticks on 1 second with music still playing thanks for reminding me of my mortality nothing better than being reminded that one day i unavoidably and inevitably die when im just trying to chill and watch some youtube and i just realized saying unavoidably and inevitably was redundant bruh the are pressing ctrl on purpose they are drop shotting you a staple of cod players ever since cod 2 bruh wow that opening was too real shotguns are secondaries btw is watching your videos worth my time i liked your style so much i clicked the subscribe button twice we need south east asia server for this game or else its a bad game for asian players one hell of an intro doesnt the game have mouse acceleration they have the battlefield version of the kill cam aka it highlights the guy that killed you and what he does a few seconds later i just started playing this but its really important to mention just how fair this games repair system is most ftp shooters are ruined by this whole repair thing but this game is so fair you spend no more than 14 of what you earn purely from finishing a match this does not include challenges and dailies and more love that quick flash of sora when you said simple and clean please hey anthonycsn can you do line sight is worth of my time i cant find raw input setting its not worth my time i dont know but after this review ironsight is worth alot of my time free cod why not this is the first video of yours ive ever watched and it was fucking awesome liked subscribed etc it warmed my heart to see ironsight getting good press the game deserves it im gonna go see your other videos now great work here man d very interactive have you seen the reload animation yes its worth your time i hate when you snap back to your face its so goddamn ugly 607 shotguns are in secondary weapons whos the one before quiet for scientific reasons there are shotguns but theyre secondarys i started downloading the game in the beggining of this vid and by the 7th min i was playing itjust shut it and make a 5 min vid lool free to play cod but the duck is whats going to get me hooked the best its shit dont play it the idiots cant even send you a veriffication email right fuck this game ive been playing this game for 2 weeks only fridays and weekends tho and i have to say i am really enjoying it long time not touching any cod after selling my ps3 thing i still regret doing i think i am enjoying it so much because i missed cod and gojng to continue playing it for sure anthony this review is failure not because of anything in it but because you didnt talk about how they call a perk this one allows you to hear enemy footsteps better long ears from where do u download this needs some skill match making not sure if its because im new but too many low skilled players in my lobbys you mean its call of duty when it was good its not call of duty its call of parkour now holy fuck a f2p fps game thats not pay to win and is like bo2 im in heaven i fucking loved bo2 downloading the game as i type this this game is like mixing warface bo2 bo3 and mwr looks better than bo4 there are currently 2 shotguns but they are in the secondary spot a spas 12 and the pancor jackhammer dude your a professional and my new favourite fucking youtuber damn you should have done a joke typing in your named showed taken xd the ctrl action was by the player gone panic it call dropshot in r6s because 1 ubisuck server is terrible and that lead to sometime when you shoot someone and they gone prone dispite you saw blood spit out of them like a river but nope they still alive because in their pov they already gone prone so your shot is fire into nothing 2 the dropshot can trick some player when their aim is not really good at close range due to their slow aim time filmed on my birthday simple and clean sora killed me that background music is on fire does anyone know where i can find it shotguns are secondarys pls cover some mmorpg games3 i laughed my ass of at 520 with the flying sora as u said simple clean xddd quacityhq copycatboo go die in a ditch or smh copycat there are shotguns they are just in the pistol category nigga that aint an accidental crouch attempt that was an og mw2 drop shot goodnight is call of duty well not but its call of duty tactical cleavage that pun is perfect did he really just say its cod after he saw pick a class screen on a fps and a countdown on the game is he joking looks like mix of r6 and cod i think anthonycsn is worth my time we are all going to die some day hit em hard at the beginning what are you talking about this game is nothing like the simpsons hit run free to play games better grow mor bc my broke ass cant be dashin 60 for a unfinished piece of garbage man this game is amazing i love every damn second of it tried this game out recently and i am hooked lol its not my main game to play but its i still play it in short bursts daily although because of my location my ping averages between 110140 so a lot of deaths are caused by it but for some reason i still have fun its a little rough around the edges but damn for a f2p still in beta im hopeful lol go the blacklight retribution route and let people buy a pass amd let you unlock everything with in game currency can this game run on any pc im getting a normal one for my birthday and i need to know if i will be able to play it there are actually a lot of shotguns i think he might have just missed them because they are in the secondary slot i have a green lizard lookin spaz which is decent kinda funny he missed it though maybe you have to unlock them idk shotguns are in secondary weapons so on the fact of no primary shotguns you can buy a jackhammer as a secondary shotgun is a secondary its definitely better than csgo just watched the video thank you also this game runs amazingly smooth i use a craptop and on low settings i got an almost constant 4060 fps ha that was a fun presentation it really does look like some classic cod heard it forces mouse accel you can change loadout in game with f1 f2 f3 repair system isnt pay to do tho you just play to repair ill download it tomorrow looks good ironsight was very great game for me but it gets boring after like 50 hours because the game doesnt have much content to it id like to have better lvl system and prestiges i ve been dreaming of a game like bo2 for years umm tried joining your clan but when i search it nothing comes up wow better than billion dollars companies who have 1000s of people working on their game imma hop into this one no jetpack shit d ingame name adamssohn dl the game today played 135 hours in total best 42 kills in tdm best kd 467 aveg kd 183 plays and feels like cod mw23 game plays smooth af and feels good aswell graphic wise really good i get 60 fps on max settings those only problems can also be released in updates it literally cod yeah 100 agree it is exactly how i described it to my friend i hope it stays free to play after it releases its full of hackers now unplayable literally is this a console game or is it just pc because i dont care about pc games i play only ps4 subbed for the amazing kingdom hearts reference lol please dont become warface p2w please dont become warface p2w please dont become warface p2w please dont become warface p2w please dont become warface p2w is there elements of pve coop or just pvp it looks interesting as hell 859 yeah thats called dropshotting and i think they do that on purpose lol i dunno if they fixed it yet but the mouse acceleration makes this game unplayable for me panicking and pressing ctrl out of instinct i think theyre just sweaty dropshots lol i also agree with you id really love to have kill cams and give us the one slooty character model just give the poeple what they want lol this game needs to come to console great video definitely have been thinking about trying this game love your editing and voice definitely a sub for me this is just like rainbow six siege i usually these corny f2p shooter but oh my this looks right up my alley no shotguns eh so a mk3a2 and a spass12 is what now but game looks good but sadly with a daily peak of around 300 players its dead sees a duck in iron sight i must have it i have been playing this game a while and about the repair system it does not cost money you can use the points you earn from just playing the game you can earn everything in the game for free but buying is optional unrelated image i sub you are worth my time the damage in this game feels so offweird to me just wasnt a thing for me but to me it feels very similar to cod tbh ironsight is what call of duty should have been years ago release a game make it f2p b2p whatever they want and just keep updating it with new maps weapons skins killstreaks etc just like csgo and some other shooters cod ghost 2 basically shotguns are in game they are in secondary weapons section dsr1 is cancer hit detection delays latency issues sometimes you die and the person dies after your already dead did i mention that snipers need to be nerfed thanks for the review are you willing to check out a game called black squad cant get to the website why am i not getting notifications from you i want this to be on ps4 and xbox one you had me at rubber duck its game over man old cods on pc have no players so this is litterly the best way to experince a cod with players is there any search and destroy shotguns are primary weapons its called a sniper though shotguns exist and kill cams exist too no search result for csnc in clans there is shotgun its secondary you whats 100 free xonotic there are shotguns but they are used as secondary gun is this on console lack of kill cam is actually a feature imo fuck that shit is annoying 343 thats literally the advanced warefare medal sound effect definitely gonna start downloading it now you made me convince downloading this while i play ffxv just a better cod thats free you can repair with in game currency this video is one of the reason the gaming community gone so toxic do the shadowgun legends awesome review you got a new subscriber i may have to get this ive been wanting cod but this is better not enough research on the guns department since there are shotguns as secondaries is this 15 minute video that should be 5 minutes worth my fucking time no stop right there im in it maybe free to play but not free to enjoy i love this game but its a tiny bit to clunky with its movement like its not all fluid tactical cleavage someone meme that those haircuts look completely normal to me good review though id play this over bo3 iw and ww2 is there an auto aim in the game ctrl is my standard prone you can switch load outs now no as val no vss means game suck how did u make ure own character how did u make ure own character at 1120 you mention cultural appropriation what the hell is that 830 titanfalldid that warfaces repair system is pretty abyssmal hopefully this game does it better what i would do to go back to the original black ops doubt anyone still plays it i got killed by my crawler so often too lol i wish people would add what other game footage they used i dunno what that overwatch game mentioned is shotguns are secondary weapons like mw2 iron sight gits first assault this is the first video of yours ive ever watched and i subbed omg x is an overwatch rip off haha shut the fuck up overwatch is a tf2 rip off that needs to be purchased with boobs and butts exceptional job first game review ive seen on your channel very well done great excitement and detail please always compare to other games i believe that gives the best feel for the game without actually playing it well done is the game on steam is ironsight in steam because i searched the game up and it didnt show up idk for hitting someone 57 times and still getting killed getting hit markers wth snipers while always being 1 tapped by others and the ttk just ruins the gamei know its not my internet or my computers ability to run the gameit just seems like ppl r always prefiring around a corner b4 even taking it to insta kill me b4 their in the room ironsight is awesome d was keeping an eye on it for some time and recently been playing it for a few days how does one rip off a game thats a rip off of another game from a company thats never created anything original scratches head an alternative to codol yay dude this is nothing like far cry 5 i got clickbaited so hard i hopped into this game after hearing its like a cod bo2 pc remaster checked the guns and found the mp7 i bought the mp7 please do is escape from tarkov worth of my time video as soon as i finished this video i installed the game and now me and my friends play it almost daily that was the worst fucking intro ive seen in my hole life i want this game to take my money but it wont fucking start or even let me play for some reason would go back to bop2 but its still 60 bucks lul fuck activision which is better black squad or ironsight you can buy timed guns right under the permanant option when you click buy you just ignored it in the video guys in order to use shotguns you will have to get them in your secondary btw thanks for this review especially including the part about it being playable for lowerend pcs i dont have a dedicated gaming rig so my gpu isnt that great and ive been looking for something to give me a break from warface the warface review gained you a like the metro conflict the origin rip review gained you a subscriber this review has gained you a fan do honkai impect 3rd plz thats not a scope pretty sure killcam is a trademark of call of duty you say guns arent timed but the smg and sniper they give you to try out at the start are actually timed sure by the time a week has passed and they go off trial youll have enough credits to just buy them if you want but its an example of a timed weapon also shotguns are in the game in the secondary weapon slot just as cod intended 746 were gonna be doin one thing and one thing only killin nazis thats a cool addition to the sniper showing where on the body they were hit i cant find this game on steam looks like just more instadie garbage like cod its a cod clone in every sense of the word and therefore is not worth my time wait for a lawsuit from activision as this game gets more popular loot boxesloot boxes nope sorry lol have you done dirty bomb yet can you invest in the middle east ahahahahah shit game as well its about 3 years old and no new updates in 3 months just another korean game milking na what cod should be do the day online next 840 this is a mish mash between the valkyrie rocket and the quad missel launcher from cod bo 3 and the javelin correct me if im wrong really not sure about this game at times its fun but i feel the ttk is too high geeez your vids are great subbed man well cod on pc aint getting any cheaper ive been legit playing this game for a couple days now i love it definitely worth playing not to hate i really wanted to watch this but only my left hear heard and it was a huge turn off excellent review tbh nice well thoughtout points that are clearly made in a sea of overthetop yt reviewers i appreciate a video i can actually stomach to sit through looks like call of roblox i always hated cod but this game kicks ass i just got a shock you look like my freind rip awesome lol i just seen levelcaps video because ive been subbed to him since bf3 then seen your video your video and its convinced me haha i mean its free i might as well i need this game the timed section is there because you can temporarily purchase a gun at a reduced fee to try it out and see how it works its about 110th of the price for a 1 day purchase is it on console is there multiplayer another this im pretty sure it has is super good client side hit registration i live in australia and all the servers are in america so i get some lag but dispite that i feel like my shots always hit really well the one down side to this is the occasional death behind a wall but getting consistent hits more than makes up for that it really seems like the devs know what theyre doing and attualy play games themselves which a lot of other games suffer from can i play this game on ios wow a game that actually recognizes shotguns r cancerous and shouldnt be in a fast paced first person shooter they completely ruin the game and promote camping i will definitely be checking this game out i actually like ironsight better than black ops 2 black ops 2 is full of veteran players and is a bad place for a noob to be but not just that bo2 is now full of hackers too bad aeriagames is behind the scene so its going to be pay to win well i do go on rampages with the vector but i have to admit that it sucks without accessories this game needs to be released on steam it will be so huge it will destroy activision cod sales is it ever coming out on ps4 this seems like a game i can get into until they fix the animation delay and lag compensation issues its unplayable but i dont even think they gonna fix it the game was already out for years in korea and its dead over there was this video worth my time i hope this game rises like fortnite would be good to have some competition for cod i dont have a top machine1060gt 8gb ram phenom 2 x6 1055t and even in low config my fps sucks is on mac or only windows i dont think an ak12 is an smg 950 couldnt of said it better i level like 21ish been playing for like a week hard core havent touched it since farcry 5 came out but yeah totally agree man kill cams need to be in there especially considering its free to playnormally means more hackers so it would be easier to 1 catch those pussy bitches 2 like you said see wtf happened 3 less campingnot a big issue tho and omg cant tell you how many times ive accidentally clicked the wrong loadout no idea why these both arent implemented good vid man bad gameplay id wreck your ass 1v1 me bro haha jokeskinda omfg for a ftp who hasnt bought 17 micro transactions cosmetics or even a laser cannon hes probably just hacking thats how he got such a long kill streak youre just a dirty hacker with no skill so go buy 17 micro transactions ughhh jk though cool game play its actually good it really doesnt seem like the average free game you forgot how much cancer snipers are in this game its black ops 2 all over again you make awesome videos man youre hilarious sub i thought you were meaning ironsights like a gun optic the way score appears is like ghost shotguns are secondaries weirdly is prone not always control i use alt to crouch and ctrl for toggle prone it makes it easy to quickly drop down into cover the vector is actually really good it just sucks if you ads because its really good for hipfire just stumbled upon your channel and i must say your content is great new sub hear thanks for the review man i have enjoyed playing ironsight even with the lag i get here in oz hehe keep up the great work there are shotguns but its in the secondary weapon section video starts at 1500 v edit idk if you noticed this game is more like warface than cod but maybe thats just me dude youre too fucking funny love your sense of humor and worth my time approach never seen your videos before but nice job well just cod but free still the same shit as always awesome review man really love your style of reviewing games its fresh and enjoyable d no shotguns okay now im interested xd corll ov doody search and destroy looks too simmilar to halo hugh if this game comes to ps4 and xbox one cod is done for this is your first vid that i saw definitely deserve a sub thanks for including that spider grenade i almost died too yea same shitm that timed shit to use weapons and shitm you could never get no good items cuz everything was timed or u had to pay for the goods permanently this is a blacklight retribution copy same makers just added call of duty features hey i have question and i want people to reply warface or ironsights hey i have question and i want people to reply warface or ironsights the intro gave me fear of death i came for the title but stayed for the music and im damn glad that i stayed quality video mate 3 its not on steamhow can i download it i am downloading this now if anybody wants to play just let me know im new to pc and have a few other games csgopubgworld of warshipsfortnitewarface its cod but its not crap simply by having permanent weapons is a step above most f2p shooters iron sight is call of duty done right is this a mobile game any chance this game will come to console is this only on ps4 anthonycsn your narration is cool funny one of the most obnoxious editing and humor ive seen in a while i loved that simple and clean kingdom hearts reference hehe ironsight definitely checks all the missing boxes on black ops 3 this game is totally worth my time also its fucking free edit speaking of the game being free this will totally increase my play hours on this game more than black ops 3 or black ops 2 or any of the call of duty games aa a console player i say leave it on pc please otherwise well ruin it im confident is like ghost x advanced warfare and a hint of infintwarfar being a former cod pro i became very bored and retired after bo2 its not that i wasnt a top player since bo1 but for real i love this game and just feels so nice all they need to do is go to console good review but you got a few things wrong such as resource takeover is not capture the point its robots that spawn at the point which drops points for your team also shotguns are in the game but they are secondaries instathumbs up for the kh reference lol you said fuck right off perfectly 625 a karambit what what the fuck heres the link to the competitive ironsight discord where you can find a group to play with httpsdiscordggf92pujv it does have shotgun look at the secondary weapons you can change your loadout even in the waiting screens by pressing f1 f2 or f3 there are shotguns but they are secondary weapons why is the back of my head comparing this to phantom forces u kind of forgot how horrible it is to buy shit with real money shotguns are secondary weapons btw i hope this game comes to xbox no ironsight is garbage is anthonycsn worth my time nope ive never played cod so im going to use this to test the waters nice video i downloaded it as fast as i could d what is that funky tune you use as background music can you tell me the track id do you play this game in a phone or a pc you just gained a subscriber um gostei aqui do brasil pra vc bom video amei esse jogo pena que jogamos aqui no br com 200ms contra vcs com 10ms ainda assim comem umas balinhas nossas shuauhsuahuhs p i liked it here in brazil for you good video i loved this game that we play here in the br with 200ms against you with 10ms still eat some of our balls shuauhsuahuhs p nice work anthony if this game comes onto console ill never play cod again cod needs competition please put this on console 225 start of the game hey anthony play forward assault a online multiplayer on mobile and its a csgo riffof and theres a vector gun editthe vector in this game doesnt sucks vin diesel plays game with hat on and a little bit of extra fat oh look its not diesel its just you anthony i cant find your clan in ironsight awful haircuts my haircut nooo the thing that makes this game more enjoyable than cod is how satisfying killing is yay it didnt force me to play the tutoriallets play it this is like what i would imagine would be black ops 4 or mw4 this looks lit is it on ps4 i dont know if youll read this or not but can you check a mobile game called eternium its clearly worth my time imo and doesnt get enough attention that it deserves at the moment and can you check shadow fight 3 for the exact opposite lol basically its like mc versus but perhaps worse ok everybody could tell that guy wasnt trying to act you know the gamestop guy if anyone is looking for a free cod try out iw4x its mw 2 and bo 1 private servers probably one of the best cod modding community i play there constantly and there are active servers with people constantly can you do is paladins worth my time is black squad worth my time ok so one there are shotguns they are in secondary you can change your load out at the start of a game by pressing escape then choose class and yea the vector sucks as a bo2 fan fuck im gonna love this shit umm anthonycsn there is shotguns its just secondaries just go to the damn review already uhh ctrl is great for proning cause it allows for drop shooting inb4 butthurt scarh with ironsights whoever says rules of shit is not like pubg they need to stfu awesome work i would be extremely interested in an indepth analysis of shadowgun legends whats the intro song called cheers shadowgun legends a new f2p mobile game is being talked about alot check it out dude can you review war thunder why fidget spinner as logo tho check out standoff 2 the closest to call a cs go on mobile is this on mobile this games netcode is crap the sever thing didnt happen for me iron sights is cod online please do one on killer instunct overwatch is a tf2 ripoff can you play war robots please i died laughing from when he saw the duck hahahha i died laughing from when he saw the duck hahahha do you have any info on australianocianic servers thank god i didnt want to get cod because my favorite was bo2 but that game is dead and just full of hackers i play this game it is cod you should get this game i tried this game because i had no money so tried it did not disappoint you are right the game is exaclty as shit as bo2 noob friendly shit connection and other bs are included black ops 2 was trash except for the 1980s missions for masons dad and zombies are you ever going to do more culture shock with aspro wait i recognize the background neebs gaming maybe hmmmmm review dirty bomb its f2p on steam i love the old motherboard they have behind the broken screens good meme downloaded this and after three hours playing nonstop i can say i hated every second of it the frame drops were horrid and the gunplay was lackluster geuss thats why i never had any fun with the cod games other than the survival mode in mw3 you should do shadowgun legends shadowgun legends released when is the warface pve video coming nice video but im just saying the prone in panic is not really prone in panic they are probably used to drop shotting please pubg mobile its ftp on mobile i had a great time with the game until the servers went down d but yes i will be playing this a lot i thought this was going to be about actual shooting with iron sights and not some i got one too fps that has been overdone 1104 tactical cleavage lol pay attention this game server feels just like cod you have full green bar you can doing very good in it if you are yellow or even red bar sorry this game is not in a good state for you unless the developer put up more servers 039 thats not pubg thats rules of survival pubg is mobile its the official one lol if this were to come to console this would absolutely explode hey i am getting a error code 10011 when i start the game could u help me to fix it pls i have uninstalled my antivirus updated windowsreinstalled the game redownload the gamedownloaded microsoft visual c redistributableif u guys got any other way to help pls respond fast cause i wanna play this i hope they release this on console i feel like it will do so well there since its very similar to cod and its free i just want anyone thats watching this to know that ironsights is a awesome game the game play is flawless i cant wait to get home and destroy some people after playing this game i believed loot boxes should be cosmetic only but this game adds lootboxes so darn fricking well its easy to earn money to buy new guns and even most cosmetics are unlock able through in game earned currency the only thing loot boxes do in this game is add to the pace of acquiring items you never feel reliant on them as you likely already have the money to buy what you want or are very close to it instead the loot boxes are something i actually looked forward to for an example i really wanted the revolver in this game its pretty cheap so i played a few games to get the money but i managed to get it anyway through a loot box i got from leveling up so i had the cash to buy a crossbow which sucks ass dont buy it take a look to dirty bomb its awesome f2p this is better unlike the fuckin counter strike where people actually knows where u at with that xray shit and fast to kill no hp system much whats the background music do warframe please ui found u through lvlcaps video u should try dirty bomb well done with the vid im the newest subscriber looking forward to more vids ive stopped playing video games when i heard your intro this dudes such a jew i love it warface its almost cod but uses dedicated servers and better netcode minus the cod kids so its fun a couple of months i guess i think the people who drop down mid gun fight dont do that because the panic but because they try to drop shot you like in call of duty but it doesnt work that well because you cant keep in scope while dropping in a reverse breaking the 4th wall i had just farted when anthony took that deep breath before his next battle it was funny to me watched a few vids saw this one clicked it ended up clicking the subscribebutton aswell completely offtopic but have you gotten one of the duck marks on warface remembered that achievement when you mentioned the duck pin at 1136 there is shotguns warface call of duty ironsight to be fair i never liked those f2p games including most games of aeria but ironsight just feels diffrent its highly fluid and balanced i cant find the clan i really want to play this on console 1102 ummm what you sure you played the game p httpsimgurcoma61xvd games name is ironsight literally everything has holos also is the clan not there anymore i cant find it thats funny left ctrl in pc cod was always instant prone by default in older games if i remember correctly check out paladins not pay2win constant updates listens to the community and you can look into the ob64 controversy and how the reddit community at the time took on hirez studios spoiler its a heartwarming and hilarious tale of rebellion shotguns are in secondary omg the video actually starts after 2 minswas it worth of my time no shotguns check secondaries that last part was funny by the way has there been any updates recently that last part was funny by the way has there been any updates recently that last part was funny by the way has there been any updates recently shotguns are available as a secondary and only work in extreme close quarters yes you cant switch the loadout after you spawn but you can still quickly switch loadouts between spawns quick question is warthunder worth my time why not just play call of duty ghosts make a video about fortcraft on mobile its cod modern black ops but with subtle lighting and textures comparable like csgo i love it you should do a kingdom come review i agree with most of the things hes said but god damn the comedy is cringe fk i played it a year ago and it changed a lot now downloading again 3 p can i find other players too its like warface but better should be on steam tbh hey anthony new viewer here and i love these reviews i really think that you should do a review on warframe you do need to put in about 20 to 30 hours to fully review it but it is really good really good game yo dude you should do one of these for paladins they dropped the p2w stuff and now the game is great state id like to thank you a lot anthony ironsight absolutely fits the bill for what ive been looking for lately a cheapfree fastpaced codlike shooter i recently played the free multiplayer weekend for cod ww2 and i feel like i get much more enjoyment out of ironsight than i did from the real deal ww2 just felt a bit slower in my opinion very campy ironsight on the other hand is more the runandgun ive been wanting i know you brought up the lack of killcams in this game and while i agree that it would be a nice feature it would end up extending the insanelyfast respawn times it has you die you almost immediately respawn its amazing im happy to relive the glory days of modern warfare and modern warfare 2 in the form of a newer game thats less clunky faster tightersnappierwhatever adjective and actually has a decentlysized playerbase very informative video and once again thank you for this series it absolutely helped me to find some great gems to play ttk is too high which leads to it being almost impossible to fight 2 people at once and come out on top in a good repair system if you waste more money than you get repairing than you make using the gun before needing to repair youre doing it very wrong notice i said in a good repair system love metro conflict the origin rules is pubg no aus servers finna neck haha this may actually get me back on the pc d i just want more loadout slots and custom class edit im game hackers arent so prevalent but when they are present its sucks do paladins cause its no longer shit and its going to have a battle royale mode soon this is literally a free copy of call of duty black ops 2 the reason shotguns are not in this game is probably because shotguns are illegal to use in real war is the clan full i keep searching but cant find it love the video review and the humour you got a new sub i just couldnt play the game bcs of the aim punch everything else is fine since the aim punch is crazy its just easier to hip fire and nobody has to use ads at all even at medium range fam check the secondary for shotguns dont be in idiot check the game first where ican find this game any link or any thing i may actually play this its sad that this looks like a better cod than the last 4 cod games you should review contract wars or dirty bomb if you havent already you should review contract wars or dirty bomb if you havent already can you review black squad too game wasnt on steam where tf do i get it well for pc barely anybody play old or new cod games that is why i didnt buy a single one in like 4 years the begimning reminded me of stephen hawking vote for next game dirty bomb and then black squad do h1z1 its free now ur cool there are shotguns in the secondary tab but is this video worth my time this shits over bo3s multiplayer lol call of duty but free you say how do i get this levelcap killed their servers like murdered them i agree to you but like every 5th game i found my self in a situation where my enemy and i die at the same time i hate it pubg mobile is out in canad the music gimme a link pls that funk is sooo smooth hmmmm can you find a counter strike free game and to review it i really hope for southeast asia servers losing gunfights because half my shots dont register is tearing my enjoyment of this amazing game great video man d nah kill cam is extremely hard to code you basically need to capture the game a few seconds ago rewind it and then replay it sounds easy but its not takes a bunch of talent to get it to work properly ive been playing this the last couple days i really like it there are a few things id change like give weapons a bit less damage drop off even the rifles are hit marker machines at medium ranges review guns of boom bro english beta got released in pubg mobile do a is it worth my time you have the same name as me you made fun of cultural appropriation and you went hard in the paint for the rubber duck subbed how often did you end up repairing your guns if at all are you still playing this game even after the review or do you just never touch it again good one cool series you have here really interesting i would like to hear your opinion on a game called dirty bomb something of a mix between overwatch cod and cs 1144 so we just gon ignore how long it took for him to kill that guy with that pistol lmfao way to start off the video with such a depressing message if this could stop people from buying the new cod im all for it got this game today thanks to you really nice shit tho thank you anthony uhhhhhh you can buy weapons for 1day ur just blind m8 have you played planetside2 i cant keep upwith this game im downloading this game right now thank you i would pickup black ops 2 but im not dropping 60 on an xbox 360 game from 2012 do bullet force for mobile why do you have neebs gameing thimg can you invest in the middle east its the wealthiest region in the world quatar has the 2nd highest gdp per capita in the world us is 21st and dubai in the uae is one of the worlds top tourist destinations as well as having the only 7 star hotel in the world and the worlds tallest building egypt has amassive tourist industry and saudi arabia and israel are rich countries too so read a book you dumb american better than world war 2 is that a roblox gravestone 556 aaaaand you triggered most of the steam users base with just one phrase kappa what game is this looks in the description black shades yeah that seams right you had me at cod downloading now thank you i have now found a game better than that shitty mycom game is anthonycsn worth my time no of course not thumbs up activision is fucked why anthony why i have loved and trusted you so much and just introduced me to crack cochin i got shit to do man a kid a job you know life now all i see are mp5s and corridors everywhere i look love the new concept great work ps ill be looking for you clan but since i live in israel hours might be an issue and any chance you can do one on a battlefield clone i bet that other would love it do critical ops next its like a mobile knock off of csgo why the fuck do your videos only go up to 480p question about the weapon repair system if my weapon is at 50 condition does it perform worse shotguns are secondary this looks good bring it to ipad if you are from eu you should try zula europeits good mix of cs and cod its basically call of duty video starts at 220 i feel stop terrible for not realizing this is literally the same anthony from neebs so glad to find your channel man keep up the good work ironsights are the stupidest thing ever created let cod die already if we want to limit our vision while playing lets just put a box over our heads or something 606 shotguns are in the game they are listed in the secondaries like mw2 the shotguns are secondary weapons this game is indeed a decent game yet i cant enjoy this game very much because i often got a yellow ping or sometimes even worst some people told me the reason why did i encounter that problem its because im from outside naeu indonesia to be exact its a shame i must stop playing this game perhaps only for a while because of that problem if they can provide a better server ill go back and play it again he worked hard for the ducky your videos are getting a lot more views lately or maybe im just now noticing it much deserved anthony the metal reaper is a literal copy of the hard suit from black light retribution its not bad but it looks like original ideas are rare in iron sights you should look at warframe ps there is a secondary shotgun who is that character someone from kof at 1105 there is a shotgun but its in the secondary section its a spas12 hahaha i loved that intro preach really a shame ive sworn off any f2p gimme ur money loot box game looks good review black squad and dirty bomb gotta buy gloves in these sort of gamesgotta wield those weapons with some stilish stuffits the only thing that shows up on the screen aside from your gun too good job anthony damit levelcap broke the game i thought that this was about the cod attachment codover watch this i am new to this channel new sub and i totally love your videos now iron sight is my fav game because sometimes i am bored even if i have gta v overwatchdead space ddd very well explained and well produced video sir sub like and all that jazz from moi just in case anyone is wondering you can use the f keys to change your class f1 for class 1 and so on from f13 wish this game had like a one time fee that got rid of the weapon repair and some of the other free to play aspects like buying guns or just make you earn currency a lot easier man you rrrreally wanted that duck steam you will fear the duck try dirty bomb eh this is literally the most broken shooter i have ever played do not install it idk why this guy is saying its anywhere close to being decent how to know if a free to play game is good when it makes you want to spend money on it even when you 100 dont have too because of how fair its model is which scope is that on sniper rifle 514 no aussie servers tho wheres the love for us i thought you were going tell if using iron sights in games is right yeah if the servers are working that day this is literally warface try dirty bombohh and thanks for reminding us that we are going to die please bring thisa similar game to xbox one you can tske fortnite back yeah you can fck right off with that one aeria games is literally my favorite f2p game company this game is so much like black ops 2 a game which i already own that i didnt think id play it much but the thing is that black ops 2 on pc only seems to have people playing tdm so if i want to play something objective based i can just hop into this game ive actually found myself putting some time into this game and enjoying it despite the fact that i still prefer black ops 2 says no shotguns but at 624 theres a spas 12 right there lol is your video worth my time he has no idea of videos so he made this its so retarded im only scared cuz aeria games has it we all saw what they did to ava im fine with this game been having alot of fun it feels more like the old cods it feels more cod than cod shotguns are secondarys sweet gonna try it out tonight looks like a better warface your soundbytes and clips are hilarious i thought this video was going to be about a video about ironsights in video games when you use a gun vs red dots and holos and stuff shotguns are secondaries in this game btw why would play a new game and not want a tutorial what a stupid way to play games could you do a review on planetside 2 606 yes youre wrong there are shotguns look in secondary its literally right there at 624 two shotguns cod except its freehas a better company behind itand is honestly really great if a game is like such and such doesnt automatically makes it bad deadpool is a ripoff of deadstroke and you can see how that turn out ripoff doesnt equal bad if the ripoff is better then the original game is a service to the community you can see how fortnite took on pubg and became a far better game bro ur hella good at this game subbed and liked yay i checked the game out and it is choc full of hackers as well as people glitching through the maps allllllso if you dont live in north america or europe then youll never get under 200 ping which means youll lose 80 of fights even if theyre not hacking just stumbled upon your channel pretty interesting even though you got a lot of subs 853 thats fucking filthy but these videos are great fun to watch thanks a bunch there are shotguns they are secondaries this guy needs way more subscribers this is call of duty done right lmao anthony you should do a video on blacklight retribution its really good imo the famas sounds like the first assault rifle you unlock from aw ant the begging btw to change loadouts at the beginning of the round press escape f2p but p2w pay 2 win please come to xbox 1 sub hey if someone wants to type sooooo original its to late its only worth my time if its on console control for crouch z for prone anyone ah aeria games played wolfteam and s4 league with my friends a couple of years agobrings back memories toggle ads and hold crouch anyone else anthony pls play tf2 theres ducks lots of em theres shotguns in the secondary slots lol you keep saying black ops 2 its actually more like mwmw2 please do hired ops and contract wars dude ur cool reviewer continue to success fortnite really isnt like pubg lol it borrows the same genre concepts but is actually rather different in its execution whereas pubg goes for a realism approach fortnite is pure arcade ridiculousness your face appears too much in this video i just found this channel and its such a gem im always looking for new f2p games to play i hope he does more genres other than fps does it have 219 support shotguns are secondaries xd is hyper universe worth my time when looks like titanfall than cod without the mechanics i cant stop staring at the hole in his wall good ass video sub wow this looks good i downloaded it after watching your video and its pretty fun thx how could this happen to me was fun only worked once and never ran again well as black ops 1 and 2 are my favorite call of duty games this is right up my alley the shotguns are secondarys and are pretty weak shotguns are secondaries you unlock certain timed weapons that are timed by just playing it says you have 49k subs but you have 51k subs we hit 50k subs this thursday xd i watched a video about it installed it then saw that its like warface but worse keep playing some games gave up and uninstalled it maybe i misunderstood but you can press f1f3 to change loadouts but you have to wait till you respawn fun game weapons are very unbalanced you should try trove its free to play and its kinda fun for awhile lmao speeding up game intro was hilarious yeah these developers doesnt seem to now what recoil os either such a shame panicking by pressing the control key no thats called dropshotting they know what theyre doing thank you for your videos i would like to see more on warface and ironsight and maybe youll take a look at blacksquad on steam dude nice editing keep up the good work subbed hey anthony i have questions how do you decide what games youre going to rate review how long have you been making videos on youtube what inspired you to make this series are you truly a rubber duck clad in both shirt and hat the questions have been asked love your content and your style cant wait for you to reach that sweet sweet 100k subs have a kick ass day instant subscribe after the you can fuck off with that one ironsight realy is one of the most enjoyable f2p fps in a long time d i fucking love bo2 pretty sure this game would be perfect for me thanks wow they literally just copied the kos menu ui its really obvious too the game is awesome there are shotguns in the game as secondary damn that game looks good downloading it rn 216 if you want to pass the intro what platform is it good for a pc that is normal and is meant for work this game looks like what cod should be thank you for the good an entertaining review game black shades goddamnit of course its aeria games but where the shotguns holy fucking shit blops 4 alpha game if it comes on steam i wouldnt mind trying but is this worth it can you trickshot the thing that makes this better than cod when its a rip off is that it kinda set place in the future without exo jumps this couldve been cod from 2014 to 2016 mightve been like ironsight cod4free without supply drop bs actually there are shotguns but you use them as a secondary weapon no asian servers my little brother just discovered this game the other day and was talking to me about it last night im glad i found this video that explains its not based on microtransactions hes definitely the type of kid that buys them which aggravates me to no end it actually does look cool though the game im not a fan of cod series but i liked this game i just played cod for the single player campaing but it got boring after mw2 so i droped it 1103 who is she character name i know 2nd girl is quiet from metal gear solid but who is 1st girl shotguns are secondary spazz 12 is pretty cool jackhammer is trash please do war thunder and if you do get ready for the grind lol damnwhats the song in the intro fire asf gave me gtasa vibe i think the thing most lacking is maps it makes the game lack depth in its gameplay btw there are shotguns but it are secondarys if theres no shotguns maybe thats why its called iron sight so there will be no hip fire shotgun spamming says pubg shows rules of survival wow it looks awesome i hope it will be released for ps4 too it is that good but its not that popular yet its my game for sure as long as they stay away from pay to win system bo2 cod ghost iron sight look at kill points same as ghosts no jetpacks this is cod done right they do have shotguns in the game theyre just secondaries they have the spas12 and the jackhammer right now any chance this comes to console theres something unrealistic about this video a gamestop cant be loud if no one is in it something you didnt make a comparison on is hitboxes which i think is a problem with all the call of duty games note there are shotguns theyre just secondaries unless im just late and its a later game is this game on steam which one better warface or ironsight press f to pay respect ironsight actually feels really good to play id argue that it is better than the actual cod games and it is free 833 what do you mean it counts down slowly u must have no idea what call of duty is theres not titties girls not worth any time this is millionsubsquality if you dont know by now shotguns are secondaries like mw2 does it have controller support is it out now or just beta do the new fortnite on tablet and phone game really good cod freetoplay knock offthe servers need some work thoughtickrate seems to be pretty low could you please review heroes and generals its a good time dirty bomb you earned a new subscriber dude woo d i cant find the clan you should do planetside 2 its the cod multiplayer but for free and still fairly rock solid so ya might as well try it i like cod mp a bit but not enough to deal with the companies that makepublish it you should try pubg on mobile neebs on background looks a lot like rainbow six no shotgun oh boi im in i love that intro i played this game for a good 2 hours so far and the one thing that i can say is different from cod is that the health regeneration is way slower wtf im trying to install it i got to window where i can choose where it will install it i press next and nothing happens can someone help me i download ironsight and when their is the loding screen is all white and it not loding in what is the problem how the fix it ty its cod but at the same time is titanfall im the only one that noticed that plus black ops 2 is still fucking 60 on steam want to try this game wht in the world this game is only available in us and europe whyyyyyyyi really want to play this till bo4 repair costs in ironsight is nothing compared to the bullshit in warface i cant even afford my msbs because the money you earn in warface is so damn little aria please keep these repair costs forever because i can actually use your weapons without losing all my money 018 this this is why free to play fps games suck they all try to copy call of duty and those developers which has the call of duty mentality act like kids and think that quickscoping is cool which infact its not why we do give kids the option to create games like why wow im really impressed by your style of video i love it keep it up congrats on the over 50 k subs for the record i was here before and just stayed but the bounce back and forth last night was funny lol best of luck hope it comes to consoles i like your videos men the game have shotgun is in the load of handgun keep going its another line of sight game the real question is is this video worth my time free cod basically straight from epic games playbook is anthonycsn worth my time there are shotguns two of them but they are secondary weapons why dont you interview some real games like state of decay 2 why is the game tagged as black shade wtf is black shade lol its pretty damn good runs great and the movement feels great also i find you super charismatic anthony are your videos worth my time you can change ur loadout in game with f1 f2 f3 650 is when i found out theyre a bunch of liars dont get the game they dont want you to have iron sights do you need to change mouse sensitivity much or can you adapt pretty well to different defaults ive been wanting to play bo2 again but i dont really feel like paying 60 euros for a 6 year old game and then have to buy the dlc too so ironsight seems like itll satisfy my black ops 2 crave try argo hey bro please review asphalt 9 legend it is just released on iphone the only difference between bo2 and iron sights is that there arent any swastikas cough theres sexy character in iron sight cough httpsyoutubey61pi8sswc8 well only thing this is only missing is an zombies mode i mean the old once with edward rictofen and not the ww2 crap version shivers so basically call of dutys multiplayer but done right is it pay to win game black shades alright do critical ops yo i missed these kinds of games growing up i love this series welp time to download shotguns are a secondary weapon the only thing i dont like about the game is when you die you see a killed by somedude as a big red banner and it doesnt show who killed you or how adding to the wtf just happened some modes you can spam f real quick otherwise youre clueless how you died good review fun game as long as you know who doesnt get greedy on the just by looking at it it already looks better than warface this game is really really nice no joke but i suck ass so i uninstalledi really mean it i sucked hard really bad i died 93of the time but i will jump back in when i finish the game i made space for game black shades 2002 its pretty good tbh this exactly what ive been looking for honestly call of duty but not call of duty its great it makes me rage as much as in cod and it also makes it fun western codol release also the animations and everything are identical to cod wheres the link though shotguns in the secondary slot dem really hate that spider c4 thingto useless is watching your youtube channel worth my time consoles need a free to play cod like if i was just watching the gameplay without any name i would think its totally cod man i wish i had that good connection fking game has 100ping on na and 150 on eu feels bad when ten minutes in you can say holy shit this is codyouve done it right im assuming the clan is full now do blacklight retribution please d both team try to capture certain point and fight ai robot fuck they take this idea from titanfall its cod 4 love this game already played it i could see this on console wow is that cod 2019 do they have shotguns yet you have some good editing play warframe try black squad hey man i have a recommendation for you a game called blacklight retribution i played a few years back but now people

glad to count you as one of our players d enjoy ironsight only 10k views with this high of a quality wtfmetrocsgohhhmmmmm looks like a copy or inspired by plus with nice graphics laso shotguns there

anyone else been experiencing terrible lag and glitches i saw this game on an add once and downloaded it but i only played it once hope this makes me want to play it more shotguns are secondariesjust

do this yesss another great video a little bummed you didnt show the slide you worked so hard to get to it that one night is this out for mobile it is more of battlefield maby you could take a look at the game robocraft a f2p cod ill get it plz be on xbox could you do one on a more tactical game maybe how do you get this game i couldnt find it on steam someone link it cause i dont know where to look for it i really want to play hey anthony i really like this series can you take a look at one of my favorite hidden gems superfighters deluxe is it worth my time you should do a worth my time planetside 2 wow i loved black ops 2 in high school cant wait to play this too bad cod isnt the same anymore is it worth my time to play a fps that says ironsights that has sights is it on steam so this is basically call of metro conflict black ops 3 600 secondary shotguns how does volcano eruptions cause a major resource crisis would you ever consider using a strawpoll or some other system to gauge what game youll do next is forward assault worth my time whats the song in the beginning i can hear you screaming though that mini montage i need that duck im going to check it out today hope theres room in the clan you whats not worth my time watching this video your production quality is really high its surprising how you only have 50k subs you bother with explaining the need for shorthand to those with overdeveloped typing fingers and underdeveloped minds but then you include one of the most accurate jokes ive heard in a long time about how people are probably going to stop watching after the cod comparison myself included and you own it i appreciate your candor anthonycsn im looking forward to your non f2p reviews someday but kudos for covering this niche genre and good on you for finding something hardly anyone else is covering ive been subbed for a few weeks and im glad i found your channel cheers can you do is having a girlfriend worth my time next i swear one of those maps looked just like terminal in mw2 is watching your videos worth my time kinda wana play this thanks praise our lord neebs daddy anthony has uploaded a new video better than cod holy shit ive looking for something like this since i couldnt get into pirate servers in cod woah this heavily uses cod ghosts assets xd i think you could make a really good video if it was a worth my time on warframe keep up the good work calling ironsight cod is an insult to ironsight joking aside thanks for putting a time stamp on the reference since this game actually looks better than cod wwii didnt you already do this video woah a call of duty that im actually interested in playing thanks for video anthony go tjek heroes and generals wanna se your perspective on that game how to ez win get famas mount a holo on it profit try roblox phantom forces cause why not this game does not have a 301 in the ammo counter after you tactically reload just like call of duty i was playing yesterday and it looks like they fixed their issues it was probably kind of a good thing they got the unexpected influx of players it helped stress test the servers so theyll be better prepared at release this is what early access is actually for honestly i might play this game for a while its good quick fun intro ends at 123 do dirty bomb ur my level cap anthony hey anthonycsn how about a video about world of tanks v10 is coming in 21st of march and its free call of duty black ops 4 leaked review the shotguns are on secondary just like mw2 and also when u buy a gun u have the option to buy permanent or timed is phantom forces worth my time man i love your videos keep them up paladins got a rework this week i think you can use it in your series basically they dropped the lootbox card system for one more simple and free also everybody was buffed indirect now that the player can make even more customization than before great review anthony as honest as ever great stuff well at least they dont have shotguns in it but at the same time they have quick scoping one shot kill sniper rifles sigh can you do one on dirty bomb looks good too bad it has lootboxes nope lvl85 and i have all weapons 0 money wasted i love it next time do a vid about black squad i plan to build a pc soon this is the first game im gonna download can you tell us what platforms they are available on awesome piece of work again anthony i have seen levelcaps review when it came out but yours its much more fun to watch not my type of game never the less keep em coming thumbs up duck powerrrr something you should note is thats it kinda like a boots on the ground titan fall plus cod it has some titanfall items and even a game mode with robot ai just like titanfall this is awesome im getting my pc soon and ill have something to look forward to is this on steam or elsewhere oh yeah and the timed section is for skins also you can buy a gun for 1 day for like 4200 credits no shotguns because shotguns are secondaries and not primaries also can you review americans army proving grounds its a free to play game for the ps4 i knew that he would make a review for this game i just did not know when would you please do fortnite your videos brought me nostalgia from my hundred of hours playing combat arms and war rock seems like its my time to go back in a ftp fps i hate the titty fest that is ftp shooters these days but metro conflict looks really fun and ironsight well old school cod for free thanks where do i find the game i cant find it on steam im downloading because i saw it on instagram cod warface csgo can you get that lit shit on steam shotgun is secondary gun in this game lol legit looks better than most cods since mw3 shotguns are secondary in this game for some reason wow this guy gets clear sights on unbox video starts at 220 youre welcome anthony the maps are totally based on cod too what is the download size i think youve found your niche with these ftp games anthony but how old is this game anyway i shall join youmy name is sakif i love you anthony hey can you look at sas 4 was that a kingdoms hearts reference rewinds video yes it was he couldnt pack more advertising in there that was my last time in just a bit concerned about those timed tabs if the lootboxes start giving it temporary guns and attachments ill be very annoyed lol so rip servers much like neebs your videos are fun to watch thanks im ok with this game but i prefer cod 4 style game with less customization and better maps and less killstreaks and more gun skill the aesthetics of that game were great gave u a fake feels of being in pripyat and middle eastern country nothing like waking up to a new anthonycsn video its call of duty if you can 360 no scope lol lol their logo has a fidget spinner xd please do dirty bomb how do i pla it play d 521 look at sora fly kingdom hearts the quality of your videos are amazing and to say you have just under 50k subs its even more impressive is this on steam ive been playing this game since it released and ive always been enjoying it cod devs should take notes wait what game is like overwatch shotguns are in the secondary section the game is awesome but that duck emoticon is a pain to get honestly video starts at 000 you are welcome great video anthony cant wait for the next one woohoo your video bought 2 more clan members to us dont worry folks this video has not yet ruined the servers its fun and all but the servers have heart attacks and shut down shotguns in the secondary weapon selection just like codmw2 i literally just farted when she said take a deep breathe and boi am dead you should play critical ops its a csgo clone for mobile its surprisingly really fun and i think youd like it er maybe you will i havent played in a while and they added updates that might not be the best but i wouldnt know yes its worth your time spoiler irony at its fineist yo anthony did ya do warframe yet im waitin you should do a video on dirty bomb i heard fashin am interested try black squad well im not a fan of cod but im a fan of your content anthonycsn so im gonna stay its f2p bois ready your engines here i come please now do it on black sguad make a critical ops video awesomeloved it but im happy with fortnite xd only 2 shotguns in game spasjackhammer i think these are in the secondary weapon slot i knew it of course its going to be iron sight cool make a critical ops video you click f1 or f2 or f3 to change games one of those haircuts is literally doraleous haircut xd yes ironsight and btw anthony this game is still in openbeta so obviously theres gonna be changes and additional stuff gets added like you asked for more female characters and changing your custom weapons in midmatch there is shotguns idiot when you start playing with better players you notice how horrible the netcode is the games alright i played the game and find it so fun but it sucks that i get 900 ping because there is no asian server anymore make a video is modern combat 5 blackout worth my time it is available on the windows 10 store find the shotguns in the secondary section try 2 pls do a worth my time on world of tanks blitz try dirty bomb if you had as much fun as i did in 2012 with black ops 2 then boy do i have the game for you was a pretty spot on depiction ill be installing this game later today hope to see you in a tdm match sometime anthony cheers from the research triangle nc love your vids hey anthony i just want to say rules is also on pc and maybe you can do one on critical ops its a mobile game am i early the game has shotguns its secondary slot that take a deep breath skit really made me laugh dont know why thanks anthonycsn this is nothing like pacman how dare you mislead me damnit anthony play dirty bomb you fool im getting this game right now thank you for another wonderful game review love your face when are you doing the warface coop video when you do it please also do special operations video idea is anthonycsn worth my time is hentai worth my time also modern combat versus got some changes so check it out again it is just that cod thanks again for finding this game been playing it whenever i can almost forgot itbroke not new ground try robocraft its also f2p on steam what do you guys think want some more ironsight videos everyone needs to play it i prefer scopes and optics than ironsights i like everything about this game except sniping its really hard to quick scope in this game also i was able to play this game on my potato laptop as well so low spec gamers can enjoy it too this game is amazing just tried it this game is better than pubg yeah dude this game is really so cool wow i played this like a year ago glad its finally on the steam that will surely bring new people in i might start playing again as well this is kind of a flash back to the old cods like mw2 and bo2 i play ironsight too i play this game as soon as i get free time it really is a great game its like mw2 with the bo2 hud recently got a gaming pc then downloaded insight strait away definitely a best free2play fps the best free fps game ive ever played in my life for your information blazer got nurfed id really like if ya made ironsight videos tbh for a free to play game its pretty good i came from cod to this game if that tells ya something this game has been underated for too long and i love it it is the best free game is this free to play on steam downloading nice game they need to fix the hit detection im downloading it right now it doent take up alot of space im pretty sure you can reload cancel i just reload and sprint part way through works all the time is this sponsored video coolness need a new potato pc freebie to get hooked on other than paladins if its on cod console when it comes for ps4 i am really enjoying this game feel like free call of duty shambugamer ironsight is really really good i bought mw and got fed up with the rampant camping and low skilled gameplay ironsight rewards aim and reflexes and the guns are surprisingly very well balanced and not p2w been playing ironsight for a long time its one of the better fps and i think it deserves lots of love needs more players if it comes to ps4 then we can talk downloading it right now thanks for the heads up a 3rd person cod style shooter would be cool man i miss playing bo2 wish they would remaster 1 2 looks good but it has no controlller xinput support so i might not get it this game has an established community already the steam release was to bring in new players ill be mad if activision starts a lawsuit with this game im not interested in the game because of how unoriginal it is it is strongly influenced by call of duty and look where call of duty is now why would any game developer be influenced by call of duty nah its pay to get everything well before that that game must have a campaign improve the multiplayer a console release devs that communicate to the community im downloading it now yes 3 lane map let me download rq go for it 425 big i scary black guy id play it if it was on xbox i hope i win the ps4 my twitter is michaelata wish it had enough players to port it to consoles if it came to xbox for free id definitely play it you should do a video on warface free to play they do co op and multiplayer right they have been adding content for years and its on all platforms no dont play this game because its made by gangnam style mokeys been playing this game for a good year its a good game every fps game is better than cod nowadays its not better than call of duty i got this after seeing your top 10 free games and i am not at all disappointed finally people finding this game its really great im down to play ive played this game for awhile and it has potential to be amazing but my problem is that its very pay to winish hope for future consoles release for 2020 twittern0tlek runs well on 1050ti as well lol i have been playing this for mad long its a fun game thou a lot less doors i miss the old iron sight i play this game often its basically freetoplay black ops 2 already exists its called counterstrike anyone catch the guys gamertag bigscaryblackguy lol i would like to win a ps4 because i dont have a console i would love to play modern warfare with my little brother and give it to him as a suprise late christmas gift my twitter is kingtripping hopefully i win i mean ill try it since its free but i dont know it honestly doesnt look that good gameplay looks like cod ghosts oh i hope they put it on ps4 i would like to win ps4 cause my ps4 is broken beyond repair my twitter handler is paintertiger thanks for the videos i watch all of them at least once or twice this is what i want for christmas so i can actually play modern warfare jimmy or chous they neeed a free for all i love that and some prestige or up to level 1000000000 im a sweat no one is going to get it if no one hears about it but also no one is going to buy a knock off of cod so they most likely will just go over and pass over this game because people want the real thing and not a knockoff of the original not saying anything against this game just saying what people are most likely to do and think of this if they just so happen to see it i got a disconnect from sever error might as well try it since im a pc gamer worth a try just saying you can play bo2 on pc for free and without cheaters with plutonium mod can we have this consoles it should also drop on console and stay free to play as a fan of fps games and call of duty ill definetly give this a shot whos joe big scary black guy was destroying you k3 made a video on this last year its really good but not better than cod nah crossfire ive been playing this game for a long time im happy that its getting some recognition finally cod is over hype iron sight looks fun ironsight is littered with bugs all over the place cant be a cod killer if its not on consoles for something to dethrone call of duty they kinda have to make a game and give us things that activision doesnt allow to beat something bigger u got to find the weakness and capitalize on it of course another pc exclusive i see how it is i will love to win the ps4 because i promised my little cousin ill buy him one on his birthday and i dont think i can afford it twitter farajmuftah asia version was there before is there sbmm or is this random matches i wonder when it will come to consol this looks a lot like bullet force from mobile ive seen this many timesthe biggest drawback this game has is the netcode thingthat and the slow updates that are supposed to add content iron sight was popular a long time ago is this free on ps4 its not new but it is a fun game one flaw for me though is that your health recovery is super slow even with the perk that hastens the recovery just think battlefield health recovery speed without the medics med pack in a fast paced game like a cod clone in my opinion the cod killer is going to be cod looks like they basically made a clone of cod mobile i like the game already this game should also be on console i heard about this game hopefully it comes to xbox one and ps4 downloading now when your so early but you dont know what to type i was in the beta this is good it doesnt require a good pc to have a good gameplay experience please release on ps4 i need something to play this game is awesome perhaps the best f2p fps game i have ever played even beats many paid games too x ngl ive played so many fps games and this doesnt even come close to cod imo okay but is it for console though i played this for a good amount of time and the hit detection and lag problems are super real its not that fun after you play it a while if it comes to console it will be a huge commentator against call of duty nice i al downloading it right now tnx chaos this seems more like mw3 then bo2 this looks very simular to the fps game warface mw is the true cod killer lol its a pos may have to have a look later i hope they go cross platform one day or at least add it to ps4 lol 58 player count from steam charts sooooo yo pc games dont count cod is a console player based game what about warframe love ur videos i havent misses a single one love it man keep up the good work is this on ps4 might be 5th not sure yeah definitely your smart yo im a decent player at this btwand i love it manhbu first third be my friend plz first am i the first comment enjoy the thrill ride join the tribe and subscribe or just let us know what you think down below this game is 100 fair to playonly

browser then it says that it cant run wht to do plz someone answer game time so many good free games out there hello my friend im with you my friend you have a great channel come to russian pancakes yaaay another great review keep up the good work for my eyes to enjoy your commentary on this is hilarious triggerhappy savageshooter hello im a og player of ironsight i was playing before it came out on steam and its really nice the netcode is bad but the game is ftp so not much to complain hi little buddy full whale watch shared too hi dear nice to meet you we are now new friends and family this was truly a lovely video thanks for sharing reminder to love back what strange outfit you have chose today i love it ian this game had me at the first 10 seconds every fps is my game i love the direction your taking these and the work your putting into all this hilarious every time nice game for freeeeeeee legit free to play action fps nice youtube glitched my previous upload so here is the video in full hopefully this one doesnt bug out aswell haha not sure if u check old vid comments but this game is 90 bots now pfft ametaurs you think this is bad download striker zone how old i need to be to play i loved ironsight they could possibly release on console have servers for places such as euna etc but for the places that dont have servers just let it be host based like cod trust me i know that sounds ridiculous iron sight is now available on steam btw but it have no install button it is on steam now for asian region i can confirm this game fills that empty void mw2 once used to fill and the netcode is far better that its initial release its now on steam ma boi is it good now its on steam ill download if netcode is fixed i am trying to play ironsight but its region locked so i cant play it in the czech republic this game has a really good potential the only need to improve the ui complessive qualityes fonts and the environment which can be polished a bit more something of this games aim system also does not convince me anyway it is a great game is it ever gonna come to consoles hey check out this gameplay of this game httpsyoutubeensyy107keu woah thanks for saying we have to suffer from high ping first of all there is some people with high ping that wants low ping to play second of all it is not our fault we live in a shitty country and there are laws to say we cant move to a better country i really really want to move out of my country but thanks to law i fucking cant i live in south africa and i do have bad ping so dont say we have to suffer use a more suitable word so we dont get offended hope you understand our frustration it is not just you guys we have to suffer more than you i really missed mercenary online 2 guys i diarrhea pls help i just shitted myself here i am pulling my hair out with busted black ops 4 when theres cod 4s identical twin right here been playing for almost a week now cant get enough this is what cod needs to return to bare bones fps youre so much better than shrouud it had an update this week well its only fair for laggy people untill they get more region servers for middle east and etc comes to ps4 the abuse andor nonfiltering of high pingers has plagued good shooters for 20 years ffs can we get over this already any news on asian sever is it coming anytime soon why are things always going around here 320 you got killed by murdersuicide and its kinda a murder suicide its not downloading theres only one thing that annoys me in ironsight press to run and press to aim thats so fucking annoying im used to holding shift and holding right click but with press to aim and run i basically just hold it then press it again to deactivate it which really confuses me sometimes and slows me down a lot hey undercoverdudes i am a big fan of yours and i was sondering if you wanted to do a collab with me in ironsight it would be great atleast no pay to win frustrating not really sure why they banned certain countries i love this game sadly i had lost my profile and after wanting to create a new one i noticed my country lithuania is in the list of the banned countries which really put me off and made me be not as interested in the game anymore though i do have hope they will at one time release the game in the whole world if i were to get into this game would i be able to play with a controller by any chance just plug my xbox one controller into my pc and just play it i agree we want to know whats going on in the game if they put this game on steam they need to reward for playying the beta this is one of my fav games atm but how much will it cost on steam do you think will it be priced and what happenes to the open beta users when it goes on steam if its on steam iam gonna play it and so many people will play the game they should put it on steam its kinda strict when jumpingclimbing into the things theres only designated places to jump or parkour to with a yellow arrow indicating it i wonder if they will do a console release 150mbps will be good to join in europe but will be expensive its available now in philippines hey can u make a video telling about how to improve aim not die frequently and some tricks to play good also how to adjust sensitivity i just want to change my name how much space does it take up is it my fault 4 having bad internet i never asked to be born in a mud hut and the funny thing is i get killed behind walls to and sometimes people pop in front of me coz i have bad nat not once have i seen you not win on that game play so clearly you are good at the game people like you love that game coz you want to always dominate and you have so you move on to another new game i no speak english is it dead what gun are you using hey undercoverdudes im trying to reach you again devs just announced beta test of new netcode some stuff about incoming graphics update battle passes and so on please check out ironsights discord or reddit such an underrated game just some minor changes and it will be perfect great game better than cod black squad is more like a crossfire then csgo but its dead too so doesnt matter hahahah i love this game is it online like all of duty this is why i get killed by people when i cant even see them in the first place lol started playing today to me netcode is my only issue with the game this game reminds me of black ops 2 people with high ping should be the people who get punished hey dude i have a 300 ping in almost every game the games feel like 15 fps even if i only play robloy wich actually runs at like 25 fps because my pc sucks but it feels always worse so is this game worth the download on steam think it can be emulated using steam play finally i havent been able to on straight up wine if you get what you want then only whatever country they have their server in will have a good time everyone else not so much biggest issue i eac easy anti chat its a shit program that doesnt work like it should just buy cod smh i really hope this game makes it through and get the attention it deserves i just recently discovered it and for a free 2 play game its soooo good we should somehow create a community league and advertise it make videos about it etc etc they need to make enemy granade trowbackable they just do it a good game but needs more content still waiting for an oce server how are you still making videos about nothing but free to play games that are already dead its trash bullets take time to hit if you cant tell you havent played enough fps games or at least good fps games if they fix that its great netcode steam remove repairing if there were servers for other regions there would be less people complaining your the persone with a bad connrction ur the one who is supposed to be suffering ahhh damn that hearts too many noob tool users it lags like a bitch for those 600 mile from the server im better off playing in the american server for those who like to shout noob you suck 1v1 me you need all the tools glitches and hacks to play if they fix netcode but ive saw a better netcode after patches if they add free forall mode out of the lobby if they change resolution on title and icons new weapons and perks scavenger and cold blood should really be good since hydra uav are rly annoying or when u go out of ammo this game can be a rly good fps game and have an esports scene still waiting for asia server hope they fix the disconnected from server problem isnt this p2w just started playing this game is it worth going back to play this game bc i did like a year ago and it was fun until i started to run into critical bugs i want this game but when i look it up on steam it doesnt come up whats your sensitivity why on steam why not the epic store the epic store is much better and the devs makes more money what is the tickrate for ironsight no less than 64hz i hope i dont know why i am watching this i dont play ironsight anymore since 4 months because im tired of waiting for the netcode to be fixed 1 for laser sight on literally everything the lack of an oce server kneecapped this game from the start people underestimate how much nzau players want fucking options for games to play kinda wish it came to psn literally just fix the netcode and you good or atleast nearly good our fault we have bad ping is it our fault were born in bad regions is it our fault we arent making the best income to afford godlike internet what are your favorite free fps games we want ironsight battle royale putting it on steam and on consoles would probably help it tremendously i played it at one point in closed beta and was rather disappointed at it it reminded me of cod ghosts which isnt good ttk is so low youre likely to do trades more than streaks the streak system has never felt particularly good and i never felt that their monetization model was very fair warface felt a lot more modest by comparison but they unfortunately dont have the playerbase to make it play well i still get behindthewall deaths in warface despite their guarantee of udp the use of tcp killed this game for me i dont have much hope for this game because tcp is so ingrained into its infrastructure and it will be insanely difficult to transition without rebuilding from the ground up can you see your body when you look down i want it on console dont expect the game on steam till they fix all the netcode issues they wont to launch the game on steam getting a million of bad reviews killing the game forever this game will get battle royale im sure what about the error when installing guys dont be expecting a steam release so soon you might even be waiting until next year i expect netcode patches completely fixed about summer this year and it starting to get some real attention later on aswell its gonna take a long time and might be dead before it reaches its full potential 3 years and i still cant understand what he said at the beginning of every videos i want to play this game but i cant install the dang thing any help would be great feels rly bad i cant play it since its blocked in my region imma try it soon but when it gets launched on steam will my account be linked i will download it when its on steam or epic games launcher this game needs to be on steam do you think it will become a paid game i realy hope the game will get better netcode and cheater wise it realy deserves the to get big my opinionthe reason why they are using tcp is because they dont have asian server if they do thry is no point ofusing tcp the only thing i hate about ironsight is the lighting thats extremely similar to mobile shooters lighting style i just wish this would launch on ps3 cause i dont have a pc no more first i played cod then fortnite now this game blew my mind im gonna play this game when theyll put the riot shield i been waiting this game to get an asia server cause i dont want to play the game with big latency or they might as well release it on epic games launcher did u know ironsight closed the game for some countries including mine i put so much time and money on this now i cant even launch the game lel that 206 ms ping what the fuck is this game take a shot everytime he says iron sight you know what would make ironsight a lot better if it wasnt such a pain in the ass to download if its on steam and its available on sea im game please just give us asia oceania servers i want to play in aus this wouldve been a hit on console for sure pls remove aim acceleration from this game they should do a port to switch like warframe did that would be cool the steam release might be the greatest revival for this game i hope it works and that it will become very popular otherwise theres no hope if they fix the netcode and get the game on steam that may get to me relaunch the game a few times when im bored if they add a good noncodstyle gamemode i might actually play the game maybe something like team deathmatch but with fixed respawn points and a solid map with good choke points because right now they emulate the recent cod games with mechanics more similar to the old games kind of a weird mix if you ask me especially with the maps i didnt play the game much but the fact that i only vaguely remember two of the maps is a pretty big indicator that they kind of suck lol but id also argue that every single cod map since after bo1 has been utter forgettable trash so take that as you want p i played from south africa it was so laggy but it was really good game felt fun also need fps boost is it for ps4 will they have a sea server now ironsight on steam id rather die faster from a gun rather than from a tempest or seeker drone having all the other specialists in bo4 downloading guess what they blocked multiple regions meaning you cant play ironsight at all now unless youre not in a blocked region you said that playing with high ping is unfair and you have 250ms xd the hq report now is no different to the first one and it is all words until done this game has so much potential i stopped playing because of the bad net code and high ping i never saw below 100 ping on this game for me 17 bullets to the head from long range with ak made me quit the game even with dmr its 7 bullets to kill at 20m my problem is that it always says on the screen client is outdated i used to play this game actually forgot it existed thanks for jogging my memory with this video looks like they are only focusing on fixing the netcode while the rest of the bugs are still lingering so until they fix the netcode the game will only be going downhill and they will just be releasing more skins will they fix the game before its completely dead who knows who cares would definitely play this on my xbox looks a lot of fun used to play soldier front a lot on pc when it was owned by ijji and after that area games add asian servers im glad this game might be saved because you are the 1 person i go to to find free games and this is one of the games i was edging towards getting like you did for me like with combat arms reloaded if they actually do this it goes miles toward restoring aerias credibility if they publish it to steam maybe it will get more publicity lmao servers i live in peru and the south american server is laggy af for me guess its located in brazil have to go to na server to get below 150 ping they are not shutdown just release the dem game on the console finally they did something with people from shithole countries who just abuse their ping for their advantage here on eu server how to install yo ucd after this video was released and the director took action by explaining future updates the game has been super laggy for me even when opening it up and this never happened to me before are you experiencing it if so can you help me fix it im in na servers btw looks like ultrabudget mix of modern combat 5 versus thats both mobile games by the way it needs a new launcher because you have to reinstall the whole game on a big new update and it just frustrates me my dumbass thought the title was talking about the ironsights of a gun in a video game the blazer happened nerf that shit this game really needs some absolute revival of playerbase otherwise it will be doa before the end of 2019 this should be like an emergency priority for the dev team i will never understand when there is a technical problem and the company releases skins instead of a fix and people think art affects programmers hey can you make an updated best ironsight guns im new to the game and its sooo fun ill try it out when its on steam im waiting steam cuz its more convienent for me 1 question why they didnt add this game on console yet i have one gripe with this game in my opinion the health regeneration is way too slow great video i think i will revisit ironsight know i really do like ironsight hope this game lives on 78th comment fist wait till they fix it then we will see what kind of fruit this game has become a shit banana or a sweet onion this game is garbage i was playing close to the start and nothing has changed the ship patch had broken everything then they returned with old netcode and things got even worse its also far from comfortimg that the director didnt tell shit about anything basically to wait even longer adding fuel to fire is micropatches implementing weapon skins and maximum of 2 minor game bugfixes tldr dont touch this game until something real happens to it as for now it is a waste of time great to see that its going to improve on the first point likely because tcp is automatically encrypted while udp is sent unencrypted given a choice as a developer between automatically encrypted stuff that already works for your usecase tcp or a custombuilt encryption with many points of failure if you dont know what youre doing udp the choice is easy can they just please make a mac download why only windows how do manage to play this game with 200 ping i absolutelly love this game i know it has its flows but im quite addicted to it and i hope theyll fix all the issues as promised cause im crossing my fingers for its future thanks for the upload undercoverdudes most of the time i dont really ever see netcode being that bad occasionally its noticeable though they should fix the annoying melee bug where when you clearly get a knife kill but it doesnt register at all itonsite is a great game play zula its a csgo clone but its pretty good this game weapon balancing is trash all that is in the game just people rushing with smgs with fucking insane hit fire thanks for explaining network concepts now i can pass my next weekly class test with ease even though im happy that they are now communicating again but im not gonna believe anything until i see them i feel like its way too late for them to do this plus many players has given up on them because the reputation of aeria games is very well documented when it comes to leaving the players hanging and im not even gonna talk about asian server cause i dont see that happening anytime soon but if they prove me and many wrong and fixes things it will be a brilliant come back from them standoff 2 come on as an experienced player some people who play this game might know me as nuski2x i feel like this game needs a ffa mode and maybe a version of br to get more hype also a few tweaks to weapon accuracy and such feels like my bullets are going nowhere when im aiming right at someone sometimes edit 342 of this video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvq5gtvszkntu is a perfect example of what im talking about here but dont get me wrong for any people who havent tried this game its really great my fav cod was blops2 and this game reminds me a lot of it the gameplay is great gunplay is pretty damn good we need more players though lol cant wait to see it come back its one of the only fun military shooters hope they put asian servers he came from the land down under your youtube would be so successful on fortnite or black ops 4 your aim is godlike for those games ironsight should go the same rout as warface eventually down the line release it on ps4 would be sick i can play it on pc i just suck with mouse and keyboard lmao the worst part is dying after you kill someone and vice versa plaz revived this game i hope they add a battle royale mode why i cant download this game i want play this game again i couldnt play it since last years halloween update i update the game the game client says update patch extraction failed and i downloaded the game again and client giving that error again and again i dont how to play this game i really enjoyed this game i hope they will fix all the bugs and net code hope they just put it on steam it needs play count stats guides discussions etc i hope they do something special for the people who played before it gets released on steam really hope they can fix up the game and looking forward to the steam release can i just say that this game has some of the best reload animations i have ever seen 125 reload and i remember seeing a p90 reload was really stylish its still fun but would be fun when netcode gets fixed it would really revive it iron sight is gei lol just go and play combat arms or warframe i like how now theres an ad marker where the video originally ended i was deadass confused for for a second on why this was posted again now i understand after the netcode they should give us asian server so i dont have to play on 100 ping edit we need quick scoping 320 is an example an how bad the netcode is in this game thanks before i was only able to watch the first 3 minutes now i can watch the full thing great half modern half futuristic game more online games two words holy damn please make more cod4 remastered multiplayer gameplay im sorry i dont speack a good english i am brazilian its a decent free fps game the guns you earn are mostly permanent and the camo isnt behind a pay wall you can get camo guns in your level up creates and unlock armor for your solider this free to play shooter is better then most of the ones on the market in terms of weapons and customization i 100 recommend people try this game ironsight need to have a story or a campaign also needs to be on console better than bo4 any idea of the population size how do these guys earn money if the game is free to play ironsight reminds me of bo2 is msbs grot available in this game more multiplayer games pls a wonderful game that will never come to console maybe xbox only really f2p best balance this is the 1st time im seeing you die omggggg this game is just awesome filled with action amazing graphicssolid gameplay and best of all its free looks like cod black ops 3 without the boost jumping with some aspects of bo2 with the kill cam of battlefield all mushed together in one game hey mate i am playing the cod series better than you now wow the new black ops 4 looks sick please come to console i need a new fps im tired of fortnite gk cheak fortnite is a really cool and fun game is royal game black ops 4 better than iron sight can u plz tell publisheres to make south african servers whenever im in an game i get a like 5 fps but in menu its like 60fps nd thats because we dont have servers in sa better than cod anyone another choose bf2 revived or line of sight may be is dirty bomb ping is just bad in this game play call of duty online really enjoy the sound design which u guys will choose iron sight warfaceblacksquad or p2w trash crossfire gamekiller are you excited for the deactivate teammates feature in the gr wildlands special operation 2 update that comes on tuesday i am pesky teammates pretty funny how the service of this game is now fully finshed and over in korea while it was released and made by them because of only few players playing plz need this on console a f2p bo2 exactly the same as bo2 but whatever its free to play does it is multiplayer so basically ive been recommendations of ccs playing ironsight that aside the dev teampublisher is spending the players money on just sponsorship and little on game improvements it seems there is no news on any fix and patches about game problems wait a minute when the fuck did gamekiller become a king seriously the fuck but great vid and have a nice day gk you need to upload fortnite because lets be honest not many people care about these types of games anymore so pretty much cod but free i should give it a try cod black ops 5 confrimed 325 that guy went flying can you play escape from tarkov hipfire op man this game look pretty good is this on xbox good weapons mp5 vector sg553 pdwr jackhammer and m16 with p90 mag wait wath the fuck i like this game but its map and some of the weapons reminds me of black ops 2 but other then that its a great game i love it ive been playing this game alot now its really good now after the update super fast and awesome still better than the bullshitery that cod has become nowadays does this make you a sponsor i watched anthonycsn and i heard some very bad review tho well not really just a cod clone give this man a gold trophy this means cod can be free its the same thing d do you play any other multiplayer faq does it have offline multiplayer bots nice shoot steam youre a beast that map is practically same than plaza map from black ops 2 the pistol instead of call it kap 40 it has the name kard anyways it looks cool and funny make the graphics photo realistic and u got a new cod game lets play it nooooooooo not this last time i played this shit i was diying from lagg i play

after playing for more than 1600 hours now i cant play due to 400 ping hope they remove the limiter or make an asian server ironsight discord httpsdiscordggkxb5hqp shit is better then cod make it competitive man this game is great but the developers keep making shitty skins instead of actual content this isnt even new when you know asians got it earlier bad thing they splitted its the first vid of yours that im watching but damn your voice reminds me of someone oo great content anyway overall keep up the good work 3 lol they put a sa map but us sa players still dont have dedicated servers hey im planning to download this game and i was told there are 2 versions of it so i wanted to know which version do you recommend me to download taking into consideration with the updates keep doing iron sight but matches pls and still no asian server the lowest ping i can get is 172 ms steam version has asian server but says its not available in your country actually i dont enjoy this update because they decrease the aiming speed with sniper rifle aiming speed is very important to me this is why i always play sniper rush i was wondering why the launcher was freezingit was the update huh i am so mad that they nerf it and gave it a m1911 how can you not be into all chat what good is killing another player 3 times in a row if he doesnt start slurring at you i do however agree that blitz fits this game nicely and while we have all heard of the standard 3 lane design a 3 lane inside a 3 lane is quite clever really im honestly not sure if i like titan or tower more you can also press f7 in game access chat options maaannn broooo balistic shield brings me baaaack to the battlefield4 times bro w the king in back baby uwu perhaps in the future there will be more shields with different kinds of pistols or even an smg could be interesting just give it a whole hell of a lot of spread or something lol do you know why the game site does not open to download bruh what i thought the tower map and those 2 bullets already in the game on na server since they are already exist in asie server beta heck now we have capture the flag with two train passing in the middle of the map ironsight asia server in steam already have this update couple month ago nice video bro keep up the good work can u tel us what is the best weapon now after the update reeee so nice gotta say but that was a pretty big update and also long time no see my guy its truly been a good minute since we last saw each other also made a new clan called shieldteamsix wooo you guys are late lol im the first one to get gold shield haha and the new map has broke the record for worst spawns but the new diagonal skins are pretty fire not going to lie i got one for the scar h wooo wow i just realized we got the update earlier than the euna server is ballistic shield deagle still op like when ironsight asia just added them to the game great video finnaly a ironsight update and your video keep going bro im having bad memories of the riot shield in mw2 i hope this one is balanced yessss im super excited for the new map and i cant wait to try out that 1v1 mode wow the shield looks great is it worth start to play this days what about the brand new update right now try it out now i think they may have fixed it by the way i am commenting on 7142012 026 thats just tf2 man apperantly i cant this and im in usa says doesnt support my region the final killcam needs a fix for snipers sometimes it looks like they shoot 10m behind the guy on foot hight and gets a headshot sadly the game is unavailable in most countries and one of the countries i live in c guess i gotta find a new favourite game unsubbed jjst because you are being payed to sponsor this game doesnt mean you have to lie about the current stage of the game one day people are walking through walls and warping around i even tried the other day to make sure it was probably the server was just bad that day it still sucked ss and no im playing in my region server and its not my internet i really liked your channed really sad people getting blinded by money and being unloyal to their subs good luck either way i have bo4 and i started playing iron sight a couple of days ago it is so much better and satisfying to get kills i hope this game gets much more player picking this game up now havent played it when it was trashed i will give an honest pov for it is really fun and doesnt feels broken anymore the ar57 has been nerfed now hasnt it can we spam to areia games to add seaoce servers as this could greatly increase the player base also the new update doesnt let asian or oceania players get into the game due to high ping the games not fixed and releasing a video about it being fixed is just a blatant lie and id almost bet this video was sponosred all the glitches that were here orignally are still here and new ones have surfaced netcode still sucks hit reg still sucks gun balance sucks the games bad dont spread lies its a bad rip off of cod and needs to die opinion im still mourning the loss of blacklight retribution and ghost in the shell first assault would people say this game is a good replacement worth putting time into thanks for your input went to log into the game for the first time in 6 months 3 out of 4 lobbies crashed and wouldnt even start timer counted down and then reset over and over game is still broke as fuck i downloaded the game but its says cant load the game you need to go and stop saying go and before every sentence please its really frustrating to me im happy to finally try out the game now that the netcode is fixed im loving the game already they fucking nerfed the ar57 sadley now is even streaming this game full of hackers why is this game not on xbox i didnt play at all since november maybe ill give it a try in the next weeks 713 this game needs asian servers me i dont think so this game is made in asia mouse acceleration still there hate that shit i started playing ironsight few days ago thanks to this video i didnt have so much fun in a ego shooter for a long time i love this game this games awesome it needs to come to steam will build such a bigger player base and i honestly think it will kill a lot of f2p fps on steam i hate you for using the ar57 i can not tell you how many times i was an easy clap cause my opponent had that that gun i have a gaming pc and the game runs like horseshit i wish this game was in mobile dude i cant even play the game it launches shows the dev logos and stuff then black screen and a loading symbol appears goes on for a long time then says timed out just miss the old intro lol yeah i had to delete it then tried to download it back but it wont let me fully install on my computer dont know wtf is going on there since they fixed it im trying again will you aim down your fucking sights please hmm this sounds kinda like more promises which was pretty much the reason i uninstalled why this is on my recommendet better netcode protocol better servers smh though for some reason i was unsubbed from this channel by youtube automatically i have tutorial series on my channel how to get out of every map in the game i have 3 maps left to upload game is broken af tbh this could be one of the best f2p shooter on the market but aeriagames is just too stupid its actually killing me that you dont ads it s an awesome game if you like call of duty just play ironsight its way better man i feel kind of bad using one of the best guns in the game lets switch to a gun thats just as good keep up the good content make a discord server for your channel plssssss basically just wacker version of wack cod game i have no clue why but i was apparently unsubbed bring it to ps4 an and xbox oof fixed but its still open beta nah this game had its chance imagine hip firing only in game with sight in the name devs ironsight fixed already ironsight 200 players online fixed but the first death in the vid is still a damn kill trade sometimes it felt like hjalf my deaths were after i killed a guy and they killed me so annoying the ar57 aint broken anymore i thinks the real problem is still the servers and anti cheating before they go live on steam the have to got better anti cheats the only fps game i know where shotguns are useless y no console release tho i was waiting to get back to this game litkushscoper is with kill bill speedstar and quickhazescoper the only pros needs to be on mobile physics are nice looks like bo2 and ca in one game this game is refreshing not perfect but lots of fun they need to fix the trading and through wall kills and some balance changes to some guns would be nice the optimization is still trash for a lot of ryzen users u said its coming to steam like 5 months ago i can t play iron sight its not aloud i play this game all the time with no problems with connection or nothing i have a mid range pc and internet is 200 down and 10up i play on ultra settings i liked this game but the lag was so terrible i stopped playing it which sucked cuz i actually liked the game could you cover quake champions if already again pls i stopped playing as i got 400ms ping the least they need to provide servers smh a console release needs to happen still waiting on a steam release and a asian sever cuz right now my ping is higher than fucking shaggy after eating a box of scooby snacks how can download sea server no apex it is bruh i post a video within hours of the update and get like 40 views and you post this late and get this many the youtube algorithm is trash redownloading the game got a lot better optimization in the last recent updates i can finally start playing on my integrated graphics at 80fps when it first came out i got a solid 10fps games is called iron sight uses hip fire 90 of the time can anyone suggest me more games like this both free and paid please suggest me few games will this game come to steam can i ask something did they have server in asia hud sucks needs a rework earning guns sucks animations sucks and are so damm irrelevant the they need to jump into a fire to get back on everyones radar maybe out it on epic add a battle royal to rival apex add battle pass maybe mod tools netcode change does makes things a bit better for me but one thing thats happening after this update or the netcode change is somehow a ghost just kills me and i dont know how im getting killed and something about ads shooting is off cause its less effective compare to hipfire in last but not least the lack of asian server and im pretty much given up on this hope they will balance all these probs and make a clean release on steam also bit offtopic but tencent will launch cod mobile globally soon and many will play that with emulator on pc and also they launched their store wegame x and if they bring cod online to the global market its game over for ironsight so they better start making some serious moves quickly its wont be completely fixed untill its out on console 455 call of juty why does everyone say the game is laggy am i the only one who never gets any server lag issues when i saw you using the ar 57 i was like this is why i stopped playing lol great video though you cant get a plisibo effect from a game i wish i could play it in my amd adrenalin software it says game uses my dedicated gpu but in game settings it runs on integrated i saw guy on the roof too people say its a bug but its still very strange and thank you for new ironsight video i hope you make more videos of it dont you plan to look at warface please have indian servers this game suck u running around like idiot and only hip fire no need to aim now they need to change spawns for secure points fix knifes and imo its ready to go on steam also rankeds are their current top priority they only changed the protocol is giving a slight improvement since udp is not reading outdated shots however movement update rate is still at 25 hz which is why some through wall kills also happen personally i think they are using second hand servers because sometimes it feels like the game cant keep up janky shots can u please make a video of best fps games for oceania as well as other servers because i cant find any fun games that have no delay so is there still going to be lots of lag and delay for oceania best game in 2019 for all types of players i have experienced massive framerate drop after recent update from 150 to 50 idk waiting for fix would love to hear your opinion on the black squad gun recoil and overal game honestly if they brought this to console it would blow up playerbase why cant i find the game on steam 242says his aim is complete trash then hits every shot only reason i stopped playing was because no oce servers glad to hear moving forward the game is called ironsight but everyone hip fires wheres the logic in my opinion i dislike the game because no matter how ready you are your dead no matter how hard you rush your dead no matter how hard you try your dead it doesnt feel like a cod clone its like i get one kill and die right away not 5 kill and die in cod i can drop a 20 kill in one life and this game i cant so this game should not be a called a cod clone youtube unsubbed me from this channel for some reason and i almost missed this the main problem was player desync players going trough walls and shit it was awful i dont think they fixed that i just seriously hate the damage drop off considering all maps are not long range shooting maps the damage drop off seems stupid 2m and the shots becomes peas who remembered war cover dudes i miss that og intro doesnt seem fixed to me theres still people shooting around walls ill wait until it hit steam this game deserves to die not first but close what is netcode can somebody explain me pls ive really missed playing this game competitively now more people are playing do i guess ill try it again im really happy that they didnt closed this game and are doing what they can with the comunity to fix itive seen many other games with amazing potential literally shut down because of their publisher of developers literally wanting tonot even doing something to try to put the game back on track likle what happened to ghost in the shellfirst assaultwhat make me lose all hope for nexongames like these where they try to do something new mainly in the f2p genre deserve more love and not to be dropped so easilyhopefully iron sights will be the first example of such it feels amazing now i live in europe and i cant download it anymore because its not allowed in my country anymore netcode is not completly perfect but much better i still hope for new updates the game have so much potential im planing to go back to this when it hits steam im like fed up it seems with bs so either that or ava or survarium i dont know which will win but its possible that ironsight i played it for maybe 100hrs in total maybe more really dont know had fun doing it but this netcode shit was ruining it for me so i slowly but surely stopped playing until its fixed good to know it is but they should put it really quick on steam and get new audience etc and back the old lost ones this game can be redeemed and played having fun again hoping for the best hope itll be free forever this game is good but when is it getting released the devs need to do something and make this game released on steam or some shit are these idiots going to bring it to steam so they can have some success no still has huge problems will this game come out for console first want to do a colab first so happy its on steam itll get traction and the gp isent irl cash its obtained in game rather a good amount i get 800gp on a good game do you remember the cs 16 battlefield mod can you do a remake it looks fantastic graphics wise hell of a lot better than modern warfare bring this to console ill pay 100 bucks to play this game over cod fix the hit detection issues and im all in cant play on steam also goes for website nice this game is not new and you didnt play blind you have a scope on your assult rifle guyz pllz support me also i also play pc games ad today im gonna try iron sight i really wanna play this game im downloading it rn and it says updating ironsight 16 hours still isnt out on steam yet i want to play the game via steam not aeria game launcher needa brush up on your info man not available to download in any region other than asia and some oceania countries eu and na regions are locked to downloading on the website only unless you vpn and create a new steam account the different regions are ran by different game developers aeria for na wiplegames for asia thumbs this up so more people are aware gets two kill with a sniper and he is proud i cant play the game but idk why i cant i live in estonia i could play before but not anymore it doesnt even let me on the page please someone say why i cant play this aint the first version of thia game the steam version is made only for asian pple if youre from naeu or sa you can find the game on the aeria games site ftp and youll have a better ping why the hell you guys wants to play the steam version even doe its asia kill them bots ironsight doesnt exist on steam in germany i used to play the one from their website and now how do i play with the same account coz i had bought many skins and the steam version starts fresh how do you not get the smoke when your shooting i always get thst and its annoying im in australia and i cant get it on steam however i got it on their website nice video though new on steam maybe cuz its not really out yet you should have done some research its available for like a year they got their own website where you dl the game and there you go no steam region limitation bs there just werent asia server before thats why they done it on steam to bypass that issues i guess anyway just work your subject next time pls because you missleading a lot of new players here is the link to help httpsfrironsightaeriagamescom also i already have an account in this game already and i got alot of guns but idk if the steam version needs me to login my main account line of sight is better shame its a dead game now so basically warframe 20 if you are wanting to play it you can get it from there website what countrys are available bruh this aint new really enjoy it over console call of duty right now i play it through their website download since the one on steam is region locked crazy more fun than the game i paid 80 for we need more simple clean fps shooters i am interested in this because it is free my brother just got this and he said its quite good now i have to buy a vpn what do you guys think of ironsight let me know below also hope to see you all on tomorrows new gameplay video where is the update track please been 2 year now and the game is still on beta when the fuck they gonna full release it as if we needed another fucking futuristic shit shooter a clone nonetheless you wont make it far if you cant distinguish yourself from your competitors like cough call of duty come up with something else this has been done shit ton of times and its becoming stale i miss brickforce i played it in my childhood with my brother and now its gone c me mom can i have black ops 4 mom we already have black ops 4 at home black ops 4 at home holy shit this is just black ops 2 i love it please bring this to ps4 what warface shouldve been whats new or innovative about this game return to us brickforce guys dont install this game this is the biggest scam what i ever have seen its a fucking trash game can you guys make this game on mobile please it looks so fun ironsight 4 ever you should add in a mode thats a large sandbox with vehicles maps are not in the game this game is so fucking amazing plesssss add it on xbox one thank you for making this 3 whers the map from 111 been playing this game for 6 months now id rate it 55 yes there are issues but they work on everything we report and it gets fixed sad to see this game is closing in some countries only thing i wonder is why there are no some of maps displayed in this trailer is it gonna be on steam soon i dont like playing nonsteam games or on different clients also how is the performance im downloading this game just release it on steam please i am an old guy that has played many games in the years this game is really good i am surely not the best at fps games but i like to have fun and this game is fun i have seen some mixed reviews on this game on youtube but all i can say is please do not let this game die you have a golden egg here that could surely go somewhere fix the net code add more content such as maps throw in a new gun every now and then to keep it alive make at least one free not paid female character to incorporate women into the game and those that want to play as females most of all keep the path that you are on by having an equal game that is not pay to win there are way too many games that are money hungry these days if you are different it will pay off in the long run by having a bigger user base publicize more add some more incentives for people to come into the game make people want to put money into the game like to get cosmetics and stuff without worrying their money will be lost alway almost like a hybrid of cod black ops 3 and cod advanced warfare hey ironsight is there an in game theater or someway i can make cins like this trailer does for my own videos if i download the game looks epic this seems warface also get your fuckin shit on steam this games deserves as big a following as csgo and i dont think it can get that being completely independent only other complaint is that the lootboxes give duplicate items waaaaaaay to often i spent 20 bucks just because i felt aeria deserved my money for making a great game i can sink hours into but got jack shit from it except a red scarh still feel it was kinda worth it because again the game deserves some cash keep doing what you guys are doing and get this damn game some marketing ive yet to have anyone try this game and not immediately go install it on their own computer is it just me or am i missing like 2 maps that were in this trailer but not in game anymore most optimized game ever are those maps gone or will be added soon im sorry but when did gamigoag wasnt lazy enough to decide to let us redeem the welcom pack which by the way thank you w for this game as gamigoag was lazy enough to support the game are these people for real is there a campaign bullshit its a shitty trailer and you cant trust gamigo anymore in this industry so ironsight the cod and fortnite killer to anyone playing ironsight add me to play usernamehylogenous there is no map like this pls make ironsite on ps4 looks kinda cool but doesnt this trailer seem a bit edgy where the hell are these maps in the game xd kinda surprised a free game has such a bad ass trailer this game has a lot of potential dont ever touch this piece of shit game cause i swear to god you will loose brain cells trying to figure out how you got killed going kill for kill so much the game score is even till score streaks whats the song called tbh i prefer this hud that was shown in the trailer then what is actually in the game in the game its more simplified then giving off a futuristic vibe not a huge complaint however i definitely prefer the trailers hud then the one thats already in the game unless a much more fancier one in on the way then sure 030 on xbox and playstion please southamericaserversplease ilove the game i want this s on ps4 i love this game but please work in optimization in the new map i only get 5060fps and i got a really good pc

1 and halo but couldnt get into them if im being completely honest ironsight looks really promising looks like it might be taking tbe best elements of fps games and improving them definitely giving this game a serious try note to the devs please please please dont bring in supply drops its a feature in cod that no one appreciates and everyone hates i dont mind dishing out some extra cash here or there for camos skins etc but please dont make any weapon types locked to a stupid random supply drop i didnt know that beauty free to play existed wow my jaw got droped im downloading this right now

southamericaserversplease southamericaserversplease southamericaserverspls please we want to server in brazil southamericaserversplease southamericaserversplease this is the texbook definition of a shitty trailer and the game itself doesnt look better the simple fact aeria game is involved remind me of a dark time full of shitty mmo larded with pay to win elements i write it as a translator i am a korean iron sight user many users agree that the game interface is similar to call of duty but iron sight is not pay to win billing can only get weapons of different colors or decorate the character and it does not affect the victory at all thats why its continuing this game did this relase to ps4 system waiting for my key right now call of duty is that you guys please visit httpswwwfreegamekeyscomgiveawayironsightbetakeygiveaway to redeem your ironsight closed beta key now cant fking wait looks pretty bad cod clone xd fake version of titanfall so hip firing is no longer a viable play style rip warface oh look someone recreated call of duty but with a much lower budget no thanks graphics are like 5 years old hey as long as there is no slide or jetpack crap im all for it free to play pay to win activision is going to sue the living shit out of this thing before an open beta is even considered a reality yeah aeria games no they absolutely killed ava pay 2 win trash servers this looks so fucking generic jesus christ its literally just a more colourful cod oh sweet im super excited for call of duty black ops 2 i mean since its a cod clone whyd you make it futuristic you have to be out of touch to not know that people are filled up with this futuristic crap look like shit from 2000 year is this available in philippines for asia server i have high hopes for this shooter we need a cod online in the usa and canada since call of duty online doesnt seem to be coming anytime soon 14th is going to be the best hope the game runs and is balanced its like all good stuff from cod how can yall hate on this might check it out if it goes free but paying for early access no thank you is this pic only i got an email for a closed beta of this looks like a cod clone so no thanks clearly this game is bullshit there wasnt an ironsight the whole time edit except in the amateur juan deag frag movie before the titanfall drops at 148 when is going to be the open beta this game seems to be very good that comes a brazilian server in the future 3 looks amazing only thing i want to change is the cockback time for snipers if it could be faster that would be nice this game is very nice i play korean version and is very god game sees kill streaks already not worth my time and or stress game looks good but i feel kill streaks ruin the game they ruined cod for me so i hope its not glamourised and actually looks like this with all these effects most gameplays from the kr version are misleading finally a well put together trailer d this is good stuff edit trailer xd i found founder pack in httpironsightaeriagamescom i cant wait is ironsight going to be saved check out the follow up to this video the future of ironsight in 2019 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvylwgbkdj20 its a paradox of crap but i got the handle on it balancing weaponry nerfing or buffing make no difference to the cheater honest players lose on that when it gets nerf not the cheater the cheater then will find another weapon to exploit so after that has happend enough times its just a sick game then that no honest player wants to play and the company its self is doing no favors for themselves by not stepping up security sad there not hackers there not scriptkiddies there cheater where there is competition there will be cheating plain and simple i played this game a year ago talk about black ops 4 not having content iron sight is like 10x worse warface is better than iron sight now at this point im quiting the game and i never even played it because its still not on console like wtf is going on poustill alive with no updates since 2015 shut the fuck up faggot and just play the game everything that was wished for in the video has all changed now no the fuck it is not going to die well no fucking shit udp caused constant server disconnect and crashing udp doesnt have an assurance of delivery if a packet is lost is doesnt give a fuck tcp resends a packet if its lost ping abuse and bad netcode plague this game although i have never tried to play it because i have a toaster that cant even handle csgo at 50 fps this game has been dead for months since august of last year there are no updates and the game is still bad game needs to be put on consoles more players will play it and the devs will realise they have to do their job right it literally looks like a call of duty clone ar57 i see youre a man of culture as well i saw raycevicks video trying to play this now if its anything like cods modern warfare 2 thru black ops 2 i wanna play it why do you only play f2p bought the founders pack for this not touched it for about 5 months got repetitive real quick ive sunk quite a bit of money but the best skins cost so much money its way too much the price plus there is not even a marketplace to buy what you want calm down guys ea will buy it and add microtransactions have a nice day i think part of the games failing is also some of the intrinsic design decisions the flinch is way too high the health is too high for how slowly it regenerates and the map design is pretty meh the monetization system and gun unlock system fucking suck and the game modes are pretty lacking it has the beginnings of a good game but it doesnt hold a candle to cod4 i think that if they reduced the flinch and put in a fast paced manual healing system like in black ops 4 the core gameplay would feel a lot better the game is dead now this was such a beautiful game cant believe its going to be dead now what a shame the core gameplay is great the blazer happened nerf that shit oh yeah i remember this game i actually really enjoyed it i wonder why i stopped i knew if they didnt get support and drop on steamepic games they wouldnt stand a chance they barely got out of the water with this game and its a shame couldve been great its 2019 and the servers are still alive this was an amazing game me and my friends loved what made us stop playing no updates terrible netcode lack of new stuff cosmetics camos etc im still trying to figuer out what this damn game not on console ironsight was genuinely too easy i played for two weeks and the ar57 was so ridiculously op that dropping 40 kills a game every game takes about 10 effort and that goes for everyone and on top of that ads was completely optional look at the gameplay above the crosshair is so tight that you could midrange with an smg without needing a red dot the games a 410 this is what happens when you dont put it on steam looks like shit shit gunplay shit movement looks as casual as cod and bf dirty bomb 2 one of the best free shoters dying because of dogshit devs fuck them this was supposed to be better than black squad boi it looks almost identical to modern warfare 3 i have tried so many times to install and i gave up unfortunate i was really excited about this game all the minemen went here as an experienced player some people who play this game might know me as nuski2x i feel like this game needs a ffa mode and maybe a version of br to get more hype also a few tweaks to weapon accuracy and such feels like my bullets are going nowhere when im aiming right at someone sometimes edit 342 is a perfect example of what im talking about here but dont get me wrong for any people who havent tried this game its really great my fav cod was blops2 and this game reminds me a lot of it the gameplay is great gunplay is pretty damn good we need more players though lol what a title plus thumbnail so missleading aim assist and aim acceleration they should have released it to steamepic and updated it more they didnt put it on consol if they did i woulda cared more and played it as of me writing this on jan 2019 the games net code is pretty good but not perfect from my experience other than that the game is pretty amazing for a f2p title its easily replaced cod i was a fan of cod in the good old days of mw waw mw2 etc and i have been wishing for something exactly like ironsight which might even be better in some ways its a faster pace than the most of the older ones but none the less if this game improves a few things and word gets out more it could take a large number of pc players away from cod just my opinion with the game thus far i downloaded it a couple of months ago had a bit of fun but then i deleted it it is a better cod than the current cods but snipers were op and all the maps have easily defendable sniper nests with a good view it has gotten me to the point that if you want to do good you just have to snipe because everyone else does and they just one hit kill you theyre racist this game will revive if it gets released on steam they need god damn marketing too this game looks pretty cool i didnt know it was even made the same way the blacklight retribution died devs didnt respond to a single question for a year and a half while they were working for ps4 version then instead of patching the pc version for few bugs mind you pc version was already superb they deleted the whole pc version with excelent recoil and other stats that theyve been working on for 2 years prior to that and ported console version to pc lol they literally killed their own game nothing surprises me anymore couse its game pay to win its weapon damn pay to win everytime pay to win should wins i know what happened to it the players attached a red dot sight just another average first person shooter next the update came bro they have this now httpsironsightaeriagamescomnews195041hqreport3 the core problem is that the fps market is a very competitive market its saturated with games they probably realised that they were not going to be able to compete against the aaa titles and so decided to quit allowing the game to go f2p where they would at least bring in some return on the micro transactions to cover their investment thankx guys for game testing now we sell this for 60 bucks i also cannot play it for some reason maybe because it is fsr a site that you cant visit if you live in russia and the launcher is basically another site idk yeah and i just dont think they know what to do with people not being able to install the game i also cannot play it for some reason maybe because it is fsr a site that you cant visit if you live in russia and the launcher is basically another site idk ah yes another next best thing game because every game can have that title its a free game man i didnt pay 1 dollar to this game why rip deleted this game a while ago because it would constantly kick me from games while i was getting kills and it would tell me that i was kicked because i was afk lol like id get a kill and then get kicked instantly like how i would reinstall this game tbh tho it was fun when i was able to play but it would have to get released on steam or something maybe then if it was on steam there would be more players ok so since aeria games bought ijji and another derpy korean company they just buy licences to publish games and make a ton of money on in game transactions they do not care about player base as long as there are fools who buy their coins to buy skins with more bullets btw aeria games has 2 more similar companies that are established in the usa and they do the same exact thing there is a reason why the most people who ever played one of their game is less then 20 000 if you take the data from steam most games they launch are mostly already dead in terms of technology they arent even in the a category there is a documentary on youtube on this i used to be a partner with ironsight but ive quit and gone to rainbow six siege i played this game for long my level is 120 i guess thats was from 3 to 4 months and yeah it have alot of issues i only played 2 matches of ironsightand i already want to quit maybe if they had fucking oce servers i have been waiting for controller support for an year hehehe its a shame to make this game dying i hope that it can be the best game in the future tried the game saw the playercount saw the mouse lag left the game i fucking love this game i put 100 hours into it bo4 hurt it alot this game is free if they put out ads it would surely help the player count ironsight used to be pretty good i stopped playing it for a while came back and i was pretty much unable to find a lobby at one of my favorite game modes which was weird i eventually quit the game 945 lol nice game btw so im the only one who disslike this game cause he reload his m16 or m4 like a p90 looks like a buggy call of duty tbh i actually truly enjoyed this game a lot but there was just nothing to the game i hope they do something in the future to keep things refreshed i still enjoy this game ar57 nerf netcode i think this complains are just begging to find things wrong just play it enjoy or leave should put the game on console every single aeriagames game fails because the developers just want cash its nobodies fault but your own for thinking theyd do anything with it this company has an awful track record and its on you for ever expecting anything from this company its pretty obvious by now they dont have a huge budget to start as shown the lack of netcode update server upgrades is expensive imo new games should stay away from 3rd party publishers and create hype via forums social media yeah i had to stop playing cus my launcher broke i reinstalled everything and it still wouldnt work so i just gave up pay to win disguise you can buy guns right away and attachments without having to grind new players are also put with veteran players so that will help push the p2w im done playing it perhaps its not making money so this happens welcome to aeriagames aka gamigo now i dont remember when i played ironsight i used to get 20 ping lmao aeria is good to ruin their games just sayin the experience ive had with this game is ridiculous ive played it from the start even paid for early access to it to support the game because the beta played really well aaaand its turned out to be a waste of money really the game is still the same since release the netcode is absolutely terrible and is the main factor in why i dont play but what really annoys me is i went to try and login last week only to be refused going to the website greeted me with a message saying my connection was refused due to my ip after 5 refreshes i was allowed in but then denied access to the login page after managing to send a request to reset my password the reset email sent me to a page that was denying my access so i sent them an email with my account info just for them to email me back a week later saying i need to prove i own the account and to send the same information i had sent previously to show i was the account holder im done with this mess of a company is there any good playable f2p fps besides black squad atm dude ist aeria thez kill everzgame even there own games milking to the last buck and buy thats aeria unfun map design terrible netcode they never advertise the game sniping in this game was so fun haha i felt like a god with the snipe in this game r6g free d it needs to go the same rout that warface did put the game on ps4consoles in general players will give it a try if its a free game on console also au servers would be great game had so much potential all these free fps games on steam are all basically the same i thought this was cod xd all military fps looks the same nowadays the only part i agree with with is netcode and communication 3 maps in 10 month is about average for a f2p game they updated the ui and added a lot of skins so the actual update part is reasonable gun balancei would rather use a lot of ars instead of ar57 and as smgs go i would rather use p90 so i dont think ar57 need a nerf other smgs need a buff rather i stopped playing it when the game would stop working for me aeria is a hardsuit labs remasterization this is reminding me of blacklight retribution lack of communication and updates killed the game very sad when i heard that ironsight has to do with aeria games i didnt even bother to install seeing how thay destroyed ava i played 2 years under aeria so ik what i am talking about i just started playing this game its soooo f good everything has worked for me so far tho its very sad if this is all true wish it would be on steam hey ud it is not aeria games that is publishing ironsight it is the mobile game dev gamigo the aeria you see is just for formalities and namesake cuz most likely the aeria company employees most of them got sacked at least 75 of them as what happened to trion games developer of trove and archage when they got bought by gamigo you dont need to be surprised with mobile game style of publishing and a publisher that cant strong arm a developer to create changes a developer that has no teeth you dont need to be surprised what i dont like about this game some kind of stupid pingserver system allowing players to kill each other at the same time or through walls because ping is not calculated server end mouse acc thats why oh i was going to download this game anyway thx to this video i wont download this game yeah its gonna be dead in a couple of months ironsight best game i have much friends are looking for the cod like online multiplayer game but iron sight dont have asia server that why i hate free to play games they just want to milk our money plus all the hacks ran out of money they are working on these things now but the netcode is still crap aeria games runs shit into the ground they always have they turn budding young f2p games into pay2win microtransaction skinfests and ban anyone who gets remotely far without paying or people who pay and then stop paying at this rate id really rather cough up the cash to go play black ops 2 than play this every single problem you are dealing with i havent experienced yet csgo became free the game has had so much down time its get old very fast i feel like the devs half way through their netcode update noticed that their spaghetti code is a complete mess and they are completely unable to realistically trace back every issue then they had a meeting with corporate and decided between either redoing the game from the ground up sunk more time and effort into it or just put it on life support i guess they chose the latter and now this game is just an excuse pretty much im still going to play it its just a cod clone the people who want that are just going to keep playing cod it is aeria games man cant suprise me more i pray that they listen to the community one day because ironsight is a great game that can become famous but all these bugs and glitches are making me want to play less and less also no australian servers do you want to know the reason why go to aeria games page on wikipedia and scroll down to games no longer published by aeria games ah thats why it looked terrible from the beginning tbh because they guys who run ironsight all they care is ironsight is good but the developers pick the wrong publisher rewatching this video i admire you trying to share your opinions and i totally get your frustrations with the game publisher but a word of good advice here the game sounds dead you have to realize that if the publishers havent done anything to actively change the game dont listen to the community and made promises to get the game to udp but are still stuck on tcp because they failed in their attempt it sounds like they arent competent in the first place at what they are doing and you arent likely to see any huge surprises the best gift you could give yourself this christmas would honestly be to learn that game developers speak to their community through actions even if they did make more promises talk to the community more often or act like they cared about what you said if you saw no changes just as you are now on top of the lack of communication it would be just as bad a lot of game publishers are like this a lot of them totally fail to make bas this is why im dont jump into inde shooters that much literally remember 2 months ago this game was on the up and up ill play insurgency sandstorm this game has so much potential it could be the next pubg if the developers just put some time into fixing and adding stuff consistently be careful with spending any money in any games connected to aeria games like ironsight its bogus studio that doesnt give a fuck if their games are full of cheaters all your permanent items will be gone without warning or remedy i just logged in wolf team its still full of cheaters and all my permanent items worth hundreds of are now gone aeria games is just cheap ass scammers studio rest in shit aeria i would knock out and piss on the head of any of ironsight developers i know im going to get some flak for even mentioning roblox in this comment but if you want a solid f2p game that doesnt take up much space look up phantom forces on roblox its a really good game at least imo says ar for ar15 then says smg i was never able to install the game because of the bugs uninstalled it no australian servers this game would have been a massive success on console shame they didnt tap into that market this game looks really fun why does these situation remind me of fear onlines d hmmmm i think the biggest issue is how much of a headache it can be for ppl to install this game the correct way just to play this in itself has been enough to make some of my friends say fuck this game entirely maybe the iron sights got a bit rusty lets face it if its not on steam or another popular launcher people arent going to go through the effort to download the game can you make a video about what happened to gunscape 1 need more weapons 2 need more maps in particular frontline mode 3 need to fix lags and servor problems for some countries 4 fix the fucking matchmaking i had enough to match with amateurs and beginners who like being fucking suckers i loved that game so muchi stopped playing it when i lost my lvl 31 level account with almoust all guns i uninstalled this last night im playing ring of elysium as well and its a little bit ridiculous that roe gets patched like nearly everyday or every second day and are constantly in communication with players and in this game the functionality of the cash shop is miles ahead of the actual game its beyond dead lol people played it while waiting for black ops 4 and fortnite to improve ive been making ironsight content for cis and russian community made a lot of weapon guides and searched for many news about updates it will be 1 year on 1st of february since open beta launched i asked them many times i dont need skins camos characters i need only correctlyworking netcode and good weapon balancing could you imagine what would we have if they give access to public test server for all players each of us could share with hisher opinion about they way of balancing and only thing what they need to do is to listen to its community and just collect all information when i heard that theyre planning to change tcp to udp i was very happy and my dreams are come true but dreams just vanished day after day it is becoming very hard to believe that the game will rise from its knees ps sorry for my english i didnt practiced for a while the weapon balance is great using ar57 ar57 nerf play with the scar wins all close range and you got them beat at range famas needs a balance really you could always play the p90 silenced best gun period in game in overall balance for smgs ar57 is rough if you use it other then run and gun yet they have news all over the main menu with holiday things going on they just released a new map with it like its not dying its growing and those crying about the netcode transfering a game from tcp to udp is a hell of a task the sniping nerf doesnt really affect those who are actually good at it only the bad people complain about that also it was applied because every time youd see snipers left and right it was annoying to die in 1 shot because you so happened to pop into their sights for a second damn bo4 shouldve never dropped because it killed this game i remember when i used to play soldier front and they dropped it now ironsight i literally just started playing a week ago an kinda enjoy it but hearing this now smh bad netcode grindy weapon system this is good game but net code is suck i am from russia and prefire and kill over the wall is so cool use p90 instead of the ar57 i was thinking that im the only with that opinion goddamn the network itself need to be fixed and more maps addictives equality to the modes for play whitouth get boring anyway they are putting more characters more skins accesories they no think in the rest of community who plays normaly out of that shet csgo went free i liked this game a lot at first but it was doomed to fail no kick or ban system many overpowered weapons and just no balance a lot of grind for nothing and barely gives any crates i just joined in after seeing it trending on twitch today its been a blast what happened is that they didnt put it on console no new guns no new maps but new features something which will trigger an i want play more effect i went to download the game and it tried to charge me 100 then started deleting my emails apparently there still working on the netcode hopefully early jan 2019 mod support could savefix problems with ironsight aeria games its a p2w and destroy ever game he touch its weird cuz they sponsored youtubers reviewers to advertise their game and now they stop theyte playing call of duty to probably steal some features its a shame the game was so fun when i played it if you think quickscoping god i hate saying that shouldnt need any nerfs then your opinions just do not matter you shouldnt be able to runandgun in any game with any sniper ever edit samey isnt a word pick up a fucking dictionary the word youre looking for is repetitive how am i supposed to take a reviewevaluation of a gamecompany seriously if i cant even take the reviewer seriously its a business man no money coming in death the discord community is very much alive active helpful and in contact with the developers and product managers still you can notice that most people there are quite jaded some community managers reported that a netcode fix will come in q1 of 2019 so take that for what you will overall i dont agree that the game iswill be abandoned but better communication from the developers wouldnt hurt this guy hyped the hell of this game few months ago right before cod bo4 release he screamed this game will ruin bo4 guys this game is new pc hottnes i still remember how he ensured people that this game will raise from ashes and on so on sensationalism as it is i said that before will say that again this game was mess from very beginning and had no future in the west after providing legit information about a 10 payment that didnt work i have had to email them 10 times and my case had been ongoing for 56 months they didnt even reply to my last email all weapons are good if you know how to use them i was agreeing you until you said snipers should not have been nerfed lol fuck off they had no weakness and they are still annoying as fuck this is so sad i really want to play this game well theres a reason cod is dying and this essentially is a cod clone its boring and repetitive one of my biggest issues is the disconnected from server message that likes to pop up everytime i am in the middle of playing a match and i have no choice but to relaunch the game if i wanna keep playing ultimately this is why i dont play it as much as i used to i got bo4 so i can play cod without getting booted off for no reason please can you put this on nintendo switch and ps4 facts this is the absolute truth yet the developers dont listen to feedback and only release cosmetics to make money they need to put the game on steam they will get alot of concurrent players and more feedback if the game is on steam the gameplay feels odd the netcode ruins the whole game arguably the snipers are broken as fuck and yeah no updates ever other gun balance issues is that the guns dont have any effective range at all like really and it makes them feel like total shit give all the guns like 152x extra range better netcode more guns and maps and you got yourself a decent game wouldnt say the game is dying though overall playerbase has increased in september and the new map today will push it more netcode needs to be fixed but other than that the game is solid its a good game what a disappointment i just think that games that fit iron sight genre just dont last long i quit iron sight because it was the same thing over and over and kinda got bored i feel like if it was on steam it couldve done good this would have been a nice game smh it was like a modern day black ops 2 but it looks like they just tried to make a quick buck instead of focusing on the long run i stop playing the game after frustrated with latencyalways 400msthey need to open chinese or indian servers 042 the core gameplay of ironsight is absolutely fantastic he says as he gets killed from the opposite side of a pillar lol dont get me wrong i enjoyed my time with this game for the most part but what was just showcased right there is the reason i left and im sure many others have left for the same reason i hate how you say all the time that there is no new updatedude inform yourself if you do a video such bullshit there are some issues to work on and the devs are working on it not every issue can be done within a few weeks there is a new update no australian servers thats what happened saveironsight great game should not die its the best alternative to paid shooters and to all the other f2p fps they are all like csgo not cod i uninstalled this game because of the netcode guys with higher pings see enemies faster than guys with lower pings basicly you can see this youtuber also ping abuse by playing other continent with yellow ping so he can spot enemies faster its lame what is this game move it to the epic games launcher aeria steam would shit themselves epic is trying to take down steam and a game like this is perfect for epics platform the problem i have is that you have to reinstall the damn launcher which is annoying and hasnt worked for me for the last update so i cant finish installing the game my biggest disappointment with this game was spending 20 and getting literally nothing worth the cash what a crappy gameplay lol i really like ironsight but there needs to be more maps or something played every map and gun at least twice well the maps more like 20 times xd i completely agree on this its sad how this game has so much potential to be the possibly best f2p fps game atm but not that much has come from it i still play the game and love it but it doesnt mean its perfect in any way also not to mention how 98 of the attachments are useless not reducing or changing anything to your gun same with some skills for your character frustrating 525 because not everyone is that bad that they need to abuse a overpowered af gun playing ar is just scummy thats why not that many people play it shut the fuck up i see first sec this gay cunt playing ar57 and is talking bout why ironsight is dying everyone can play csgo now its free the main reason is it is in pc solution quick the game like i did and play call if duty join their official discord server and ask them directly lack of content and shit netcode only successful fps games aeria games had was soldier front 1 and 2 totally agree with you they just dont communicate i dont know why even on there own discord they wont replay to any questions communication is to key to building a community and it seems like they are not interested in it can you try csgo danger zone wtf i just got the game i only can agree with all your points i think this could have been it already for ironsight i mostly stopped playing because of the ping i get south america and the atrocious hit registration but the game was fun not to forget that every amd ryzen user gets fucked by their optimisation i stopped playing after bo4 came out aeria games is the worst i strongly suggest everyone simply boycott aeria games entirely do not play any game published through aeria games do not buy any aeria points and simply let everyone know who plays games that are through aeria games that you refuse to play due to the publisher i would rather deal with paying 60 to buy a new non freetoplay game even if i dont enjoy it as much as my favorite game than to support aeria games again as i once did when ava was published through them for awhile this company simply needs to die fast ar57 had a damage nerf it had 28 damage which has been decreased to 26 i have noticed some people have more bad ping than me when i live in asia csgo is now free to play and it has battle rolyale it is free and one of its kind buy cod if u want a netcode update people man even complaining when u get free shit boooo dislike hey bro i used to run thise game so smooth after a couple of update its became poorly optmized is im the only one nothing suprising aeriagames suck anyways aw man hey at least csgo went free to play the king of free to play fps game is rn csgo since it went f2p communication is the core thing that keeps the connection with the community or playerbase which ironsight is highly lacking they used to post weekly updates before saying what they are doing and whats to come but now they stopped doing it which i dont know why but they still do the community highlights every week its not like they have to do it every week but atleast post once in a month so that playerbase will not feel disconnected i dont know what happened to them they used to do have good communication before but after that netcode change and unchange they just went completely silent which isnt gonna please playerbase i used to play the game everyday but i had enough of the bses and bad ping so i just quit about asian server every time i asked about this they always says they have to find some partner or something like that in order to set up a server which i still dont understand somehow they forgot that asian peoples play game or perhaps we should have spam this is nothing new guys remember ava ahhh at least iron sight has acurasy on snipers its not fqing ca i havent played since about a week after the netcode update failedive just logging in for the free chips and log off since then its sad because i really was enjoying ironsight but bad netcode and lack of updates keeps me from playing well if this gamd dead just play call of duty online what i just have a break and paused playing this game i love the game but there are some changes that need to be made this game could be so good especially with it being free to play but if the devs dont give it the attention it needs its going to die really quickly if they really put the time into this game and made it better then ported it to consoles as well they could really do well with this game not surprised aeria games did the same with s4 league died playerbase thats what happened i really really want to make a video about what they should add to improve the game i quit the game for this very reason bad netcode smg rambos no new modes no new weapons if they decide to fix all of these or just the netcode atleast ill definitely join back i tried to play this game but it just runs awful with amd cpus i get 30fps on lowest settings etc but i can play the new black ops 4 and never drop below 60 tf2 hardly any communication and updates stays alive for 10 years editto people who tells me why tf2 is still alive and ironsight is dying well i know because i play tf2 this comment is a joke about how tf2 is not dying while other games do its my favorite game of all time lol this game is one of the best f2p fps games out there it is awesome they need to put it on steam i had doubts of this game because aeria games i guess i was right i got banned from this game for trying to use playstv to record footage if you check their facebook page they are actually working on somethings making memes things to stay away from as a game dev chinese investors korean publishers some american publishers why a i reccomeed this that game looks trash lol maybe they forgot their passwords maybe theyre working on a cod bo4 battle royale mode kapp the fact is that many people liked old cod that now are dead or full of cheaters and campers and many people dont have enough money to get next gen console and new cod so ironsight is a big opportunity that is avaible to everyone and it is just becaming a waste unfortunately i still dont even understand why they dont put the game on steamanyway i agree with what said in the video they are wasting an opportunity aeria games just that maybe aeria is holding the devs back ironsight is a game growing with popularity and no updates are you even following their discord korean devs are well known for doing these kind of things just drop the game and stop answering the publisher i was taking part in create a badge event for ironsight i spend some of my time to create that badge me and some guys were invited to closed forum conversation and we were waiting for month or two for the results and then community manager said we will not receive any prizes because they brake deathline of sending our works to developers thats all you need to know about aeria games peace i just feel bad for those who spent alot of money on the game lol netcode sucks and balance still is crap i just hope this game will not finish like lawbreakers like ive somewhat been enjoying this game but i just get bored of it now its a good game but they need to something or everyone is just going to leave and find another game ive put a good chunk of time in this game and at least 50 bucks for lootboxes but got shit so i chose to not waste my money as well i knew ironsights terrible servers and netcode would kill the game i have been calling this for a long time lmao ucd i told you this game will fail miserably a year back the first thing you gotta realize is that its aeria games lol has there ever been a successful free fps game oh boy this brings me back to one of undercoverdudes first ironsight videos where i left a comment among the lines of i see aeria games i avoid and he replied to it forgot what it was anyway even tho i said that i still invested a lot of time in this game sigh still waiting for steam release no its not nothingupdates are coming but they fucked up snipers added more sway and aiming down sight is longer and blaster is not oneshot kill anymore for no reason and now everyone just run with an smg without even aiming the core gameplay is not fantastic its boring and doesnt make any sense with all respect to your opinion ucd 3 i uninstalled and will never install it again edit typed this comment before watching the whole video and thank you for addressing the snipers d they are preaparing a big come back i loved it it was my favourite f2p game but i got bored of it not enough maps tdmsearch gets boring boring perks bo4 was actually good camos were boring artsyle is meh maps were boring the game was promoted to sweats so a bunch of sweats were on the game ruining the fun no innovations nothing new attachment system is weak netcode was and still is trash no party gamemodes bad idea couldnt find voice chat fun game not given the proper treatment imo they just said that there was an update coming 2 hours ago for me this is the best free to paly fps shooter i hope it will live somehow wots thisaeria games fing up a gamedefinetly didnt saw this one coming right guys really nowthe amount of games that this publisher vaporized with its touch is amazingaeria games in general looks like every single publisher here on brazilmoney always n1 priorityplayers worried about the gamebring some cool little cosmetic stuff theyll surelly forget the bilions of bugs and problens within the game and will give us some easy money i saw the potential in iron sights since its very first japanese trailer but when i saw aeria games taking control of the game for usi knew it was going to be like thisgames dont need to be p2w for its publisher and developer to steal the max amount of money possiblethey dont even care if the game dies or not and aeria games is in this listi cant trust itsame thing as nexon yeah i wasnt thinking that this game would be able to overtake cod on pc mainly because i was assuming that the game would lose its momentum at some point its a shame though iron sight is a really solid game this is the problem with free to play shooters to be honest none of them really last long besides black squad anyways csgo is free to play now so thats definitely the best f2p fps game to play they are adding a new map next week it seems like youre dealing with aeria games for the first time repulse born to fire and more died in a matter of a few months this is a good game but your right their not doing anything to improve it for some reason i get no lag and no issues in general it works perfectly for me great vid could we get some more iron sight gameplay quite simple what happened i played this game from july to september it was fun for what it was but after a while i started to know the bullshit spawns hit detection and servers i pretty much gave up on it on september then black ops4 came out most people would think call of duty is trash but its actually a legitimately good game and combine that with bf5 and they pretty much put a nail in this games coffin i dont think ill ever touch this game again since cod bo4 is so addicting not surprised aeria did the same thing with ava rip ironsight how is your gun so stable mine jerks up and down all the time when firing any tips for me to be better i only get 15 kills average and i suck what is the best tip you can give to a player like me to improve i need a replie pls can you please tell me how you record roses are red violets are blue i came for the thumbnail and you did too heard someone say youre the best player ingame top1 i played against you yesterday i believe im pretty sure but i could be wrong and i absolutely wrecked you but you still wrecked everyone else on my team so your team won gg 69 title is a lie d hey nice video just wanted to know if you have any funny clip that you want to give to me so i can use on my channel just go to my channels about page and youll see how to submit the video dont want to leave any links on your video as spam plz size of the game this map for the mode only or all modes hey bbkdragoon thanks for taking the time to play our game we are aware of the netcode situation and the developers at wiple games are working hard to address this situation we do not have an estimation time of arrival yet but well notify the community once we get an update as for the monetization aspects you mentioned please remember that the game is free to play and that our team is doing everything to stay away from pay2win elements which explains the current situation please remember that we are still in open beta and that we have still room for improvement in short we appreciate the constructive criticism and hope you will follow our progress until we reach the satisfying state we aim for d i dont know how the game was back then but you can buy any gun in the game with in game currency and they have become rather liberal with the ingame currency and now you can rent guns for a day for cheap just to see if you like it ive also unlocked like 3 guns already from loot crates that are awarded to you for leveling up as ffar as the ttk currently its pretty good some weapons can one tap headshot enemies not only snipers their is a couple ars and when you add the magnum ammoincreased hs dmg its a one shot kill to the head right now one of the best assault rifles is your starting weapon ive seen many high level players that prefer the kc2 which is the starting weapon at no time do i feel at a disadvantage to players who spend real life currency on the game if you are into cod4 mw up to black ops then this is the game for you im having a blast with it ironsight really satisfies that urge of a first personal shooter from the mw and mw2 style of gaming that is very beloved in the pc gaming community for a free to play game it is addicting they need to monetize the game somehow but i wouldnt mind buying a battle pass here and there to have some decent weapons just at least the gameplay is still good i have nothing but high praise for this game and hopefully the developers continue to fix some of the issues with it prior to steam release if call of duty kills a f2p game like this society will be so unfair the game is free to play and the game devs have to make money plus in bo4 you pay so much money just to play the game and the content is hidden behind a pay wall it missed its window netcode fixed yesterday leeeeets gooo desync is a problem in every single online game and always has been people are just noticing it now because either a theyre older or b theyre starting to take games seriously i dont have enough gigabits c i would play it but i dont have enough gigabits playing only ak47 deagle combo csgo habits here i would agree with you on those changes cause they could be nice changes to have so is there a better ftp fps game out there i think i will switch to this rather then fortnite my guy they need to make the guns really expensive so people would invest in the game so they could make more updates it dosent even take that long to get weapons if you actually play and do achievements you are fine a gt 9600 i hope everyone has somehting better than that ironsight is the best free to play shooter on the market i agree with everything you stated yes do these things this game is so sick their need this on the ps4 or xbox one hey update on this theme ironsight got a new update also new net code if this went to console then i could save 60 bucks every year for buying the new cod in terms of the so called grind to get a new weapon well for me i have 40 weapons and about 60hrs of playtime and like you dont even need to play daily missions except ones that give you chips to get more gp all you have to do at first is do challenges and you will start getting 1k gp or more per one challenge and belive me you will soon realise that you will start getting more as i got 13k gp for just using my drones and dont be afraid of experimenting with other guns perks andor drones dont be scared that your kda will get worse or bad belive me you will see if you dont like the gun or if it doesent suit you or your playstile just switch it up for another one and you dont even need to buy a gun you can rent it for 1 day for a really cheap price and repairing system is fine if you ask me its something that gives you a bit more of something to think about aswell as ammo or some other nades beside flash and frag nades everyone has their opinion on this so if you dont like the r i have a 18ghz intel pentium 4 and a pny geforce gtx 550 ti and the game is amazzing this is sponsored by ironsight oh no the same fun for 4 hours of gameplay god damn young grasshoppers want everything straight away with no effort or sense of achievement but its a good game oh and stuff you dont buy with real money expire they are temporary i have a gtx 1060 mini 3gb and it runs amazing on ultra fairly priced card too d i agree with some points but i feel like too many people want it to be like cod hence the lower kill time point idk just try looking at it from a different view point dont compar it to cod right off the bat netcode will be updated by the end of september according to the devs on the forum finally some old school cod like shooter man these revives all memories the comments that u made were spot on but 1 more thing they need to add is oceanic servers it would help a lot of people out everyone play ironsite is amazing i hooe it will be on console i love it just the kill times and consistency is sometimes wacky if they fix that then it would be amazing this game runs great on my acer aspire e15 laptop its fucking great i agree you definitely dont need a beaslty pc for this game been play on integrated graphics at 1080p with 60 fps lol so i built my first gaming pc yesterday this was the first game a downloaded it is so much fun and challenging to me as a new pc player i completely agree with all of your points though i only have about 34 hours on the game but i see every point i dont like the modern warfare side of the game i would of preferred a more black ops 1 age game itself looks alright tho what they should do is release it on xbox and ps4 as a 4050 dollar game so you just unlock guns levelling up ect this is literally just any shit f2p fps no chance of success not on steam only if the maps werent so cancerously boring and small the snipers are way too strong even more so than the black ops 2 you literally cannot win against a sniper if you are using an arsmg even in close range i play on gt610 kill me and this game runs ok i want black light retribution back so goddamn disappointing to see it in the state its in now its just another free to play fps with pay to win elements includedbut atleast something that is worth trying but the most thing annoys me most is since you have to grind alot of money to buy a single weak weapon while getting shredded by p2w players with p2w weapons which destroys new players addiction to the gametheres this another problem also that when i register with email even if i didnt played the game at allnew to the gameit says that the email is already used i really want to see this game on console tbh i dont even have a graphics card yet and it still runs pretty good on low settings so if you dont have a decent pc you can still enjoy it with relatively ok fps it bothers me to say this because i do feel that theyve tried to release a quality title yet i cant help but say that all youtubers are overhyping this the game just isnt that good whatsoever it doesnt have the same gameplay feel as cod it doesnt have the same tight mechanics as cod and even though the graphics engine of call of duty titles arent all that it cant even compete on that front to put it simply the game is average at best and much closer to sub par you guys are just making this game out to be something its not when a game has to consistently be compared to another to be relevant its doa ttk is gold and you should feel overwhelmed if youre going up against more than one person at a time will not be bigger than fortnite or black ops 3 ive just been having a great time pc gaming after building my first ever rig and i cant believe how good f2p fpss have become my computer can run the game so thats a big plus i couldnt run the ww2 beta that came out it loaded but it lagged so bad i couldnt play it when a copy does cod better than cod i think the kill times seem to be ok if they make the kill times faster i dont think it will be fun as for buying guns i believe they should be locked under a specific level as they are in cod buying skins with the in game money seems cool though agree on everything except on time to kill i personaly think its ok this game is the most fun ive had with a cod copy since cod 4 the kill times look short as hell i used to play soldier front and halo a lot as a kid this game looks really fast lol kill times faster are you kidding me the kill times as is makes firefights more skill then bullet hosing for kills it makes retreat way more desirable then just blazing ahead full steam with no breaks it makes you have to think before you engage i absolutely agree with everything here another thing i would like is more scorestreaks and also have all them combined into one selection instead of having to choose between offensive or tactical the one point i got 30k cridets when i joined beta kill times do not need to be faster my godthis is the main problem i have with cod nowadays i die instantly i miss getting shot and having a moment to react and have a firefight not just die in half a second the only good f2p game will this come to ps4 i dont agree about the grinding issue to buy weapons i find that with the amount of xp you get from challenges matches if you do well and special missions you get every day you make enough credits i have 20h of gameplay and i have purchased 6 assault rifles 2 smgs 1 sniper rifle and two secondaries i do agree about the repair items mechanic and having to purchase bullet types for 7 days that sucks also the quickscoping is an issue since everything takes several shots to kill but the main sniper rifles only take one man do i hate the bolt action shotguns in ironsight its aeria wow its not cod like its the new cod would love this for consoles the pc version of bullet force coming from the halo franchise longer kill times are just more fun to me it takes longer to get the kill but i like being able to outplay when im under fire adding more options to gameplay can only raise the skill cap as well my first real triple a shooter was overwatch on ps4 but my first ever shooter was roblox phantom forces and that game is honestly fun as hell who gives a fuck if its roblox it is really addicting my problems is the player base is mostly kids so theyre bad and dont play objectives it also has the grinding problem you really gotta grind to get weapons but you also unlock them from leveling up so credits can go mostly towards the massive amount of attachments that also unlock from leveling plenty of silences compensators scopes sights and bullet types and most importantly guns to get any gun enthusiast hard theres atleast 30 different guns in the game and weapons are all pretty balanced sadly most of the guns are ars and all play the same sniping feels good so does running and gunning jumping throws off accuracy like most games though the best snipers are high level unlocks though since sniping is really powerful highly reccomend the game to people who just w low pingers babies crying about netcode to bring adventage to themselves get good 9600 graphics card is horrible basically any pc can run it this is just a modern version of point blank literally everything is the same even the sounds except few maps and graphic improvements i like this game and its pretty much the only game i can ply with my dying gpu but the netcode and the way you get destroyed when you have the first 2 shots on someone is really annoying but i still keep playing it if this gets on steam oh boy we needs this too bad about the mouse acceleration is it coming to ps4 is it just me but i like the ttk d maaybe it could be a tad bit slower but it feels kinda different and nice d you have time to react and if you are a god then you have better odds in winning a gunfight when they shoot you in the back d i like the kill time its between cod and destiny ttm 4 hours isnt even bad unlike 40 hrs just to play darth vader in battlefront 2 was ironsight give you the necessary amount of money cash down right at the begining to unlock any guns you see fit you have a gift of 3040k credit right at the begining when first login in its your duty to make sure you unlock a good gun at first and by the time you upgrade your gun to level 2030 you will have enough credit to buy another gun and you also have crates in wich can grant you special guns etc i have not yet spend a dime and i had rad cosmetic items i got over 6 guns in loot crates and i bought about 6 to 8 guns so yeah the grind isnt insane the thing is many peoples dont realise they have to claim their extra money and achivement stuff in the sections reserved to that if you dont they will vanish after 7 days already downloading thanks for the info well its still in beta so i wont complain im am 100 sure they will fix some of these issues as time goes on this was sponsered did nobody notice that this is literally halo with a cod skin over it pay to win have you ever played rainbow sig siege it reminds me of it i hope this becomes the next warframe started off terribly but over time for a ftp it does it right and not in a scummy way if it comes out on console it will be huge fortnite is massive on consoles for a reason anything free to play will be massive on console getthisonps4 i happened to stumble across this hidden gem a few days ago man to me this game feels like it has everything that mw2mw3 did right and none of the game breaking op weapons that being said im only two days into the game but ive got about 8 hours into it so far im enjoying it very much thought it was just me getting shot from behind walls idk but crosshairironsights and font kinda remind me of battlefield 4 havent played bf4 but the ttk also is higher than in cod i guess havent played this game but on the first sight it looks like a mixture of cod and battlefield 4 to me hopefully they dont drop the ttk the lower the ttk the more random deaths and cheap kills you have with a higher ttk you need to be consistent there is no luck probably shouldnt be hyping it up too much if aeria games is involved just letting you know they have a history of lots of p2w f2p games it plays just like cod this is basically bo2 new dlc just a fair warning if at any time you cannot log in or launch the game and it has script errors on the launcher that would mean the game server is down and no one can play they dont give etas on uptime call of duty experience on pc titanfall 2 bro lol nah i just llay phantom forces onnroblox lol hey dont get it wrong the netcode isn bad in general since the hitreg on there end is fucking perfect but the movement delay is destroying it hit where regging under 18ms and that is hella quick for a f2p shooter and shooters in general trash game looks like bo3 iw and csgo smashed into one game i just played it and the last pc game was cod blops 2 back in 2013 i play xbox the one x to be exact and the game was so familiar to me i went 302 my first game and im still slapping ass left and right its cloning cod and cloning better than cod does its self lmao this guy really likes the broad term netcode which he uses to only cover the fact that he really doesnt know how video game internet connections work just use the word netcode over and over again lmao people really shouldnt talk to inform about thing they dont know about fyi i can run it on a amd radeon 6800 red faction halo and cod type game kinda this game has poor netcode that cute have you seen r6s how about rip others behind the wall f2p first person shooters are generally 100 trash and pay to win i disagree about the ttk bigger is better not to big but a moderate ttk actually makes you have to think and develope a strategy for your next move its why i liked halo so much more than cod note halo 3 not the new ones when you said what does it look like i didnt say cod i said to myself it looks like shit this looks so repetitive try rainbow six siege idk but im gonna check the game out now codgo why does it have sights if its called iron sight the time to kill is perfectly fine in my opinion but i would agree with the amount of grinding you have to do to unlock a new gun the characters look like they were exported straight out of titanfall 2 is 4 hours grind really a lot for f2p fps i dont agree aeria games made this they also published a good game calledalliance of valliant arms later disowned it ironsight the game that doesnt even fcken start for me cod halo and csgo are the vibes i get from this game doesnt play like cod looks essentially like how cod is played blacklight retribution copy looks bad and outdated stop being a shill i keep getting a notification saying that the source is corrupted when im trying to install it why is this this game looks fucking good that shit looks clean asf i started with cod 3 goodness you think this ttk is too slow ill assume youre comparing against codbreed games cause this feels way too fast to me already just my opinion this represents the good era of codgood guns modern theme good game all over they need to fix that strange shaking when firinglike if u agree pro note it runs on ultra 80fps with the gtx 650 this game kinda looks like the net code and time to kill are the same as warface used to be i started playing halo before cod because it came out first stop pausing so much when you speak too much suspense very scary amazing game just fix the payment for guns and other gear and the netcode are the big ones for me lmao just no terrible game those kill times look fine tbh i honestly dont like the more recent style of coming out of cover for a second and dying will this be on ps4 i dont really have a prob with the kill time i like this game way more than cod although kill time is longer your scorestreaks dont reset when you die i like the kill time because i dont really like having no way to react if i get jumped i also like the regenerating health bar the only annoying thing is the repair system but its a free game so what can i say im gonna disagree with you on the high ttk you view that as a negative but the higher ttk is what makes this game so fun the fact is you shouldnt turn a corner see 3 guys and go easy multikill that should never happen the higher ttk gives you time to outplay an enemy yeah gonna disagree on the high ttk being a problem i hope to god they dont change it the kill time is fine to me just preference can you turn off mouse acceleration now well of course youll get bored the way you play youre a try hard and always want it end quickly the balance is freaking terrible lul do the building look like putty when i land this game is aids literally half the time i get a kill the enemy and i trade the gunfight netcode needs a ton of work the weapon unlock system is also garbage being able to only use three guns in the game unless you spend money on loot boxes is stupid keep mtxs as cosmetics only it works and doesnt turn your game into another toxic p2w mobile game not sure why the fuck they thought this was ok im sticking to black squad probably the best f2p firstperson shooter on the market i honestly think the weapon grind is ok imo looks like bo3 if you didnt have to pay 60 for it this game looks dull uninspired and has absolutely nothing to offer besides basic gun action that gets boring after 3 rounds halo reachfirst fps ive played ttk in halo is so long that this is nothing compared to it heres what i would change fix the netcode doing this would change how timetokill feels so i honestly wouldnt change that until people have time to experiment and give feedback on the new ttk due to better netcode make the guns attachments perks and kill streaks all like cod in that you unlock them by leveling up and just playing i also like how black ops 2 last cod i played for any amount of time since its successors were utter dog shit did the unlock token system where prestige mode would allow you to permanently unlock something monetize the game through skins or maybe even charge for the game to make up for people not needing to spend money on unlocking guns and attachments does it have raw input wait this sounds like warface if it truly wanted to resemble the successful elements of cod itll need to lower ttk and make it like call of duty by the sense of if you pick up a gun you stand a chance no matter what gun the enemy has this game actually looks so dull and boring sick of cod now if it comes to console f2p than it has a really good chance against bo4 ive played black squad and im really digging it i believe its almost like a game right in between cs and cod which is a great mixture of gameplay styles i guess this game from the looks of it will satisfy me and is going to give me the perfect antibr therapy dirty bombs time to kill is so long that you could make a dam cup of coffee and start sipping before you get a kill unless your a god and get nothing but headshots downloading it right now thanks for video id like to see this game on consoles 96 hundred graphics card needed 9600 yup reminds me of titan fall soo its literally just cod but for pc developers are a piece of shit you can actually buy a gun every 45 h im commenting to bring up this video more i tried it for 5 minutes and was already bored cod csgo better graphics looks like a mw3 ttk not as fast but close to it and i loved that game probably not the servers problem that you get shot thru walls you can shoot thru some walls bring it to ps4 leggo i play this game on intel hd celeron r 16hz xd its super easy to turn off mouse movemoment accelerator you just have to go to your config folder or something that makes sense with settings from the game folder of choice of course then you need to find a text document open it on internet with notepad look for disableaccelerator and type true to enable the disable function and save after that go to the properties of the text document and check the read only box and voila start the game and it should work if done correctly it looks like a really really cool fps your settings look crisp showcase them hehe but wasnt the insanely fast ttk from cod one of the main complains from people ironsight set out to not only copy but improve on every flaw cod had and cods fast ttk was one of those flaws so i feel like ironsight upping the ttk isnt really a flaw but an improvement i personally have always hated how an enemy could take me down before i could even register they had flanked me and vice versa back when i played mw2 and black ops even i felt it was unfair how fast i could wipe out an entire team if i flanked them correctly i mean jesus i took out 8 people in less than 5 seconds and they didnt even have time to understand what was going on but then again maybe its because lately ive been playing games like paladins with long ass ttk that i dont really understand this issue dont think it will take off that much that cod deathmatch style of gameplay isnt that popular anymore i loved those kinds of games 8 years ago but its just not something most people are looking for nowadays in the same way collectathon games from the late 90s early 00s died out mostly the cod era shooters are too is this on ps4 was that eposvox that i saw d i started out play halo back in 2001 then came cod mw2 its pretty nice for a game called ironsight its odd that i didnt see a single iron sight in this gameplay looks like infinite warfare fyi nobody liked that game how can you handle to recoil its so bad played it just wondering if there is controller support edge of giant success cant remove mouse acceleration is this only on pc hmm i am gonna check out the game put it on console good video my g was very insightful ive been playing a few days and tbf the longer kill time was one of the draws for me makes those multi kills skill based instead of oh wow someone was using an op gun unlike in modern cod games what was the music playing in the first 2 minutes of the vid i hope i got 64x bit so i can play that game ive only got an apu not ryzen the amd10 and i get 5060fps at 720p now this is the futurism in a game that i can enjoy ive been wanting a pc for a long time now but just watching someone play this game makes me want a pc so much more cant wait to play this when i get one i love iron sight and i agree with everything in this video it scares tf out of me when im just chillin by a wall and all of a sudden i get killed by somebody that was shooting at a teammate of mine but the kill times arent exactly too long or too short theyre more inconsistent than anything i was using the ar57 and one second a headshot basically took 3 bullets the next it took 10 but the game is great and theyre getting to success fast looks nothing like call of duty shooting through wall is a problem but it is in part part of the game you can shoot through some items on the map with reduced dmg thus the ap amo witch helps with this can i play this on a medium laptop eh looks pretty nice could be a cool game to become famous but im hyped for bo4 hopefully its good i dont judge games before they are out because its a 50 50 chance its gonna be amazing or an eh game every thing you said is perfect i play the game more then is healthy and what you said is just what it needs great vid keep doing good ironsight fortnite tarkov feels your netcode dramas haha game looks fun but cod the most repetitive game in like the last 10 years probably not the best model to copy im really hoping that the game comes out on console one day im dying to play the game but im no pc player i have 14 weapons with 30h playtime and no money put in the game to get a credit boost or anything i dont really get it when you say 20k credit is an insane grind i really feel that if i want a weapon 12h of playing will get me that weapon with game credit mission achievements having a range to test wouldnt be a bad thing tought this is how cod black ops 4 shouldve been the only thing i dont like about this game is that if you use a gun to much you have to repair it is it only pc do you think it would ever come to console time to kill is actually perfect dont know your gripe on that but weapons and shooting through walls dumb annoying your relationship with this game i had the same relationship with league of legends but the difference is that in my relationship there was only sadness the problem is this buying for days is aeria games they do this in every game you can grind credits and buy your stuff but only for some days not forever and thats why i hate aeria games i think youre spot on although the regeneration takes way too long for how fast paced the game is i think shortening the kill times slightly and shorten the time it takes to fully regenerate health i think itll be a perfect shooter where can i download it 34 hours grind for a new gun isnt that long as far as i know for ftp fps not true that you need gtx 960 i am playing with r7 260x with fps mostly around 170 drops to 90 very rare but goes up to 250 as well after playing warface for 5 years the netcode in ironsight is perfect if they release this on xbox i will 100 buy over bo4 would i be able to play this on my mac book pro 2017 lmao being completely serious their biggest issue will be hackers guaranteed its always the bane of f2p pvp shooters combat arms and blacklight retribution were both amazing games in their primes but both got overrun by hackers that eventually chased away the player base why do you talk like theres someone behind you ironsight devs if youre watching this video please dont listen to him all of his complaints other than maybe the netcode issue would worsen the game this game looks fun as hell but sadly im on ps4 this game isnt on the edge of giant success no game that boasts some sort of freemium pay to repair game will ever get that big unfortunately blacklight retribution was miles better than this game and look how that went dude you pointed out all the things i was thinkingvery good detailed review instead of those dickrider review videos people have imo the game is terrible it just feels too chinese for me just feels terrible last time i played there wasnt any australia servers it needs to come out for xbox one and ps4 id rather pay for the game upfront than for it to be freetoplay its developers are weeaboos dont support this it has a nostalgic black ops 2 feel that no free to play shooter have this game with proper support is gonna be huge i love the game but i wish it was on console im sorry but im currently playing ironsight on my dell inspiron 4gb ram128mb vram graphics memory corei3 125ghz processor settings low and im getting above 30 fps always this is a dope video i never even knew about this game i would love to start a series on my channel this game looks beautiful havnet tried this but i would assume if it is free to play cod like shooter the structure of the games progression is probably similar to combat arms back in the day well what would take longer unlocking guns in this using credits so you can buy the gun you specifically want unlocking a gun through supply drops which you dont even have a good chance to get the gun you want for a free game ironsight is already dominating the cod franchise if they released a console version then ironsight would be a massive succes something i would change is damage drop off because at close range the guns can kill decently fast but you never can really kill someone who is far away the damage seems to go from 3 shots close to between like 68 shots at range that kinda make ar feel a little bad to use or at least to me for me fear online and gitsfa were so much better can you turn off mouse acceleration now i loved playing this game at the very start but the lag become unplayable once you get a couple hours in game was so fun at first but i started noticing problems health regen is just so slow i remember i killed someone had like 10 health that guy had enough time to respawn and run all the way back to the same spot to get revenge on me even before i could regen back to even half health worst of all is the time to kill its horribly slow so slow that someone can litteraly have enough time to scope in with a sniper and one shot you so whats the point of useing assault rifles that take 8 bullets to kill when a sniper can do it with 1 it needs to go to steam and its perfect has a combat arms view in terms of buying guns n stuff on time table when this get to console it game over i think the game is better as cod i dont know why but i love this game very much i already did bought cod but think ironsights is better i run mine perfectly fine and i have a gtx860m great video i have a 330m and i can play it the kill time in dirty bomb is very slow getting weapons isnt that hard just focus on the achievements daily login bonuses and daily challenges i think the f2p system is actually fair plus if you could get all weapons extremly fast i would get bored with the game faster i want to work towards some goal while i am playing ive never had this much fun in an fps until ironsightscod has let me downand this just feels like cod but with all the garbage extracted from it hopefully this game makes it to console just to put the currency into perspective i am a daily player but dont even win 4 games a day i am skilled enough to get 25 kills a game in tdm and close to 40 on a resource game with that said i am sitting on 180k with quite a few weapons now i do play said weapon until the 5th achievement is complete unless the weapon is trash i dont have an issue with paying 20k for a baseline weapon you can also rent weapons my game doesnt start its stuck at the starting loading screen fok sek i actually like the higher kill time because aim is more important now with low kill times it just matters who lands the first shot whereas on ironsight its more about how well you track the enemys movement and make micro adjustments with your aim it feels more skillful ohh yes i feel a another frustred cod pc player her i feel ya d this is an interesting perspective most other people who i watch play this game have the opposite opinion on a couple parts compared to other ftp games the grind to unlock guns is pretty good in most other ftp shooters youll sit on your starting guns for days unless you dont mind just renting or if you spend money i think the time to kill is fine if the time to kill is too short it can lower the skill gap the time to kill in this game is similar to that golden age of cod games between mw2 and bo3 the starting guns are also fine the blaser is one of the best sniper rifles the k2 is a mid tier rifle and the tiers arent very spread out and a lot of skilled players use it very effectively but the mp5 is not all that good without attachments whats interesting though is if you let a gun expire and dont switch it out youll spawn in with a basic m4 thats a little better than the k2 but you dont get attachments or optics there is a video on the netcode by that one guy it doesnt take long to get weapons i was able to get one every 12 days i already have all but 23 guns unlocked and i wasnt playing more than 23 hours a day maybe love this game even know is hard cuz im a console player but im getting better some body want to play with me new to pc yea its a good game needs to blow up i would rather they would charge me 2030 for it and only have purchasable skins ive been playing this game for 3 or 2 months now and the only thing i hope they made is asia server thats all playing this game in eu server around 330 pings man i got a lot of assist and its really horrible server for asian player like me xd more than that this game is top best f2p ive ever play tottally worth my time bro 20 hours in and six is not bad you legit need that much time to unluck like 2 6300ip champs in league will this ever come to xbox i am playing since 2017 and its awesome except ar is to op snipers like a shotgun secondary shotguns are to weak netcode weapon prices is ridiclous interesting that the cod fans are pinning their hopes on black ops 4 what happened to cod ww2 and all the return to boots on the ground rahrah malarkey i agree with everything he mentioned in the video except the long grind for guns they cut the cost of guns in half now it was 40k gold now its 20k you can get 20k gold in a matter of days not only that but each day you log in they give you free goldchips and even some weapons for like 3 days so it really doesnt feel like a huge grind the matches are quick and fun it doesnt feel like a chore to do 3 but as a free2play game how else would you expect to have proper monetization where the devs are making money and the game isnt offputting i think the system they have now is balanced for being f2p other than the time to kill and the netcode issues which the devs are addressing i think the game is solid for now most fun ive had on a free fps game so far halo players decimate cod people at their own game i feel that titanfall 2 has to date the best shooting mechanics i want ironsight to do good to see it dump on black ops i dont have a problem with the grind or how they make their money but i do believe they should at least test an idea of a battle pass idea like fortnite has tbh im not a huge fortnite fan but the one thing they have done right is their battle pass system they make a lot of money off of it and its not pay to win lots of ideas to explore they should bring this to console so i will be able to play it i started with halo then went to cod then back to halo ironsight got me hype i play it a lot now i dont play the futuristic cod games or this dumb battle royals i play fighting games and some shooters but this game is amazing seems like the same model as warface nice videoi dont think the startup guns are bad tbh plus all guns cost 20000 implying that there arent any guns super op from the rest there are guns that are better than others of course but i think the guns in general in terms of performance are balanced nicely love your voice man keep the commentary would love to this your opinions implemented into the game and bring this to us console players this game could be the new cod it could kill cod off if they werent robots i would play this game its got that pc fishbowl effect gives me headache watching idk kill times are pretty fair i can easily come around and kill 3 or 4 dudes also the weapon prices arent that bad you can actually get money easily its like black ops 3 minus the wall running and jumpbacks real halo players started halo 2 on xbox gtfo out if here but this game does look like it has amazing potential hmm i just started this game like 2 days ago decided to use my starting points and just buy about 6 different guys for 1 day each i did just as good with starter guns as the ones i rented the real reason i hate this online shooter is the person who sabotaged the owner who was to implement this into cod it never fitted so they canceled the censorship and the owner desynced from the gamings program concept ill wait till the netcode gets better to download this im pretty sure the netcode is bad because the protocol most people are excited for this but some of those people would say it sucks if this game was a call of duty title i started with halo i will end with halo this looks terrible this is just like cod its no different try warface its also free to play but actually pay2win launching this on console with the changes you talked about would probably blow up cause since cod is not what it was we dont have a actual good fps game and this game being free would help it a lot lol the time to kill is fine you shred enemies in an instant can you play with xbox controller woah cod ripoffs in 2018 it doesnt take too long to unlock guns a 9600 will cut out some people are you high lmao tahats a budget gpu from like 2007 it costs about 5 today i think the ttk is great in this game tbh it gives you an opportunity to turn on people who get the jump on you without taking too long to kill someone the issue is that hp regens way too slow so if you get in a direct gunfight you might have to sit for a while before youre safe to engage in another facetoface fight but to be fair without free to play mechanic they cant make any money good video but im fine with the current ttk honestly they just need to buff up some of the weaker guns and i think itll be in a good spot you think 4hrs stuck with a gun is a grind hahaha in warface weve been grinding for like 5 months and 99 of the players arent even close to getting gun which we paid 10 to get access to crafting ironsights economy seems very fair since its not pay to win unlike warface which has all the best weapons which is alot locked behind an outrageously expensive random box paywall sorry this vid is about ironsight but wf got me raging envying ironsights economy put this bitch on steam and itll go viral hard if it was for ps4 then it would be the best free fps game on the playstation store this game does not run rock solid on amd cpus from an oldschool cod fan mw2 blops this looks really entertaining and solid ill definitely be checking it out later down the road thanks for sharing it dude on the edge of being ruined by hackers why the fuck does ads shooting feel more weak i never aim down when firing at someone as it takes longer to kill someone and the recoil feels worse too its so weird i love the game but i hate it as well weapons feel so off mp kill an enemy faster than an akscarh mk is totally shit and its the first weapon i bought recoil is completely off you need to tap fast 2 kill someone but you cant cause the gun cause 10 miles up kill times are in fact way to high fun irony started with halo 1 and now im playing dirty bomb and irosight looks good but cant play it with that netcode 20 hours with a month dirty bomb is also another f2p game oh its also dead lol couldnt be more on point i love this game runs like butter and just needs a few things well you ready for this ironed out its already gaining traction with videos like this cant wait for the future of this game 126 that reload what awesome does it still have mouse accel implemented in my opinion its not difficult at all to unlock weapons i mean yeah its true you have to grind a bit but thats the beauty of the game if you could unlock every weapon in like 20 hours of playing whats the point then and you said that the starter weapons are trash no they are not the k2c is actually pretty good the blaser its like the most op sniper in this game the quickscopes you can make with it are actually insane and the weapons they are all balanced i said that the blaser is op because its quick but it does not have a lot of damage there are some ars that have more damage than the others but the rate of fire of those who have more damage its much much lower everything is balanced in this game in my opinion hope you see this comment and actually read it and i hope i wont get much hate from other people anyway great video peace bullshit there is no feeling of grind in this game its very easy to unlock weapons unless you buy one weapon play it for 1 game and then want another one there is perfect gun balance spend your money wisely in the beginning the guns are super easy to grind out in 23 hours how they are supposed to make money if it was easy to make chips for skins just do the daily contracts and when u get achievements u get a decent amount of gp for buying guns just buy guns daily to test which one u like then by the time that guns durability goes to 0 youll have about 6080k gp to play with the game is amazing but sadly unplayable due to there being no oceanic servers ironsight in 1 word cod bo2 what is your graphics card mannnnn for the netcode the character movement latency is slower than the firing latency meaning that the game updates every shots faster than your movement so sometimes it looks like youre behind the wall but the server didnt registered that fast enough and you die im at level 55 and i buy all the weapons in the game just to test them all and i cant agree with you more bro this game notpaytowin right its needs better netcode ammo and a better way to earn new weapons also perksok theres alot this game needs to improve i love this game and i think its already fast paced which is a good thing idk why you think the ttk is long and i have been able to kill 2 people at simultaneously it just needs quick reflex and about the weapon unlocking i think its absolutely perfect first all weapons bought are technically permanent but they have durabilty system alsmost every 5 hours of using the weapon you have to repair its not a big deal because you can make that money in 24 games but dont forget there are acheivments and daily missions which play a huge role in getting money for average in a game you get around 300600 cash and with acheivements it can be added up to 3500 there are a lot of acheivements and they dont go for example the ak47 mastery the first stage is killing around 20 then it goes to mastery ii which needs 100 kills and gives you more money etc i think buying weapons is not a big deal a weapon costs 20000 cash and a skined weapon costs 40000 excluding the gold sk also it needs to stop u from always having 2 peps killing each other at the same time its so annoying agree with netcode and gun buying but not kill time are you serious the kill times are fine because some weapons just destroy in 3 shots any lower and it will be a 1 shit mess drop the kill time really i think the grind is a good thing since i cant get enough of it games like cod are stupid easy to unlock everything imo so i think its fine to have to put in a little effort time to kill is kind of on the edge but i think that if it was fastereasier youd get rekt by noobs if youve ever played ranked youll notice that people with good aim can rek you in 02 seconds but hey thats just my two cents just downloaded and played this yesterday its definitely pretty fun also addictive because of all the things you can unlock havent liked cod at all since bo2 so its pretty clear why i like ironsight for the upcoming bo4 im trying to keep low expectations but am hoping it wont be another flop i love this game i want this experience i agree completely you can easily run this on 930m laptop graphics cards and possibly even lower cards but it runs on 930 and 930mx comfortably without dipping under 60 fps ever it runs super smooth but i dont think the weapon grind is too had to be honest if you play well you can easily get over 400 or even 500 credits per match and you can do achievements that give a butt load i dont agree with the time to kill thing for me its ok but they should make headshotting more rewarding and maybe slow the character movement speed a little to make hsing easier ive played it for quite a bit and i still find it extremely fun except for when you get matched into players way out of your league and get absolutely smashed but hopefully the problem will be alleviated once the matchmaking system has enough players if the game blows up to sufficiently match according to skill once you get a gun that fits your play style for me the sg533 you dont really mind the grind for getting more weapons as you can just open supply crates and test your luck when you get to that point it isnt oh i need to get x weapon because ive seen it perform well its more like eh im comfortable with the weapons i have lemme test my luck see if i get anything cool because at the moment the supply crates are a fourth of the cost and yet have the ability to get those weapons as well as weapon skins which cost twice as much as weapons which take 4 hrs of gameplay to get why would you want less kill time thats the competitive aspect of it who ever has the better aim is going to get the kill while the other guy struggles to get the headshot 0330 this is bs and i couldnt agree less getting new guns is very easy ive played for around 40h now and got about 34 of all the available guns most of the sidearms and almost if not all attachments and i even spend quite a bit on skins and cosmetics as well the weapon break so slow that in the time one breaks you have earned about 4x as much as you need to pay to repair it again i have been playing for a week and i have 90k credits its really not that hard to earn them mouse acceleration needs an option in settings to be able to disable it lool looks like since this game came out every person on youtube became an expert programmer of netcodes i play myself from england and didnt find anything wrong with it tbh you get daily rewards for logging in just check em out and you will get a lot of ingame currency for weapons there are also daily challenges to gain them if you shoot enemies in the head the ttk will dramatically decrease i love this game the net code makes me want to rage quit sometimes i can run it with ultra graphics on an old macbook pro with 650m that has 500 mb memory biggest problem is hit reg people are hyped to compete but is so frustrating in its current state it does not take that long to unlock weapons its the basic f2p fps shooter but i can confirm some guns are bullshit i usually snipe only and the dsr is the best btw getting killed around corners has to do with server tick rate the lower the tick the less updates to the server per second so if youre around a corner on client side most likely server side your model will be a bit behind i think the kill time should be lowered and so should the credits u earn because im still working on getting a new gun and its been like 2 weeks 100 agree hope they dont miss that window i completely agree with this the time ti kill and grind for new weapons needs to be changed is it for ps4 ima be honest i have been playing cod since cod 1 and before that moh which cod was based on and before that delta force 1 2 3 and before that the original friggin doom on lan with college buddies when we heard about this new thing called networks and the internet so yeah i am too old to say things like ima be honest but you are sooo right about ironsight and the ttk and the netcode but more importantly where it could place if it gets it right pc cod is 1 million players but maybe more if done right so just get that right and ironsight could own it and take some console players with it btw pc with ironsight as it is now gets incredible fps with a fairly low graphical overhead i have all on ultra with a pc optimized for aaa games from 2015 most laptops can play it no more excuses its about gameplay hell cs has crappy graphics but amazing gameplay learn the lesson and make some freakin money man but agreed they are not quit ive been playing this game for a lil bit and would rather pay 60 to actually get rid of the dumba credit system also in ur opinion what is the best gun in the game i agree with what u said about the cons except the weapon grind thing now its 20k to get literally any gun in the game and sure u have to repair it from time to time now my point is the weapon price is good because that makes you more careful with what weapon you want to actually spend your credits on so its alright at least for me that the weapons take a lot of time to get i think real guns help out a lot too many fake childishly designed guns in call of duty meta weapons ar57p90 i couldve bought both at the very start but i didnt the prefire capability of p90 and insane accuracy of ar57 makes these guns powerful and noobish can it be countered answer is yes scarak47arx and many more hard hitting guns for the people who think this is p2w the deafult assult rifle is one of the most balanced weapons in game and effective at that and they give you 40k gp to buy two weapons of your choosing plus earning gp ig is fair im a f2p and ive played it for over 3weeks and ive gotten all guns and have even unlocked a lot of gear and skins and again everytime you level up a free chest try it out for yourself i can definitely relate to the constant dying around corners 9 times out of 10 if someone sees you either you kill that person or you die theres definitely a desync as well because ive been killed many times by people using the same exact gun as me when on my screen i clearly started shooting at them first ive even checked my recording softwares replay and yeah i start shooting at the guy and die before his character model ever starts shooting back at me however i disagree on it costing too much to unlock weapons 20k is nothing if you actually invest the time to use the weapon you just bought rather than buying another one and another one willynilly thats what they want you to do though they gotta make money somehow and repairing is simple just repair after every match itll cost you at most about a hundred something gold and every match you make at least 5x that amount same thing for the ammo types which you dont need to use btw you make the gold can this game run on any pc im getting a normal one for my birthday and i need to know if i will be able to play it i made my acount and everything i go into download and log in itll freaze and wont let me even download it my only major complaint is the lack of oceanic servers if you think you die far behind walls when youve got a decent connection you havent seen anything that lack of oceanic servers is the only thing stopping me from playing it more but i also understand that the game is in beta and theres a good chance that they cant afford those servers yet or whatever the case is i eagerly await the day those servers arrive though ripped behind walls sounds like hackers as for long kill times at least thats a difference from the normal cod games i have one question that is a deal breaker or not for me does it have full controller support if it does ill download it right now if its anything like dirty bomb in the controller support departmentya know partial then i may never play this game i haaaate km 96 hundred graphics card lol good video bbk 3 ill have to try this out i never really found the grind for guns that bad the challenges and achievements help a lot with the grind they need the bring it to console and fix the monetization to make it less of a grind maybe by doing a season pass much like fortnite and offering skins for characters and weapons why cant this come to ps4 with larger maps free frames per second works on gt 750m fine 60fps 1080p 126 that reload tho yeah its is an awesome game but the ping in many countries is so high that its unplayable if they dont fix it then it will just flop like many other games 9600 is 10 year old card when i played advanced warfare back in the day my go to weapon was the ak12 it was like one of the best guns in the game and very accurate with little recoil but thats completely opposite in ironsight it sucks a lot i found it boring i dont know i should try it again maybe for a f2p game i think the unlock rate is fantastic i have 5 guns and ive only been playing a week it honestly doesnt get much better than this in the f2p world lol hell no fuck the cod ttks this ones barely even longer rip consoles this game looks good and its free something to get away from the toxicity of overwatch will definitely try this out so its pay to win ehhhhh i think that its really easy to buy weapons you get like 40k right off the bat and i seem to be getting enough money from doing daily challenges to unlock new weapons weapons usually just cost 20k aswell so i dont see where ur coming from here i would love this game on console its such a nice shooter indeed playing it with some friends is cool i dont think the time to kill should be faster though yo what was that outro music d great vid as always il play it this weekend i honestly dont mind the grind for the weapons like this is nowhere near the grind of warframe btw i love your vids m8 p dont know why you want the ttk faster just play cod if you want cod i love sniping on that game it is so amazing the standard sniper rifle feels so good its not an insane grind they give you so much gp via challenges and achievements i have noticed i was being killed round walls its good to know its not just me i dont mind the grind in this game i think its because i come from games like borderlands and destiny this game plays more like cod online havent had much of an issue with netcode that would be because theres no servers in australia 200 minimum ping on a twitchy shooter doesnt play well so i have to pass on it until i can get a decent connection otherwise it plays awesomely personally not too keen for them to reduce ttk current damage model emphasises headshots making player skill an important factor in the outcomes of duels a lot of the double and triple kills you were earning just in the vid were due to shot placement take it from someone whos played every cod from mw to wwii a skill emphasis in the play makes a hell of a difference in enjoyment that being said might be due to the netcode im sure if they figure out some of those problems then the current damage model would make more sense have you played black light redemption looks fun will check it out all the grinding for credits sounds like the other free fps blacklight retribution i started playing that game because if you as well i really wanted to like that game too if it doesnt make some of the changes you made i think this game will share the same fate ohhh that intro music fire if they fix the netcode then the kill times wont seem as bad i agree ttk is a little too long for my taste i thought blops 2 was too long and could only play hardcore i thought mw3 had the perfect ttk i think if they put in a hardcore mode as well it would help this game definately sounds like its worth a shot mind the pun best boot up the pc and start downloading great video after pubg and fortnite has gotten so big with netcode so bad that proves that for most players netcode doesnt matter this needs to come to ps4 dope video man keep puttin in the work you talk too smooth to now blow up soon yo this game brings me back to cod4 so much looks like so much fun does this game have raw input or aim acc kills look very satisfying on this game never heard of it may check it out off topic question but do you think youll playpost bo4 on your channel especially if it comes with battle royale its all rumors and speculations now but from what i heard they are concentrating a lot on making the pc version with high quality probably due to the battle royale i loved wwii and bo3 and im definitely excited for what they have in store for bo4 also i really hope ironsight might come to console someday great video sir having your time run out on equipment and ammo is a huge use of your credits if you dont play that often and its also a bummer that they cant be permanently unlocked this game needs to add game modes like domination and hard point from cod one other vital suggestion would be to introduce new maps i thought the prize was only in beta test is there still only mouse acceleration its very odd that a clone does the thing its cloning better than the thing its cloning i think it feels like a cod from the 20092012 era of the series theres a lot of grinding yeah theres not they give you over the amount needed to buy a non starter gun if u want a grindy shooter look at heroes and generals its pretty easy to unlock guns in iron sight netcode is pretty shit tho ttk just depends on opinion free to play or not a janky netcode is the reason why i wont play a game like this is it coming to console i hope itll launch a client on steam i have some buds at work who play and enjoy this looks cool reminds me of black ops 1 and im sure its pretty fun the way they talk about this is the way we talk about eldewrito so it looks like theres a classic wind blowing through pc gaming recently i just hope the big companies notice it and ride the wave is it on mac started this game a few days ago it really feels polished for a free to play experience im okay with the time to kill though perhaps if they were to reduce it keep it higher that cod ttks the reason you experience the dying behind walls is because they use tcp protocol for the servers looks pretty interesting might try it out soon kind of reminds me of when i used to love cod and pub stomp 247 man if you think this is a long time to kill i wonder what your opinion of destiny 2 is lol ichase this would do so well on mobile looks like a mix between bullet force and cod lol love ya bbk this video made me laughthis game would be greatif they changed most if the things about it made me laugh pretty hard though it is a great game it does little to stand out theres no reason id play ironsight if i have cod online on my pc they need to make some sort of jump equivalent to fortnite adopting battle royale not battle royale in ironsight something fresh it is a decent game if you are willing to put up with the paytowin elements but many people arent so they definitely need to fix that i played it for a few days and abandoned it it wasnt bad in anyway and it looked and played very much like call of duty i only really had problems with 2 things one was the unlockable weapons being really overpowered compared to the default starting weapons second i generally use a controller and there was no support for that and switching to mouse and keyboard just isnt comfortable to me however that clearly wont bother many people i played it on an old ultabook and it ran fine so yeah it pretty can run on anything like fortnite watch battlenonsense vid on this game and youll know exactly why the netcode is weird the cod community wasnt the only ones to give up and go to games like fortnite fortnite and other battle royale games are just a trend that will die soon enough if they brought it to console id be so frickin happy we dont have good games for free on xbox aside from warframe and defiance 2050coming out later this summer which both are looter shooter third person games built around killing ai for loot we dont have a fps shooter for free and its kinda sad game looks like so much fun thanks man will this game be on the ps4 eventually ill try it thanks for the recommendation ironsight is a brand new free fps that is currently being developed by wiple games aeria games this free game is sitting right on the edge of giant success in my opinion as the pc community has a strong desire for a game just like this but is ironsight worth your time in its current state today well take a look at the pros and cons of ironsight and what i think could change before black ops 4 that would allow ironsight to explode in popularity the foundation the team has with ironsight is very strong now with some small changes they could capitalize huge on a market hungry for this type of game thanks for watching if you enjoyed please subscribe for more just a heads up everyone this video is from the technical test beta from december 2017 the state the game is in now is way different in terms of hit detection starting guns etc thanks for taking the time to watch my vid everybody that thumbnail is beautiful

discovery is fun ironsight uff 3 but the new train map is to big awesome video bro glad to see your channel is growing belated congrats on 1000 subscribers keep it up teiwaz tv please make more videos we got this in ironsight asia a few months ago but if theyre separated doesnt this mean aria is copying wiple im confused oh and if they follow everything in the asian version you guys should get ready for the vss a new map called broadcast which actually appeared in a game trailer before and also an ak buff making the ak47 3 hits kill gun man idk about the na server but the asia server is dying right now there are so little amount of player and asian people kept reviewing the game that it has many hacker even tho im pretty sure either their internet is just sht or they are really bad and never played cod maybe there are some actual hacker but fvck me this game is the first time in my entire life where i actually got called a hcker once there are so little active player even it is a turn off for me because the game kept putting me on korean lobby giving me high ping i just started playing this gorgeous game thanks to steam and my first play was actually a capture the flag match love your vids man thanks a lot sow you video and says to my self ohh new update lets see it after watching the video wth i have played this update in december i better play minecraft yay new upload we need more updates like this nice you finally uploaded another ironsight video nice video as always tei btw is ironsight asia and global on steam now has joined together or they still has a different page i havent play for quite a while the elevator is so fun tho haha great vid bro missed ya how u been another cod clone no thanks seems like a good amount of things are copies from call of duty especially the whole 2025 thing so basically bo2 but faster paced better graphics and its free ill definitely try it out i dont like the graphics no leaning wont play call of duty with halo and rainbow six siege its just black ops 2 this looks like if black ops 2 was f2p i dont understand that rifle its a bullpup but yet theres still a mag in front of the trigger could i connect a controller and play or its if mouse and keyboard only a weapon to surpass cod remind me of warface for somehow ugly people like you complains about why we are using adblock because we dont want your shitty ads looks cool is it split screen ye i was surprised how good game is its very enjoyable and not p2w it basically free cod but better xd reccomended so call of duty but good i heard p90 all i see is bo3 oh boy you can quickscope in this its basically cod and warface its a balance game not too much in the future just a nice flow it needs more work i think in giving u that chezzy gameplay the graphics looks something like advance warfare but without xo suit and the guns look cool like ur playing battle field 4 is it ever gonna come to ps4 is it on ps4 i hope it i see a cod clone which is a game i never liked due to its lack of any appeal its not doom with fast paced movement and satisfying weapons its not r6s with lots of thought put into everything and tons of teamwork its just nothing boring its like its trying to be a fast paced yet tactical shooter but fails at both id love to see this on console since im not a pc player ok so how are they making money its f2p but are the devs going to randomly flip and make it pay to win free to play with paid sponsorship what is their plan i need this for ps4 now my pc isnt for gaming playing a game named ironsight with scopes ironic jk it looks dope though definitely will check it out this is like infinite warfareghosts and cod online not hopeful if anyone played warface then they wont play this including me i tried it not bad but many cheaters in the game infair weapon system it like higher lvls has better weapons so every time im getting rekt the matchmaking is horrible well another kind of games like warface or black squad looks good but hows the player base so how do they make is it p2w quickscoping just what i wanted just looks like csg had a baby with call of duty and its future tech needs oceanic servers clearly not as good as roblox phantom forces is this playable on console yes i know im a peasent seems like black ops 2 remastered and black ops 2 is my favorite cod soooo i hope they release this in console this on ps4 this sounds like my type of game to play wow faze pete when already better than cod it is already very good for a beta game i am hoping to see more stuff in the future is it on mac why do we still have cod clones wtf so sick of it be original like my god cod but boots on the ground and free is it on mac cause im bored on mac whats the intro song called its a cod clone is it windows only or can i play it on my mac f2p cod is it pc only or can i play it on console its literally just a clone of black squad i wanted to give the game a try even if the game is far away from being popular the game has no translationservers to my country has a buggy launcher and the game doesnt even get past the credits for the na server and for the eu server stats dont load and im locked in prevented from starting a match i think its sad for a unknown game to have such a sad start is it available in sea server is there nuketown 2025 remastered would actually play it if it was on console will it come to xbox chinese cod this really looks like war face kinda looks like black squad mixed with cod looks nice called ironsights uses exclusively optics sponsored video has ads pc only its literally just a black ops 2 reskin not a bad thing but copyrights and such could be problematic i think call of duty can learn something from this its fun so is this just cod when will it come to console is it pc only this game is honestly just a better version of bo2 i really hope it comes to console bc this game is beautiful is this game available on consoles looks alot like how cod was should be will check it out thanks wish it was on console unpopular opinion i prefer siege you havent used that song in the video for months i missed that even though it looks good is there a ps4 version planed loving the looks of it any word if it will be on console loving pc btw is this coming to console having problems downloading the game says that it cant run on windows 10 for some reason sick intro cod quickscopers heaven can they all migrate to this game and give us back cod without quickscopers you guys have it all wrong its the ghost in the shell shooter assets the died it was a fun game so basically black ops 2 i tried to play it but it freezes when ever i try to play the tutorial i know its new and will have bugs but seriously the tutorial doesnt work is it only on pc cod advanced warfare without the bad parts i reckon iv been playing this game for ages now tbf it reminds me alot of the old days of mw2 yes its f2p so you should already know that you rent weapons like every other f2p fps but its not pay to win when renting guns you can rent them daily or you can just buy them permanently using in game credits not real money there is micro transactions but they do not make the game pay to win its all cosmetics its a solid game but they really need to fix up their network as some times you will die behind cover but on the enemy screen you will be in the open but honestly good game for what it is 710 btw i got about 30 hours right now d its my favorite call of duty since they released black ops whats the outro music man i really want this to come to consoles sry pete i rather play r6 and for 3 yrs running try to get to diamond max plat 2 is it pc only looks like the good old cods i think ill try it out looks cool enough but not my style of fps too much like cod for me it actually looks alright actually looks fun im always down for a good free game i like how the thumbnail has a sponsored text thanks wow im early whats the song in the intro nice stream marshal i popped in for a couple minutes and was your 1 twitch viewer i suggest that you try out rainbow six siege its a pretty tactical game and i really think you would like it we need steam free game cod call of duty im already play this game in steam yeah game look like awesome this was such a good game i miss playing it i dont know if it got banned restricted or something else but you cant play it it the baltic states iron sight needs to fix hit boxes ammo and damage whats the website i want the game thank you for finding this im so sick of fking fork knife its pissing me off and im just done with it i was going to look for a good free fps by myself but then i found this and i was like this is the one splitgate oh no nvm then looks like a copy and paste from cod here in 2019 still waiting for iw to fix their game bruh this game was in roblox status of gameshut downed play warface americas army 2 was the best free and overall fps of all time nothing tops the gameplay of that masterpiece whats the game link really great this is more cod than codmw 2019 is its on steam now btw and its still good this is literally cod mobile finally a new fps game i can play with hope and then proceed to get my ass kicked on it what about krunker tho looks like all the upset cod fans have an alternative now i cant play ironsight because of my ping iron sight uses eotech best fps for u that dont hav gud laptop phantom forces on roblox oh this looks like cod fuck this battlefield modern warfare 2019 now that jacks played ironsight he needs to play phantom forces on roblox when i see abilities all that shit i stay away from it cod stuff is not for me where is csgo is this game still irrelevant though there be many free things that we can see that we get in this world but question what is the most important thing that you can get for free and after that follow up question why do mostmajority peopleof the world forbear receiving it i think buying bf4 would be a better deal this game is now available on steam any one watching this video after i write this comment u can easily get it on steam is it on steam is the game available for console as well no link in the description is this plaza from bo2 ughhhhh sure why not check it out if this isnt call of duty idk what is games dead now this is basiclly cod for people in china but do we have oce servers yet havent played much of this game because it never had servers i could play on us servers are way too laggy with 240 ping blacksquad is highly worth it its actually trash jack play hired ops it went free to play your not giving the gameplay of those game you say all you do is play pc games lol im still playing this lol just needs controller support and ill be happy lol yes i know pc gamer with controller

specs needed link for download this game please comment me man thx so much i first played this game i love it so much one day played i was rank 20 apparently ironsight is dying is it why is my ironsight is input not supported that not free to play thanks u saved my wallet you touched about that they are copying cod with the perks and skills but this is what people want and is free to play whats more i think that this is much better than cod this is an excellent game for mac users thanks ironsight are there any fsps where you can run your own custom config servers anymore i miss running my own servers hope they make a steam release i really really really really want that hey is this game on mac jackfrags you should see the new game modes theyve added i am happy to see a good fps game that actually makes me stay for longerthan a weekor a month also one of the games you showcased was warfacewich i played and likedbut it kept me only for a year or so it just gets boring with timebut i am looking forward to this game i dont have any cod 4 vibes on this game but iam having cod bo2 vibe guns look and feel and sound more better than most aaa fps titles to anyone playing ironsight add me to play usernamehylogenous not so realistic tho in short cod f2p are there uk servers for this can only find na download and 1mbps limit can you please put a link for me to download the game because i am very interested to play it it really looks very cool but i cannot find anywhere heros and generals is like battle field its also free kinda looks like a mix between cod mw23 cod bo2 and battlefield34 a good fps but my computer is trash and i cant beat other players in gunfights because my fps you sound similar to donald trump that map looks like one from bo2 dust on ps3 is better but they got rid of it fyi cod is a total trash fortnite is actually free survarium check it out on my channel not real rain bow i look rainbow jack finaly i have ps4 its not ava best free fps game of all time but it has potential i have been playing this game for an entire month now and i got to say the devs have done a really fun game and did i mention its free the game is like what i would find on cod bo2 gameplay is fantastic you get decent frame rates on a midrange pc literally a perfect balance of modern and futuristic fps game and did i mention its free whats this gamr called what about warframe i know its not a fps but its f2p a free cod thank you now my broke ass can stop playing fortnite and warface graphics card that looks like the 60 cod already better than pubg goddamn that game looks solid and fun check out warfare its also funny because cod can virtually shut this game down because of the similar maps but it doesnt seem like theyd do that its like any good cod game but with battlefield kill time yo if this game comes to ps4 holy moly its gonna be lit whats the url for the game this looks like a better version of blk ops 2 nice u sounds like princevidz funnily enough ive played this game and it was trash the only twist in this game is that sometimes the matches dont start better cod ultra mega modern advanced infinite warfare hey i want this game but im wondering if you can turn off gore anyone when i try and downlaod it says the url is messed up or the page is no longer available i cant find it on steam where do i download this game 2nd map literally is plaza for ops 2 such a great game didnt touch any other game since i started playing this 7 days ago awesome maps looks like something from cod rainbow sic siege ripoff even the gun skins quick scoping in this game is sooooooo nutty being able to get 180 quick scopes makes me yell in joy while i also realize i have 200 ping where can i download this hellbird is super annoying is this on console yo this looks really good the name of the game warface is pretty good i wanna know why it keeps stopping me then i cant move for like 1430 seconds planetside 2 now thats a decent fps free to play you wait until they bring the inapppayments sounds like youre saying hindsight is it on ps4 hopefully the ironsight community isnt as fractured as the cod community lol what about cheaters are there alot on this game holy shit a v sync option open your legs ironsight im peeping through i play skill sf2 its a free game too and tbh it is likely unrealistic but its a fun cool game ironsight uses eotech if only there was oce servers is it in the psn store great game my internet is fine but i cant seem to download the game im always stuck in a loading screen on pc ironsight is confirmed to be released on steam once open beta is complete consoles are not confirmed but the developers havent denied the idea of it happening one day what are the requirements for the tame hm us fighting over resources cough cough middle east cough cough ok game but basically completely unplayable as you cant turn off mouse accel another really good one is warface on steam a really good game but borderline unplayable since im in singapore playing on naeu servers gets me like 300 ping cant wait for asian servers to be up a really good game though it sucks honestly i got a warface ad on this play critical ops looks cool damn cant wait for it to be on steam wasnt expecting much when i clicked on this video but damn this actually looks really good reminds me of cod4 mw2 and bo2 can you put links of what youre talking about in the description blacksquad is ok but this looks way better i think youll be a little disappointed just bought rainbowist really fun thx im downloading this ah this will be the replacement for fortnite if they dont fix the shitty shotguns client and ironsight has problems launchinganyone found a fix looks like a shitty cod clone yawn weird to think that all that paying stuff was allready in battlefield heroes like those emotes cosmetic stuff and then the op weapons reminds me of wolf team without the wolves i love warface is this on console i tried this game after seeing this video the gameplay was fun but the one issue i had was the ping im in au and there seems to be no region selection within the game every game i go into my ping would be 250 this must be the most generic shooter ive ever seen really missing a soul or something to stand out with did you ever hear the tragedy of planetside 2 the great i thought not its not a story the games media would tell you now seriously you want a great free fps go to planetside 2 wow looks nice id never discover this game if not your vid and youtube who put this on my main page thank you reminds me of combat arms i love this game everyone really needs to give it a try is this only on pc guys what are the minimum specs literally jsut cod but a really shitty reskin really nice this is just perfect cause i was kinda sad playing back with cod4 and 6 and getting lot of mouse inconsistency and playing capped at 90fps i fucking love this game so much i feel like im 13 again i cannot download this game 010 phantom forces ripoff without bfg kids or thicc roblox bodies is it available for android mobile cons not on steam website down has to be downloaded directly pc exclusive not on console its kinda like warfarce i am gonna give it a try im tired of regular 10v 10 shooters with the same concept br games are so popular now because its totally different and new for players now if they can come up with something new it would be great its 2018 we need a whole new play style but if i wanted to play a game like this i could just play cod or bf1 gameplay is even good but rest of the game is a joke 90 of weapons are the same nothing to spend game currency on do you remember arctic combat such a great game warface is better it would defenitly save my budget but why would use holographics on ironsight xd is it on xbox nice now i can try cod if i ever feel like it looks like the cod weve been asking for since 2015 is this on ps4 thought this was cod bo2 at first or cod ghosts i would still play this if i didnt get an average of 500 ping thats just a call of duty made by different company can you play it using an xbox controlleredit nope this game is alot better than cod ww2 shit reminds me of a better cod ghosts would love to play the game but the whole registration process is filled with not reachable come back laters as well as the page youre looking for it not available and also our site is not available im coming in this about a month after you made the video so im certain it wasnt just a random influx to the site whats it called again whoever made ironsight made the running animation almost perfectly exact to cods runi wonder how they did tht whats the link for the game ein sight tf what is it called jesus christ i cant hear or what hes pronouncing i would argue warface is a great game as well i really hope this comes to console call me blasphemous but ive gotten way too good and comfortable using a controller to just now switch to the wrist destroying mouse i wish consoles would get something of this quality for free i am quite impressed with this game not gonna lie pretty excited to try to out later what do you think about warface its not like cod its kind of based on roles coop missions game modes no regen you need a medic for that engineer for armor and ammo from riflemen what do you think honestly i play it since last week and i kind of like it nice vid tho this game should go mobile started watching this and immediately thought of cod ghosts that game had my favorite multiplayer out of all of the games in the series i am currently downloading this and will be playing it im the only one whos been playing this game for ages it looks like if i mixed a btec r6 and a btec bo2 together check out tactical intervention ummmm what does vsync do if this was on console it would blow up like crazy that famas thogh im sorry but this game is not good simply cause of the connection issues its super laggy and buggy i could only play 3 to 4 out of 8 matches i played with no lag too much cod can it run on low end laptops gives me that mw2 feel i know its ttp fortnite and realm royale kicks down the door this is the bo3 we all wanted i heared that he said eyensight gun and movement looks really good here omg finally a good fps really excited for ironsight and world war 3 watching this video as i play ironsight bo2 ripoff and bo2 looking map still looks fun tho i just wona snipe if bo2 r6s and bullet force had a baby try blacksquad isnt the best but considered to the other free is preety good f2p clone of bo2 yeah stop advertising games like these this game gona go on steam and devs will lose their mind over popularity and this will be filled with pay2win shit this game is all about abusing the shitty netcode is this the same game that was on steam before another great f2p fps shooter is dirty bomb check it out i see famas i would play this time to see what it has omg thats so weird i played like a week ago sadly its not on mac if not i would be playing the shit out of it i prefer blacklight retribution even over most paying fps tbh try blacklight retribution how about dirty bomb this good game i like it no recoil what so ever this shit is basically cod looks like cod bo2 already full of hacker whats this called pc only its like a better call of duty is it on ps4 is it also for mac but is their au server games calls iron sight uses an optic ffs jack play warframe best free to play out there heaps of content live service with constant updates every other week or two amazing graphics literally hundreds and hundreds of unique guns hundreds and hundreds of unique melee weapons and over 30 characters with unique and entirely different abilities with prime equivalents literally a better destiny please check it out does anybody know why i cant register to the game you like this game cause its making your wallet chunkier lawbreakers is free to play now this is very much like cod the gameplay looks solid how about crossfire hears jackfrags say the name of the game searches game on steam and nothing comes up literally right after i hit enter but the game is not on steam yet how is cod like not trying to sue them or something whats your sensitivity that moment when a free to play game looks better than a popular triple a game cough cod cough weird when i play ironsight i have the worst case of recoil it looks like theres barely any in your video looks fun great video jack even this runs better than pubg lol you should totally check out survarium the game is a bit dead buts its hella fun shouldve put the link in the description did they fixed their serversdid they got some updates cuz like 0 new content meh who want to play bf4 on ps4 u must have mic my sier name theleader4 called ironsight has crosshair hmmmmmmm even though you shouldnt compare games this looks like a blatant cod ripoff nevertheless it looks smooth and im going to try it its just another cod game wasnt bfp4free from ea its good but you get shot though walls a lot where you shouldnt have been shot was gonna play it until i heard its on their client free of duty lol have played both both great games this game looks absolutely amazing but i dont have pc so big l but like what are we talking about here its a game i can play for 1 sessionlike for 2 hr maxthen i wake up the next dayi wouldnt comeback to this or think about this its not that kinda game just a basicif you just wanna chill without doing anythingit good for few matches literelly i am telling you you dont even need to download this just search online fps browser gameif you have firefox that supports adobe flash playeryou can play this kinda games in your browser incredible game very smooth and good gameplay looks like cod plays like cod but isnt cod i just want iron sight to have a 25 killstreak nuke since i was never able to get it back in the day fortnite is free and good bi i can never get it to download jack the type of guy to make people quit playing iron sight running around merkin fools u should try dirty bomb i would love to hear ur thoughts about it why i cant download this game the map looks like they took it from call of duty blacklight retribution is also really good very glad you posted this video i never heard of this game until this my brother and i have been playing it a lot now and enjoying it it feels like it copied the best of cod before it tried to go all wallclimbing futuristic jetpacking garbage what about the online game bullet force thanks jack i got this and im having a blast d my new pc cant arrive soon enough its boii i want an asia server pls pls pls played this game some months ago when they actually serviced in pmang korea quite well made game im having problems downloading it its says my files are corrupted can someone help me dirty bomb is one of my favorite f2p fps will try this one out what about warface rip cod hello ironsight serious questionwhat the fuck happened to halflife and counterstrike i know enough people still go but we deserve a hl3 and a new cs its 2018 ffs seems pretty good like a low budget or fanmade call of duty for those who miss the gameplay style of mw1 mw2 mw3 is this available for console a bootleg call of duty f2p fps games used to be great they were amazing and then got taken over by companies that made them terrible crossfire ava warrock etc they were all great for f2p games been streaming and making videos of this game its a load of fun thanks for bring in a bigger player base p looks good im not hugely into cod i think ill stick to bf4 for the moment but its definitely a considerable option better then cod lol im really hoping that these games will be added to consoles theres not a lot of choices that appeal to me plus im horrible when it comes to using mouse and keyboard i actually thought this was bo3 at first lol starving for conent i hope that is going to be on ps4 anyone played crossfire i used to play it alot years ago you know that youve just increased their player base by around 15 hundred people even if just for a moment very little recoil killstreaks lost all interest why do companies insist on cloning the features that ruined cod what is the game name gonna give it a shot thanks its like cod for sure looks a bit faster than cod no link to the game dirty bomb is also a great free to play fps you should check that out jack id like to have your enemies because mine seem to shoot back smh no hate btw i love your vids this game looks fun blacklight is great too jackfrags you just broke the serversd csgo is only 15 i dont see why people wouldnt just buy it lowkey this looks as good as a og cod or better no thanks it has built in mouse accel i like insurgency even tho its not free its only 2 on steam which i mean its basically free in my opinion im having a ton of fun with this game thanks jack blacklight is fucking ass compared to this game there is no comparison why is this not on steam you should play blacklight retribution the game has seen better days but its still alive and needs more players the map looks great i dont like ironsight its way too fast paced and guns kill too fast the animations for running make it look too futuristic as well i cant wait i love blacksquad man i have csgo too but blacksquad is nice and refreshing ill have to give ironsight a try tho lol thats cute you think ea will give something out for free xd this game is so fun and brings back the nostalgia of bo2 and the direction cod should have went its like call of duty so its shit m8 shit they should go on steam greenlight i was actually looking for this game in steam the other day because ive seen many positive clips about it now and i dont want to pay up for the rehashed bowl of sheit that is actual cod today ironsight might be the next best thing connection failed the server took too long to respond the weapon balancing and netcode prevent this game from being good but will it come to consoles aeriagames no thanks wont take long before they ruin it thought this was blacksquad at first looks like a very clean satisfying game no raw input mouse accel the fuck are they thinking guys ive actually been playing this all day download it its so addicting that the fifty times i felt like playing something else i got lost in ironsight again yeah just another cod clone i appreciate the video but ill not be checking this out do you find that you and the enemy player kill each other simultaneously often tried it for a few hours i am liking what i see the flash and stun grenades actually do what they say unlike cod where you can see from a flashbang after 1 second free and it already looks better than cod i assume it doesnt have oceania servers the best free to play fps is easily phantom forces on roblox i shit you not but look up phantom forces surprisingly smooth gunplay how is it that you are so good even when you pick up an fps for the 1st time i think the best free to play fps is still operation7 but unfortunately is going to die coming to console how can i sign up for the beta i researched it but couldnt find anything this actually looks a good alternative to cod well done to the devs should bring it to console i actually thought this was call of duty this game is ok but when i play it the aiming is terrible you could aim right at someone and you have to pray that you kill them and the time to kill itself is weirdik its in beta but they should fix the aiming first can you play battle carnival i cant even log in to the game fucking garbage this game looks very promising and i wanna play it now if only my pc had higher specs totally accurate battlegrounds is a free to play if you download within the next day or so available on steam dirty bomb is pretty good just played it right now and it awesome feels great getting kills thanks for killing the servers i was happily enjoying this game until you did this video now its a cluster fuck of lag is it on ps4 i played it in early open beta and the netcode was terrible sometimes you killed enemy in few shot and sometimes you empty whole magazine into enemy and he has 50 hp glad you showed this game some love its a pretty good f2p thats not saturated with cash shop bs you can actually just well play the game watched this vid tried to download servers too busy jack you broke the servers with this vid d few hrs later i downloaded and played well not played anything else since this is better than any aaa title out atm imo even with the odd bugs well worth a download maybe console release someday i would be curious and look forward to a free to play game like this on console or even the return of warface on console asking for dislikes this is madness weapons rent only a cod clone but its better than actual cod games im like woohoo then hmmmm think about it wtf did i buy a 1080 ti for if they going to use game graphics from the 90s yep i now know why its free i want this on console this looks like a very good game to play til cod or bf gets their shit together and just make modern fps next bandwagon game that all youtubers talk about ironsight so many issues with this game from the installation and launch of the game alone hope they fix name game this looks absolutely awesome dirty bomb is great also in this style of guns and graphic would be amazing a soldier of fortune type of game oh i missing sof too much just choose weapons fight global terrorism in awesome missions and cut body parts off d jackfrags u should try warface its a great fps the only downside is that the launcher doenst work that good americas army pg is better looks like cod mixed with battlefield hardlinei like it dunno the engine is terrible when it comes to movement and gunplay both feel so clunky its like im playing arma 2 after months of waiting still no asia servers i cannot even cant i am so happy you covered this game jack its the best free fps game out right now ironsight isnt worth it right now the gunplay is shit because of netcode and the performance is subpar it has borderline no multicore optimization yes thank you for bringing more people to this game i didnt like it at all way to csgo sorry im not 12 anymore much more into hardcore shooters comer on sandstorm time till kill was why high i still hate the spawn system in the all the modes except plant the bomb where you have only 1 life lets say i spawn in the north of the map and run towards south suddenly almost the entire enemy team spawns behind me and obviously kills me i really enjoy playing this game but this is just annoying and i think there is a better way to handle the spawning of the teams i hope that they will change that dirty bomb is also a good free fps ever played heroes and generals forced mouse accel tho miss me with that mix bo2 and aw and you got a better game than new cod ifwhen they put it on steam ill play it tryout heroes and generals on steam although you have to grind a lot to get what you want what is the playerbase like wish they release it for ps4 how do you know a game is going to be shit when you cant fuckin even install it tried to install it like 5 time but their files are too fucked up keeps giving errors ive been playing this game since the closed beta and i absolutely love it and yes it needs work but its completely worth the download basically its cod done right get on ring of elysium gives me a vibe between rainbow six siegecod is it free for playstation lol note on weapons the starting gun k2c is really good so you start with no disadvantages if rainbow six siege and call of duty had a baby its really laggy in steam tho not sure why but it reminds me of really early like alpha warface before it went to shit its good cz its free looked interesting until i found out theres no oce servers and no plans for any in the immediate future the first map reminded me of plaza from bo2 this game is a ton of fan weapons cost like 20k but i usually grind 25k per day easily by playing a couple hours i feel like its gonna be like warframe great game great developers great community but not a very well known game i cant get the fucking password to play the game i want to change it but when i press the link in my email to change my password it says access denied dead player base full of cheating no thanks i had been playing this game for quite a while and got a tiny bit addicted to it for 2 weeks it just got boring quite fast especciallt because you get stuck in progression alot and the game seems to have dice balancing but with shorter killtimes the maps just feel like the worst parts of some bo2 maps put together and some are pretty annoying on some gamemodes literally an exact copy of call of duty i even heard some of the same sound effects that are used in cod only thing it has going for it is that its free looks like a bo2 clone i think warface is better a free to play bf2142 would be awesome thanks for the recommendation jack i downloaded it and i absolutly love it so far looks like a fun game but you can turn off mouse acceleration so its shit ive played this game jack describes it perfectly ik yall are gonna hate me for this but do the game have controller support a dam good game for being free whats the name of the game watched this vid downloaded the game instantly hooked thank you jack for showing us the game does need improving in certain aspects but its so smooth and feels great to play when your not lagging that is but its great for a f2p dirty bomb is this on ps4 what is the game called where is the link i wanna play nowe im guessing this is only on pc remember exe uhm remember com warface is watching closely wow looks better that blackops 4 take a shot every time he says free to play is that warface reminds me of arctic combat i thought that was bo2 at first wait what about warface i think that games cool this game turned me off real quick when i got into 3 matches of quickscopers ive played it months ago its a really good game i might cover it up on my channel anybody remember dirty bomb ironsight is the best game ive ever played but shame aeria games didnt provide server asia so player like myself who from asia will encounter with lag thats just sad with refinement this looks like it could be a suitable direct alternative to call of duty better than new cods lol jack you forgot the link downloaded the game and played a bit but found it very hard to find anyone to play with what i saw looked good another good ftp fps is warface its pretty good and a bit more dynamic than this game warface is also pretty easy to play on low grade systems and there is a rather large player base its the same as any other f2p fps this game has the famas im fuckin sold lmao what the fuck is going on in the video is this what it feels like to have ultimate instict relatively low recoil i own this and bf4 and mw2 on pc and let me tell you mw2 has absolutely no recoil and the recoil in this game is 2x that of in bf4 holy sht it changed a lot from dec of 2017 you should check out war brokers on steam no ragdoll effect ugghh theres no reason for that not to exist in every single violent game what about warface this game was so glitchy i guess its fixed now i hope i can run it on my notebook looks cool this game its pretty good but oh my god the grind it kills me after some minutes is this on ps4 its good but really needs to be optimized more these maps look familiar korean cod clone the community is actually struggling due to a lack of servers what console is this on next cod is it just me or does the map hes playing on look an awful lot like bo2 plaza cosmetics are for twats if you put ironsight in the title you wouldnt of gotten these views gg 10minfrags warface anyone i didnt like the game too much i prefer faster ttk and snipers feel too op but im not good at quickscoping so i cant use them i often cant find people except in groups which gets me killed however it looks nice and is one of the best free to play games i play roblox phantom forces and while it looks horrible i like it more can someone help me i have bf4 and i installed the final stand but when i want to start it on bf4 it writes to me that i do not have the application bf4 but i have it through cd hmm rip cod try americas army proving grounds free to play fps and this game was actually designed and created by the us army desync in this game is so shit ironsight is way worth the download looks like cod4 married bo2 this game is impressive ive never played a cod always been a battlefielder its fun and the ttk is perfect head shot crit is great fun game and thats what makes it great i have been playing this game for 1 year already glad to see its getting fame for me its a bo2 remake which is sick cme all play at this game looks good been trying to find a new game for my stream and i think i just did mate dirty bomb is best shit i played it when it was in closed beta but idk i didnt like it too much honestly even though i love cod up to bo3 i dont really like that the female skin is looked behind a paywall no ps4 im glad that you used k2c in there like how he doesnt even link the real download so ppl wont get screwed over any chance for dedicated self managed servers does anyone know where is frankonpc its cod the environment textures and hud look a bit dated to me the most annoying thing for me is definitely the fact that hip fire is the same accuracy as aiming down sight or at least its very close to that feels cheap and unbalanced is this on console aswell i recommend dirty bomb this game is giving me nostalgia on blacklight retribution on the ps4 sad thing is how of a grind is required to get stuff in blacklight and how easy the game is for me netcode dosent matter anymore fortnite and pubg is proof of that really nice game d played it for a few hours with friends and loved it however without friends felt stale great game though i cant find it on ps4 still only for na f2p shooter lots of cheaters can you play that with a controller how do you zombies play 1000 versions of the same game everything look fine except graphic isnt good when a free to play fps is better than cod press f to pay respects i played ages ago its better than call of duty pretty much says it all amazing video and a amazing game thanks jackfrags for the truthful and amazing review no asian servers at the moment kinda thought it was warface but then after watching the video i realized that its better anyone else remember that ps3 exclusive game mag massive action game same story as this one pmcs fighting for resources in 2025 only issue im having now is the lack of sea server other than that the game is superbly good so its like blacklight retribution when it was good i hope it doesnt take the same way that blacklight did this is what iw should of been this game is great tbh it reminds me of the enjoyment factor that cod lost years ago ya want a free to play game that feels decent check out phantom forces on r0blox hey jackfrags you should check out midair on steam to see if you like it its a f2p first person shooter that plays very similar to tribes 1 and 2 its made by a very small dev team and needs some exposure because its a great game if you liked tribes 1 and 2 or even later version of tribes youll like it thank you for showing this game i love your videos and i think im gonna try it ive spent more than 20 hours on this game and there is one thing that will keep players playing this for quite a while and that is the ludicrous amount of achievements that the game have it gives you a lot of in game currency just by using the same weapon over and over similar to how the classic cod did it on top of that if you are to get a scope from the lootboxes you can use it immediately to any weapon that is compatible with it without having to grind for the levels which is the best thing ever man i hope they have those wide open maps where when you spawn with a sniper rifle you automatically get a gilly suit i played iron like 4 times a pretty long time ago and then i didnt like it but now it seems pretty good so i might try it out again looks more enjoyable than cod or battlefield better than fortnite shroud still thinks this game has mouse accel lmao a game like this on console would be dope dont care that it looks like a cod clone seems like a cool game to play ohhh yes its from aeira games wolfteam childhood is this on ps4 plays like an older cod games love it i enjoyed the older cod games but havent played the newer ones its just not my cup of tea but i like how this plays i will have to try it out is it on console wow you will say anything for a buck now a days that game is full of hackers you low life scum piece of shit liar fuck yo channel nigga looks like ziba tower im interested now will be downloading it now thanks jack it has a very futuristic feel to it when looking at the trailer on their website but watching the actual gameplay makes it look more realistic wonder which way theyll head with development i personally really like it the way it currently looks looks smoother than pubg already in my opinion ironsight has its own individuality and it is its own game tabg is the best this game is a pure cod clone the game is free so i see why people want to cock ride this game people say the same for paladins because its free but overwatch is much better this game is a bo2 clone and doesnt even come close to being as good as bo2 i hear a lot of people saying the games optimization is good andbitbia but it could be a lot better i can play games that looks much much better then this one at higher fps i have a 144hz monitor and it does feel a little crappy when the game dips closer to 90fps at times it usually only goes low on the map iron work but most maps are okay definitely could be optimized a bit more mr fruit played this before and ive been playing it since glad you did a video on it too it looks great but i only have ps4 the resource take over mode would be awesome if they had separate maps for them the standard map rotation maps are too small i think they need to reduce the player count per team or increase the death timer a little bit longer i played that game couple weeks ago and i really liked it but i had to create 3 diffrent accounts because of bans i just played the game and got baned for nothing 3 times ill check it out again but i dont want to get baned again xd it is a very good and it got a lot of potential if it goes to steam but if youre from asia like me i would say dont bother playing it because they dont have asian server and you have to play on north america europe server with 200300 ping which is not fun its literally cod roblox phantom forces is so much better though iove this game this is what cod should be bring it to consoles and call it the cod killer looks like a generic cod clone no steam no download i love this game ive fallen out of love with call of duty so when i want a faster pace than battlefield or the military sims i play i hop on ironsight the only thing id maybe tweak is the ttk it feels a bit to high but all in all 810 planetside 2 is also a great free fps oh boy another fun game on pc i thought it was warface lol alright you got me hooked lets try this xd btw may i recommend another f2p fps that you may like trying get your hands on blacklight retribution available on steam more scifi lot of customisation nice skillcap good feelings i would really like to see you play this one and i think you would like it play heroes and generals i love dirty bomb can you check that game out remember fellas this is freetoplay non realistic recoil pattern i guess run and gun wins the game strafing and sprinting look way too fast for me its even faster than bf3 there is no mouse accel there is automatic sensitivity scaling based on your zoom level holy shit the gunplay looks good have you heard of contract wars id prefer warface over this just my opinion freaks me out when i hear near future and 2025 ironsight and heroes generals are the go to f2p shooters for me the only downside in this game is totally trash netcode annnd its time to bring ghost recon phantoms back jackfrags try markc mouse fix i have no issues if a game has no raw mouse input markc makes sure you windows sens accelerated or not is 1to1 so what will fix most of the issues does this need a good pc or can i run it on a shitty one please tell me this is avalible on console cod fookin sucks so this fookin sucks thank god for mw2 remaster is this available on ps4 too ill have to disagree with you here jackfrags i tried the game for myself and the movement system is jaggy sometimes i get shot from people facing away from me and this is a massive flaw for a competitive shooter youll need to be able to tell if the enemy is looking at you or not if thats not given the rest can be as great as it wants im not going to play it it also seems to have some issue with input latency when i click to shoot or scope it is delayed by a tiny but noticeable amount of course i havent done any testing on that one but perhaps one should all in all it isnt worthwhile beta or not poor mans cod pretty much oh these enemies its just cod ghosts this game looks like a warframe ripoff cod clone that wanted to be original not the first time i see this game looked very similar to bo2 and the map he plays on is similar to plaza and that isnt a critical for a f2p game i loved bo2s multiplayer and i love this too great game sticking to basics but having decent customisation and class option and most important of all its boots on the ground graphics and gameplay looks so outdated but then the bullets do no damage over something like 10 meters which is pretty close for me in other games so strange for me a mix of battlefield and cod pubg vs fortnite rap battle when been playing for a month now havent spent a dime and still had a great time if this supports controller im down i saw this game elsewhere earlier and was wondering what it was thankyou jack dirty bomb game is called ironsight uses holo sight dirty bomb when is the game coming on steam is there a particular date when q3 or q4 is anyone seen the video where that idiot shroud trashes this game because he thought there was mouse accel even though there wasnt better than star citizen also a little gimmick in this game is that the maps have some interactive parts on it imagine an early and limited version of bf destruction on one map and some cranes lifts and stuff like that on other maps where you can activate them yourself with a button love the game fix the movement lag reduceremove killstreaks from competitive and you have a serious contender for the esports market verdun was great back when it was inbrowser only warface is better jackfrags playing search and destroy sooo weiiird xd i think they can improve blacklight retribution still going that shit was great reminds me of call of duty prefuturism how are the snipers wish i could run this did they remove the mouse accel try combat arms are there lmgs in the game ironsight vs ww3 vs bf v ffa mode has been started this game reminds me of bo2 and its set in 2025 he sounds like connor from detroit becomes human my ping is at least 200 from nz looks like a straight up copy of warface ironsightblack squad bs is utter garbage classic shooters cod4 wtf that aint no classic probably worth checking out whens it on steam i tried a couple of matches but it was unplayable because of some major lag and invisibleteleporting enemies 2025 damn i guess this is the future of the beta worldline unturned best this feels like an ad this looks sick like a cs and cod had a child did you have a chance to try line of sight from steam i agree with everything said i only dislike the scorestreak since now everyone will get them in cod you have to get scorestreak by being good and getting kills without dead there they charge passively its lame since in late game everyone has a scorestreak all it takes is a little respect to make a game great watch out jack its an open beta and you can preorder the game the final release will be p2p please dont keep mentioning fortnite will this come out on console could someone explain to me why you want to play this game instead of cod bo2 and i am not talking about the price of a game when is it gonna officially release looks like a cod cloneand its free which is what im willing to pay for cod any morebut for real that map looks way like one from bo3 jack can you make video about totally accurate battlegrounds warface is this game controler compatible play battle field 5 good thing console plebs cant play this masterpiece game they dont deserve it and are holding gaming back semi serious looks more fun than cod i cant wait to play world war 3 gave it a try and first experience was some guy on my team thanking jackfrags for bringing in a bunch of new players still pretty fun though i would love this to come to console jack you should play dirty bomb its pretty good i have almost 200hrs its free to play how good can it be its free to play how fun can it be its free to play how fun can it be still waiting for another rising storm vietnam video i just hope they dont add jetpacks theres always that one person that comments ortnite is tahe bset fsp game evrae the game is good but they need more servers i always get over 200 ping i tried to install this game 4 times by now and its got corrupted game files every time looks like a well rounded game the map reminds me of plaza is this game on playstation looks pretty good but i thing the player is moving too fast this game is very cool been playing this for a while now totally addictive more maps its back up is this on console damn it looks really good its basically the cod game we all want but were not getting you broke the game jack now everyone cant play legit thought this was warface fortnite is a f2p fps game the title suggests its shit my life is a lie if only they have asian servers i had uninstalled the game months ago because the netcode is infuriating to play on i cannot stand being killed behind cover or around corners i was in the close beta and fuck i loved it sadly no aussie servers so wasnt too great for me haha but holy hell it played like a dream ooouuu i like the new outro this game was actually made in korea but it was closed in korea because it had really small player base its like hardpoint how da hell do i even download the game i want to play this gotta love that fam ass is this bo2 v2 just telling shooting is really good in blacklight retribution i go to install it and the website doesnt load resembles the best cod bo2 the last cod i played before myy switch to bf seems like the site is down atm so i cant even download it i want battlefield play4free back cant even download it because the browser is all messed up would be great if their website wasnt broken right now if you show your r fps you can see your ms next to it hmm what about blacksquad tho i get a really deep modern warfare 2 before it lost its direction and that is a damn good feeling im gonna see if i can potato this game on my rigwish me luck d please give us asia servers warface is better in my opinion this is what bo4 shouldve been like i love that you find these gems this game is alright but there are no servers for nzaus so i get horrible lag pretty unplayable for me we all know why we are here we broke af ii want this game cant access their website to dl the game s i went to the website and its glitched showing no game i wanted to download and try it but the website is glitched someone go to the site and tell me if your experiencing the same glitch tried to download but website doesnt work it looks all messed up and wont load im guessing there is an overload on there websitesorry for all caps i typed this then i saw it was caps and am too lazy to retype websites down boys i am banned from the website cool idk how but its cool link for the game plz what is the minimum requirement to play the game my pc isnt that good pc only this sounds so much like mag that its crazy now all they need to do is add all those super large game modes on some big maps and ill spend over 1000 to support it no questions asked fantastic jack you killed the servers my duuude ahaha is this game only available in europe jack how about a link to the download you broke the game u fucko graphics look much better than cs go i kind of hate this game getting traction on youtube i enjoy slaughtering everyone i dont need good players coming on from youtube lol btw if you want to know how to succeed in ironsight i have one word hipfire what about planetside 2 i like how this game has a really deep and very true story about recourse wars in the future but people are just like wow i like shooting guns and are not even really paying attention to the story looks like they pasted the bf ui onto cod with cs graphics what platform is this on i really want to like this game but all the weapons feel incredibly similar why does the famas shoot at almost the same rate as the other ars for example really kills my motivation to unlock and level different guns good thing the website doesnt work for me ugh this is something id actually like to play i wish i had a pc to play this oh my god i have seen this video 3 years ago the game is incredible ive been playing it for ages now but the thing is its full of noobs who make me ragequit just like almost every free game out there que the lawsuit from cod devs its boring as shit there are like 5 maps and 4 gamemodes unknown error occurred please try again later only on pc say my pc is not a potato or mediocre but somewhere in between will this run if so on what settings im primarily a consol player and am just now getting into pc i gotta say if in a couple years this is polished up and put on consoles id probably pay for it a free to play cod clone with crappy netcode ill pass u should try warface could you use a controller on this game this game looks fucking sick this game is shit lol try warface its also free how to download it 210 not enough powerful trans women of color represented who make up the majority of the fps market and the actual military jackfrags ironsight is amazing i started playing and had the mw2 feeling after a few seconds but can i use a controller i have played it for the past few days and i could never get my gun to shoot quite like yours wtf why cant console get a decent fps ea should make bf4 and bf3 free honestly this game really caught my eye but im not going to be getting it unfortunately ive been looking into doing more pc gaming and this seemed to be a good game to add to my collection when i went to download this game i seemed to be redirected to a seemingly fake website to download it a very very convincing fake if i do say so i wasnt very sure of this website so i immediately closed the site and checked my antivirus and voila i had a trojan on my computer after looking through comments on other ironsight videos i saw that many other people had encountered this trojan problem one user even went on to say that this game was a very very elaborate trojan a good game but im not very sure as to whether i want to risk having a trojan on my computer to cure my boredom the website sucks top 5 best free fps games 2018 battle carnival skill special force 2 phantomers ironsight warface is paytowin f2p died off a little bit because many publishers rushed out shitty cashgrabs with terrible monetization schemes it was a mix of not understanding the f2p market and not taking it seriously now that enough time has passed the survival of games such as warframe and dota has established a standard of how to treat these games i always have 70 or higher ping in only this game why but still the problem is my poor pc cant handle this baby too i played a few days after release beta it was interesting for a bit but it got dull after a while i uninstalled a few weeks after i might pick it back up again though only game im looking forward to be on ps4 you should try totally accurate battlegrounds haha its so weird the only problem with this game is the net code other than that its great kinda random question but do you have to have a pretty nice pc to play this game well i am having lot of trouble with this game like i cant download it from anywhere help pls i think you crashed their website lol its down cuz too many connections they need stronger servers cant even create account right now because of too many connections did you forget the og armies proving grounds what system again pc is a nonstarter for me no thanks best free to play game fps i have a lot of fun with this game but there is times where it just feels inconsistent hip fire op this game looks solid i hope it comes to steam in the future jackfrags giving underrated games the fame they deserve this is dank gets repetitive after a while not gonna lie the game is pretty good for a free to play i honestly had low expectations but what can i say the game is great i have this game its like the best game ever literally just cod but free this is what happens when bo2 and bf4 make a baby soon as you said its a pc game youve lost my interest im a ps4 dammm its good an impressive free in browser first person shooter is rush team i first clicked on it as a joke st school but eventually i actually started playing it sometimes at school when im really bored pretends to play cod but calls a game mode in cod headquarters this game looks awesome and im very excited to this company brings this game to the xbox platform jack bring more gameplay from this game in the near future looks like a better and snappier warface i love hearing your perspective on games before i try them out jacks stamp of approval untill chinese hackers flood jack glad to see your thoughts on this game i personally love it and agree with all your points i would say it is aa and closeonitsway to aaa as long as they keep improving it is not my main game right now but it very easily could become so thanks for your thoughts and respect your viewpoint thought this video was going to be about roblox phantom forces the best free fps jackfrags i think i have what it takes to go against you in a sniper match on bf4 lol ive been practicing 1v1 me on flood zone irl the latency feels a little off and the sniper is pretty much a long range shotgun but overall this game is probably the best cod style f2p shooter out right now no battle royal what a shame nah im joking screw br this is bo2 new generation hey jack dont know if youve got a set in stone playlist for this free to play games binge your currently doing but why not give planetside 2 a revisit jack id like to see a ping on the school board frags wait this isnt roblox phantom forces or cbro jack says why he likes itgot 1000 kills in a game play totally accurate battlegrounds just came out made by the same people that made totally accurate battle simulator you forgot that the famas m4 acc and p90 are some of the only good weapons and that the devs are weebs well this is basically call of duty but k den unfortunately no australian servers yet again were left out it plays and looks like cod id prefer this to had taken over than fortnite i wish this were on ps4 inb4 lol casul console skrub i used to play blacklightretribution on ps4 before i finally had enough cash to buy battlefield 4 ever since i have deleted blr and i havent played it since and with fortnite being the most popular f2p i doubt the playercount will be quite low dirty bomb dirty bomb is pretty good does this game have oce players and servers if so im getting it this looks really good might be nice to have some classic cod gameplay again meh dirty bomb for me is the best f2p fps game you meant hardpoint when you said the secure game mode is like cod ww2s headquarters will this be on ps4 lol been playing this alot the past month funny to see a vid up by you hell yeah iv been playing this game for about a month now and its really fun there is a lot to unlock and do and its so fun if u havent check it out planetside 2 is still good how about console can you download on xbox jack will it have battlefield game mode is this game clash of clans wish it would let me download everytime i try it doesnt let me no need to buy cod this year blacksquad is shit one of the maps looks exactly like the club map in bo2 what about unreal tournament and dirty bomb i feel like this has the potential to be a hugely popular game dont screw it up devs yeah within seconds that reminded me of cod4 mw then again its the same engine across all cods iw engine where the only thing changing is the version number bhwhaha every time i try to install this it always gives me a error i would try this game but theres no oceanic servers unfortunately on ps4 the netcode makes ironsight unplayable but the weapons are so fooking expensive what about warface playing in australia with only europe american servers sucks but still a great game wow gj jack you popularized the game so damn much their website crashed cuz too many damn people are on it xdd on the brink of excellence looks like call of duty with counter strike graphics ill pass somebody should just make a game like insurgency free to play jack is a god at every game check out dirty bomb jack super solid game thats f2p really high learning curve but has really solid gunplay and movement the devs are kind of a pain atm but theyre sort of coming around d hey jackfrags i think you just broke their site 180k in 8 hours lets say 100k went to their site thats 12500 a hour and 208 a minute a good testament of how big your fanbase really is like i said before you are my idol keep up the great work gg looks cool but its free and the majority of free fps games are overrun with cheaters or nothing but high ping playerspass lol soo f2p cod your a bit late i was rockin this shit a while ago its basically a blatant shameless rip off of cod yet its actually done well however we will see if what the fans of cod say holds true i wouldnt care about the futuristic shit if where under a different ip welp here it is ladies and gents you got ironsights put up or shut up did jack just kill their servers that box he stands near at the start is the same boxcrate in r6 tried it out and feels like the european version of call of duty online needs oceania servers its a cod knock off ill pass this looks exactly like a call of duty good job you killed it now nobody gets to play drop shot hip fire heaven nope no thanks looks like it takes a whole mag to kill someone i think you sent so many people that youre crashing their website lol tfw u try to download the game and there site goes down due to too much traffic id like to see you give your 2 cents on insurgency sandstrom contract wars is a good free fps game on kongregate what was that game and of course site got a hug of death thanks jack p hey jack you ever try a game called blacklight retribution i remember having a heck of a good time playing that apparently back in the beta days i assume because i somehow have beta items unfortunately i can no longer run the game i really hope this game takes off we really need a solid match based casual shooter like this but it doesnt have asia server thats why i stopped playing i tried this a few months back it couldnt hold my interest people compare it to older cod games but its not it looks similar but plays nothing like it wow their site is overwhelmed well done jack p hope it releases on ps4 the map looks a bit like plaza from bo2 i think this vid made their site crash lmao welp looks like im playing this over battlefield vagina for consoles too ive played ironsight in closed beta and my experience is quite nicethe community is awesome the progression system in guns are good and there are tons of players who are friendly too this game looks dope it cods better than cod xd what i hate tho is that nades are only daily oh wow like a classic cod so its cod there wasnt a single person using ironsights in the clip when a f2p cod clone game looks 10x better than current cod downloading it meow dont tell me roblox doesnt have good quality fps games ugh quickscopers nothanks ill pass its a boring game jack this game have something same to warface this is what i wanted call of duty to be like this year there is an option to add your own personal ping in the toplefthand corner i would like to see dice make battlefield heros 2 as a free to play game when i saw the gameplay it reminded me of cod bo2 then you mentioned 2025 then i was like yep bo2 but its not ill try this game out though i like free to play games imma download it later dirty bomb exists and thats a quality ftp shooter too codish for my taste ill pass as a fan of cod i tried this game but i really couldnt get into it the map design is dire theres no sprint cancel when reloading and regardless of graphics settings theres an input latency i couldnt get rid of it just doesnt feel quite ready need oceania servers dirty bomb is and has been the best for the last 2 years roblox phantom forces next plz wish there were oce servers kinda unplayable otherwise is that 4 ps4 to looks a lot like cod but in a good way it feels kinda nostalgic fuck why cant this be the new call of duty looks like cod back when cod was good well here comes a massive playerbase influx its called iron sights why do you have holographic sights v i hate the game didnt like it play americas army providing grounds no micro transactions i know of you should give dirty bomb another go a lot has changed since you frist playedit and it would fit perfectly in this series since its a f2p competitive shooter man this looks fun i think this looks like a good game in the end i find that free to plays come down to the grind to reward ratio if they find the right balance then any type of ftp can survive i wish this was on ps4 too i wouldnt call it competitive given theres trade kills competitive games have clear winners and losers a better call of duty the battlefield community hates cod and this game looks and plays very similar to it yet people are loving this game and being very positive about it psychological issues with cod planetside 2 is pretty good but its an mmo and there arent many players left whats the name of it according to battlenonsense this game has the lowest lag if it comes to consoleit will wreck everything this game honestly looks a lot more playable than cod thats no joke this is cod again link the games in the discription for next vids like this please its crazy because i just downloaded this game last night haha it is actually pretty good been having a lot of fun on it this is what cod fans wish their game was like is that cod is it me or does look a bit generic what sets this game apart this is warface 20 jack i do not want ea or any aaa studios to make f2p shooters it will be me a good thing for consumers or gamers the video felt somewhat like a commercial no hate just feels like it for me warface is better can you shut off mouse acceleration before you couldnt this honestly just like a slightly modified version of bo2 will this be available on consoles yooo this is my game welcome pc only overwatch had custom celebrations and animation well before fortnite nothing is really groundbreaking about fortnite the map cod adavance warfare i really enjoy playing this game but as you said being killed behind cover multiple tiems is pretty ennoying although the amount of hits that you sometimes need to kill an ennemy from a far distance with an assault rifle for example is so much frustrating but lets go along this game has so much potential can you use a controller on it im terrible with mouse and keyboard i saw mr fruit play this about a month ago its a really good game do you know what youve done jack gl ironsight servers its not shit but its not good enough to want to play for years to come short term mindless fun longterm fuck that sounds cool you should play dirty bomb you making this video is gonna prolly attract more players to this game finally lol im constantly matched with the same people over and over thanks jack made me wanna try it you should try out dirty bomb a critically underrated f2p fps this game was so broken when i played well i tried it when charlie made a video of it and it was a bunch of shyte full of hackers and you get into 110 of the matches you try to join this game is fun for a quick fix of fast paced killing but lacks the depth that allows you to get hooked too it all in all a pretty good free to play game is the mouse acceleration still there this game has strong cod similarities if the game gets ported to consoles it is going to bloom even more for ps4 it looks like a simpler bf3 or bf4 only reason id consider it is because its free if youre gonna make a clone it better be free i am surpriced its not a battle royal game this time free to play games is the wave lets get it play rush team its decent but on multiple occasions i had the problem that i couldnt move anymore if that gets fixed it can be a good game blacklight retribution is amazing is it on xbox it shouldnt be a concern but people killing each other and dying for a company greedy for recources seems kind ofunrealistic no now the plebs will come to the game reminds me of blops2look and feel entire introduction segment its just a better version of cod is it on ps4 i tried to download it but the downloader keeps crashing when i start it up looks like im not playing it warframe laughing in the background a free to play game looks way better than call of duty nice work cod ive seen this game before really thought its so cod i never touched it but i did land on warface which for me placed itself in a really good position between cod and fun military warfare none of those killstreak bonuses apart from bragging rights lots of cool modes and personally i havent spotted much of paying advantages to it apart from customization options jack if youve tried warface how does it compares to this i only know one good free to play shooter and that is warface this is so weird to see since i just downloaded the game about 2 weeks ago the game is really good but my god the net code needs work i have died a countless time around a corner and you can trade 1 for 1 in a gun fight a lot other than that the game is pretty solid and has some really fun gameplay scar op btw no disclaimers at the start lol ion sight just downloaded this game yesterday its so much fun i find this game to be terrible the maps look like they were ripped from various cod games basically a cod copycat like if u agree looks like a copy of cod from like 8 years ago which is good since they have screwed it up this is how i imagined bo4 just play phantom forces oh rats im on console only looks really nice reminds me of mw2 those were the golden days i think if it was nicer looking with some better graphics then itd feel like its from aaa company but right now it doesnt nothing to hate about it though seems like a great game with a limited budget and if it comes to steam ill definitely try it so its free cod how is the progression is it safe to download try planetside 2 its not performing as good as this game but its worth a try also freetoplay yessss ive been waiting for you to make a vid on this its like the cod we hoped we would get after bo2 but never got except its not a cod im downloading this for sure hey jackfrags gonna cut to the chase i stream ironsight over on twitch today my chat started telling me you had made an ironsight vid my viewers went up too lol so naturally i came to check it out after the stream was over i can only thank you for bringing more people to the game with your massive reach great in depth structured and informative video you really like this game jack literallywarface the ttk is random played it a few months ago something just isnt right yeah jf what the same wee thinking started the download ye watched fabianchills play this what about tabg i would play this game so much more if it didnt have stupid amount of aim punch what bo4 should look like bo2 add future boiiii ii ii 2x ii half ii and half 05 ii 25 boii5 boiiboii5boiii the game is actually made to replicate the feeling cod but improving its many flaws while being f2p reminds me of cod you can also purchase weapons forever with ingame currency you have to repair them so its basically chinesecod but more like bo2 with a few extras nice do a video on warthunder new game called world war 3 anyone ea and anything free aaahahhahaahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahaha i cant breathe this game is actually amazing for a f2p title however like many other f2p models it suffers from a lack of a good anti cheat although with that said the best game thats even close to this is counter strike and we all know about vacs anti cheat highly suggest people looking this one up though as it really is quite the title for something that is free genuinely enjoyed the time i had on this game i wish it was on console jack can u please make a heroes and generals video d try dirty bomb looks very similar to battlefield 4 jack you should play dirty bomb this game is so good that i couldnt play anything else single player in parallel so i made myself uninstall it yeah im confused with my actions as well got a certain proving grounds look about it this is call of duty online but worldwide i just saw a vid on this a little while ago i thought it was pretty cool 2025 nuketown 2025 bo2 this similiar detailsokay this game is amazing 1010 ign finally a game i could play with my broke ass friends looks nice hopefully they will eventually have it on consoles i was severly bummed out to find out that the default sniper rifle had to be extended roblox phantom forces is there a fov slider tabg is a cool new game but very buggy what do you think about dirtybomb its also a free fps game in beta but itll be 10 in a few weeks a nice game to take a peak at if u ask me ps jack already made a video of it a few years ago when it was trash it really changed a lot in a good way imo what does raw input mean yes it looks like cod but its free and actually plays well ive played this game for about an hour and i got to say its a great game if you miss the modern warfare games play it the best way i can describe this game is a less chinese cod online without call if duty assets its really fun too whenif they get this game on steam i can really see them growing quite a large player count im excited to see what this game holds in the future anyone know if theres any game modes without killstreaks gives me a cod vibe the good cods were all just pawns paying micro transactions in this free to play game of life might be a cod ripoff thats better than cod try blacksquad its f2p and its on steam and i recommend it after a couple months of playing this im surprised i havent seen a single hacker either they have some good protection or the game just isnt popular enough just looks like a generic fps nothing special what cod shouldve been makes me remember uberstrike i miss that game fast and smooth gunplay all you need try dirtybomb anyone remember battlefield play4free looks pretty decent might try it blacksquad is shit and full of hackers and in game transactions dont play it pls can you please make a video on the graphics options of video games such as vsync and stuff like that shroud said it sucked another brilliant video about a new game gj jack and what you think about warrock amazing game just servers swarmed with laggy south americans so same ol same ol for a battlefield player in na americas army is pretty good try this game called contract wars if they port this to ps4 and xbox and include crossplay my life will be complete cod but with amazing hit detection im in if they fix the issue of getting killed as soon as your behind cover then this game will be even better than it is rn does is still have the tcpip based netcode now i feel very interested yet frustrated this game seems to be solid my setup is surely not the ttk seams long this game is not that good the ttk is what really bugs me line of sight is better i think its like bo2 one of my more or less older favorites which is okey ill give it a try sounds like combat arms thnx im going to play it jack what about dirtybomb feels like cod4 or cod6 bullet force is awesome free to play phone game fun and the freeium level is allmost non existing cant download this game net framework 35 cant install on windows 10 i guess give me something on steam where can i get this game thie is essentially just a cod bo2 clone looks like it and feels like it its just not as polished this should come to consoles this is gonna blow up and be the next shooter in the community id like to see this on console yaaay jack is covering this too i think we all know dirty bomb is the best free to play fps game ive been playing this for a couple months really good game but it feels like the netcode has gotten worse each update dirty bomb is another quality free fps i thought this would be some korean game but its actually developed by an german studio in hamburg lol edit its just published in germany if devs can make something that looks this good for no cost to customerswhy the fuck does it cost over 100 for cod that is completely fucked from launch well its prety good is this on constol whats the game called and where do i download it do a video on dirty bomb it hits 10 in a month this looks a lot like cod does it really play like cod if it does ill probably like it phantom forces is still the shit my main issue is that the ttk is way too high makes it impossible to engage 2 or more enemies at the same time is this available for ps4 free to play games are taking over the market as of now another game you might want to look into is one called alliance of valiant arms its alot like csgo in ways and its a really fun game and yes its free to play lol i appreciate that you covered this game it has so much potential to become a big pc title and i hope it does this game is pretty insane it also runs well on lower spec pcs hope this free to play style can be continued by the bigger developers ghost recon phantoms is a really fun free fps little older released in 2014 has some unique mechanics as well i wish this game wont end up downhill its amazing and we need this in consoles too switch for example i have been playing ironsight a good while now this reminds me of combat arms this is like bo2 fusion danced with cod4 sounds like a straight bo2 ripoff what are the minimum system requirements for this game quake champions is the best free fps shooter this needs to come to steam cod clone oh god aeria games thats a bit up and down crossing my fingers thisll end up good tho xd i played this for a little while and loved it if this ends up making its way to console ill be all over it wait i think i remember this game i cant really remember that name but i loved it so much heroes and generals is good and free this coming to xbox more of those videos who cars about a cod clone have been playing this game almost daily since february currently its my favorite fps game a free fps that is actually good project reality how many different guns are there how many different maps sooo are bought weapons permanent or not i dont like that buy for few days system at first youll have fun but after a while youll notice its huge flaws i got little birdy legs birdy legs birdy legs birdy legs phantom forces so you can turn off mouse acceleration or not the playerbase on pc is already good plz put the game on console too only problem i have with this game is the netcode what oss is there a lan option this game will destroy bo4 game looks terrible wait its not developed by any stupid aaa company or valve gets the game if only the netcode wasnt ass the major problem with this game is its netcode its highly variable normal people ironsight jack ihonsight you should check out dirty bomb again greatest f2p game in my opinion its team based and objective based this game has a huge netcode problem 10x worse than pubg the dsync makes it unplayable but if they fixed it which i doubt will happen then it could be a very good game so its cod advanced warfare done correctly they need to fix the goddamn netcode in this game you get prefired around corners constatly and you get no reaction time at all otherwise its pretty fun another solid free to play fps is dirty bomb you should check it out if you havent yet cod online for us cod bo2 is my favourite of them all so far ironsight does cod better than cod does cod the game is nice but the map design is horrendous in some of the maps you literally shoot with the enemies from 2 meters this is the biggest turn off in this game for me looks a lot like warface what monitor do you use jackfrags skill fps is good as well bf1 is free to play in trial mode im using my 4th trial account tbh seems good gonna give it a go you should try tactical intervention im sure you would love it maps remind me of bo2 now there are atleadt one good fps game ff a good moba game ff a good survival game ff a good rpg ff now well just wait for a good battle royale ff to come out ironsight was fun but too easy and matchmaking is quite broken you get matched as a lvl 20 against lvl 300400 nontheless very fun just too easy for me if i had to pick a good free to play fps game i would warface srly great game ill try it out i must be the only one who thinks this is no different to cod ive played the game but it just feels like cod to me looks better than bo4 lol its more like bo2 than cod 4 does this have any chance coming to console will this run on my pc here are my specs processorintel core 2 duo e8400 gpuintel q33 chipset gma 3100 ram2gb i wish this game would come to console even if they charged us for it though i guess i can only hope looks promising to me great game shit servers and net code jackfrags is there a battlefield like game for mobile with vehicles and 16 vs 16 large map i guess asking questions is a form of hostility just by looking at the comments this looks better than star wars battlefront 2 pc only the game is good but the client and everything sucks ive been looking for something new to play and do videos on thanks for this when yourre trying to find a game w worse netcode than bf4 ive been playing every day for weeks now and its a ton of fun still some netcode issues but its playable enough what i really like are the killstreaks most of them are not player controlled and the ones that are are much harder to get and most of the time you wont even see the higher ones in matches only now and then there will be 1 at the end of the round so the killstreaks alone dont determine what team will win based on who gets them first more bf3 live commentary please we would really like to see that again 3 love ya bro looks a lot like the crytek game warface dirty bomb phantom forces insurgency is 15 and is pretty good also will it be available for consoles killstreak is stupid in this game killstreak should be a rewarded for your skill not saving points to buy them like little boy saving for a toy gun i tried this game but i just cant get into the frantic addfueled tiny maps and ridiculously fast pace i like more nuance to weapon handling too such as with battlefield after playing warface for 5 years ironsight feels like heaven there is no damage delay teleports or similiar netcode problems as in warface its a cod clone with a splash of csgo lol what is the best fbs gane on mobile i was very sceptical at first but this is actually very enjoyable especially for a f2p game so its a cod ripoff can you still not turn off mouse acceleration in this game gunfeel is terrible imo jack you forgot about planetside 2 thats a good f2p game looks like cod and r6 mixed together not complaining is cod going to sue this game just like pubg did on fortnite guess not pubg is just being a dick lol i dont play this game very often because of overpowered smgs and campers its good but it could be better it also has controller like aim assist so fuck ironsight lol it says cloud9 on the top left in the gameplay i admire you still reviewing ftp games barely anyone still does but it usually ends up with me having a fun game to play with a few friends without having to play so serious but wheres the zombie mode except for the netcode and kill trading actually good btw how are you not playing or talking about planetside 2 ive played this and my opinion is better than cod i cant find it on ps4 have fun with those laggy backtracking asians its a fun game but playing this here in asia 250ms all the way ugh i wish i had a pc my only real problem with ironsight is that the netcode can be pretty wonky sometimes other than that its a lot of fun also the mp7 in this game is one of the best iterations of that gun ive ever used in an fps theres a ping option in the settings and it displays on your screen up in the corner even betta this game has kill streaks and plays like cod has no big wanking maps like bf must be better than battlefield first 10 seconds seeing this video paused it started downloading its a free call of duty wow lool tbh looks better then cod the animation looks very fluid watch out guys incoming law suit from activation lots of this game is so like cod really like the game runs smooth and feels comfortable thats a pure cod clone lol as soon as you said cheap scope i wont be downloading it i love this game 3 looks like the lithtech engine iron sight uses a holographic sight makes sense the overuse of stuck in is annoying this is looking really fluid many free to play fps games feel kinda choppy which often comes down to lackluster animation work but this seems nicely polished im gonna give it a go and see how i like it wow it looks fast im not sure my ageing eyes and arthritic hands would be able to compete lol do many people play this i might try it wouldve never known this game existed until you introduced it thanks gonna try it out its a pretty fun game even noobs can grab all the support options and be helpful looks so much like warface is it on ps4 because i cant find it on the store what about blacksquad like ive said many times you put this game on consoles it would be so damn popular and would challenge cod finally another studio gives their own take on the cod formula its open for the take and another studio can blow it away just put stuff like this on console i really like this game and its in rotation with me and my gamer freinds its got a lot of polish for a custom engine free to play game kinda late to the game dont you think hey isnt this the 60 game kids play these days whats it called uhhcall of duty game is very solid but the only thing that bothers me is the tickrate which you mentioned in the video weird to see the famas do full auto in a game jack i remember your dota 2 recording 6 years ago pleaseone more video on dota 2 looks like good classic call of duty the only problem is netcode looks badass i cant wait to play it just need to transplant jacks godlike abilities to really get the most out of this game jack please cover dauntless its in open beta its like a pc monster hunter with mmo aspects god i wish theyd put this on console itd do so well and itd be really fun what about fps game blacksquad both blacksquad and ironsight made by korean company failed to succeed in korea but blacksquad was much more popular than ironsight in korea why dont you play blacksquad i just download it 5 hours ago lol if this came to console id totally play it even though im not much of a cod fan anymore but this seems like a mw2 or mw3 which were the last cod games i enjoyed no ones gonna play this how boring ironsight the game in which you never use the ironsight of the weapon theres a setting that shows your ping and fps on the corner of your screen you guys can check it out if interested also the game is very well optimized runs so smooth on my potato laptop they should rename this game to no recoil im fine with the game have fun with it just dont call it competitive so blacklight retribution but the devs actually care this might actually turn out good once it releases will it release on ps4 this reminds me of one of the blops 2 maps i forget the name the gun sound sounds like its coming from a popcorn machine wait this isnt fortnite this is like the perfect game for me damn i need a gaming pc maybe someone here can help ive been trying to install it for the past 2 months and failed whenever i open exe installer it closes with a stopped working window what do i do help the other players names linke schamlippe left pussy lip and crystaldildo nice vid by the way ironsight a freetoplay cod advanced warfare ripoff that does more justice to the franchise than any game of the past 5 years ironsight devs can make a better cod game than actual cod devs on the market i cant even install this just doesnt let me install this game has been open beta for one year in korea but it s pretty funny to open beta again looks like a cod bo2 ripoff still good tho you should try out dirty bomb hello jack i am so addicted to this game i left pubg and fortnite for it the devs confirmed that the game has no mouse acceleration and i think the game will be on steam in its launch the only issue there is the netcode soo problematic can u give me the link plz ive been playing it for a bit now and it could become a cod killer if the company updates it and make it great just like what epic games did looks like a spot on cod clone perfect im getting a new gaming pc tomorrow and i dont have so many games so this can be one of them i test d pc only game has anyone heard of heroes and generals no battle royale mode itll be dead in 2 weeks after release test modern combat 5 warface is also good specs to run this he should totally try phantom forces ekks dee i just came back to play this game and you do a video illuminati confirmed ironic how i had a fortnite add before this d this is cod without airstikes every 5 seconds you should play warframe looks very nices how can we play on xb1 looks like all weapons have same rpm sound jack finally doing a video on one of the greatest recent fpss out there free or aaa good on ya mate or something seriously this is awesome oh ironsight i love this game i already knew the game on the first second in the video yeeeeees good we need more players first map similar to terminal from mw 2nd map similar to plaza from bo2 3rd map similar to euh who cares it looks cool no raw thats a deal breaker did you get a free account or did you get a press account warning i played this for 3 days the snipers are extremely easy to use and completely op im also sick of the limited maps just from those few days of play things that might make you consider playing trash netcode relatively grindy to get weapons i played and found the game has mouse acceleration and you cant turn it off along with no smoothing its horrible in my opinion so this is a good free to play game how about taking a look at warframe ive always had this question for smaller sized maps do we really need minimaps i get that new player might need them but if you consider how distracting they can be once you get used to the maps am i the only one who thinks this way after the last few videos there is no doubt that jack is a dice man lol gg jack and gg dice for scratching each others backs id be no different blacklightretribution is good aswell from my experience the odd mouse movement is due to high drops in fps dunno tho i dont experience it often you and your friends need to try totally accurate battlegrounds it would be hilarious to watch try warframe its pve but i think that is one of the best ftp is battlefield 1 worth buying today holy crap the map at 1 min in is a blatant copy of an cod advanced warfare map the na servers workwhen i tried it i had to play on eu servers can you just fucking tell me the games name ffs i hate to be that guy but the fact the game is published by aeria games is a pretty hard pull to swallow for me they arent exactly the best publishers from what i remember back in the day yessss jack playing ironsight my life is made 3 thanks for this looks good try heroes and generals it is a nice game but it doesnt have any servers in brazil so i usually gets 140ms of ping its terrible i played for 1 day then i uninstalled when it have a brazillian server ill give it another shot check game dirtybomb looks like call of duty lol hows the performance most of have clean graphics and and dont look so demanding but still run shit at lowend pcs this game has huge netcode issues i have atleast 1 tradekill a match and the matches are not even that long like 10 mins the game feels good but there are a lot of issues that they need to fix before i pick it up again is for ps4 too this looks really good pretty wild what a company can do when they actually give a shit about their game and players cough pubg cough it seems so cool is it also coming for console looks too easy and lame i have skills so ill stick to fortnite thank you very much it is much better than all other fps f2p games but still i dont like it as much as my aaa games i love it but i deleted it cos there were no damn oce servers it was failed at korea f2p fps game and server shutdown few months ago like blacksquad or warface does its a blackops 2 clone and thats a good thing its just cod though have been playing this for a few months now and im really enjoying it well there is an fps that is free and quite good its on roblox tho but its called phantom forces its really good tbh have you tried out warface im surprised a free to play game is using real life weapons at least thats what it seems what about dirty bomb thats a good free to play fps this looks better than cod lmao ironsight is a very poor fps game the movement is dogshit and the guns are horribly balanced good except i keep getting disconnected afk all the time the devs know of the issue but arent working on it so until then screw this game i love this series jack good job mate i swear ive seen this mobile game before the guns all sound the same everything else looks pretty cool tho this looks pretty nice consider me intrigued thought it would be roblox codface this is like cod with not the futuristic shit what about blacklight retribution well okay i havent played it in years but i remember it being pretty good in terms of free games try battle carnival its like a f2p cod i hate cod but i love iron sight i liked this so cant be on console finally you played this been loving this game for months now good game until you realize it takes 3 headshots to kill someone i really want a pc waiting for it to release to steam when it is coming to consoles feel like everyone should play this instead of the new cod the game is very much more like bo2 than cod4 is it available for asia this actually looks fun who knows it already from fabianchills based on the not sluggish staged reloads its better than cod this looks really good im definitely going to check it out little bit late jacklevelcap was talking about this game few months ago its really goodkind of cheap cod i like this game the best cod ive played in years remember when everybody was playing dirty bomb wonder what happened to that game its just for us hey jackfrags thanks for trying the game out were glad youre enjoying it so far and thank you for the valuable feedback a word about mouse acceleration ironsight uses raw input by default but it is not indicated ingame currently there is therefore no mouse accelerationsmoothing whatsoever feel free to approach our team if you have further questions or feedback and well be glad to accommodate you cheers a free to play game with less microtransactions than a lot of aaa games sign me in please was wondering if you might give this game a goo its pretty decent tbh very well designed you should try warframe raw input for what on rainbow six siege the raw input add a input lagg pls play survarium for some reason this quality game reminds me of phantom forces m8 idk why but it does its verry simular lies all lies jack this isnt fun jk peace and luv this game is incredibly good i do alot of ironsight related content too and i have to say the game got alot of potential and they are doing all the right steps one after another cant wait to see it on steam and the community to grow d ill try this once they fix the net code ive heard that its atrocious this right here looks better then call of duty lol what about planetside2 if you wanna be good at this game hip fire 24 7 ur welcome its really broken play dirtybomb looks pretty good tbh actually started playing this this morning its really god and quite a lot like the older cod games you can find me lurking around as username dangleebles try dirty bomb what is this game called have a revisit to battalion when the mu2 update hits its going to completely change the game and could do with some coverage keep testing new games and give your two cents on them could be a good series for you i know i would watch it that map looks just like that one map on advanced warfare thanks jack gonna try it out this the game shroud played for a total of 4 minutes because he could not turn mouse acceleration off the only thing i hate about this game is that no one uses their fucking sights my experience with this game there isnt much to say i always die from people that use weapons with high fire rate and a laser pointer on their guns for some reason you can even lose a gun fight against these people from distance dont know how this is posible without aiming imo i find this game really like cod not because its a fps because you have a arsenal full of weapons but 320 are being used by everyone there is no gun balance not one game where i didnt see one particular gun its just another cod copy that nailed the gun balance i have nothing against copies this game isnt worth peoples time in this current state no raw mouse imput plus dont bother if your from auznz when i played no severs and had to play on 200 plus ping reminds me of a dumbed down bo2 but its f2p and actually runs on pc so hey thats good americas army is a good free fps also pretty decent vid keep up the good work this on console it is comparable to call of duty in a lot of way such as the one mentioned in the video another similarity was that of rage just like when i played cod back in the pre supply drop era what do u think about warface goodwill blacklight retribution this map resembles a lot like plaza from cod bo2 we neee this on console i just want battlefield heroes back the gameplay is so fluid and cod like but it is so badly optimized the gun sound same as warface my brain was so confused at the beginning is this warface but the hud different rush team and contract wars were my shit if the animation was a little smoother and slightly more realistic graphics this could be really fun love this game im lvl 28 quick scopes no thanks bullet force is pretty decent too it rips off bf a lot tho offensive and defensive killstreaks medal of honor anyone i tried this a few months back but rainbow 6 sucked me back in im gonna give this another stab now nice one jackie boy you should check out tabg jack its free at the moment and very good i would even say that its better than pubg and fortnite it looks like a call of duty clone iv been playing ironsight for 2 weeks im loving it play it every day holy shit this isnt a battle royale game warface is better too callofdutish no thanks where can i play this its not on xbox or ps4 i noticed your gamertag was ironman did somebody else already use jackfrags famas with 30 bullets this is good these developers are stupid anyways if you can make the original cod gameplay better earn millions working with the developers dont fuck your own ass game called ironsight while the gun he uses has a holo combat arms reloaded will it ever come to console this looks like a cod clone the animations the ui the gun sounds and even the map design very wow game i love this game edit what i love about it is partly the high ttk movement feels really good also no there is no mouse acceleration confirmed by developer eldewrito is a really good one console or only on pc yeah why play warface for free when you can play this shit with 2009 graphics where do i download this hell yeah ironsight kicks ass phantom forces is better this game was alright except the fact that the mouse movement felt really sluggish or it has some kind of mouse acceleration really weird feeling i cant quite explain but its ok try takedown redsabre it gives amazing emotions especially if played whit friends it looks really good actually hopefully they put the beta on console so i can play it dropshot cool game ive played it a couple times warface the gunplay and movement feels tight and great it feels like classic call of duty and is a lot of fun i recommend giving it a try if you have the time you should check out the game armored assault its free to play what freetoplay modern fps game should be like how do we get it wheres the site cod for free no team fortress two roblox phantom forces jack we need a pubg try hard guide thought it was bo2 for a minute what is the name of this nice game really i want to know lmao that footage when jack was last person standing on search and destroy actually got me totally engrossed and tense whos ready for parabellum 24hours to go blacklight retribuiton is good too name of this games i miss battlefield play4free if your a nitty picky player like me no raw input is fucking rubbish needs a console release that map sort of looks like the one in hardline is this on console ionsight is it only on pc or is it on console it sucks how pc games have better shooters than console games this has a serious cod4mw2bfbc2 feel to it may well investigate so is this a sprint only game or what seems like every step you take you are sprinting whats the difference between stun grenade and flashbang defensive or offensive option so basically medal of honor 2010 streaks netcode is terrible seriously hi im following from iraq ps4 or x one this shud come to ps4please ironsightmake ur way to uson consoleit wud be s nice i could see jack playing some war thunder what is the site name warface is good jack any freetoplay battlefield type of games so the good days of cod nice been playing this for a while now and its so much fun it plays like cod with out the bs i hope they work on adding new content i can see myself playing this a lot in the future aswell final stand in bf4 is now free on ps4 warmode i think the name is called is also good or it is a csgo ripoff there are 2 games whos name look like eachother pin me im a grenade looks better than cod tbh jack lick me now i love it when jack says up to scratch this is a funny comment but can you try roblox phantom forces jackthey have the zavod 311 copy called ravod 911 and a map called metro which is similar to operation metro i have never played it in a few years but it would be fun to see you play last time i was this early was the other day leave a like first this game is much better than cod lol but is it better than minecraft why would you play this when you have a free option like fornite or get csgo which only goes for 13 i believe on steam reminds me of cod when cod was good jack can i get a sub its matthew from high school crossfire was my go to f2p game around 2008 id love to revisit it but no computer at first i thought this was warface looks almost exactly the same even the sounds of guns are the same bo4 but free and better this looks actually impresive i think its pretty goodwords that were said before the game explodes in popularity jack youre the man jack you are awesome when you put videos on youtube with games but can you to do a video with the game world of tanks please counter blox roblox offensive is better are you suggesting roblox phantom forces isnt good get planetside its amazing and free is it on ps4 unlike fortnite this should cause some uproar hng kinda nice too love this game give video for ww3 pliss first love you sexy beast today is a new day today is the day of the day lol idk hi jack im early first first first love u jack you absolutely deserve that selfapplause xd you can buy you can buy you can buy with in game currency translated that means you gotta grind for 8 years for a hat or you can just buy it those hit markers though looks like a knock off shitty cod who else has never heard of this and is super hyped about modern warfare where you found the intro free to play cod cool it is so relaxing seeing a youtuber that actually shows what the game is about instead of just doing a usual montage so a free to play fps that is comparable to cod or cs without paywalls ill take it well this look smooth than warface shooting on a moving train or whatever that is is one of the many fantasies of our generation i blame the first mission impossible for it i was the 3000 like d game called ironsight all the sights are holographic that actually does look pretty crunchy if im honest with you hey nano great video did you have fun making it will it be on ps4 this game looks really dope if only my computer wasnt potato its mw2 in 2018 so its like the game warframe but better looks like another cod game this one is just made to be free to play i didnt get what he meant by crunchy until i heard the sound design and its crunchy very nice looks like a call of duty black ops 2 clone to some degree airstike select here here and here dies airstiked his own team you sound so motivated so when youre broke so you get a free fps you place warface but youre feeling more cod so you get this i gotta say most youtubers just show gameplay of sponaored videos meanwhile you actually take time and play the game a lot and do your research and you actually got me interested in downloading it keep up the funny and good work huh so someone from respawn got fired and took titanfalls source code with them this is like cod and titanfall mixed looks fun best free game of all time imo this game was so bad back when i use to be partnered with them the game was largely boring and updates where once every month or 2 last time i knew they didnt even release a patch for netcode until earlier this month wonder if you still get shot 20ft behind wallssomething i have not been aware of being fixed since closed betait is currently open beta sounds like hes saying this with a gun to his head to anyone thats playing this game add me if u wanna party up username hylogenous ive yet to crash and i play a lot of this game to the point im top 500 in the world this actually looks really good your into is just it is like call of duty but free will this be on xbox 1 i played the closed beta good times they need the infected gamemode that would be awesome love your new intro seems like a fun to play game might give it a try oh cool nano got a sponsor lets check it out few minutes into gameplay this is dogshit keanu reeves voice wooooow dude s sooow reeeaaal hey anyone please help me guyswhen i login with my accountthe game is open and its just loading and loading at last its say time outi am from bangladeshi am playing this game from 3 monthcan you guys tell me is that ironsight ban in bangladesh shift hold to breath i guess devs dont english played this a few months back and had a blast really is worth anyones time the only reason games like these exist is because battlefield p4f died that was the goto for fps free to plays for a while a great game bro youll enjoy it nano lll pay you 5 to scratch my butthole as much i like the gameplay the one thing i dislike about this game is the sound gun sounds like they are made of plasticbut that just i dont know what you guys think hey nano do you remember black for the ps2 i learned it from start to finish you the man good vid more planetside plz its pay2win games fortnight cancercod trashxretarded aiironsight shit yea ik its beta but you can see at the core how crappy it is like a 99 cent mobile game its just korean cod but free so you dont have to feel guilty about giving activision your money every year if you like the mw series and bo2 youll like this it has one of the better f2p models out there and as a game is very solid game overall i get literally zero games in this all the time feelsbadman i love the customization tho why does nano not sound like himself in this video did they hold nano captive during this video wow free to play beta i remember when playstation used to have that now we have to pay for pre orders to play betas like bf5 or cod bo4 good times when we used to do that too bad beta lost its definition here and its more like 2nd alpha now love the new opening no lie ur gonna be the next fitz gurenteed cod weapon sounds are sick now this feels like a cod ive wanted even tho it aint sucks its only on pc of course i want this on ps4 just fyi i got unsubscribed from your channel by youtubethe algorithm might be screwing around again being able to buy weapons and attachements with cash but its a good thing that cosmetics arent behind a paywall id rather not be able to get cosmetics than having to pay to progress or pay to win because often progress in these kind of games is so slow that its impossible to get top tiered gear cosmetics are a way to donate to the dev team weapons shouldnt be nano please bring us a post scriptum gameplay 752 that freaking reload though based on real life counterparts entertaining as always thumbs up on the great work not for me sorry nano is this a sponsored video or an ad yav been hit by strucc by smooth boom nano for some reason it bothers me that the logo of eden is basically the same as imc from titanfall when will we have squad memes or pr memes i just want to see nano do a icecream sponsor with his beautiful voice black ops lol im fine with nano doing sponsors but why does he sound like ironsight gave him a script to read in some parts tfw you beat call of duty at call of duty did know you oh this looks great actually d is this a good story mode snakes death noise heard in background 225 press r for rip you forgot to mention that you can buy loot boxes with real money and get weapons faster we all need to represent our inner self dude that intro how did you make it try insurgency sandstorm more ptsd for everyone its just another cs clone are the settings user friendly like can you easily find and locate keybinds andor mouse speeds and stuff yo did you get kicked out of your clan such a great game this game is some cool unless isint the way cod is now is it concile or pc this game looks shit a copy of other freetoplay fps browser games warface and cod i mean gosh darn pretty sure that soundpack they use is free he sounded so unconfortable its kindof a better cod game but a better cod game is still a cod game if they keep going with their fair and mostly well balanced economy and make sure they keep the game running smoothly then itl be a good game but if they want to make it a great game they are gonna have to look into some way of making their game unique tf2 has a healthy economy and a lot of charm and character and thats why its lived for so long squad has an amazing community i mean nano is a part of it nuf said dark souls defines difficulty that feels rewarding and has tons of content doom has seamless and exhilarating gameplay and flips the horror genre on its head excluding paid games its still got a lot of f2p games to compete with for consumer play time like tf2 warframe paladins ironsights will probably die after a couple years if they dont find something more unique than interactive maps which is an awesome feature but not enough to define a game rn its a game worth playing but i theres a lotta stuff on the screen in the game hi nano do you still play in project reality it has shiet net coding you actuually see people go through walls on a daily and it makes noobs call anyone out for hacking cause again the net code is trash for this game theyre just gonna milk it for all the cash they can then abandon it when it goes full release for another game to milk cash off of all the devs do is drop new skins and maps not fix the net code or the shit the makes the game borderline unplayable the loot boxes are rigged so you get the same weapons youve already gotten very rare to get a decent gun with a skin the game modes they tried to add are boring and broken the spawns which are meant to be spawn camp proof do the opposite higher lvl ppl will know how to spawn camp your team have fun getting shot from around a corner cause someone has trash internet or is playing on the wrong servers cause the net code is trash me and my clan gave this game a try just to have all 8 of us who tried give up within a few days cause of bugs amd obvious money hungry d man this game is great better then my 2000 dollar wasted on cod basically just a good cod was that the rock as one of the characters what was that squad cinematic at the beginning nano sell out mode engaged fubeep yeah ummm maybe i will stick with ww3 the gameplay is clunky and is pay2win do not get nice how activision picked nano to show off early black ops 4 footage cod reboot anyone honestly insurgency just seems better than this even the old one not sandstorm a sponsored video you make me sick nano free to play game means free ai means shitty gameplay guys just for a heads up the game is basically a better modern cod that tries to emulate the older games like mw2 and bops 2 it has better netcoding and hit detection and a great variety of weapons side arms are terrible except the magnum and score streaks the company is pretty good at giving new content maps guns skins etc theyre just having some problems with a few spawn bugs and weapon balancing if you can get around that then youll probably enjoy it if you like faster paced arena shooters it looks like a nice cs and thats really it with a campaign or another cod rip off i dont like this at all ironsight does not seem to be all too special fairly generic very codlike which is not a compliment quite the opposite looks like a poor mans call of duty if you want a real massive multiplayer free to play fps try planetside 2 a shilling for the nano its looks like they mixed cs rainbow six siege and callofduty or battlefield its been a week or so nano but well worth itso dam funny brojust cant get enough thanks 4 the laughs sorry but this looks like a cod reskin the maps look incredibly similar to the point im wondering if they actually copied looks like a cod clone yay sarcasm i was going to comment nano dont ever fucking upload these poorly made shit games just for sponsorship you shill but hey this game actually looks pretty well put together not my kind of game tho you know what im here for ill be waiting for the next squads video please always be your own dude and dont copy whats sadly successful like actually putting memes popping up in your videos those arent funny or accepting sponsorships you dont care for i like the content you put out and believe in enough to do so so if you like this game thats cool and my oh my you have a cute butt if only people died a little quicker wow corporate sponsorship for nano movin up dude dont hate a guy for getting a sponsored post he also clearly states its a sponsored vid i want nano to have the time and money to make vids thats why i let ads play on vids from people i sub to i want them to get payed means more content for me its how economies works free isnt free its paid for some where i dont mind spending money on games i enjoy same as i dont like to walk so i buy a car and spend more than i need to so i get something i want money isnt some evil thing just a means to a more comfortable end 600 gta sa theme on gtav horn plays buddy next time try the ar57 in hipfire ar57p90 magminigun firerate enjoy bra this game is similar to warface yo nano 1v1 me ill kick your ass in ironsight my gamer tag is worldanielord so the frontline gamemode is the free brother of the rush gamemode from other games insurgencys push for example guys this game forces you to grind or pony up some real money to actually own weapons you rent them out for a few days or get like 40000 ingame currency units to own it plz post more often if ray had been playing things would have gone smoother just saying nano play insurgency sandstorm please silly fucking me i thought it would be a game where everyone used iron sights chinese version of cod why in the intro video it shows noneu countries in eu ad sponsored looks like csgo meets cod some of the modes shop remind me of zmr this channel is pretty neat ill sub i just got my ass kicked in insurgency this may be what i needed this video is sponsored by demonetization emp pulse successfully released but emp stand for electromagnetic pulse so its electromagnetic pulse pulse successfully released tf warface 2 saw intro and the fact i could grab my crotchinstantly installs this already looked better than cod and its free so its like a f2p cod nano you should play rainbow 6 siege this seems like a really big rip off of black ops 3 i would like to play this does it come out on xbox holy shit are deadshot cptamerica or master chief cause damn you took them out like you was on of these guys this offline tbh i rather play this then the new cod kiss me in the moonlight prince nano hm need to try this game cool why was the uk in the eu at the start nanos got a sponsor nanos not starving to death yey this game has potential and i am proud of you for sponsering it a free to play cod d looks interesting also the frontline game mode is exactly like in one old game called sldner secret wars good for small playerbasethough in that game its almost never actually used lol does it have a oceania server yet if it do then may be ill check it out does it have like competitive ranks nano put me in ur video pls so i can become famous squad player like u we subscribed for squad ask bad nano youve been hit by a smooth nano slaps hood of the car i enjoyed playing this game a couple months ago but it really needed some balancing work and updates to make the servers run correctly might hop back on and try it out see if anything has really changed nice vid doe can play we some time nano im lvl 49 bydeway im a big fan what 1060 tough 6 gb or 3 gb vram it s a free to play cod huh what about the community the fact that on the purchase screen there was permanent under the price suggests that some items most likely weapons will be rent out only types unless you pay real money ill give the game a try but seeing that alone is very unsettling and makes me not want to waste my time with this game as its probably going to be crap not to mention as you said weapon balancing lets be honest its more than likely that those unbalanced weapons will either 1 be premium only or 2 will cost an excessive amount effectively being premium only and on top of that will most likely never change do know though nano if the game is indeed shit that will reflect directly back on you that is my trust in your word will severely diminish ill probably come back to update this when ive given the game its fair share of my time the game really isnt half bad for a f2p shooter gunplay is great it just looks like a mashup of warface cod and battlefield nano needs sponsored content i want him to have sponsored content it means more nano you can clearly infer nanos opinion of this sponsored content has anyone tried this game with potato internet ive heard its tcp protocol which if you lag or get packet loss it gets worse and worse finaly some more nano this game is just saying cod should be free them tactical stretches we just want ptsd simulator 1943 and ptsd simulator 2018 the new trailer its amazing give it a year the paywall will be there itll just be slowly added in this looks really good for a free to play will get i enjoy this game more than 60 black ops3 this game kicks cod in the nuts hard its free to play with those nostalgic oldschool vibe welp i gues you got some money from this this game looks pretty good like everything cod couldve and shouldve been better than black ops 4 thats for sure this is legit a shitty cod knock off that runs like shit try warface call of titan warface warfare not being disappointed but this paid ad for ironsight is not what i want to see on your channel bruv give me squad memes or a real game not that toxic ass f2p shooter even after their recent patch game plays like horseshitgave it long enough to fix itself and at this point i dont care about it anymore ironsight is sponsoring everywhere d ironsight is a real f2p shooter you can easily farm weapons or attachments only attachment relatively hard to get is a silencer actually looks pretty good ooooohhh very noice 9th comment 11th comment ahahahaha since this will be sunken anyway fuck off commies reeeeeeeeeeee im an alabama naegur and i wanna be free ultimax 100 is the machinegun i consider my successor good mag capacity good weight and reliability shut up clock in and load up nanothe time 4th also m e m e third yeah first first ive never heard of this game why the fuck is it saying i already have an account should be on steam u should make merch i didnt have time to download it but i seen cod and i havent played a cod on comp before and i said you know what this is free ima check my dude tko see what he thinks and im sold i gotta try this game out going to play this game as it is free at the time it wasnt even new just got the notification now lmao lmao idk why but when i first saw it for like 5 seconds i thought it was rainbow 6 but rainbow isnt free now you gotta do all knives on this too its almost like cod but has a little bit of counter strike in it too wont touch it until can use a controller what platforms is it on ps4 which i could play on my phone can we get a console please cod ghosts do u know when the double xp comes back the game aint bad its just very glitchy and doesnt take much grinding i do like how it aim assists witht the knife this game is like cod and it does have potential to be better than cod this game is amazing and if it comes to consoles this will be a very popular game at least i hope so they better add controller setup can you join my party plz im ur biggest fan my gamertag is t2kla10 did i play fortnite with u and i asked if u were the real tko how come this looks better than every call of duty me and my friend saw you on black ops3 put on console please these cuts are free too you are not the only 1 doing this stuff i like your channel but selfish people piss me off and you never gave me a look comment or reply to a comment if you like combat axes i will keep the good clips and random streaming coming is the game on steam or what off topic i know but bro what are the best maps to knife on in ww2 the shovel is the only thing keeping me from chrome and i cant get more than a 2 kill streak im a pro ironsight player for d00mesports if your ever down to play with us then shoot me a friend request shmong played the game the day it went to open beta and playing it since its awesome you and dysmo are money hungry sellouts lol this game is just a rip off of call of duty and battlefield and this is the 4th free game thats better then cod i have seen lets forget about other games such as warface that looks strangely a lot like this game if i made a video game at a high risk of copy right action against me i wouldnt pay youtubers under 600k thousands of dollars to promote my copied game smh you manipulated 12 year olds half of you dont even have a pc just a ps4 because you wanted early access to trash games like infinite warfare pc is dominant then xbox is and last playstation xbox literally 1 ups everything ps4 offers stop wasting your dead grand parents money im going to downloading it dude your good at the game i already play ironsight ask em if they could release an xbox one version ironsight doesnt feel nostalgic because i havent been knifed across the map yet with commando is it on steam looks like rainbow and bo2 ish and maybe csgo this game is every were jezuz christ nice vid this video was great man is this on console downloadable form steam new to you mayb do you know who sheknives is hey tko do you know is this game coming to console this is simply boring to watch u run around whit knife in this game we need to to come to console even if it is a beta it looks like so much fun i was watching dysmo play this and seeing you play this makes me wanna play sadly i dont have a computer this game looks cool i might get it if this game comes out on console i would probably play this more than cod play more plzzz its not even like hes doing this for the money because this game genuinely looks sick looks better than black ops 4just saying im surprised activision isnt suing the crap our of this company the game looks good but it clearly takes so many things from call of duty im legit the 1200 like it said 11k i pressed like and it turned into 12k wtf they need this on ps4 looks dumb compared to cod dont compare games to cod looks like a pretty cool game id play if it was on console any date when it comes on console we need it on console if they will add the riot shield i will play it for sure is this for ps4 all i wanna know this game has been out for like 6 months now if this comes to console call of duty will be death it is already better than black ops 4 this game is going to blow up like fortnite game looks cool but i need it on a console i dont play games on pc tko need to do knife only lobbys with subs imagine all the rage involved the game is more like cod and just csgo game modes and some weapons skins all these console skrubs wanting it on console haha ive read alot of comments by level 10 its boring im probably not going to be that good still better than me on a beyboard and mouse even tho ive played on one 247 josh can you read your gmails please cod killer should shake things up a bit hopefully this game is on xbox 1 if this came to console cods multi player would be dead and treyarch would only be able to sell their zombies if only this was on console i would say fck cod real quick looks great but im not a pc gamer it feels like rb6 cs and cod ive had it for a while its so much more enjoyable than cod at the moment trying new games is good hope it was fun as long as you had fun its worth it just do you bro is there a console ver when a free game is better than ww2 lol how hard is it to run looks badass this actually looks pretty cool and its free i might actually give it a download i was just playing when the video came out lol ironsight is destroying cod lol i love that game is it gonna be available for xbox and ps4 that game looks clean af ballistic was also a great game when it was free on browser when it came to steam not only it wasnt free anymore lots of content was cut or changed game wasnt the same after that would buy if it came to console might even have to become a pc gamer because it looks like csgo and cod had a child with awesome weapon selection reminds me of cod and counter strike nice game is it for ps4 cool game hope it comes to xbox if you open it from steam the you can use a steam or xbox wird controller love that guy at 619 thinking he can run away from tko lol glad to see you make a vid on this game man and seeing you tko it up im not good at pc games ive been playing for a couple of days and ive really been enjoying it is there quick scoping anybody else noticed he said the games has explosive knives lol anyone else get reminded of a vertabird when you see the hellbird tko you did amazing man and i want more please yo i would love to see this more bro we need this game on ps4 yesss another youtuber promoting ironsight its so much better than cod that im not going to upload it instead ill continue uploading cod i mean if this game wants to be successful they should add it to console love the idubbbz music in the background its time the music at 340 is tko idubbbz if this game comes to console please free multiplayer why tf nobody specify if its pc only bruhhh im over here coming from dysmos vid to say you should play it and then i see this and im like damn i was too slow it feels like its missing something is the game aviation in the ps store this game has to come on console josh you need to read your gmail i hope it doesnt go on console because then no one will play it on pc you actually did a really good job at explaining the game in this video i wouldnt mind another video like this you can use ds4 window to play any keyboard and mouse game with a ps4 controller on pc also it looks like a good game im gone check this game out bro keep it up bro i really i hope one day i get to play against on cod wwii this looks like warface i think nostalgicnostalgia was said about 27 times one of these days a game is gonna come out and let you only take melees and give you some kind of running speed buff for it face cam hehe asshole fungus infected yo i been trying to play tat shit but it took like 51 hours to dl and ion got that time i cant play with this fuckin keyboard can you use a controller ahh knives dont bank that sucks this games still better then black ops 4 could you knife only on csgo i know it is dead but i think it would be fun this isnt new lmao ive played for a while i dont really like these kinds of vids im not hating but are you and dysmo just going to upload the same content all the time nice vid dude thumbs up great stuff ima share dis shit subbed liked iron sight i dont care that this game is in beta please put it on xbox good game but bo3 is better bring it to consoles tko i like your videos but in this case i dont know why this video looks boring v can u try rainbow 6 siege everything is cosmetic only i wish cod had this supply drop system did you forget wwii supply drop system is all cosmetic and you can get every gun just by playing the game just like ironsight the free part already makes it better than cod the rest is just bonus its better cuz its on pc just an idea you should play tasty avp game that came out in the late 2000s am i the only person who heard the background music and thought of the idubbbz content cop skits and you should make videos on this game i already told your friend that i would like that come to console dysm to save people a lot of time its pc only game this game is so good thanks for letting me know about it tko like for ironsight to come out on console this game needs to come out on console so nostalgic man lol ill try the game out tho idk what youre talking about tko you were running around doing pretty good with knifing lol grats and thanks for keeping the music in the description damn it tko its pc only bro im not buying a pc when i already wasted the money on an xboxonex just to find out bo4 is prioritized to ps again fml i cant say its better than cod cause its not on console thank you for uploading we need more players lol why is every cod youtuber talking about ironsight all of a sudden how much are they paying you youtubers to hype this game up hmm we gotta find a way to get them to put it on console because id play it cant wait for ironsight battle royale rip ww11 this is a cool way of recording im cool with it ive been watching dysmo play this game a lot and i really wish this was on console a better version of cod with skill come on iiiiiin is every cod youtuber paid to say that this game is better than cod in their titles or something edit the title was edited everyone is loving this game whats with all the people saying oh he doesnt like the game why would he accept the sponsor of a game he doesnt like i understand he doesnt mind money but then his commentary wouldnt be so exciting like it is and he wouldnt have made an entire 10 min vid and wouldve just put a clip in edit he also wouldnt hade gone out of his way to play mouse and keyboard needs to be for xbox and ps4 lets hope it happens 513 looking for a gf lmao theseknivesonly plays a different game that isnt cod but feels like it and still knifes no shit just saying no one get the an 94 its a 2 bullet burst weapon i am disappointed is it on consle this game ironsight is refreshing pretty good game and video man i would like to see more mainly cause i cant play on pc right now looks like cod bo5 came out before bo4 u probally dont remember but i played

youtube just call each other to make a title hey nice video keep up the great work it seems like i good game and i like it but it really looks like a rip off you call of duty just because its free

work yes im first bitches first so early shitttt whats up bro long time no see love this game but theres lot of delay playing this game terimaki personally didnt like this game no skills needed its that type of game was to late for me to watch already sleeping finally ironsight and then i cant watch ot live get dammit tips use compensator on weapons like m4 fuck so busy at work i didnt have a chance to watch the stream you are so awesome you even hit when you are missing 233 someone teach me how to do that quiq scope 027 cause my q is used to take a flash bang this cigan accent in your english d like i have played for a few hours now and so far i am very happy with this game with that being said there are still many many issues with the game this includes gun balance map balance as well as networking errors so you get killed behind walls other than that the last possible problem is time to kill and health regen speed however that is very subjective other than that great game and i hope it succeeds on pc as i would love a quality cod like game especially if it is free pay cosmetic only game love the back ground music what are the name of the sounds used in the video just discovered this game its just so fun and entertaining to play this game nice video i love the sniping but i find it quite annoying when your in a gun battle and get one hit while you are pumping bullets out your really good i always get fucked on this game everyone sweaty hard scoper lmao i read a few posts on their website asking for an asian server but the way the devs replied to them i think they are way too arrogant whats the outro song i need to know because ive heard it somewhere b4 and im getting nostalgic vibes please anyone sweaty ass snipers in this game are fucking annoying they ruin the experience for everyone else the return of proper quick scoping sold im in need this in consoles if only cod was like this just proves that people love that old style of cod its what made cod popular in the first place thet should go back to the old engine and full of hackers with aimbot just like cod shit netcode and shit hitbox that is ironsight snipers are broken and should be nerfed and how tf can it one shot people if it doesnt do 100 dmg only 6v6 what sight is that 215 how do u switch as fast fabaianchills maybe u want to watch my 70 kill game d i uploaded it on my channel d hi im ugly and i have a pretty and talented sister please tell me whats the music in the outro 5 hours of playing for a 7min video sir no copyright game play did you had any problem with the launcer when starting the game because after i put my username and pass it turns white and stay like that and even if i press start again it does the same thing with the recent cod black ops 4 rumors if the iron sights devs decide to port this to console they could take this games popularity to the next level x another one bites the dust with the cfx50 so many iron sight players looked at the stats and said dude its just a blaser that shoots faster lol the cfx50 is bugged i believe ti has the same damage as the blaser but it never one shots unless you headshot i think its body multypliers is bugged because its semi auto sniperand maybe have coded semi autos to 2shot always i have it myself i got disappointed myself yow nice video my channel does funny and wtf moments or even some of your best kills and want to be featured on the channel please visit the channel and check our about page on how to send in a clip hope to receive a clip from you soon better then cod what the size of

to uninstall the client couldnt they just put it on steam when i press download at ironsight site it says error 502 why after i download he still download something like 7273 and then 7374 i stuck at

download it and sure enough he does nicely done mark sam lol i think i have more sub i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you liked black ops 2 youll love this no crazy wall riding or rocket jumping straight gun play and kill streaks has small player base so we need more people you should come play also i hear its coming to steam and console soon my fav cod streamer is black whaaat haha love the content as always bro ive played this too its quite fun but not a cod killer dude i love your gameplay man you just found yourself a new sub you done with div 1 tf tryout the new cod that gonna comeout glad u back u been ghosty love the content proud of you bro miss ya in division bro but ill keep the game and content alive for ya pretty good quality for a free game hopefully it is not pay to win d using the jungle carbine in narvik is fun how the heck is it possible to give such a possible win out of hands just like that huh i mean they were completely overrun yet managed to overtake the game with ease either there were a lot of people in your team not paying attention at all or the other team had some super powers going on lol damn good game tho when ever i get a tank i rush and everyone follows personally there are two things i love in bf5 1 the sniping is great and long range snipes are the best especially when you get a headshot 2 going assault class getting sticky dynamite and sticking it on the turret of the tank and suiciding while destroying the entire tank and you can quite quickly take most of the tanks out but some sit at the back and do nothing i actually feel more comfortable using iron sights on rifles and snipers what gamemode is that reminds me of the water based maps in bf4 iron sight sniper simo hyh liked that i never play whit scope i seem to remember the arisaka on bf1 being ok as well in argonne still waiting for hc mode i dont know why in the hell the didnt release that right away whats the meaning of jackfrags jack is such a team player and people say theres no team work battlefield is all about teamwork so imagine actually going through this 656 jack i see a guy there me did you kill a bush whats there jack one man army welcome to the normal bfv expirience play squad on steam will you se the difference between on gameplay shermans need antifortification device a bulldozer blade for pacific hedgerow cutter for europe man its so ammoying that i cant play this game smoothly with a gtx1060ti once upon a time i crushed the enemy like they were ants now have to play cod i usually dont go scopes but it is useful at most situations however im the kinda sniper that goes into battle with the iron sights finally getting bf5 soon love your vids rip random infantry 1514 i really wish rifles were a one shot to the chest i love the idea of running as an ordinary infantryman with iron sights and a leeenfield or a kar98k or other iconic bolt action rifles hey jack can u try doing guns that fit the side like us guns for the us and japanese guns that would be cool im leaving an comment just to make the youtube algoritim chose your vidio team switch desperately needed dice pffff u cant see the n word battlefield needs a voip system and faction locked weapons imo tank jump on any pice of geometry cant get that if you siting in 40t tank dice make tank more stady so we may push no to be able put sight on target becouse little bump in map gg tanking bf5 sucks if you remember bf4 jack welcome to my battlefield experience where players wont push even though its possible to take the sector or flag sometimes i get good teams that actually push with me but most times its like this videome trying to capture alone meanwhile me and my bois at hell let loose where is our artillery support wanna hear a story i bought battlefield v preorderd played it for 1hr and havnt played it since lol this is me after eating beans 3035 iron sights are so much better because of the scope glare some kid messaged me if you cant player medic get off the game looser i messaged him back go fuck your self all the sudden he reported me and now i lost communications and was suspended what a noob the guy in your squad 815 repairing aa before helping capturing b the logic in some players this is how i only play scout i dont run scopes ever pls do these full games more often its interesting to see how the battle plays out jacks logic i did good but my team lost the game so ill post it as a consolation to make me feel better cant like this video because this game is a total garbage right now i do enjoy watching you play used to enjoy playing bf3 and bf4 with you was always a fun challenge didnt discover you on youtube until last year and been watching ever since thanks for the great videos jack prioritized reloading before healing in almost every situation matey at 1421 crouchrunning out of the smoke carrying dynamite fucking floored me for some reason xd god im so f big pussed i cant play bf5 because my wifi adaptor broke we need some way of organising the squads like commander mode in bf2 this is the most representative bfv experience in any video you have posted that game was every game ive played for the last few weeks the iron sight chad without the sweet spot for boltactions like in bf1 its just not the same sounds as though jack is commentating on this video after hes recorded it sailed right by wake island during my last deployment surreal experience hey jack if im playing a battlefield game i cant see people becouse of the sun any tips you could use the boat to harrass them if you wanted i have respect for anyone who does this good one jack it was neat to see the tank gameplay and a bit of a longer video simo hayha is that you commanders and squad leaders as in bf2 click on this pause it and that lvt which has 24 people in in was me 241 this is giving me ptsd of paracel storm from bf4 jack still saying panzer boosh its pan ser book seh ironsights are underrated haha thoughtless shit medic would really like to see more vehicle games from you p enjoyed this video more than most posted over the last few weeks you clearly enjoyed yourself and it shows how the game is not all about one players ability but the team effort dont have to win to have fun even though we all prefer to win i love the type 99 and type 38 rifles am i missing something with this rifle did they make type 38s without scopes and with bent bolt handle and thats why i dont like such modes they really depend on the team the problem with this is the guns they are all ass i hate the revive system in this game i like iron sight snipers over scope depending on the sight thank you for showing why blueberries is a common battlefield term and why its derogatory nobody knows how to flank or establish a position they just act like its call of duty they run in die respawn and repeat hi jack that was fun its nice to see that we mortal players are not the only ones to be frustrated and denied in these breakthrough games thanks for sharing would it nice if we did start with no scopes like bf1 dude i played with a sniper with iron sights in the beta all the idiots on the ground who just wouldnt get on the burn smfh how stupid the ding of this gun is a big oof such a noobteam battlefield 1 i couldnt stand using the scopes on bf5 i cant see crap without them 52 is trash wish this was more hell let loose this game has lost all attraction for me but you are a badass with a badass channel so i will always watch your videos when is the sovsussr going to be added in v at 1630 unreal just a little coordinating from the team would have made that a breeze damn the enemy team is good a welltrained sharpshooter doesnt need any optics to kill enemy soldiers like this guy good the nice sharpshooter jack you should totally revisit bf1 again the tanks should push and make an defensive barrier to protect infantry what do you think jack 2811 the sound of defeat it was said you would destroy the sith not join them ur very good at this game loved the infantry variants on battlefield 5 i always prefer iron sights actually with a big screen4k its not really a detriment at long ranges either i havent touched this since the update been playing bf4 hardcore servers i prefer iron sight rather than scope cuz there is an extra feel its like an art so it looks authenthic game is so broken i dont even get the squad kills for the new gun assignment total bs dice i know its annoying but guys lets keep the pressure on dice in regard of the ttk i was playing bf today and raging af it is very odd to see how calm is jack in the same game i dont want to show em my butt we feel you jack stop calling them snipers they are service rifles good to see a mainstream youtuber using a gun the real way tankers are the worst people change my mind iron sights sniper sherman tank oh look simo hayha challenge i wish its mobile this game needs more weaponslike a looot morebf1 was perfect and now that i tried bfvwell i can say for sure now that the game was rushed and nothing absolutely nothing is polished how do i block this channel and other channels with battlefield v content i just want the damn lunge mine so at least tanks will be more cautious when pushing assault players and if the said players are gonna die at least theyll die doing tons of damage to it the arisaka is the same as a gewehr m95 but then with different scope sights they are still fun to use with iron sights im honestly considering getting hell let loose that game seems awesome this episode shows the type of team im always on this game is so boring since 522 why doesnt bf5 have the sweetspot system that bf1 had i thought that was great in bf5 you have to headshot someone to get a kill will a iron sight sniper or hope he is low health in bf2 there was a channel with only squad leaders and commander on it so we could play organized this counter strike on a bigger scale thet should re implement commander mode honestly we need the commander role back shouldve used the v1 as soon as you got it wondering if they are going to fix that map like actually have the japanese troop invade instead of the us for more of a historical accuracy every time he wants to break through the hangar i think just go to the other side of the island and flank them because that is how you play wake island in a stalemate but they cut off the map so you cant do it what the heck dice ive always loved iron sight bolt actions unfortunately they dont transfer over well to these titles so ive almost completely switched over to games like post scriptum world war two online vurdun and tannenburg is this xbox one x jack sometimes you just have to tip your hat to your opponents iron sight sniper so you mean a rifle also the japanese army consisted of mostly riflemen equipped with arisakas this game got everything twisted even the damn bolt is twisted its supposed to be straight damn it used to do this a lot then i found out that it was waaaay funnier in bf1 come on jack you should know that just sitting on the objective isnt enough also please put your smoke further ahead not directly on your position you cant push out of smoke youll get peppered instantly instead use it to blind the entrenched enemies approach them and ripping them a new one genderfield 5 is a piece of shit game and you shouldnt play it if you dont want to support people who probably think that youre a sexist bigot just for believing historybiology i sinpe with iron sights in battlefield 1 with the ross mkll with more then 100 kills you should definetly do more vechicle gameplay and also check out storm firefall jack he does some awesome tank gameplays i iron sigh all the time scopes are boring for me only good thing about this game is tank ive not played for almost a week had some games that where so frustrating with me and maybe 24 other guys actually on flags and everyone else tanks inc sat 200m back whiffing shots at entrenched enemies just charge your harder to hit when sprinting around with a tommy guns anyway great idea with the team based objective jacksquad leaders should be able to communicate with each other maybe even have an alternate commerose just for squad leader coms yes squad leader voip would be awesome i think the most infuriating thing for me is v1 farmers who dont get any kills its the noobiest time of the year nobody jack we need to push up on the right side and flank all of the other 7 year olds in the lobby make sure you get a back massage for that game mate welcome to norevfield didnt play bfv der but getting the impression that nobody gives a fuck about revs does anyone else have an issue with updating bf5 on origins jack theyre in there i think proceeds to get blown up in opposite direction and survives with only a sliver of health martini henry is the best ironsights rifle give up with this shit game do you think its worth buying bf5 now this is why breakthrough is the most shit game mode in battlefield youll probably never see this comment but im going through a really difficult breakup at the moment and your videos are so relaxing and provide a brief moment to escape the pain keep being you jackfrags 3 this has been my experience with the game in almost all matches lol first time using the arisaka with the bayonet as infantry rifle i do it all the time as a japanese soldier and literally yelling tenno heika banzai when bayonet charging now simo hayha is prowd still havent touched this game since they changed the ttk loving bfv new maps 2500 jack you know a few games you play where you can communicate with other squads i wish we could on bfv on console years ago i played socom and you could do this with great team work also i remember it being a push to talk system like a wallow talkie lol you could also hear enemy chat if you were close enough like in another room or when u get killed you could hear the enemy laughing i use the bayonnet charge when i run out of ammo or when i spot a bush camper hey jack just wondering what fov you play as see america doesnt always win on this map iv neva used a scope on this rifle its perfect without i bought bf5 on the xmas sale cant wait to play it tomorrow i only run the type 99 with iron sights as an infantryman border guard of the ija i love the gun and its iron sights ive become very good at using the type 99 all the time and racking up kills i will buy some merch i love your designs a preferable alternative to modern crapfare how is he only level 66 xd iron sights were my first choice in bf1 but in bf5 i cant spot enemies and theres no sweetspot i turned to smg isnt this literally how most infantry fought in ww2 that final tbag was downright disrespectful jack gg is this game worth buying for 14 currently on offer on origin but is it still populated etc id love to play yet every time i go to start the game it crashes without fail iron sights sniperoh a tank arisaka 99 im sorry did you mean gewher m9530 arisaka is good though when im on the defending side 910 times we getting our ass kicked but i do personally think c d are easiest to defend especially if you play together with a friend that goes assault or support with at mines jack is proof that if you play on high equipment you play better team based objectives was a good idea since bf2 but dice jackfrags and ozzyman are like the same person i played 2 conquest games consecutively 2 days ago with leeenfield iron sight and leeenfield 3x scope the results were with iron sight kd 250 got revived just once with 3x scope kd 196 i missed more shots obviously with iron sight but i stayed on the target anyways because you dont have to zoom out in contrast to scope and rained down bullets on the enemies much more easily higher rate of fire of leeenfield drives me to use it with iron sight noobshitt iron sights were more useful in bf1 and i dont really know why the bullet velocity on the arisaka is really slow should have kept trying to use tanks jack lets go get the win team team nahhwe good tbh i love the boys at rifleits high damage and ability to take on tanks and not just infantry i amazing yeeee my team was listening to me sorry for ruining ur game this day haha you can shoot spotting flares so that you dont get spotted loved this episode would love to see tons more of these nothings better than the martini henry bf1 i miss sound when you get a headshot 814 press c jack no medic needed yet yes more vehicles please ouch the human wave team stonewalled jack ouch nice try tho i would like to see you in asian server and crush some hackers and see how you will fare against 2 or more hackers in one server it would be cool and hopefully can help reducing hackers if they got killed a lot instead will battlefield 5 runs mp on my 1mbps connection its always the retarded one whos in the tank im feeling a bf4 or bf1 video would be nice around this time of the year merry christmas squad leaders all being able to talk to one another is interesting but i wonder how many times that would devolve into them talking over one another trying to be mega squad leader leader of all squad leaders more tank content pls ahh yes my favourite kind of sniping another thing your team was missing were a few good prone mmgs suppressing the enemy fire without maneuver is indecisive maneuver without fire is suicide more vehicle gameplay it was very helpful as a person whos just getting into battlefield v jack next time try a deep flank on the right side from the water get two good snipers in the airfield tower and the rest assault from the rear of the hanger captures much faster with less loss of lives of course you should post even defeats especially hardfought ones how else are victories to have their savour i want an ironsights and sniper scope only server this game looks so fucking monotonous literal meatgrinder gameplay 247 of a playerbase composed of people who want to snipe 2 miles away from objective or just wanna run around and play deathmatch i dont like waiting for rifle cycling before i can confirm a kill that or headshots which i cant hit with a scope much less iron sights vehicles are prone to players just looking for kills and it really ruins the game for the rest of us id love to see all modes with a nonvehicle versions 8 got battlefield 5 on christmas not cool down for the jb2 just that stupid glitch thats been in the game since day 1 jack drilled him through the bush there frags when can we get the new rap battlefield vs arma vs ww3 vs cod vs insurgency vs escape from tarkov honestly i just think the enemy team were too good for jacks team they countered every flanking action they did hard are you all ready for the christmas noob surge loved the tankplay refreshing change more please jack thanks for posting this shows the plight of the solo player sometimes you try your best but its just not enough for the team can u play more insurgency sandstorm please alright then simo hyah ugh more trash island gameplay care eyes scope is answer what do flairs do in bf5 this is my favorite weapon in bf1 nothing new to me been doing it sense the first bf the ttk still sucks dont you rage at all jack i would have lost my shit in the 2nd half of this round jackfrags calmness in person your most infuriated moment 2930 d really like the idea about squad leaders being able to talk to each other ive often been on a losing team where just a little team coordination would go a long way to turning the tide since the pacific update came out all ive done is run type 99 iorn sights for my japanese recon its honestly great its very difficult since you cant one shot chest shot anymore especially on console it is so helpful for my sanity to see someone else struggling with team that cannot use w button last time i played i killed 15 guys on the objective before dying it was honestly my biggest killstreak as infantry in any bf i achieved nothing no one followed no one ysed fuckton of smokes ibthrew along the way fuck those guys 2244 lets buff the tanks dice said they dont move because they are weak merry chrimbo all jack didnt even use the iron sight rifle for most of the video wth how do you get the chrome finish on the revolver 120 and further no medic aroung left behind a big medic chest this game is a major let down for me i wanted to play it over the holiday season but with the ttk changes its very frustrating and doesnt even play like the same game ive been playing for the last year maybe they will make some good changes after the new year and i will come back and check it out as for now i have quit playing after 1600 hours yeah the 3x scopes everyone and their mother have access too should really be limited imho the gameplay would be a lot more interesting if everyone except recon 6x or irons for them were limited to iron sights its great anyway but it could be even better no win but gg either way jackfrags in 2020 i dont wanna show em my butt i never use scopes and i like bolt action rifles a little late but merry christmas everyone honestly i found this kind of gameplay pretty cool it goes to show how the game really does feel like a proper push and pull in the heat of battle squad leaders talking to each other you mean like i dunno squad p does anyone think we will get the springfield rifle since the americans are now in the game id like to have a new sniper the arisaka is a decent gun file this under stupid questions but i have to ask if you use iron sights on any sniper class rifle does the game still show sniper glint when aiming at an enemy i mean i would think not but maybe the game codes all sniper rifles with glint automatically love these longer videos on battlefield nice to hear your thoughts and strategies etc i hate the meta in this game bf34 so much more fun thats all i use are iron sights how does the gunplay feel after the hotfix we can feel you jack merry xmas merry christmas fellas i run the leeenfield with a bayonet anything close range out to about 300 meters is zero issue with iron sights i with that if you used iron sight you would get the sweet spot mechanic i only play with iron sights lol jackfrags bf2 had it all figured out with squadscommanders and voip ptt included in the core game it worked perfectly i have never since in any battlefield game had that type of teamplay not saying that it was like that in all games but with community servers you learned quickly the servers that tended to have those cooperative oriented players it baffles me that dice completely lost that in every game since bf3 for example would have been perfection if it was included id most likely still be playing it instead i been going back to bf2 time and again i see dice usen frags for publicity they need to fix firestorm jack tell them hi l realy like your vids maybe 1 day l could get a shoutout they need to make realistic servers bf1 ions hardcore mode was brutal can you plz do a video on the kar98k welcome to 99 of my entire bf experience where i constantly ptfo and try to take the objectives while some tank whores camp half a mile behind just boosting their kd iron sight sniper is the best experience ever in game how do u only have 3 subscribers hi i love your vids ur really good yes squad leaders should hav an option to chat and collaboratecoordinate strategies is this game worth buying after its first year did they revert ttk yet im playing just with iron sights on the sniper rifles game is trash beast how many times do i have to hit you i have been saying that every time i play since the time to kill change next do role play if youre ok the japanese side only use japanese guns and japanese grenade etc is it effective with the new ttk hit the 3 million subs at christmas lol congrats iron sight is beautiful you can keep the sight and reloading at the same time back in the days we had bf4 hardcore server and iron sight sniper everyone was oneshot but you need damn skill this where the good times thats the optics they had in ww2 if you were one of the small percentages people that actually shot someone you were a sniper this is how i play sniper class because you dont get spot with lens shining but you can get headshots mid to long range this game feels cheap af give planetside2 a go if you want to see a good communication system and teamwork there should be a thing were if u get hit by a sniper rifle 1 time in any part except the head u get the penalty that the next sniper shot within 30 or more seconds is gonna instantly kill you doesnt matter if u get full health this is mostly against medics and heal abuse i love this gun too a 35 min videoit must be christmas or something good chtistbirth i love the fact that its called iron sights sniper but u quit sniper at like 5 mins into the video xd me and my friends while defending the caves on breakthrough all equip bayonets and charge random enemys in the smoke my god jack i feel sorry for you it looked like you played with bots when your team got hunkered down at that objective it is sometimes that allies dont think much on how getting the job done but charge in like cannon foder this map is very vehicle heavy yeah once i was taking cover behind a box and peeked over to see 4 tanks advancing towards me i didnt make it if they could have a different channel where squad leaders could communicate everyone would like that beautiful english lord jack frags imho the commander system in bf 4 was pretty okayish with a little bit of love it could help teamplay im sorry but who still plays this garbage anymore i dont mean to be a dick i loved this game but after the last patch it just simply isnt fun jackfrags the ultimat a push solo carrying the game youre such a beast thats insane how do you unlock weapons i cant even unlock any weapons for some stupid reason these games are individuals playing a team based game merry christmas everyone god bless my third and last comment you couldnt call in the v1 because you took damage while holding the phone its a glitch im not sure if its triggered by just taking damage or by using your first aid kit being resupplied breakthrough on iwo jima is unplayable only one time have i played a game that the americans have won non scope snipers use short muzzle becuse enmy can see muzzle can this be a full across the battlefield episode if wen never saw the second half of breakthrough wake island love this video the struggle was real thanks jack ive actually played so much iron sight sniper that i have forgotten how to use a scope this was very interesting ive never see jack struggle like this i use the m9530 with iron sights try using the model 8 with the higher rate of fire and good hip fire skill tree use with iron sights sniping or up close a 2 shot monster nobody literally every battlefield v player in their thumbnails i n s p e c c he talked shit and they started losing sells and people stopped playing so they reached out to pay him to talk good about the game lol merry christmas jack thank you for all the sick content keep it coming in 2020 yeah teammates are shit this man doesnt know what christmas means battlefield 5 is one of the worst shooters out so many stupid decisions put into this game along with its poor design not to mention the terrible gun balancing do not even bother to pick up this piece of shit game mabye in another year it might be worth trying just like battlefront 2 u know what a challenge is the boys at iron sights we need martini henry in bf5 jack using a bayonet madness post all your game play jack im here to watch you play not to watch you win operation just stand here youre orders just stand here if the squad leaders could talk to each other like in squad post scriptium hell let loose its the only way to snipe its difficult and challenging and soo satisfying to get kills jack taking off the training wheels i use iron sights for bolt action rifles all the time the type 99 iron sights in my opinion are one of the worst cough cough gewher 95 the 2 best are the lee enfield and the k98k also you made a great choice for loadout and specializations for the iron sight load out i play bf3 like this in metro when i was not a medic iron sight sniping was so much fun in bf1 bf5 needs to have new sight magnifications so you can have 2x irons and 8x and 10x scopes those poor rifles in bfv have no damagebring one shot rifles back for once bfv looks fun when can we expect a review of battlefield 1942 jack it would be nice if you could traverse the whole map for across the battlefield just my two cents happy holidays merry christmas jack as a ww2 aficionado i was wondering why i never heard about the recapture of wake island so i went to the might wikipedia to do some research and i found this the us chose not to retake wake island by force in wwii as it would have been too costly in american life to do so similar to how the us wanted to avoid having to invade homeland japan for the same reason and so instead decided to blockade and bomb the island into submission although the island and its japanese garrison didnt surrender until the end of the war itself they were practically starved for over three years in fact they were so hungry that they hunted one specific indigenous bird on wake island into extinction balancing does not exist in bf5 it annoys me to no end that the japanese are the ones defending when it was the opposite in the real battle ive used the ke7 since day one i play recon with iron sights 80 of the time and love it merry christmas read ur bibl and thank your parents oh man if you should use any iron sighted sniper i strongly recommend the kragjorgensen its made for long ranges and if you got good eye sight damn you can pick people off from like 100 meters with little bullet drop and no scope glint to give you away for some odd reason i do better with irons over scope nostalgia watching this i remember playing this map on the 360 that arisaka sounds wonderful btw merry christmas i thought he meant a gun from the game iron sight so frustrating to watch this is like every battlefield experience for me i only use iron sights with all snipers the only problem is bolt actions are wildly underpowered and the scout class is pretty poor hasnt been good since battlefield 4 bf1 downfall of gadgets bv5 took that and put a cherry on top with ruining the guns its so frustrating when your team doesnt want to push with you thats how i play agro sniper iron sights with the revolver this shows my biggest gripe with the game rn 96 camping tanks at once i have an arisaka in real life and the muzzle velocity makes it feel like a lazer irl too its such a nice rifle to shoot when you can find ammo for it great video why does lvl up take so long lvl 3 or 4 in about 4 hours no weapons unlockied and no attachments yet nothing just standart class the reason you like attacking on it is because you arent cannon fodder for 8 vehicles like the defenders are post more full games its awesome you have to clear the objective before you can take it drill them through the bush jack veery good video showing real battlefield game play and feelings i like bfv but the damage doesnt make sense most of the time smgs are weak af also merry christmas big man jack covering us over christmas legend d jack carrying the team of potatoes xd hey jack are you gonna do a video on the winter docks map in mw ppl not playing the objective and only worrying about kills fps is ruined breakthrough can be realllly hard and frustrating cuz yiur either getting steamrolled by a million tanks or it takes an hour to bleed there tickets down because there sitting back so frustrating watching this having been in this situation so many times in bf games where the team just wants to sit back and snipe and not try to move forward and make any progress jack will you play more nohud games that would be very cool to see this almost makes me what to reinstall bfvalmost please update firestorm merry christmas to everyone except dice more hell let loose please that is actually my usual sniper loadout for the japanese im one of those players who likes to be the most historic accurate that means for the japanese i use the arisaka whit iron sights bayonet type 94 the kunai and the japanese elite meellei dont kniw the name make a video using the garand sniper doesnt help you got like the lowest dps weapon in the class lol i remember when dice actually balanced slow firing weapons to do more damage and it actually felt like it remember the scarh dice please bf1 bfv not even close after order 52 was executed youre dead because you reload when you dont need to jack a 34 minute video thanks for the christmas present jack 3 jack plays a round of breakthrough for fun also jack gets 75 kills and a 44kd without trying is it me or the comment section on jacks videos is the friendliest one lol jack why were you playing on an asian server a couple of hours ago sniperrifles are way to much nerved especially considering the fact of low fire rate and slow reload compared to the mgs shots from the chest up should be instant death up to 150 yards for millenials woke island anyone else not get an xbox for christmas christmas merry jack when jack is unable to complete a flank because of the new btk average players like me are beyond screwed fix it dice for some reason jack thinks the type 99 has a faster bullet velocity it doesnt it has 600ms which is the same as most snipers like the m9530 the krag kar98k have 700ms and also low drag rounds and the zh 29 can go to 860ms with faster bullet spec the highest bullet velocity in the game is the mas 44 which is 900ms with the faster bullet spec finally someone who appreciates iron sights sweet a christmas video iron sights are honestly underrated an iron sight sniper is a rifle jack youre a rifleman drilled him through the bush d that is 90 of the tank players lol all they do is sit behind the infantry and just shoot nothing lmao its so annoying as an infantry player to see that we have 4 tanks but we couldnt capture the objective just because of this selfish moron tank players merry christmas everyone jack i love your videos merry christmas ps more bf4 jack went brad pitt in fury while the rest of the tanks just watched 2445 thats what the ping pointer is for jack merry birthmass merry christmas one and all i also play iron sights as a sniper whats that revolver how to get it try it with the 2x scope its awesome i hate it when teammates dont push especially when im popping smoke everywhere and frantically typing push using smoke cover in chat people can be so blinded by trying to get a good kd ratio that they forget the objective as well as the tactics that can be uses eg flanking mappy crimps jack merry crisis jack its probably one of the few rifles that still has a bf1 feel to it its got a really fast muzzle velocity on it too 600 ms this gun just is a worse version of the m95 do tanks have a weak spot or no about time ironsights are the only way to go i hate xmas iron sights are the only way to snipe telescopic sights are for coward bitches shitty game if you dont play bf4 anymore play this new aweesome game you played last time hell let loose i wish iron sights didnt exist in any game merry christmas keep up the good work jack we appreciate you and love you jack but forget about youtube and go hang with the family merry christmas im better on bf1 with iron sights that gewehr 98 infantry is a monster merry christmas jack merry battlemas any tips for new players bought it recently and just get killed so quickly enemies are literally everywhere jack is just flexing now and he hits more shots with out a scope then when i use a scope so is the game alright now or what merry xmas iron sights thats what my dad from jail said he used to see all day every day nah im just kidding idek my dad not gonna lie i am a person on the internet i would be pleased to receive some likes thank you its like battlefield 1 with all of the bolt action rifles you are the best jack btw i hope to see more episodes of hell let loose because its an impressive games so its a noscope sniper only thing saving bf5 is honestly the pacific dlcwake island lol who doesnt use iron sights on arisaka can this comments get 50k likes so jack drags can day lalalalalalalalalala for 30 seconds first if only they added hardcore mode first hey jack i think im 1st great vid in the 1st 15 secs lol merry christmas for everyone im downloading the game now very cool hi jack love your vids hey im first nice clip my guy dude you killed yourself with a hellbird 114 thx for vid that game is for intel cpuon amd cpu run like shit so hype for bo4 who else preordered it surprisingly it looks really good is it on steam sponsored by ironsight dang it its not on console i can only play warface at 30fps which is fine i just wanna know if i could run it is it hard to run poopity scoop whoopity poop ironsight is so fun even tho im shit af on pc can you play the campaign if only this game were on console your accent is so pleasant to listen to anyone wants to make a team with me also im a noob you sound 15 my mind is blow to see youre older is there controller support for this game yet ngl id play this on console a free fps ill have to try this would warface be tested by you marley seems pretty alright on console im late sorry notificationsquad marley im your 400000th subscriber congrats on 400k marley congrats on 400k subs love your videos mate 400k subscribers yasssss mate notificationsquad please play more ironsights you abssolute legend also get the p90 tr it shoots and kills fast seen a few videos of this game lately looks good shame my shite pc wouldnt be able to run it come on gary only 9 subscribers left for 400k react to korean billy glasgow dialect part two pls marley why does it look like this games refresh rate is like 2hz looks good but damn they need to work on the net code and refresh rate what surprise another great vid ive got about 300 hours into ironsight now its a fun game the time to kill looks so slow never been in a video mate youre still a beast though liked the vid but it would have been good to hear a bit of how the game feels and what you think of it when its in your hands i know its in beta and such but maybe for the next vid yes thank you i love this game fantastic to see it getting even more truly deserved exposure if anyone is looking for a clan join warzonemafia d thats not bad actually its like a better version of homefront spliced with cod formula extra points for those who remember that game mp9 is such a nice weapon to use and k2c in of itself is already a good gun despite being a starter weapon aug is good as well you want to aim for high fire rate low recoil guns or high damage medium fire rate guns scar listen for footsteps watch your radar dont challenge a sniper with a dsr seriously dont just avoid em do not feed use lowtier streaks until youre confident that you can carry a team without a heavy need for streaks firefly is one of the best streaks since its got a high blast radius and the hellbird can turn the tides of a game if you can scare the enemy team into hiding inside support is fine as long as your team can hold up without a strong offense accuracy is everything practice your aim with bots and move faster learn the recoil patterns and adjust with the right attachments a compensator on the mg3 reduces the recoil by a lot rent weapons dont buy until you get a better idea of how it works if its good enough buy it oh would love to see more ironsight gameplay reminds me of old school proper cod when is it launching will it be on xbox top tip get some furniture for your room then your videos will sound less echoey get your ass to ikea goody guy watches content regardless if sponsored and stays true to the tuber total wank is a picky knowitall wee cunt that hates honest profit through advertising love the vid m13 i support marly even if its sponsored far and away the best freetoplay fps ive played its a refreshing change of pace from a lot of the modern teambased

lets hear it for the notificationsquad notificationsquad loving the video marley 38th viewer ironsightificationsquad notigang even in in the middle of class love your vids so much ironsightssquad notificationsquad got here in seconds notification squad boysssss eyyyyy nonifiication thanks for the info marley might check it out bro notificationsquad btw notification squad lady yo notificationsquad marley it cant be the best until its on all platforms you know whats funny this looks infinitely better than black op 4 which i unfortunately played the open beta for guns have recoil but they also have aimcone for some retarded reason theres no more grenades the only grenade is a frankenstein flashstunconcussion and you have to sacrifice a loadout slot to equip one of these grenades small edit there are grenades but you can only pick either a lethal a tactical or special equipment you cannot have both frags and stuns at the same times and if you want to use special equipment you dont get any grenades tomahawks are still a thing but they require a full second between the button press and the throw but also the max throw distance is about 15 feet scorestreaks are doubled and changed rcxd is now the cheapest scorestreak requiring 6 kills without dying to achieve uavs are 8 theyve attempted to go for a realistic graphic style instead of the slightly cartoonish black ops we all knew and loved looks cool ive been getting bored of rust lately i had seen this a while ago definitely interested but i forgot and never took the leap saw a ad for this was going to message you about it there was a chinese cod remake ages ago and i think its this but its english you have to grind so so much bc its a free game nice video and i am also playing ironsight great

i just bought and installed the game the water is frozen no animation after maxing the graphics options the water is still frozen any ideas minecraft inspired you mean dwarf fortress inspired rimworld minecraft this just looks like a different stonehearth from the first few minutes i cant really get past the having to go up and down on the terrain its kind of annoying other than that the game is pretty cool you never want to use raw resources because crafting them into walls create more output than input so basically by using raw resources youre guys have to dig up 50 more stuff does this support lan multiplayer gameplay looks like a uglier version of stonehearth is there a population cap i dont see this start surviving the winter lol reminds me of rimworld so this is 3d rimworld attacked by a bunny muuuuust not make cheap movie reference i shall resist i can do it bhaaaah somebody get brother maynard and his holy hand grenade i feel cheap now this game is fusion of minecraft and rimworld hey nook the first three holes you dug were only one block deep and you adjusted it to two blocks but didnt fix the original holes so when you tried to place the still in those original rooms it wouldnt fit because they werent deep or high enough this is really rimworld inspired than minecraft go check the game this is just a rimworld clone wheres the uniqueness more like rimworld inspired thank you for saying inspired too many you tubers say shit like minecraft colony builder game looks like the game ive been dreaming of its a shame that the character art isquestionable minecraft inspired literally rimworld 3d great channel 1648 was that monty pythons bunny i remember when you showed this to us the first time nook it caught my attention so i supported it on kickstarter when that failed i waited for steam early access and bought it then i like to support games like this and this one especially appealed to me for some reason but who knows if ill ever get time to play it ive got so many games already thanks to you mostly lol 655 cutting a tree in background tree falls over then she does haha awesome the instant that you selected some blocks and some little people started digging i felt like this was a very intriguing cross between minecraft and dungeon keeper ill definitely be keeping an eye on this game diamonds diamonds on the soles of her shoes it actually looks very much like timber stone still was red because it takes 2 zlevels and you only dug out one looks like an upgraded verson of the game towns added it to my wish list thanks for the gameplay hey nook so i wanted to ask out of all the df clonesinspired games youve played which do you think is the bestmost developed must play or funniest this stonehearthknonmoria or another i would more call it a 3d rimworld hae instead of minecraft like minecraft inspired round heads all lies and slander soo just saw an ad for something called palms it think its a cult of raving lunatics im not sure but it terrified me i dont know what it is but nope the character portraits could have looked like anything the dev wanted he went with this mix this game with rimworld and dwarven fortress and i wouldnt be able to get a job anymore xddd forest mushrooms let you make drinks early game just throwing it out there you may see my name in the game no joke maybe youll get me as one of your peoples would love to see more of this way too many of these type of games its a decent game and i like to play the game but i would like to wait until this become popular hopefully the game got some substantial and competent updates from the last time i played it was technically playable but it was an utter disaster ill found out myself soon enough since i managed to get my steam key from itchio edit nope still a disaster will wait for better updates as time goes on combat is currently atrocious sort of minecraft and stoneheart together hopefully this has been well updated just starting the vid first is he ever gonna continue this found few games like rimworld 1factoria 2 battle royale tycoon 3 mindustry 4queens wish the conqueror 5 prison architech 6 judgment apocalypse survival simulation 7 shortest trip to earth 8 first feudal 9 keplerth 10 citiesskyline 11 planet coaster 12 space heaven 13 rise to ruins 14 oxygen not include 15 parkitech 16 starship corporation 17 king under the mountain 18 dwarf fortress 19 civitatem have fun i love rimworld so much thats why i search games like it then i came up to this vid and i starting to love it too keep it up sir they should make the camera more useful i would really like to see this game in like 23 years and see how it develops this might be one of my few bought games because i love rimworld and stonehearth i think one is highest priority and four is lowest i dont like the z levels very frustrating also i want to be able to tell my colonists what to do directly so sad tat none mention stonhearth in similiarity what about stonehearth rimworld minecraft you mean i can control a unit on 1st and 3rd person view please say yeshh beds is the first item in your research tree it seems to be a theme in games like these that if you dont have a bed to sleep in your sleeping patterns are automatically bad so its never just bad sleep its bad sleep at random times lol this games is too boring would have loved to see your first hour but great to see you finaly in here from velsh82 btw you have been more lucky in your start here then iv been im my last 5 starts been attacked by bugs from start or first gathering dangit kage everytime i stop by your channel i see another game i have to buy started back in the early days of 7 days to die i laughed so hard the second you said new game its been on ea on itchio for a year says youtube p and dont mind me just being pedantic it looks a lot like dwarf fortress which i like very much never got attached to the extremely simple graphics do they plan to keep the blocky style not a super fan of the minecraft style this game looks like timber and stone its like a indepth version of stonehearth kage play life after please i really fell like that is a lot of tmg games it wasnt bad wasnt great but they do have some no great ones i have imhotep and i like the theme better so i will wait on this one looks like fun though particularly revolution i seem to remember your proper admission that dubarrys similar courtier was definitely better than revolution reminds me of imhotep phillip dubarry games never seem play tested or developed though they might be to be honest the theme of revolution doesnt attract me at all so a game like this with a more palletable theme for me is quite interesting philip dubarry also did black orchestra coutrier spirits of the rice paddy rice dice and eminent domain battlecruisers the cubes are not red green blue and yellow at least yup theyre pink green blue and yellow d i think i will pass this and continue to play founders fortune so pretty much if you are a loner and have no friends to play minecraft you get this game lol r u kidding me highest prio is 5 and not 1 that explains alot yeah people where talkin about how the main menu is rimworlds repainted and the sleeping sounds stolen from oxygen not included ah hello again splattercat everytime i look for gameplay on a new game i like the look of its always you keep up the good work pal oldmanyellsatcloud wait thats also an old meme i just got the game today at embarkgame sitei am loving it thx splatty great video as always hello splattercat you should play a serie of this game i would love to see a how to or what not to do before i get it my self its crazy annoying how oblivious splattercat this is whay i like splatter so much he dusent spent all his time talking about the game he also trys and if you ask me and manny of his other viewers succeeds at connecting with his audience ps pleas excuse my poor spelling imma add my brewing and dodging skills to my resume too i agree splattercat the meme quality is pure garbage these days there are a few good ones but most of them are shit last for a month and are forgotten memes back in the day stayed for like half a year to a full year if it really was a good one that title screen looks exactly like rimworld a little like rimworld and im sold theres still interesting new stuff on newgrounds but i think the awesome animators that do weird shit are not as prominent as they were inthe early 2000s hmmm im gonna check homestarnunner splat try stonehearth i think itd be right up your alley i used to be on newgrounds and albinoblacksheep like 15 years ago now so many awesome little games from those sites and such ridiculous content oh yeah funnyjunk was pretty great too lol old man splattercat in my days the internet was the shit lets contine this ples as i am wanting more data to be gathered form it befor i get it jeez that game is ugly isnt this game stuck at version 3 or something the net was waaaay better when badgers ruled this game is no longer available for purchase its end goal fell short so it has been cancelled you could sign up for one of the tiers they have listed on the page but these tiers dont come into effect until embark actually gets released so supporting it at this point is not advisable if you want your money to go somewhere this really needs to be brought up in splats video because right now he makes it seem like you can still get the game that work menu looked like a direct port of rimworld reminds me more about stonehearth then rimworld to be honest hey splat you have the dig tool set a 2 deep in the upper left corner this game was looking interesting last year hopefully they added stuff and made it more stable id like to see more of this looks like a really interesting game the graphics are nice and it seems like a refreshing take on the genre this genre has to be the most stuck in eaabandoned genre ever i guess id like to know why i should spend money and play this over rimworld because this looks like its just3d rimworld remindme 10 months so many new videos so many of the same thing i dont even know who to blame anymore is the indi sector just making rimworldteraria clones or are they splatters preference and we see so many of those 1 tools need a head and a handle so to say the head can be either stone blocksnot raw stone or metal 2 u left a bed as a hospital bed 3 water can move but it loses water as it does and depending on how much the source has decides how far it go 4 when it rains water deposits will get some water based on how much surface area but there is a cap 5 to see how much water a deposit has u hit the water icon then click on it only salt water is infinite 6 same with farming dont place to many mining or they get overwhelmed and other jobs will get missed 7 when building check the materials as u will wind up using a material to build a wall that u didnt plan to use u wastned your little stone u had that was needed for stone blocks for tools on the wall 8 on mining the skill they have decides if u get materials or not from the block so i u have a skill 1 guy mining he might get stuff 1 out of every 10 blocks where a skilled guy will get items every time 9 fyi enemies can what is this called wanna see raptor do rimworld aha rimworld in 3d raptor for the stroage it said use ballers in the live stream this is my first live ever this game looks fun i hope you keep streeming this i would love to see what you come up with when you figure this game out i like how in depth it is it mustve been some nine years old who suggested minecraft when are you going to upload the next anno 1800 campaingn video yay my first live with you first like and then watch hello and good morning raptor reminds me of cubed rimworld 1 fyi food spoils 2 dont try to grow 999999 plants at 1 time u plant x then plant x more once finish in your game your guys gonna speed 99 the time farming and 1 doin gother jobs due to sheer size of farmu also dont ave that many seeds 3 they have kids u do get a few if u clear camps thou 4 and yes the lost though u had of if u can make a freezer yep u can 5 do not set entier zones to plant everything cause some plants u get far more seeds than others so u will wond up with tons of wheat and just a few berrires make rows for each plant type so u know u keep enough of each wow this looks really awesome big bug fix thats missing is trading if you trade a prisoner the game crashes 70 of the time really like the game though hopefully itll be optimized and more fixes to come looks promising but wouldnt you consider scripted videos so the devlogs could tell more information in less time anyway keep it up the game looks really cool this looks great how complicated is this to make compared to maybe a shooter or plat former great work on the update loving this game keep up the good work great update mate the rail way system looks pretty good and practical also diagonal paths are a nice addition d and yeah unitys shadowsystem is a mess for games like ours xd nice job yeah i was intrigued by this from the start well from my start when i first saw a preview ive got so many games to play that i havent even installed this one yet but im still enthused about it man its great to see you doing videos and stuff about the updates the updates look great wow this is super ambitious looks great looks good im excited for this to continue development ive been hankering for a 3d colony survivalmining game looking good keep up the hard work just out of curiousity are you going to continue this or start a new series never knew the children learning from parents thing thanks was going to cut out the beginning but decided i just want to leave all the lets play series unedited and raw hq version is still being processed so please be patient on that this is an awesome game very thought video given to us from experience and the most adorable voice well done keep it up in this video my friend who helps me with the editing tried a new approach to the video more memes its definitely a video that takes a lot more time and effort to edit so thanks a lot for the great job please me know if you guys like this approach or if you like our original style better thanks thamks for your video your tutorials are brilliant that you for sharing hi mate thanks for your video tutorials question im setting up a troop insertion mission and being escorted by ai uh1 gunships how do i make the gunships loiter in the troops disembark area and provide cover also the same gunships upon becoming winchester or bingo fuel how do i have them fly to a nearby farp to refuel and rearm rather than the original base of departure and continue with the ongoing mission thanks good job my only query with sudo embarking or disembarking of troops with ground vehicles and triggers is it doesnt cater for casualties ie if you have 10 troops moving towards a truck and 3 get killed in combat enroute using triggers if you dont have some clever logic somewhere you will activate the next group with 10 troops again how do you disembark troops with a human helo pilot amazing job with the tutorials keep em coming thank you very much for this tutorial this answered a problem i was having just last week with a similar mission need i got it seems a little bit different now and in the german translation it is also a little bit confused in the radio menu in fact its well hidden under f7 decent the distribution to the transporting aircraft at the disembarking point seems to be mandatory duration is not necessary in fact more than necessary may brace the function it seems there is much more on functionality planned but not worked out yet hey good job and thanks for the video which version of dcs are you using im flying the actual open beta the last update 19 juli 2018 but embarking disembarking is still broken in fact disembarking is not available at all nice one will use it thank you again will this game be like rimworld but with unlimited map traveling no minimap bullshit i wanna buy this on steam i want to buy a game but i do not have a payment card can i make a purchase by bank transfer i spent years with timber stone and when i saw embark i was excited again when will i get an early version of steam nice to see ya still going after ks mate ill be keeping a eye on it p does this have multiplayer and if it does does it have a dedicated server looking good i am grumpy my new channel name fans so which ones of your characters will you make super ugly embark developers yes why play this and not rimworld hope that isnt the final iteration of the gameworld looks quite bleak 310 314 no dude you need a wood stockpile a woodstock pile is something else entirely p how would you compare this to dwarf fortress will it have entire civilizations or is it just focused on your settlers cant you just dig an underground house it looks like it would be way faster than building would it count as house for them also have you tried making wheat flour and seeing if it counts to make basic meals because raw wheat does not how to i connect still to water building a well inside a fruitwell see what happens is there any way for water to return into the game since im planning on playing one game for a long time ill at some point run into the issue of all lakes being drained etc i noticed some kind of river thingy draining veeery quickly probably because of the heat will i have to rely on fruit juice then does this still work the same way you have to connect more then one pump together then attach it to the windmill for power video seems to cut off a bit early you were right in the middle of saying something gamewise what about rivers and streams i know a standard dwarf fortress tactic is to start off next to one i know a few of my favorite forts have been near natural waterfalls great game great guide good depth and cool intro thx do you also stream this game or do you just make tutorial videos let me know if you have questions about anything in this video or if you want a video on another topic first video in a long time leave some feedback good or bad you guys rock seems like rim world in 3d but not so good is this one in steam shale would not make a very good weapon such an interesting game any release date does noone notice the weird twins 3200 this kinda reminds me of sims meets minecraft meets banished so this is basically stonehearth why is this not on steam this the first video ive seen on this game and 8 mins in i want it already if not for the settlers sort of reminder i get from this then definately for the dungeon keeper theme mod im envisioning this having cant wait to get a pc to at least play these types of games nice gameplay idea hes tiny lolthey looked normal on the long run over the monkey got bored he thought they was petting him so he went to sleep i have longed to see a rim world and timber and stone prodigy child come about i so badly want to see a finished product on this it just seems like the kickstarter is not going to make it at only 20 and so little time left kickstarter page says that the game will not be developed if it does not make its full quota either so sad because it looks so good for being so early its like watching tv show friends with gameplay rimworldsims thanks again for showing off the game just stayed up almost all night watching your channel love the content leave it to nook to take every fortress and city building game and twist it and turn it into a new version of dwarf fortress really trying to like this game for its gameplay there are some nice light and shadow effects but these depressing landscapes and especially those weird character portraits are giving me a hard time doing so so hows performance rimworld is 2d and still has issues starting around midgame im a bit concerned everything else i see is great for sure i do wish the world map was a lot cleaner so that you can adjust the geographical section you are choosing all the landing sites are so hilly and unmanageable especially when you first land and have only one axe or one hoe maybe had selections for small hills valley flatlands cliffside and the like having a huge chasm in the middle of your kids running around cutting trees does not seem like what good parents should be letting their kids do remember to read the screen before you click buttons as there is a word quality and quantity they are different words and mean different things one is for degree of durability ie good bad excellent and the other word is for how many of an item you need builtcreatedcookmade make sure you are clicking the correct button before you get out of the screen this game looks great so far hopefully the kickstarter gets a bit more support id love to see it finished youre not following some of the basics you learned from df just like how you work to prevent caveins those floating bits of dirt should have been marked as dont mine except for the strip furthest from their access point so you can work your way backwards the cellar was mined out in a way that removes the floor in the kitchen entrance which could be covered over with stairs you can tell when youre mining out a floor by the way the block is seen instead of unseen when in the slice view speaking of stairs the cellars access point is a one blocktall spot which you blocked with stairs if you remove those stairs and dig back one more block on each level the stairs should have room to be placed while still allowing access to the cellar my friend those trees you thought were set for cutting are fruit trees set for harvest spoiler alert the still was still not working they were researching p research doesnt require a water source brewing does i like this game please more patrick can go and fuck himself he didnt left ea he was forced to quit hes cursed by god gamers you guys should really have paid someone the 2030 bucks to put those posters in the frame properlywhat youve done to that witcher poster is killing my soul whatever patrick soderlund does and wherever he now goes is cursed the next cliffy b ant colony simulator ha ha ha i believe the combat needs a little more work although monkeys cycling on invisible bikes over the heads of other monkeys and people is quite a skill that was hilarious d also f there was a checkbox in graphics called metric so you are probably in imperial units love these fortress games streams no thumbnail well this certainly makes daddy moist uwu when is the dwarf fortress livestreams usually the character models at 0546 all seem to scream please kill me i asked about those stockpile priorities they correspond to job priority and not location priority so not likerimworld at all in this case default pause is button just to the left of number 1 in top row of keyboard spacebar is much more natural and easy will you be playing anno 1800 the game looks great great video man ill be continuing this playthrough on stream via youtube later today at 500 pm est look forward to seeing you there why do you assume that you know how something works when you have just started playing and is completely ignorant every time a streamer say something is a bug it is always because they are clueless according to the game tutorial breeding require double beds in rooms how much it costs 2423 seeing shybo sleep on the ground under the bed made me laugh so much i dont think furniture works like in rimworld they cant walk over them maybe thats the reason why they couldnt access the beds or build the walls behind it i guess it actually needs a space between each bed bit pricey for a 03 alpha not really much of a look its more like looking at the headlights of a car but being too lazy to walk the length of it to see the rest the game has an evolving world so the game play evolve from the first few hours to many hours later you didnt even make it past one entire season of the world make a mine to get stone instead of running over half the map to get it man i bet randomise would probably love rise to ruins another fun citysurvival game well im the second then i bet im the first comment here people really need to play a game first before they make a video on it this way they look less like a dumbass so not one person noticed that this is a cheap rimworld ripoff even the screen layouts are the same why is it minecraft in the description lol that game is unpolished buggy and needs a lot of work but it seems fun yes more from this thanks and here i thought u were a gamer never played df why i never good news its coming to steam sometime with graphics and sound now the entire world can play the game of legends seems like they only haul food yeah thats what happens when your stockpile is assigned to raw food in touch with the ground im on the hunt im after you smell like i sound im lost in a crowd and im hungry like the wolf dwarf fortress is an awesome game with unbelievable depth and detail this game has quite a few similarities and looks very appealing as always thank you for your time and effort colony building without autosave wow hmm it looks like a real neat game shame it still has so many glitches i think ill keep it on my radar see if the devs improve it the icon is the spaceshipescape capsule that is crashing you to the planet good honest review need more of that i am looking for a colony builder but theyre all either too barebones or discontinued ill keep looking rimworld also has a limit to room size if you go too big eventually it says that it is outside instead i watched all three videos and found them to be very helpful looking forward to ep 4 you didnt need to look at the parents to see which traits the child would get when hovering over the buttons to choose which parent the tool tip said which traits the child would get for each selection it only takes these people 8 days to make a baby geebus reminds me of minecraft why you put the wall on the dog so you only have 6 colonists cant there be more hey nookrium i know this is a little old for new comments now but i would really like you to play a bit more of this game or do a few elisodes when they get a update done so many people are being foolish and saying its a ripoff but it could really be special if they improve on the ai factions and the family andor research system i know i am just one guy but it would be most appreciated if you did a few follow ups for this game every now and again love your choice in games thanks for sharing your passion with us nook you wont get cancer from walking over a patch of lead for it to affect you you have to either eat it or breathe it in even then it doesnt cause cancer but it does cause brain damage among other things wow fuckin really rimworld much smh 075 speed for best results if i gave you my postal address could you send me some of your poo so that i could eat it please this is just a rip off of rimworld except its 3d and shit how is this not 3d rimworld it just looks so much like minecraft i guess if i started playing it i would say im playing mc now i have played dwarf fortress though the blocky terrain looks ugly at least the characters arent the same 24 bucks yeah no thanks buddy omg gotta get this tomorrow heya nook if you get a chance check out seeds of resilience on steam turn based survival type game looks pretty good and seems people are enjoying it would love to see a lets play or a video or two thanks buddy keep up the good work stonehearth meets rimworld d i am waiting so desperately for it d join the embark community httpsdiscordggvje7gck hiya nook grumpyoldgamerreviews here i just rebranded watching the video now keep up the good work poke me on discord i think i need a reinvite to your room do they have moods which affect them why the hell isnt this on steam im not buying it till it comes to steam is this a 3d rimworld it seems to operate exactly like rimworld and im all for our being 3d and awesome the thing i really dont like is the reasearch tree df doesnt need it without that is the kind of df i was expecting putting aside the menu screen this doesnt come across like a ripoff of anything else but it still seems kind of uninspired really in particular it doesnt really seem like the dimensionality is actually adding much to the game in contrast to dwarf fortress for instance 3d rim world hope its just as varied rim world has thousands of items because of mods i was just doing a search and watching older version of this game yesterday how nice to see that you were doing to same thanks a bunch oh its another rimworld boy i already got worried we wouldnt get one this week this game looks 100 percent better then it did back in january of this year when it was in kickstart there is a good discord community and a lot of folks will help you the dev is active and tends to address issue bare in mind the same question over and over again from lots of folks might tend to get ignore on the base it has been answer before this game looks nice and while it is kind of like stone hearth in a lot of ways it is better and less frustration on the fact that stone hearth has been doing this over 2 years and this is as good or better with less then 12 year you mileage may very most things have been reworked the research has been over hauled from what it was at the first of the year and so has the over all look of the world i thought i saw wood construction on the research menu when you briefly opened it up i hope this game wont be abandoned like timber and stone and other same genre games it really has a lot of potential for real dwarf fortress inspired even the dam starting menu is a ripoff of rimworld and this game in itself is a ripoff or rimworld where can u get this game i really like it the 700th rim world copy cat ahhhw shiet another one of these games watching this i want to embark on a quick journey from a top of a building destination pavement my 10 year old pc probably cant run this so i think ill stick to playing rimworld and minecraft one at a time lel gotta say dislike first comments but like rest of vid play more rimworld instead when the first episode of the long dark appears this game looks so cool and also kind of reminds me of stonehearth if u look at it also i just watched the tiberium rim series again because i remembered that i had watched it and you put hunter in it i wanted you to try this game d just waiting for nouc to kill everyone and eat them dude i didnt know you liked minicrat me neither rimworld rocks so much you can do o no the evil creatures will come out at night and eat you reminds me of rimworld minecraft stonehearth embark youre making great progress you should be proud of yourself thumbs up for jerry bean man my question is simple i keep seeing these games saying dwarf fortress simulation inspired but they never get the simulation part down does the game create its own entire history just before the player gets started if this was on steam i would buy it right now some1 tell the devs to put it on steam already if i wanted 3d dorf fort id open stonesense i want more hello smelly rimmy how tf did you get the game i want to review it stonehearth is like a more developed funded version of this but way more indepth have you tried gnomoria it also fufills the role of a 3d df quite well with a better ui since im assuming youve never played it id say stonehearth over minecraft in style fuck yeah jerry beans man jerrybeans who is it jerry beansman or jerrybeans man jerry bean man what in the fuck did i miss while i was at work why the fuck are you called jerry bean man i thought i accidentally subscribe to some random person i want to jerry your beans man jerry fucking beans man is god fucking jerry beans man jerry beans man for prime minister who tf is jerry beans man yay jerry uploaded 010 too few jerry beans man too much black luster soldier jerry beans man you should make that your meme channel new name but why hiii jerry im watching ur stream thanks jerry who the fuck are you how you havent got millions of subs i dont know not long though mate youre doing good also using brave to give support im using 6gb but still cant play i dont have cards huhuh i even lower the settings oh lel minecraft nice game is it as taxing on the cpu as df i couldnt play a game in 2018 that has such lowresolution graphics like minecraft even if the concept is good looks coolid get it when it hits steam and has more going on hope it goes wellnot sure if i would ever buy another early accses title thoas most go into the trash by their own dev team a year on steam if thatbut i think i would buy this anywaylol not a fan of the minecraft blocks rimworld minecraft great concept but i just dont like the minecraftstyle that is has i am convinced that this game does not get far because of 3d looks super clunky you are able to build the still you are just trying to put it in a wall you have to put it in an area that you can place it lol basically one of those shitty dwarf fortress clones this used to be on greenlight on steam but steams greenlight appears to have been discontinued so what happened with the steam launch then so sick of any game where the world is made of blocks being compared to minecraft its nothing like minecraft this is awful completely devoid of content meanwhile i can count too many other similar games that are already well established with more content than you could ever go through in a lifetime banished rimworld etc i just cant stomach these blocky games maybe if the blocks were smaller but i havent seen one yet that i could stand to look at it for more than 5 minutes and this one is no different looks gnomoria with a better interface i would give it a try hi try heroes of annihilated empires minecraft rimworld so just a glorified mod of mine craft so rimworld looks like a gay minecraft mod games like that they are awesome but they are missing most when have no multiplayer im getting more of a gnomoria vibe out of it too bad the dev dropped gnomoria and disappeared any one have any idea where he went yeah this is just a ripoff of rimworld will buy it when it enters steami buy only steam games oethis looks like a nice game rimworld 3d its like minecraft and oxygen not included minecraft rimworld embark how many blocks deep is the world and when will it be on steam youtube thinks this is minecraft i mean yeah this seems too much like rimworld ill pass this game looks interesting i think it could be what gnomoria failed to be im a little concerned though because it seems like it might not meet the goal i dont think i ever want to hear the word still again look what nice df ripoff imo the terrain looks very busy its also very hard to tell whats what and very easy to lose where things are this is bull when do they start killing eachother and harvesting organs i would not be surprised if the map is literally a texturemodded minecraft map lmao i call this incest simulator this is just scifi gnomoria the characters look like they were created by feminists they were created to be as ugly as humanly possible just like modern feminists sadly i wished it was more like anno thanks for the video nook rimworld kenshi dwarf fortressand now this i mean i love rimworld and i would love kenshi even moreif not for the bugs but somebody has to shuffle this games before they become stale i propose a 4x type strategy colony mangerwhaat u say basically rimworld but when it comes time to expand you expand exponentially with tech trees massively improving your life and building a serious not only colony but city that has diplomacy with neighboring cities i guess i have inspirations from spore most idle game and a android game called the homeless goreally good btw where its not only struggle and struggle with some moments of peace like rimworld the game would be struggle make a huge push relax and enjoy after your victory and after a good while new problems arise basically here is some low level design you start as lvl 1 crash landercurrent goals food shelter not being in a shitty situation problems defend from wildlife and minor tribes and ga looks interesting though i would prefer a less minecrafty aesthetic this is so like timber stone with stonehearth thrown in the former was abandoned the latter went stagnant looks like crap might be good if u like minecraft graphics nice thanks for showing the game rimworld anyone so initial thoughts coming up some skeptical criticism involved but still hopeful this turns out good currently everything screams very lite dwarf fortress with easier to memorise controls and 3d renderer in other words like dwarf fortress a couple of existing mods not that thats a bad thing in itself ive seen a few wonderful games build upon inspirations like these but does it do anything unique with its inspirations and does it have to in order to stay relevant and fun this is the important part if its fun and relevant to gamers today it can be mostly forgiven for taking heavy inspiration heck taking inspiration is what gave us many of the greatest classic and modern games of all time like how rimworld lives and breathes in its beautiful scifispacewestern niche using the mechanics to good effect while giving an entirely new and freshfeeling experience with an emphasis on directing a deep story experience without alienating players t this is a dwarf fortress meets cringe youtube thinks this is dwarf fortress and while i dont think the two games are identical that makes a nice metaphor for my biggest criticism of the game it lacks its own identity its too much like stonehearth rimworld dwarf fortress and all the other games in that genre it has elements from each of them remixed a bit but not in a way that makes it its own product i can only assume theyre trying to do that genre better than anyone before them has or at least trying to pick what they liked best from each game while leaving out anything they dont think is important but that doesnt leave them with enough of an identity why would i play embark over the other basebuildingsurvival games which i own and am already familiar with i think youll have to build a court system to handle all those flirting chipmunks something troubling is about to happen starting a civilisation with 9 people i smell incest this game looks very silly and great wow you find so many cool games dude good stuff isnt sims completely in dwarf fortress anyway i wanna see you keep playing this and eventually have the whole world covered the stone texture is terrible or are those gravels ehrf what are you you are potatoes will be keeping an eye on this one i really wish i could get over df ui but find it makes the game a pain to play reminds me of the wonderful but abandoned timber stone its more like rimworld in a dwarf fortress setting i havent played stone hearth but from what i seen i wouldnt consider my self impressed rimdwarfs have much more replayability so if this is anything like those i wouldnt mind seeing more of what this game can do series leon is so dreamy i am a bit weary about games that have been in development for 2 years are this complete and then go to kickstarter why not just greenlight on steam i think i will wait for the steam version too many scams going on kickstarter kickstarter has become a den for developers who have half finished games and dont plan on completing them so they kickstarter them to grab as much money as they can before they close down development sorry for the cynicism but that is unfortunately the truth of the matter this should probably use smooth voxels for the terrain its very jarring the massive blocks meets smooth polygons clash of aesthetics minecraft rimworld and if you are going to play this game remember your starting crew have to be under 30 years old so that they can reproduce many times over so that your community can grow i hope you will do this game justice as just like rimworld you have to build a home for these little guys although it is not as fleshed out as rimworld it has promise all but a slower start and longer days before you can get a base up and running i hope the dev has made some progress on this game as it has been a long time coming for a better playing game anything sorta rimworld is sorta fun thanks for sharing backed very interested till i saw the minecraftlike map not for me this one theres so many of these kinds of games recently i cant imagine any of them doing it well i think youve built the woodshop but not the workshop thats why you couldnt build the still its amazing what reading the popups will do for you as even though ive never heard of this game i already know youd need a workshop to make a still p im here to affirm that this game as early as it is is extremely solid heck its more playable than most of the stuff pushed on early access and this is the first test build please consider supporting this guy everyone he is a very meek and humble individual and will be completing the game no matter the campaign outcome you can get your hands on a build at a 22 pledge and make sure to join us in discord too spread the word edit thanks for covering this nook you da man so stonehearth meets minecraft nookrium please my last question can you tell me games that similar to cdda or caves of qud the shadows of the objects are cool nook it is not yet on steam first i only subbed for the angels in the outfield references this looks more like a worse version of rimworld and stonehearth mixed together but better graphics and a larger worldmap jen is all about the f oh rahdoyour videos are awesome that moment just made me laugh put loud situational comedy looks cool but so does other 1000 bgs all reviewers should do us a favor and review only games which make a difference whats the point of making a noise with hundreds of mediocre games are you going to play this again you need to check out timber and stone similar style of game but less micro management im curious if youre continuing the series id like to see how the updates improve the overall gameplay and qol experiance the game itself seems very promising if develpoped properly ever consider digging into the ground for sheltered housing btw the building style is akin to dwarfcorp httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp252390dwarfcorp with complicated details similar to oxigennotincluded httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp457140oxygennotincluded the priority numbers should have a larger range like either 09 or 099 hey love your videos if its anything like rim world set the other things they arent doing to priority 0 and then set one person to do certain tasks at 10 priority like designated workers looks like it might be worth looking into this game first heart pls hey man nice video one question do you prefer a dev who makes small but very frequent updates or one who goes for bigger but less frequent ones please dont be like those other gaming channels take your time and understand the game is no way those to dig orders will be made you got to levels underneath those big orders they cant reach him so you have to understand the game the depth that you put is the depth you get theres no changing that unless you catch it yourself and you cant catch it because youre moving too fast im love n this game sorry to say this but i think stonehearth is better this game is like timberstone only 6k out of 30k funded ouch yo zueljin any plans to revist kingdom new lands with the new dlc dropping i like the look of it might get it but want to see how it play out first plz do more ty zueljin gaming if you like this game give stonehearth a try in my opinion its a great game stonehearth that is 3d dwarf fortressthats a bold claim one i dont think any game can come close to fulfilling ill have to keep an eye on this to see if it can come close to dwarf fortress complexity a paused dig planning would be helpful if its not already in place in the game humm this is somewhat fancier timber and stone with mass effect choices this game looks cool id like to see some more of it why dont you address zueljin as me if u put this on steam i will buy it today i agree with some of the other comments we definitely need more trees for cutting into planks and for the carpenter right now there are far too few and it takes forever for the carpenter to create simple planks and sticks please speed up these very basic tasks i can never get the carpenter to maintain 30 planks or even 10 because it seems to take him so long to make 1 in my opinion the very starting task like planks sticks blocks tea should be done very fast also why can we not designate a water spot perhaps make a well for drinking i hate have colonist die of thirst when there is a big pool of water close by but since i dont have tea they die of thirst i know its early but have you thought about populating water with fish and we could catch these fish for food it seems very logical enjoying the game and looking forward to more progress thank you cool game took me for ever to figure out how to get more people i guess you just needed them to mate if you run out of trees how do you get more of them whould be nice if the trees dropped seeds and you could re plant them also as far as the workstation go it would be nice if each one told you what profession uses that workstation ive never gotten to point where my base looks liek the one above in the video i always run out of food or drink you are really talented good sir really like the automation aspect of the game in another note any chance you make a pirate themed title d ok i have been following the gameplay online here are a few things i have noticed maybe needed a better game spawn trees water flat land or more points to build a better starting tribecrew add more detail of skills and traits to the player ui night time too dark for youtube add a healers workshop to early game shorten build time for starting workshops i hope this was helpful cant wait to play for myself yay a baby every time i see games like this i always need to know if the settlers can have a baby its important to telling the stories i saw that embark has windmills to power waterpumps but doesit has waterwheels powerstations jarred is a very distinct and opinionated newborn really like this series you should definitely make more more often well dont know about this game if i want to build with water close cuzz on the way there they all get killd by wildlife hope they fix tht if not then i say dont buy this game ever even while exquisite it was a rotten tomatoe like this game hope you can do some building above the dirt too to show that of too though xd after watching this i had to buy it you make everything look fun heh i can barely afford to watch you keep it up nook you are my favorite youtuber definitely going to get embark looks very interesting this game is great ok confusing af crappy ui etc etc but damn it really is df meets rimworld in 3d xd good series thanks this is more timber and stone than rimworld 033 thats the banyo rigth there r u pinoy hope this game will be finished and not follow timber and stone way i love timber and stone even if it was abandonned its a great game form the shitty graphics and your insane blathering im not impressed you should try to zoom in and show the game play instead of jumping around the screen assuming we all know whats going on also can you shut up a bit pls you may like your voice a lot i think its silly rimworld still looks better and that seems a bit of a lost oppertunity when you have like dwarf corp and stoneheart weapons get weapons for your dwellers they will be attacked pretty soon so get weapons made please or else you will die and get a distillery and pump so you can pump fresh water from a freshwater area not the ocean secluded water areas yay you found it designate the depth of your digging in the upper lefthand corner of your screen ever since minecraft first came out this is what i always wanted to see from it and nowits here this looks so good but ive been burned before ill keep an eye on it but we will see thanks for showing it off anyways why isnt this on steam so the hubby and i picked this up after watching you got one question how the hell do you rotate your view looks cool but its not on steamif its a ea game ill pass cause those all suck hey i am more than forest carpet dont judge me you dont know me i dont play many games like this one but im watching two playthroughs of this atm and gotta say it looks really interesting feeling the hype hope they continue to do good work on it im not saying this game is bad concept is solid but the graphics are dog shit this seems pretty neat this game is like stonehearth but more realistic and minecrafty it looks good but 25 is a bit steep for a title like this especially this extremely early in development 10 would be far more reasonable there was abandoned game timber and stone with similar mechanics i loved it maybe it is my future awesome rimworld meets minecraft meets dwarf fortress would love to see more i backed the game so why cant i download it 245 gah kill it with firehrmm i mean the artwork of you crew really could use some cleanup tbh lol when he said that piece of ship was the bano i thought it was a technical term for a ship component nope just spanish minecraft look immediate nope not going to buy what a charming little game it seems to have elements of everything i enjoy from other games as a result i guess my only concern with this one is what makes the game unique ill definitely check it out excellent thanks splatt treelivesmatters too p sometimes i feel like youre just blabbering on without knowing what you are saying just for the sake of blabbering bring back stardew valley you gave the best commentary for it bring back stardew valley it was so good splattercat please play stardew valley i think you would like it hey splattercat you should do a podcast thing your commentary would make a good podcast splatt where is stardew valley bring back stardew valley please wormhole doesnt suck anything in black holes do this game is exactly like stonehearth everytime you say rimworld it makes me wanna play rimworld would love to see you play more of this a lot more actually im pretty much already sold on it i love the character models i love that we have kids and thats one of the ways we get more citizens im hoping our citizens dont die off too quickly however would seriously love to see what is currently available to do ingame so far we can harvest basic resources and build 3 shops i also loved that they consolidate the crafting windows choosing cooking or carpentry without the makework necessity of finding and opening the right buildings window awesome are there ways to make people interact and like each other rimworld really screwed the pooch in that area what about stockpiles there were predefined stockpiles can we make custom ones i dont mind stacking lumber and stones in the same zone also a stockpile zone thats a 3x3 square occupies 9 squares does that mean itll only hold 9 items before that zone is full anyway i just want to see more game you need to change the quantity not the quality for them to make more of an item so number five its like fourth or something oh god it has a social mechanic i wonder how many fights are going to break out resulting in the loss of fingers and limbs i dont wanna play it but i wanna see u play it more this game is so pretty i hope you play a few more episodes please continue this series i want to see more of this game 3 honestly it looks way too much like minecraft for me to give the gameplay much attention you still get a like though rimworld meets minecraft the commentary seemed a little forced in this one if that makes sense idk was a little bit odd liked the video anyway id like to see some more of this game i kinda hope the developers move for marching cubes isosurface meshes or something rather than large terrain blocks in the future the minecraft big blocks look doesnt do it for me but everything else looks promising in the little bit that can be seen here do a banner lord lets play bring back maddog what a high quality minecraft mod kappa real though it looks like it also runs really really well most early access in addition to being buggy and bare bones run at like 1 fps when you get more than 30 minutes in i would like to see more of you playing embark i think it would help me to decide whether this is another timber and stone or stonehearth looks exactly like dwarfcorp hmmmm max witt thats a dope name sorta reminds of timber and stone i really miss it i wish it wasnt dead so real talk how is this game you gave us a lot to digest here and to me it seems basically like 3d rimworld with a big world one aspect where i felt rimworld was lacking how correct is that statement is it as deep and eventful as rimworld or does it just have the components of rimworld without the fun flow of events and such do things randomly happen or does the world just go boringly once it starts as you play can you find out how youre supposed to get more villagers aside from kids because if kids are the vastly main source of villagers even in the beginning it could be kinda sour instead of say convincing others in the world to join also what is the end game just make a cool fort with lots of people escape the planet beat the end lastly how do you think this stacks up depth wise to other base sims they say theres crafting with mix matching parts and thats cool but is it like wood bronze iron and then poof your done do different parts have differentmany it would be a dope track by splatt called dirt on the bag lol looks cool but the landforms on the main globe makes my poor geography heart cry maybe do 1 more episode of this whoa this game looks good keep up the good work ohi love you d best gamer of indie games d 5 th dabs hey splat have you ever heard of a game called cryptarc there is always someone in the bathroom when something goes wrong nothing better then rimworld type game notificationsquad i just loaded yt up on my tv and it said you uploaded this like 23 seconds ago right as my phone vibrated score being one of the backers of this game and a alpha tester i cant wait to get my steam key on the 18th thanks for sharing 1h to setup wtf i just started playing i have one question alt w isnt working for workflow what do i do casually naming a dwarf after the ss classy thank you for making this tutorial just playing it today you know nothing i started with learning z leves so glad i did thank you so much your video really helped me get started and im so excited to finally play this game danggood ol dwarf fortress just trolling the hell out of you huh nook 1020 heh heh 1800 this is not how you play you boost your dwarfs beforehand with those 10 points whatanidiot applies here just started playing yesterday thank you for making such awesome tutorials i was able to go from what the hell is this to competently playing as a long time rimworld player ive always been intimidated by but very interested in this game without your vids i wouldnt have gotten anywhere cheers when he dosent explaining how to move z levels an input overlay wouldve been nice often you open menus that i have no idea how to get to great vid the mod use is annoying we want to learn the core of the game your mods teach us little of what were here for did you nickname one of your dwarfs schutzstaffel fuck the ss with fire i used to play df back in 13 but i always played with no mods lnp or graphicsui mods im wanting to return to the game and still wish to play it vanilla but im curious if anything has changed with the user interface in the past 5 years ive pretty much forgotten everything i knew about how to play this game if theyre 50000 cm tall theyre far beyond a dwarf thats about 03 of a mile in american measurement very helpful for a new player like myself thank you z levels are only difficult if you dont introduce the concept straight away this game is probably the most in depth game and most alluring game i will never play the developers in their stalwart arrogance and belief that only they know what they need have been forcing stagnation in their community for years by outright refusing to create a standardised or logical ui its unfortunate because its like looking at a table of finely crafted tools that all have such obscure handles which make them impracticle or useless yet the smith refuses to redesign them because he will not recognize that his artistic handles only hinder his users thank you thank you thank you this game has been so inaccessible to me i have limited game time with a young child and in just the couple minutes you helped me with massive hurtles thank you i know this is an older video but this is really helpful and entertaining this is one of the first games where i have to invest time outside of it to learn how to even start playing it btw you are making sense in these videos i can see how confusing it is to explain the game isnt exactly intuitive but i think that trade has to be made for its complexity maybe the ui could be a little better though thank you for helping me begin to learn this impenetrable ui this game has you seriously dont know what schutzstaffel means do you nice tutorial i like the fact you have the voice of howard better call sall does he know what the schutzstaffel is thank you for your time and effort to make these tutorial videos it took me a while to get into dwarf fortress because it looked so intimidating but after watching this and listening to your explanations of every little thing and detail within the game really helped other countries use as for numbers do more df streams d i know youre a variety channel but df feels like home 3 is this still applicable in 2018 i personally find wheelbarrows really useful in the hauling of things maybe they want to encourage crop rotation 50000 cm cubed is what that said why are they measuring dwarfs by volume my graphics do not look like that they are horibal trees none lolwut i have a problem when i open the lnp dwarf fortress never plays on the center of the screen that pops up like the top of the game will be cut off this is the first video ive watched that instead of normal or faster speeds i prefer 75 so the world creation screen is not in ascii its not a problem but im curious how it happened im using phobus i think it has something to do with me changing one of the inittxt values so that i could run stonesense i havent got attacked on my first year is that weird great vid using it to learn as i play along sadly i cant get dt to work at all but hey thats one more challenge right haha maybe im weird i retry embark until i get iron sick of coppersilver only embarks i go w a minmax embark no axe no pick wood x8 olivine x5 copper ore x10 iron ore x5 cheaper bags wheelbarrowstepladderother goofy crap 2 pigs dont need to graze and i only ever find the really deep chasm caves 1 axe dwarf 1 hammer dwarf 1 broker 1 med dwarf 1 armorweapon smith 1 farmergatherer 1 carpenter broker med smithy do the mining axe hammer start trainingsparring iron helms iron weaps copper shields copper mail shirts i tend to make a lot of balls as in spiked wooden balls they sell really well and make phenomenal defenses i once saw a damn cyclops forgotten beast die to one like 4 pages of combat logs this poor poor cyclops albeit it had a mastercraft gear it was filled w 10 mastercraft spiked wooden balls yeah i play while listening tend to steal ideas and treat it more like a discussion than a tvshow type experience should i use performance tricks even when my laptop has an i7 processor i see graphics what is this heresy i have liked and subscribed it was inevitable how the hell do you find a place that doesnt have an aquifer in all of the maps i have generated there was an aquifer everywhere there were trees and i need trees halp what graphics setting is he using the way i began to understand and love this game is by having robot wars style battles in the arena how do you select the farm without mouse and how do you scroll through the plants in the farm i am using laptop no numpad key bindings just discovered this channel you are fantastic man really love your style and your thoughtful approach to your viewers thanks keep up the fantastic work wow i failed right at the start because i dont know how to scroll through the height levels and he dont says how he does it at min 2000 my dwarf therapist crashes every time i load it pls help how the hell do you get the graphics to look like that every time it zooms in to my fortress local map i just get the asci code graphics with no spirtes where the dwarves are smiley faces rather than sprites i need help my game doesnt work with mouse like his i have to press k too look at stuff i cant click anything pls help im watching this on a phone cant see a thing i never heard of this game until i played rimworld pretty cool looking you can always tell its complex when its like this with the old launcher and stuff xd also what is this music you are using it sounds pretty awesome whats with the flickering border i mean seriously wtf for me dwarf therapist wont come up help how does he have his selector on the mouse and why is zooming in also enlarges text size for me something that helps me a lot usually instead of bringing llamas and cows just bring sheep they give wool like the llamas and milk like the cows plus they need less grass to pasture hope this can be helpful to another fellow noob reminder that using texture packs makes you a noob how do u go up or down in y layers where did you get that workflow dfhack im not seeing it included in the lnp when i install mine and do everything needed it says pylnpuser doesnt exist and that i have to load a world first not only that but the df screen is always black with just sound nice so this is the latest build of df some features here ive not seen longest ive played it is a pretty stable fort but my dwarves started getting possessed and locking themselves in rooms with ridiculous demands that then led to murder sprees manually locking them into the rooms so they starved to death worked on the first one only but the later ones just broke the doors down xd mind you this was years ago idk why but i love dwarf fortress commas in some places are used in place of decimal points 52250cm 5225 cm tks for the video size of 50290 cm3 is equal to 5029 liters as you might imagine it is about volume it is about a 17 cubic feet or 13 of your average bathtub what the fuck with this game lol this is just a nostalgia trip for the first frickin games that came out wtf is with this ridiculous bullshit lmfao d jesus fkin christ the controls are a fucking joke man wtf with that bs waste of frickin time and it doesnt even have half a goddam tutorial what the shit fuckin fail lmfao d thank you so much for the tutorial fort nookrium thanks to you and you quite easy going short tutorial series and your idea to ask people to help you point out things your forget through twitch i actually started playing df for a second time in a way after the first time that i actually played through 3 forts and gave up every other time i started i just lost mood before even a season would pass now thanks to you and partially to the gemset tileset i am actually expanding again and getting ready to be once more randomly destroyed i just hope it will not happen because one of my dwarf trips another sees the blood on his knee and goes insane and kills someone and then all of them kill each other 50000 cm3 thats volume not height thank you very much very helpful for beginner like me actually miasma is an old medical belief that said that diseases where caused by smell so things that where smelly where considered to be potential transmiters of diseases to a certain degree this was correct rotting corpses do cause diseases but this theory failed to explain the existence of bacterial and other microrganisms that are the real cause of diseases funny enough the myasma theory was the cause of the creation of londons sewer system when a huge outbreak of cholera hit the city it was blamed on its odor at the time miasma theorists insisted that using the sewers would cleana the city from its repulsive odor and heal the population jhon snow who would later be the discoverer of germs challenged this theory but funny enough he agreed altrough for completely different reasons that the sewers was the solution 413 did you seriously just drink out of a mug damn you are taking the playing dwarf fortress thing seriously do you get catsplosions in this version of the game the fact that i started playing with this on one side of my screen and df on the other side and i still got incredibly lost rather quickly kinda tells something about either me or the learning curve of the game still this game is gonna be my next obsession once i get my head around it why would you not spend dwarf skill points during the embark process was it just because you just didnt feel like it for the tutorial or is there a reason behind it thank you for this tutorial 3 one of the easiest to follow how do i get it on mac because i dowloaded the starter pack as its a microsoft windows application ahem one of the dwarves is schutzstaffeler likess mmmmmhhh you always leave your front doors at two spaces wide why do you not let caravans into your fortresses ive been playing for a little more than a year so i consider myself a beginner going through all the steps in such detail is super helpful to me thanks for this lokum the first dwarf settler of the palace of the balls by the river paddedbottom this cant be anything but a great df episode nookrium i need some dwarf fortress advice built a fortress dug down to stone layer got it going pretty good military and all the basics sorted no aquifier decided to go on adventure mode and start at the fortress decided to go and explore the fortress as the adventurer went inside i kid you not 57 water in half the fort no aquifer no anything really basically do you have any idea what the crap just happened looks like it could be fun anoter game like dwarf fortress in 3d did you ever play more of this splat i think i really need to see more of this game looks good man thanks for showing it jeez its like that poor rabbit hopped up to someonethen they grabbed him and twisted his head aroundand killed him without a weapon then they left his bodyon the ground yes more please we still havent gotten to see any building or if there are raids and such i paused halfway through to back this on kickstarter d hope it makes it blueberries are dope dude i dont know if its because of gene modification or freezing or whatnot but my grandmothers blueberry bush use to give me the shits constantly because i couldnt stop eating themi loved blueberries when i was a kid theyre kind of like miniature and sweeter grapes nifty looking game enjoying the play through and your channel in general those are magical blueberries a normal blueberry bush takes two years before it begins to produce who ever u are reading this just go and subsribe if you have turn on notifications and if u have u get a cookie splat man seriously did you voice carl from llamas with hats you really sound like him hey if you love these kinds of games you might like a game called ostriv its in aloha right now but its really good so far id love to watch you play it and hear your commentary the only thing i can think is that if you blatantly stealborrowuse ideas from other more popular games then your game had better be better than those you took from i hope this is reeeeally alpha rabbit is pretty good they should have it in stores like chicken loving this game so far seems like fun timber and stone copy could you play more kingdom and castles i would like to see more but just do you i would love to see more of this game being vocal best to my abilities okay splatt this is me being very vocal please play more of this you might want to turn down the quality setting of all your crafting i can understand wanting a good quality bed for your peeps or maybe even good quality clubs but higher quality uses up alot more raw resources so making highest quality planks is a major waste same for food and tea why spend 4 mushrooms to make 1 tea right now where your extremely low on food and drink better to do 1 to 1 ratio until you get your farms producing also you can make new stockpile zones you could make 1 larger everything zone until you get things sorted out better maybe even dig some stairs downwards 3 or 4 layers and then dig out a large storage area that way food is close by but not taking up valuable real estate for buildings or you could build rooms under ground instead you said you wish you could have your peeps just drink water thats what they do when you run out of drink they will go to the nearest fresh water source and drink i love all of the little comments from the time you were doing geology its always interesting to hear small snippets of your life previous to becoming a youtuber also loving this series as the other comments say watch out for the quality slider its costing you a lot of resources i am being very vocal in my request to see more of this game i like too see where this might go so yes please make more videos the game looks like it has a lot of potential and does some things that i like that i thought rimworld missed but to do a complete copy of rimworlds priority interface but reverse the priority scale is just bad design and is arbitrary as far as the map generation goes it reminds me of very early minecraft aside from the scale early minecraft had a much more limited border there is a lot they could do with it hopefully they dont abandon the project btw mushrooms have different farming methods some better then others for different varieties its actually pretty interesting more more more yes splat doing a great job keep it up buddy youre on a planet where the blueberries are red why not a fungus tree i notice your quality slider is at the maximum 4x does that require 4x more resources or something for crafting or just 4x longer craft time because the former can be a huge resource drain this early edit it definitely looks like it increases resource cost by 4x after watching the rest of the episode you should really look into reducing quality to 1x in the next episode before you starve out all the resources im early better think of a joke more please i know your a busy man splatt but could you give us some more fade to silence pretty please could you try two things in the next episode if you dig a block away from the side of a water area will the water fill the space also you can dig but can you fill an area its always nice seeing you missing the big green button great episode splatt this could be a great game lets see what the devs make out of it interesting series keep it up d i would also like to be in the game as sharkie i dont mind what second name you put i would like to be in it please mateo wolf tewa wants to be a character somebody who likes animals if its not too late could i claim ahmed bass as my guy he sounds almost exactly like me p excited to see where this series goes name a colonist lost rd please could you please play dwarf fortress on this channel id like to see this efficient half above ground half below ground base you got but in a desert as deserts are my favorite terrain i offer myself as tribute siox wolf a game with a bit of rimworld in it and a psycopath sabouts im sorry if i feed you another corpse abl series wants a character keep up the good work oh nice i might have to hit this one up later i remember seeing in in greenlight way back when 3d is a fad it will never catch on there are mods for deep psychology and dwarven shenanigans now we just need levels and 200 more colonists no wonder df is so cpu heavy why isnt this on steam i would buy it right now if it was this game looks super cool character art style looks odd first of all because of how detailed and textured it is game in a cubic world especially a colony sim with lots of chars on screen should have more minimalistic approach towards characters and stuff i think rw is a good example of clean and simple esthetics detailed graphics also makes things easier to screw up for devs weird graphics sensation caused by things being off a bit one of the best examples of graphically screwing up a colony sim is judgement detailed graphical approach also makes the game less moddingfriendly cause you need to pour more hours making custom animations models and stuff and thats why star citizen or gta v are unlikely to get real large and cool mods these character designs look horrendous thats smart running into a wolf pack lol i like it rimworld meets minecraft looks interesting could potentially have promise tho i have a feeling the developer is only adding modding so early to encourage people to just do there job for them seeing what mods work and what dont taking the popular ones and incorporating it into the development which isnt a bad thing as long as people dont mind getting their work stolen or not getting credit for it but hey ho i could be wrong and i think yeti should do a series on this or maybe a mini every alpha to show off updates and how its progressing cant in all good concience give this a thumbs up this is way way way waaay too early the game barely has anything in it to call a game yet besides from making stockpiles and digging dirt i mean at some point arent we supposed to be judging what we see now as opposed to what a dev promises this early kinda prepreprealphas actually hurt the games image rather than support it early because this is just i mean why what does it have that other games doesnt right now nothing might as well buy gnomoria instead or rimworld or any of the countless other games already filled with content oh it has a blocky cube world in 3d great but with no actual gameplay in it way too early to show this game or ask youtubers to make videos of it i wish them the best of luck but i really think they shot themselves in the foot here looks cool but i will say some of the blocks of the world look like there just miss mashed together hahaha and i thought the random animal attacks in rimworld was grim at first i was unsure but yeah i would watch a series as someone who has been following this game for a couple years and playing the prealpha for over 1 yr i loved what i saw of your video pls do a series and see how big you can get reminds me more of timber and stone which i loved shame it died out hopefully this one will finish im loving most of what i see in this title so far splattercat also did a first lookfirst impressions episode yeti i think your biggest problem was not knowing what you were doing but thats helpful to devs of a new game too lets them know where a little luv needs to be applied you knew the wolves were down there so giving your crew tasks over there was always gonna end up wiped should have looked more north and ne anyway great video maybe next time slow down on fiddling with priorities and get each of your citizens a club oh and avoid wolves lol i really like this game i hope that start menu is temporary though the game looks very slow overall in df this is easier to forgive because of the symbol abstraction but here you can see the units slowing down for whatever theyre doing the sfx are kinda brutal not doing many favors for the impression um im glad im to old to care or id get upset what kind of game kills you from the very begining it takes way to long to do any thing and a yea combat you slap they team tag you its really coming along your nutz and that is being generous i dont know how much thought they put into the game or if some night they just had this drunk on and had an inspiration to remake a few games i wondered what would happen to you if you were attacked i even worried about it because you cant seem to do any thing at a good rate of pace in the game sorry im not so kind with my thought on this game as you are do i want to throw my money away i quit doing that after cube world robbed everyone they have to earn it now game seems really cool hope it gets the funding it needs id cheap in but im broke stationeers yeti stationeers httpstoresteampoweredcomapp544550stationeers ohhh tynan may not like this i like it really looks promising but so did many other games that eventually got abandoned like gnomoria i personally wont risk backing it especially if its trying to be like dwarf fortress specifically i think they would be setting themselves up for disappointment or failure rimworld while similar is different enough that people generally wont even compare the two beyond being colony management games hate to be all negative about it but i definitely hope they prove me wrong i am more than willing to support them once it looks like they have a pretty decent amount of content or replay value the models and the terrain look too much different to be a pleasant watch i hope that when a official demo is released the terrain will be smoothed or something similar yeti you should check out the zombie base building game they are billions its pretty awesome id be up for more of this its definitely got potential i hope they can give their ks the shot in the arm it needs game obviously needs fair amount of work and refinement but it has a good potential to evolve like minecraft or rimworld into an excellent time killer but its still too early to say for sure a lot of good here actual 3d zoomingpanningetc chibi characters actual animation instead of bland 2d icons also 4600 shitty blood lol stupid red tumblr noses on the character faces thats predisposed me against it already feels like watching primitive technology hmm yeah this is just going to die in kickstarter it reminds me a lot of gnomoria could be good in time looks super promising and i might do a series on it even though the kickstarter is still going kickstarter link httpswwwkickstartercomprojects1049608286embark3ddwarffortressmeetsthesims developer said money from the kickstarter is going toward audio art and ui for the time being assume the models voxels ui etc will all change theres already a bit of drama regarding the similarity of this main menu and rimworlds but to be fair the planet on the leftthird buttons opposite and the void of space in the middle is such a cliche space game screen that i dont think anyone would ever claim its theirs and do something as drastic as sue over it i assume its a placeholder avery was born avery improves at running evolution is amazing if it said humanoid meat then maybe its the monkey but it could be aubreys first child also the furnace wouldnt fit coz it as 3x2 and the room as only 2 high both girls bleeding for days and not dying sounds about normal first thank you nookrium for introducing me to this game i quite like its quirks and all speaking of maybe your fist still wasnt working because you have put a stockpile inbetween the still and the water i like it feels like my new guilty pleasure thank you for continuing the series ouch it does indeed look like a murder took place wonder what lead up to it on a different note that furnace is 3 levels high perhaps your workshop area is only 2 levels high i like when around 1155 the author speaks about how sad is theres no window when in the meantime an infanticide takes place apparently including the parents of the newborn too poor avery at least theres no other kids around to tease him for sleeping with mom and dad for so long so he dont need the knifeyet your videos are pretty good man question tho around 1145 ur colonist start fighting a daryl morrow and if you look at your colonist tab it seems that daryl is one of your colonist for a momenti think you missed it bcuz of the bed hall making ok i watched the rest of the vid your colonist killed daryl and prolly ate himlol i never played this but try clicking details to see age this game looks great another one on my watch list thanks nook hey nookrium your woodshop is disabled thats why you arent getting any planks terrific movie sitting here at ys food we like to uncover this type of content we produce travel food films too everywhere around the world and we are constantly searching for inspirations and also creative concepts thank you i hope this game does well the kickstarter will probably be funded i just hope the developer adds more depth just like df i need town names civilizations history other races statues and engravings genealogies and family trees im not a simple man lol you are making a bit of a logic mistake in the job priority having someone go to the item move it to storage then move it to craft station is always worse than just taking a remote item directly to the storage notice 1 step less what you want it having them moving it to storage when they have no crafting task otherwise you are making things slower when the storage is empty some interesting stuff there with the equipment thanks great video thanks friend i started my game and followed along with your video im still trying to figure out how to set up a still couldnt get the pipe to build but ill be watching your next vid for sure love this game when are you going to post another embark episode blocks are stone blocks that you make from rocks at the masons workshop but it must be stones from underground the dirt layer on top doesnt count for this blocks are very useful for building and making tools and weapons from once youve got weapons equipped and fight them as a group the flies are easy i learned this the hard way too i lost 7 colonists to flies in my first game its a tough game to get a foothold in for sure i got lucky didnt get attacked by flies until much later although i lost a kid collecting berries to a wolf little red riding hood is a thing i assume this game is dead might be to late but i like it its cute and different than some of the city builder games you have played looks interesting but the night time is way to dark couldnt see anything going on maybe turn the game brightness up or hopefully u could unlock lights im very interested in seeing how this game goes it looks interesting so far i already play stonehearth so it would be interesting to see if this game has enough positive difference to get me to try it curious if you would be interested in anno 1800 would love to see your city layout designs john bane you truly are alpha male dominant it seems very similar to stonehearth i agree aflea what about ur fortnite city theres still more to do on it looks like a mix of minecraft and gnomoria how can i test the game why isnt this on steam if it was on steam i would buy it right now what is this gay video everybody i know who goes to a new years party fuck i cant even remember it me well i dident go to any parties but by looking at your snap chat i can tell how fucking drunk you were also i enjoyed your text at 2am hey remember that this was a there are billions stream guys its weird that i find the way you say embark very interesting you put the emphasis on the ark like embark ive always said it with the emphasis on the m and b like emmbark i believe relationships are in the thought bubble up and to the right of the details button darn ill have to think hard about funding this i think it looks very interesting but im getting very frosty at the idea of buying games that arent even close to done hope it gets kickstarted first one ive contribbed since about a year ago the terrain resembles minecraft a lot probably uses the same basic functions for procedural generation too bad it doesnt do the erosion by water and wind simulation like dwarf fortress does the map would look much better itll probably take hours to generate but well hey sd this looks interesting but the landscape textures are a real eyesore atm take a look at empyrion im pretty sure youll enjoy the buiding aspect similar to planet explorersnms etc as well as the combat heres a vidlink to give you an idea httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuudeqdfwdcwt3s it looks like minecraft fucked rimworld and had a baby what runic system is that on the thumbnail greetings from the future into the past d i hate tings like this it is clearly something i would enjoy gameplay wise but graphics wise it is ugly and annoying damn my brain its so weird listening to him 3 years ago because his newer voice is so much better he does it so much better how he says it makes me laugh greetings everyone stranger something something i did forgot already and i just listen to it like 8 seconds ago haha hey aavak have you considered playing sunless sea it is a very fun game that i think you would enjoy i have seen other lets plays of it but your way of going about things is by far the best btw i love your videos really should have read evelynns likes and dislikes me seeing dwarf fortress nope fuck that complicated shit i wish you made another series of this hey avak one day could you make a tutorial on how to understand the game well what i mean is ive never played and asci however you write it game in my life and i really want to play this game one day but i dont know what all the letters mean i followed the dragon here ive been dying to die this game but not sure what this game is actually about kindom managment or a rpg dwarven fried eagle a taste of freedom xd the attic of buds sounds awesome is there something you want to tell us aavak 1115 do not mention the space elves wowmetasapia and flyingstaplersamazing nameso this is the backstory for the ship namessome randome dwarfs were called like that and they just chose those nameswe are getting closer to the secret of aavaki wander what is inside the notyetuploaded box aavak i guess evellyn knows about the stonesshe praises them with her lifelike stonemastergargothe creature made by the stones and lathland where did you get the iron anvil from the only anvil i could get was the steel which cost 300 points what kind of mod does he use doesnt look like the regular install at least thats for sure wow this world gen is amazing 00 your videos are great its very hard to keep people entertained in this type of game but you do it the best i have seen intantly subscibed i just said interested twiceoops i just got hereand might i say you are quite the charming fellow very interesting commentary keeps me interested i am indeed subbing with no hesitation would you say you enjoy dwarf fortress or gnomoria more just curious third time starting watching this series again hope you do another season of this someday one of my favorite games but i just dont have the attention span to play it as well as you have lol watching this series all over again the doctor also detests blood gnats thats not a very good doctor on ipad friend shall you do anothercattenvr v2 in 40xx its not that different but still worth revisiting sunk 70 hours the past week into some fortresses i like it k tnx 47 minutes of world generation so complex i met you yesterday on the stream looking forward to ur df lets play will you ever repick this series in the beginning of this video you mention youre favorite roguelikes what are those i cant seem to hear you precisely i want this game right now is it free really charming series i enjoyed this episode much man your military really needs some steel weapons and armor which is shame considering how much material you have id focus on getting your weaponarmor making industry up also have your military train by killing those unarmed goblin prisoners was getting the metal working dwarf an anvil and the supplies to make the metalworking workshops really cheaper than perhaps getting no anvil and waiting for a caravan aavak i am going to be bindge thinking for the rest of this week and have decided to watch everyone of your df lets plays at lest for cattenvir i love df fan fiction so i figured id hear plenty of storys while watching this you worried a lot about whether to show world gen but honestly thats more interesting that anything else youll do in subsequent videos its the best part of the game is that a welsh accent i hear subbed after the great castle doctrine i saw you had this and banished ill be watching for a while i have to say the amount of effort put into making this game makes a mockery of multimillionaire companys that make games today are you taking names for this lp too if so add me to the list know its way back but would like to say since started playing myself unicorns are asshole last one i meet bite one of my dwarfs heads off and ate it your gnomoria lp helped me get into gnomoria hopefully with that game under my belt this lets play will allow me to delve into this behemoth of a game oh man im gonna like this i absolutely love how dedicated you are to your subscribers in commenting on their comments i found you after looking at the game cataclysm dda glory and fame to dapper mcjester i am really happy to find you playing dwarf fortress i will watch your series for this game which i absolutely love glad to have found someone who is so dedicated one does not simply have 30 ep of dwarf fortress over several months aavak i think youre the only person whose df videos make me successfully start playing df again ive tried so so many times to understand the game but failed but you explain things way better than any tutorial has at 1430 is it just me or is there a volcano in the middle of the oceanupper right community challenge settle a volcano on a 1 maptile sized island in the middle of the ocean oh you have dwarf fortress lp as well thank you aavak i really needed these explanations didnt get bored at all with your video watching these babies again cause ive started playing again and i dont remember anything lol just wondering what is the tileset you use for this your playthroughs are more informative than any tutorial out there i now have a thorough understanding of how i can start off on both dwarf fortress and gnomoria thank you you have another subscriber d i dont understand why nobody uses the define parameters menu it makes so much better worlds ive always been the opposite when it comes to which mode i play fortress mode has always been intimidateing just due to the amount of keys you need to remember for shortcuts however i have no problem playing adventurer without any graphics packs or mods and i kill any elves i find seems like a good and long series you have a follower from spain ironhand16 hey avak whats the graphic mod for this thanks for the compliment d daw too bad you dont have a tower as your neighbour the options are listed on the screen tab key is change mode in a nutshell dwarf fortress mode is a sort of management god game where you govern a colony of dwarves somewhat indirectly adventure mode however is closer to a roguelike where you control one person directly and adventure across the world completing questsslaying beasts etc what is the difference between dwarf fortress mode and adventure mode seems like you have an expedition of outcasts besides aavak they all seem to have troubles with words and low social skills not to mention horrible bedside mannerlol indeed a great price for a truly epic game d great game and it is free honestly ive not thought too much about which metals would be best im guilty of finding something that worked reasonably well and sticking to it so thanks for the great advice about bronze i think that would be better than the random return on silver all in all wouldnt it be more profitable to take 3 cassiterite and 3 malachite than 4 tetrahedrite 24 bronze vs 16 copper and a variable amount of silver close call i guess also have you looked into using the blue peafowl their clutch size in only slightly smaller and they give slightly less meat but they mature twice as fast and thus will lay eggs in half the time if you want more animals in the future consider getting thread instead of cloth and skip crutchessplintsbuckets wow i didnt notice that but thats hilarious thats a fair thing to say i think the game is certainly mind blowingly complex theres actually a book written by peter tyson called getting started with dwarf fortress that teaches how to play dwarf fortress in a easy to understand way he revises it annually to keep up with version changes too its just mind blowing that a game could inspire a man to write an entire book it goes as to say dwarf fortress has become something more then a game its a world of its own 2453 how did you enter in that civilisation list df is a fantastic game specifically for the stories it weaves through the gameplay it gives someone like me a lot of ammunition when it comes to injecting life into the characters what with the thoughtspreferences etc youtube has failed to inform me that you had started playing dwarf fortress and for this i shall never forgive it i just happened to notice you doing this series the other day it always warms my heart to see a df play through i shall be watching this with great interest to see what stories are carved out in your dwarven halls ive played a lot of games that are similar to this one games like towns and gnomoria and the bajillion roguelike games that are out there though i never really gave this one a go i find that a lot of newer roguelike games suffer not from complicated ui but rather a lack of ui games like sword of the stars the pit has pretty much no interface and you have to exit the game to view the key layouts though its still a good game as im sure this one is thanks for the kind praise i hope my videos can help introduce a few people to the game who might otherwise not be able to look past the complicated ui and ascii its really a rare gem i live up in stroud if youve heard of it so not that close to the bridges but you can see the river on a clear day muddy as always lol i guessed which part you were joking about dont worry where do you live near the severn by the way near the bridges or further up i cant imagine living near the bridges is so good given the crazy amount of traffic and they always seem to be doing some sort of work to the roads round there lol i mean i was joking about giving me preference not about being part welsh haha thanks ps maybe in the spirit of solidarity you could sneak me up the list since my granddad was welsh and i live within sight of the severn joking strangely ive heard of this game but never really played it though it looks like something id be very much interested in you video was nice and informative for anyone starting out the lists long but with the way dwarves die in this game im sure youll get into the fort eventually so ill add you to the list i also would love a name and also curse those elfs and their wood that sounds about right though it may also be possible to trade for flux stone or steel items which you can then smelt down and reforge into something you want so uh for those of us that have so much material ores that flux stone no longer exists what would the fallback options be from what i see on the good old dfwiki it seems iron armor iron edge weapons and silver blunt weapons would be a viable backup plan added to the list i would love a name some kind of talented weaponsmith to gear up our brave dwarfs maybe an armorer love df and youre great thx certainly ill add your name to the list though it may take a little while to get added to the fort as the list is pretty long but im sure with a few sieges and migrant waves well get you in ill take a named dwarf militaryarmorer if possible ahhh i didnt realise you were quarter irish the name makes much more sense now it was still cool anyway 0 well im qwater irish and im welsh so it makes sense of course you can especially with such an awesome name no chicks shame sure ill add you to the list name tuckerace if you do add me hey aavak i have been a fan for a while could i maybe be on the list of names may i have a dwarf yes yes yes have been missing a df lp they always give great stories and derpy dwarfen moments3 can i get a name may i be dwarf i would prefer a doctor so if someone gets a papercut they dont get there finger get cut off by revocane if you add me make it skiller2 cheers jonny i hope you enjoy the videos d ive added pennypen to the list not surprised youre doing a df series should be fun to see how this goes d may my name be in the list too please aavak can get a drowf named fireforce ahh ive had forts in the past that were swamped by beasts regardless but much may have changed in the way it balances spawns since then the last few forts ive had were fairly short lived as i was only testing the latest features so i must not have noticed im sure that can be arranged its rendering as we speak and will be uploaded as soon as it finishes graphic looks beta but as soon as we get into it the lands takes nice shape and the creature gets much more realistic awesome creation man keep it up with those bright simulation strategy game thank you i always put savagery and beasts on max its not actually that bad but on less than that you dont get beasts all that often this is gonna be great oh and if you could name my dwarf xenir like last time hopefully i wont get crippled instantly lol next please clowns of any variety are dangerous certainly though it may take a few migrant waves before i can get you into the fort my internet has been down for the past three days but man oh man i was looking forward to this lp i guess im a little behind in terms of requesting a dorf but you know i wont get anywhere without asking ill take whatever comes your way hopefully well get to the deepest bowels of the earth in your fort just beware the clowns aavak these are no ss13 clowns no no no these clowns are worse well i guess ill finally learn how to play this game at long last is it possible to get a little person named after me perhaps a doctor could you add my name to the list as either a farmer or a crossbow dwarf if you wouldnt mind could you add austbot to the name list id like a weaponcrafter but im fine with anything and gender doesnt matter ooo werty please df is the best sure ill add you to the list and welcome to the channel if it wont to much of a bother you could add phiolax to the list does not matter what type of traitjob i get ether your a demigodunkillable or just very lucky hello new sub id love to have a dorf if youre doing that c righto ill get haika added to the list hopefully we can find something suitably exotic to tame for them wow im not sure the world is ready for such power but ill add you to the list anyway last time i asked for a dwarf he was put into the army beaten to a pulp by werewolfs strangled for weeks and survived so if you want a unkillable dwarf add swissarmy to the list well it seems im a bit behind here and your named migrant dwarf list is likely fairly large but id still put my name forward to be a member of this haika is the name i usually go with in community games perhaps a military dwarfspear with an exotic war animalbig cat if possible heads back over to continue watching the gnomes playlist would you consider using the stone sense mod its the only version of df that so far hasnt made me weep bitterly yes that would be perfect thanks for letting me know oh so like caves made from soil or sandy materials id love to but someone has already asked for a dwarf named gnome im afraid would you like one named strider instead may i have a dwarf named gnome sure ill add your name to the list im a new sub but i would love to have a dwarf named after me well the list may be huge but id still love to have my name thrown into it 3 by the way aavak you dont need to mud underground areas just grow stuff on soil nice aavak and df d i look forward to this series certainly ill get your name added to the list i noticed the thread you made on bay12 for this lets play and decided to follow it its pretty interesting so far so id love to follow it if you can sneak in a lalasa somewhere in your dwarf population id really love that it wont matter to me what job but if said dwarf turns out to be a hero so much for the better i cant wait for the next episode i would love to be dorfd as jamuson if you have any masoncrafter positions not claimed otherwise any random position will do thanx a lot cant imagine a better df lets play than one made by you really enjoying your channel oh i imagine anything military will have a high probability of death ill get your name on the list d it is getting rather large but im happy to add more to the list regardless may take a while to get to some of them though lol likely in the next day or so nope im generally keeping up with the comments though its hard to reply to each one individually i am i think catching all the name requests mr chaotic is on the list sure ill put you down for a siege engineermechanic or a weapon smith by all means care to add honbad to the list i was already following you but now i have subscribed to you this should be a great lp of df and if youd like please put deknegt to the list preferably something military with a high probability of a gruesome death name one of the dwarfs gnome for me sweet ive been waiting for this lp since the end of your gnomoria fort can i request a dwarf named kissell cant wait to see more by the way 2 more things one is in my expeiance the giantesswitch is a legendary beastis the hardiest if you live on the over world and not under ground and two is i wold like to be a trader as before i was a pirate i was a trader joy both aavak and rev have a fort going at the same time ill get my df fix reasonably often and in an entertaining and laid back package from multiple sources cant complain also if your migrant list isnt bursting yet id love to get myself into the mix and if there happens to be a position as a cook farmer fisher brewer or similar food production chain bit id love to dabble with those i would love to have a dwarf named after me i dont care what he is when is the next video going to be uploaded wow so many coments already i hope my naming wish didnt go unnoticed yay i knew youd get to this game eventually im glad its sooner rather than later i wouldnt mind having a dwarf named bear i have no preference aaah im so happy youre playing this i was late into watching gnomoria but since i seem to be around for the start of cattenvir i would love to have a dwarf named after me i havent played df before so im not too sure of the professions but can i get someone who is in engineering or some type of weapon manufacturing wouldnt be opposed to a soldier either righto ill see what i can do d though i get the impression a few people have been expecting this one raises my hand though a dwarf would be nice if your name logs arent too backed up already i understand there will be a lot of military dwarves but if you can find one that fits my request for the gnomoria gnome preferably some sort of smith like a weaponsmith but i dont mind if you have me as a military dwarf or whatever dwarf you can im not picky mate sure ill add amman to the list aye ill make sure youre down for one of the fooddrink professions though if you could name one of your dwarves amman and make him an archer dunno if possible in df or at least some woodrelated dwarf it would be awesome thanks in advance i think i requested a df dwarf at the end of gnomoria but just in case i want a cook brewer or farmer named bloodalchemy whichever is needed certainly ill add freya to the list normally i would ask if you could rename a dwarf after me but i would like to ask that you name a dwarf freya after my favorite and now deceased soldier in xcom enemy unknown in her honor and ask she be put in the military if you ever get the time or chance sure ill add you to the list d thanks for all the tips much appreciated id love it if youd name a dwarf babbit certainly sure ill add you to the list consider yourself added d damn now ill have to play df again xd i would like to have a dwarf named after me if possible i forgot to say when you turkey population gets high butcher them for leather and meat if you dont know how turkeys and minecarts work i think you said you didnt its a good idea to go to the menu that you can change what to cook and brew and set your dwarves to not collect eggs build a few rock net boxes from crafts dwarf and for mine carts dont build them the slaughter your animals and build lots of wheelbarrows also if you are using a tilesetfont can you post it in the caption of your next upload can i have a dwarf named switters thanks mate love your uploads still finishing up your cataclysm dda playlist i basically watch a few episodes before bed every night nothing like a proper

playing df love this game thnx aavak can i request a dwarf hopefully not in the military though millionfoul would make a powerful dwarf because i want him to live longer than twelve seconds during an ambush since that can happen he doesnt have to be soon just put him in whenever you want if you want he could be a girl too because dwarven society isnt sexist maybe a cross dresser or something cant

planning to put it back on account of playing df as well well see though if it does then i may simply play them one after the other alternating which im playing actively but i dont tend to make such far reaching plans they have a tendency to not play out the way i expected lol yaaaay thank you thank you thank you d can i be one of your dwarfs ok new lp this time i will request a character from episode 1 lets call him phdwarf and let himher be some kind of artificer good luck oh man i am looking forward to this incidentally will this be postponing your next gnomoria lp i would totally understand since juggling 2 games like those would be a tad overwhelming lol farmer with no patience thats not good im tempted to audio hijack record the ends strike the earth and use it as a text tone on my cellphone surely itll cheer me up every time it plays lol sure ill add you to the list as i mention in the episode so much has changes with vanilla df since the last serious attempt ive made at a fort that i feel a little lost so i dont want to heap mods on top of that plus i might not realise whats vanilla and whats mod so thisll be easier for me for this fort then in the next ill be modding wow my all of my feels cried out in empathy at that yay d so looking forward to this can i be a battle axe welding dwarf i know dwarfs in the army have a life expectancy of a fly in a bug swatting factory but hopefully i will die a badass way xd wouldnt mind a dwarf named mesron if possible any profession is welcome love df looking forward to the lp finally dwarf fortress but why no modsince revocane use genesis you could use the masterwork dfit would be awesome btw i want a dwarf too i thought he was getting me a terrys chocolate orange for christmas but alas twas a terrys chocolate orange wrapper with a real orange inside fair enough you can sleep in the magma room then dont worry thats just its name i assure you of course any fort will be instantly improved by the arrival of thedude not his cousin though thedud hes mostly useless i will become a dwarf too and after a long fight for leadership i will overthrone you aavak xd haha well good to see a df lp from you can i has dwarf of your specification whatever is needed at the time or for future endeavours as long as i die a glorious death d lol well im sure it wont come to a magma reservoir hopefully can i have dwarf named alexslayer if so that would be amazing for my job i would prefer some crazy genius or a crazy dual wielding swordman but if you need me to do something else then i wont mind cheers i was highly anticipating a dwarf fortress or a second gnomoria lp i would love to be scrutebuck the dwarf preferably a carpenter so i can stick it to the pointyeared gits or a warriordwarf so i could stick it to them much more literally but if those positions are filled im sure little bearded me will be happy in any position if not feel free to turn his room into a magma reservoir thats the one im using as it happens so good suggestion i would like a dwarf named after me mrdarkdraker and i would like to be a blacksmith seeing how everyone else is asking could i get a dwarf too some kind of engineeringtype would be cool but i dont mind if it could be possible in the next migration wave to get a full time soldier called spartan that would be awesome welp just like in gnomoria i shall also offer up my services whether as a frontliner and military dwarf or not however i shall leave up to you this time aavak i strongly recommend the ironhand graphics pack anyway if you could please dwarf me as a miner for now and then a hammerdwarf as soon as you get a military up and running i think youre safe in saying gnomoria is dwarf fortress 3d thats pretty much how the community sees it i do love df though thanks for choosing it the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legends fade to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again in one age called the third age by some an age yet to come an age long pass a wind rose in the mountains of mist the wind was not the beginning there are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was a beginning great video man and a jester dwarf will be awesome any dwarf rzombie please d looking forward to this cheers dude d i mean its almost certainly going to end in flaming dwarves throwing themselves out of windows etc but hopefully thatll happen after i get some stuff finished unlike gnomoria where practically none of my projects got done lol awesome thanks d ill do my best on both counts sure that was one of the two mods i had considered the other being genesis lol yeah they didnt last very long in gnomoria did they but sure ill add your namesake to the list d next miner we assign shall be yours sure ill add you to the list glad to see you got your series started im sure itll be great yaaay aavak doing dwarf fortress make me a dwarf named sellardohr preferably put me in the military and build a very good fortress can i have a hunter dwarf or crossbow dwarf called samscale when you get round to making one also after this fort is lost or the series ends can you try making a fort with the masterwork modpack this is the best news since pretty much ever aavak youre amazing also is it possible for me to have a dwarf named lobstarooo in this as well only if its not a problem of course and if i do get in lets hope ill last longer than my gnomish namesake did in spiderslaughter p by all means i would like to have a dwarf named treesniper12 absolutely and i feel everything but ashamed for it yaaay cant wait to see where this goes more please d ill likely be starting a fort for them in another week or so when ive let the game get patched a little more i think i mention that in the end episode of gnomoria and sure ill add your name to the list d can i have rock the miner hey aavak could i get a dwarf what will happen to the gnomes also id like a dwarf named fyrezen if possible doesnt matter what job anybody else giggle like a little girl who just got a fairy princess riding a sparkly pink unicorn when they saw this been waiting for this i look forward to much fun d any chance i could get a dwarf named vesty ive been waiting so long for you to do a df series thank you yes yes all of my yes yes ive been

where the squeak but its easy just coming from jesus christ its not two blocks lateral is to block depth you trying to kill your people every time you did you always digging for two blocks and they cant get out of it always make sure you have one depth you know how it happened they only do what you tell them to do hahaha you know exactly what you did you murderer exactly youve made nothing from the start always make your building structures and then start a army or protectors or something thats why you failed i took a look at the dev blog seems like pathing is still a hurdle for them too bad

the gods allow me to die fighting with a warhammer well if i had to be a dwarf i would like to be darkness count me in i think the effects of bladed weapons on the undead have changed quite significantly cutting them into pieces is considerably more effective now and decapitation is mostly highly effective as well there was a bug about it not registering properly but i think it was fixed

dwarf named hudson please dorf name plz norn i would like to have a dwarf named after me oh man dorfs at it again you can only build a distillery near freshwater not saltwater ocean look for fresh water deposits near your area and pump water from there to to a nearby trench you build or natural trench you notice you put mushrooms and bananas in the same slot in the next one you should put the crops by a water source because it speeds up the growth i love the look of this game its such a strange but appealing combination of genres galena if i recall correctly from dwarf fortress is an ore which you can smelt into silver and possibly something else maybe lead subbed and thumbs up which version were you using i did not see character portraits when you were setting up to embark nothing about this is like minecraft i looks and behave a lot like rimworld with more humanlike avatars with speech all but slow movement action to complete items i just hope that if there is any dangerous things that will attack like environment wind rain storms or animals that it wont take them a year and six months to build a house to protect themselves and please if you are going to do a lets play on the game do not make an underground base maybe after you have mastered the game more and have a better understanding of how thing will come at you underground bases are so hard to see and work with and from a viewer standpoint i hate those kind of bases as you rarely get to see what is happening with all the people especially since you the player will be more focus on one person at a time and the full over view of the other colonist will be lost hi sgtkeeneye this game looks like a really good update of mine craft and wat happened to the video u were talking and the video ended how long was the video ment to be fast forward to 010000 020000 030000 040000 050000 060000 070000 080000 090000 well apparently me calling out directions and shortcuts at my computer screen here in canada and in the future is not seeming to assist you in finding your way any easier maybe i am just not calling them out loudly enough i mean you are 6500 km away after all and in the past i regret not being there in game or watching the stream at the time so that i could have helped you out a bit and pointed some of the historical landmarks you traveled past i am telling everyone about you and wurm thinking about starting my own embark very shortly can you please tell me how to dig can figure that part out yet oh my god baby faced quill this is so different so i got tlnp but my protection software on my computer says its not safe anyone know why it might say that because i trust my protection software but im also a lazy newb lazy newb pack is not supported for current versions of the game 2937 quill is a dwarf the world gen alone is amazing its such a good fun game hehehehe in such a savage and dangerous land an unexciting adventureless life while boring is going to be the longest sim city meets lord of the rings is an under stament unbearded quill looks so goofy in a good way also how do i grow a cow and get a pork roast from it excellent game but takes a while for to me create world i know this is old but how do you get the embark screen graphics to look like it does visually more pleasing to the eye at 1101 i have phoebus installed and i dont get to see those graphics until after the embark screen and once my game is loadim new to df so if anyone could share that detail i would appreciate it she hot can i meant u buying your first anvil hah i just steal mine from the first dwarven caravan by deconstructing my trade depot i once ran a fortress for like 3 years without booze be warned in starting this series he just stops playing with no resolution its still definitely fun enough if you need to learn but it kinda sucks if youre watching for entertainment value this higher level game not for mebut evil genius is great game to play i have a question is the book on amazon getting started with dwarf fortress still up to date or will it still help me any one who wants to play this with lnp you will need to go here now as the link on this video is out of date and is no longer updated as of november 2013 httpwwwbay12forumscomsmfindexphptopic126076 how to figure out how to play this game on your own worked for me have an iq of 131 and have a page on the wiki open constantly going to watch this for a second time now quill do another one at least when theres a new patch at the beginning dwarf cyclops in a onesie this sounds all such nerdy but its awesome hi quil can you make a new torturial for df with the mods you recomends i really wish someone would made a better version of dwarf fortress mainly make it easier to understand and some graphical and ui improvements quill with a beard is so much cooler i played dwarf fortress like 700 hours by now i recomand master work mod because newb is out dated also masterworkj has a loot of awesome new stuff added to it iv you want like mages monster new enemys or playing as orc so mutch stuff just awesome is this game free just play the game and shut up make a pork roast from a cow pork roast from a cow i couldnt play this even if it is free looks like poop removing aquifers cheating cheating with the mineral occurrence value it replaces some flux with minerals i would recommend the standard value the newb pack is out of date and not updated in a year what do you recommend to use instead just found this game but dont want to look at numbers and such why long intro omg this is so cool gonna have to try it out myself too also dont you dare call them better graphics ascii graphics are so goddamn charming though for a game like this the tilesets probably work better but i will never use tilesets for old roguelikes p world generation is evil mani got a world filled with inmense amounts of mineralsbut there is not even one rock of any flux stone loved that series thanks for the vid make yourself a pork roast grow the cow spot the error besterich277 ok i guess you dont like that game i can respect that i believe its unquestionable that this game is and probably will be the most detailed and indepth game in the history of games forgotten beastslet me tell you about forgotten beasts uhhh complicated brain hurt this is why i play castle story instead of dwarf fortress uhhh complicated brain hurt this is why i play castle story instead of dwarf fortress pork roast isnt cow dwarf fortress is just amazing it is the only game where you can use babies to distract elephants that decided to charge your fisherdwarf who responded by jumping into the river and being mauled to death by carp i love it mmm pork roast from a cow great explanation i once made a map and im pretty sure there was no dwarves at all christian sn it is still in early alpha its nowhere near finished that is quite an interesting game im sure if those two brothers actually remade the game it would be better tenfold with all that game design and programming experience theyve gained in the progress of making and updating it thisthis is what got my subscribe this game is great just by hearing of it pork doesnt come from cowsits pigs every map i search has no freaking trees almost an instant likesub it took you guys 120 seconds to get me that is a record i must say boatmurdered isnt a horror story and some of the stuff like sankis can still happen but the elephants cant probably not xd she is his motherinlaw im new to the channel im not trying to be rude if its not but is that his mom after watching this series i came to the realization that i have been doing everything wrong know that feel was it by any chance boatmurdered because that particular horror story actually cant happen in the game anymore unless of course you download the old 40d version from 2009 or whatever year its from what horror story whats wrong with facecam thats how quill rolls why the game is not scary at all what you read was the cause of not being careful when searching just be a little bit more specific on your searches once you pass the big learning curve youll see how much fun the game will be download winrar or 7zip and extract the file as easy as that its worse if you give up you would dump your mother only because she doesnt comprehend games sad dude sad has anyone made a monty python joke for the forest of knights ni im going to baselessly insult people because i think it validates my point cool story bro ive seen gnomoria and it is just a cheap dumbed down df clone its also a shameless cash grab riding the coattails of dfs popularity taking the mona lisa and drawing a hat on it doesnt mean you made a painting better than the original mona lisa the hill of humor wouldve been an interesting choice in both name and location plopped in the middle of an evil island dwarf the rapist elves exist solely to be pissed long or shortly live dorfs the truth is the game can handle isometric rendering sprites and tiles also it can handle simple animations dwarf fortress a mind blowing overcomplicated micromanagement game thing is it can have much better graphics really cause of the huge number of informations the software deals with your pc would have a melt down if this game had normal graphics they need to make a dwarf fortress 2 with better graphics make a pork roast from a cow wow that would take a while i wish she was my mommy mom doesnt understand video games at all its very bad to make a too high mineral occurence because it takes place of the fluxstone and the usefull linerals but how advancd is that physics engine in df when a minecart filled with bolts is suddenly stopped alll the bolts fly out if you hit a goblin with a cart the goblin is pushed a distance depending on the speed of the goblin and of the cart gnomoria is a good game no doubt about that but it certainely not like dwarf fortress and the most important feature of df making your own world and see it develop isnt in there gnomoria has a physics engine and you can build traps and things too since dwarves cant get drunk in this game i always thought they just had different bodybrain chemistry where theyre dependent on alcohol quill are you a fan of warhammer fantasy quill how old are you pork roast grow the cow a pig is not a cow niri pregnantboar damn what a name xd this game is so much fun if thy useith exploiteths you are still screwethed dwarf fortress logic engine definitely the last two features are definitely must haves also dwarf fortress is superior i suggest trying out gnomoria when you have the chance its basically dwarf fortress but with an interface that is far superior unfortunately it lacks a return to fortress feature and does not generate a full world for your little fort to spawn in coolest mother in law in the world quite possibly i love how you two interact hope this tutorial is good just downloaded df and wanted to read some tips ended up reading a df horror story i am not so sure that i wanna get myself involved in this game anymore what does the mirror thing in lazy newb do i want to know if it matters hi quill18 isnt that lazy newb pack a little outdated newest is v162 or does it matter atleast utilities and other stuff are older in your version thank you thank you to the last bear piece of adamentite before striking into the demon world please never stop doing videos for this game good lets players are almost impossible to find for this game that export to minecraft thing she mentioned only works with old versions of the game which you are not playing oops i meant my last comment to be backwards therefore read it inverted and here i am opening sims within a minute it would be awesome if you did an adventure mode run bringing a male and a female cat are you nuts oo quick note mineral occurrence gives you more coal and such things but actually decreases the amount of gold and iron just thought you should know you do realize he said that he only subbed after quill started dfwhich was at least 2 years after he started making videos jurydutysummons has a really good lptutorial bout a year old but i still found it entertaining and informative grow the cow for a pork roast alrighty then quill your new mission is to find a use for babies perhaps as a cheap building material or food supplement or cagebait also i hear from reliable sources that babies bounce yea i have only seen one lets play of it and frankly the lets play is not very good throw it into the pit as i sit and pet my cat yea finally a tutorial cause very little people teach it and when they do they are bad cause very few of them speak english were dwarves mountains sound good we also need forests to deforestation and piss off the elves when he said 7 dwarves i thought what about 13 dwarves go upstairs make yourself a pork roast from scratch grow the cow ive heard of one embark in a terrefying biome where it rained normally there were no random dead things deciding they didnt like being dead just eyegrass and giant insects then came the glooms murderous deathfogs engulfment was to be sentanced to bleed from every pore of the body this embark was and will always be waterburned tvtropes succesion fort vol 1 not to mention that if it even had halfassed graphics it would melt any machine that touched it especially the bigger forts with flowing liquids and such note to other ppl that r incapable playing dwarf fortress gnomoria is an amazingly more user freindly although u still have to buy it like 10 it is worth it also it uses the mouse for most things and is amazingly better looking so i decided to watch this video while i update planetside 2 since i wanted to get back into that game the patch has been done for awhile and i dont think ill be getting back into planetside 2 dwarf fortress seems far more interesting pork roast and grow a cow lolololol dungeons is another good steam title that is sort of like a remade dungeon keeper i dont expect full blown 3d or amazing graphics just something along the lines of dont starve but a little smaller would be great the small text and sprites strain my eyes and tire me such a deep game if he could just make it less ugly he would blow minecraft out of the water here we are again i started watching you stream with the first df and now im here again its very unlikely that that will happen simply because the game is a roguelike and as all rouguelikes go they enjoy basing the game around text the whole reason for this is the amount of detail they can put into it through text is much bigger and better than actual images even if you have to visualise them yourself i wait for the day this game evolves true art mentally visualizing every little detail gets tiring after a while i made like ten worlds and my pc goes through the history super slow when loading it each world i made had no flux stones and i know you need them to make steel because i was following the how to play dwarf fortress bookguide so i just started a game without a flux stone me neither on 3 maps that i created let me know if you find a solution understandable df is a very different style of game compared to most games nowadays it couldnt find a flux stone on my whole map for some reason i cant believe i had not noticed you were doing this dwarf fortress is one of my favorite games i thought ale would be a dwarfs drink the first person to settle my continent was the only of her species and was beaten to death by a giant she didnt have a happy life i always pause quills videos before i start them and wonder how long the speech is going to be at the beginning wow olxer medium worlds on my pc take around half an hour to generate ah finally some dwarf fortress otstaxmon sounds good to me how to see other layers updown nohate it looks wird and boring not my type of game shall i download legacy or sdl you need seperate mics does someone know name of old game that you making farm by day and later at night monsters spawns many people are put off with the ascii graphics and the many menus but df is truly an amazing game once youve got past that subscribe activated yo are amazing like eva i tired this game once a few years back i think ill try it again with the graphic pack 3 what the hell none of this series showed up in my sub box things go horribly horribly bad dwarf fortress in a nutshell even in adventure mode also it is really rewarding to not make a new map each time if you start in the same world file after your old fortress inevitably burns down the new fortress will actually engrave stuff that has happened in your old fortress onto items and walls yes you must play evil genius i freaking love that game cough seriously you really need to lol magma its the solution to everyting that or a dwarven atom smasher its amazing that 2 people created this game i wantered to see another of these from you for soooo long i saw your second embark a while ago and i had to wonder where is the first embark lol love your bids man found several games i love including this one keep up the good work purple evilzombies and stuff yellow savagegiant animals light blue goodunicorns and fairy huh not played df with a tile set in a long time quill for future reference at least for me i have to use a preset from advanced paramiters to generate a world with flux stone all other worlds created outside advanced paramiters will not have it flux stone for those unaware of the game allows you to make iron and later steel a assential part of your army oh man i havent played df in ages hopfully this will get me in the mood i wish i could put a million points into the evil genius suggestion on towerdive this would be an amizing lets play of a game the younger generation doesnt even know complex and hilarious at the same time hurray were back in business whats the differance betwen mirror 1 and mirror 2 finally dwarf fortress thank you quill love you forevereven more 3 i desided to drink with u all i have id hinakin tho so woohoo sweet now i have a summer to watch all of quill18 this is awesome dwarf fortress finaly back i once played dwarf fortress and i built my kingdom it got filled with molten iron dont ask me how but it was boiling molten iron from my furnace room and they all died after that i explored it with my adventurer and he wasent able to even get close because everything was filled with hard iron wallsweird jesus christ allmighty this game is insane yes yes yeeess quill and eva you should really do a evil geniuslp if you can find the time eva as the genius and quill as the evil you are so funny and entertaining by yourselves but as a team youre more than twice as good

a fine choice brewed down the road from me can u name a warrior dwarf bellcross plz quill no please dont get me hooked on another game that i cant afford to waste all my time playing dont say its like simcity meets lord of the rings because i love those both so much dont have too much fun with this please im doomed sims 3 takes so long to load you can make a pork roast from a cow so you geneticly engineered your cow to grow pork o he might have more than one account or just never made an account its canada as milk comes from plastic bags so too does pork come from cows in canada downloaded so far i have goddesses of love and beauty and gods of pestilence and suicide why does that seem sexist to me innis gunn my favourite beer i love your videos great stuff i especially like the simcity videos but all your stuff is entertaining using my dfvidtuts2012 embark set huh nice i dont have much to comment on yet allthough i think i did give one of the dwarves the woodcrafting skill once the

without the orcs adventure game for adventure mode simulation game and i t182 all slapped together into one free game i butcher them how else hello my dear n rear jef fan o i played two hours worth of dwarf fotress adventure mode two days ago while listening to a two hour power metal consert ill say about 10 deaths also how do any of you deal with a catsplosion you grow a cow to make pork roast favorite game for lets play by my favorite lper keep it up quill we all enjoy your content this makes me really happy d you and dwarf fortress are a perfect match a knifematch if you will wait you get a pork roast from a cow dwarf fortress lets plays are my drug feed my addiction woo dorf fortressssss hahaha yeah im really frustrated with the gavelkind law in the base game i always went straight for reforming for better inheritance laws so i really have no idea how to really deal with it oh and some jerk took my daughter as my concubine he wasnt alive much longer anyway im really interested in seeing how quill deals with gavelkind 920 quill go make a sandwich lol just watching and listening to this has made me want to get it just for the legends mode you should get rome 2 total war when it comes out i spend most of my time scrambling to get 3 of the holy sites so i can reform the norse religion and get out of gavelkind before my 15 kids break up my realm i really shouldnt have taken so many concubines i tried murdering my wife after my son was born on a different character but then he died of typhoid two days before my character died in battle i like staring into the matrix though lol pork roast made out of cow xd yes more dwarf fortress great videos dwarf fortress is how i originally found quills channel as well hi there im planning on doing my own lets play of df would you be offended if i posted it as a video response to yours this game is great but and i love it but when i first played i had no idea what to do until i figured out how to play i did not really enjoy it but eventually i learned how to play and it was great if there is anybody who has trouble because it is a little complicated there is another great game called gnomoria it was inspired by df and it is very similar but is much more approachable both games are great and i cannot wait for videos go play minecraft if this is too complicated for you ever thought of playing masterwork dwarf fortress its like a upgraded version with more aspects they also have orc fortress and kobold fortress in it too good luck great to see you doing a df play through again i actually subbed when looking for a good df lets play some time ago the confident finger if you know what i mean d ive been waiting for a lets play of this from you ive spent countless hours in this game guys im 12 i love games like this where you build but i dont quite understand what this i any help oh yes ive been waiting for this i always wanted to play df but the complexity of it drove me away now i will learn i recommend getting masterwork df instead it has some ingame features that are essential such as searching for keywords in item lists your stocks etc not to mention an ingame professions overview without having to tab out to another app finally it has some simplifications like renaming all different pig leather ostrich leather blabla into just leather making crafting easier and more reasonable informative and enjoyable as usual quill gl on your fortress yes oh man i am so looking forward to this your commentary is brilliant normally but i cannot wait for this series i would love to see quill play evil genius theatrics plus strategic planning entertaining villainy check subs quill started another df lp so excited oh man oh man dwarf fortress this is great a dwarf fortress series praise the sun waiti mean strike the earth grizzlefloors was actually how i found quill way back when after i finished my jefmajor binge i was looking for someone else entertaining who played the game and eventually came across this channel was amazed at how i found someone not only fun to listen to but actually informative too then via quill i was later introduced to the civilization series as well as the whole 4x genre twas a bountiful discoveryindeed love some dwarf fortress need to get back into this what a pleasant surprise for some reason your funny translated livestream ad wasnt showing up for me i just finished a severalhourslong livestream for old gods will be online soon this is magnificent there arent any periods by default in most themes because that icon is shared with ground it tends to make your ground a bit too busy it can easily be switched around though love it and pls play eval scientest usually i skip ahead because i hate how long it takes for people to get through talking but i dont mind quill i would have preferred 13 dwarves but oh well dwarf fortress with eva ermagerhd i think i just came xd seriously though this is awesome and i request more of all the things 3 3 im really enjoying the old gods at the moment kind of surprised you havent released anything on it yet but ive been playing it so much it feels like its been out for weeks already i wonder if youd think the norse are overpowered andor if they would be nerfed by the time you make a video im sure whateverwhenever you do it will be awesome as always guinness the best irish beer ever you have to the play evil genius it was my favorite childhood game would love if you played evil genius i mean catsplosion can we have a xatsplosion hang on did you just choose an embark spot with no goblins but what about the fun having mineral occurrence everywhere can reduce the chance of finding flux stone to zero so its not the best choice having it everywhere always nice to see well explained df lets playstutorials i think i will watch this series even though i dont play df play more simcity yeah sims 2 on launch was bad took 45 mins to save my game the first time i played new dwarf fortress video from quill oh yes best way to learn df spend a lot of time on good videos like this have the wiki open guess what happens after playing several sessions you dont need those crutches any more erm no you still need both but it is good fun wait you have seven dwarves and no doc mumble he was my favorite best historical figure i have ever seen was the great yak cow of workik i like it i always wanted to learn dwarf fortress and youre explaining it very nicely aw man this is just awesome i barely started getting into df a few days ago so gonna love this video series how convenient i pressed escape to watch the next video k im intrigued about this game ill start watching quill you should play hard time by mdickie omigoshdwarffortresssqueeee hurray for dwarf fortress are you going to nickname your dwarfs with peoples names from here arent these definition episodes usually episode 0 pork comes from cows obviously idk why people are afraid of aquifers so much they are easy to dig through maybe you need to watch a tutorial but afterwards it is easy you know unlike the whole 200 dwarfs management thing make an infinite water source out of the box you dont rely on river rain witch can flood you if you are not careful ahh ill never get used to these fancy tilesets oh and hi eva mayu here roast pork cow really yessss finally so excited about this lp this is going to be a great series will savor every last episode this is a masterwork df stream it is decorated with cabochons of youtubery on it is a picture of a quill18 the quill18 is surrounded by cheering fans this relates to the founding of a new lp of df by the gamer quill18 in the year of 2013 this object menaces with spikes of fun half an hour just to create a world i love it wooooo this is a good way for me to learn this damn game how to make a pork roast grow a cow mmmm love that cowbred pork roast been reading boatmurdered and headshoots the past few days i was hoping someone would start some df content for me to enjoy d more yes dwarf fortress again omg omg omg omg happy this is such a good game i was just hoping that you would do another dwarf fortress lp yes quill sunday for me too d wooo finally porkroast grow the cow logic yesssssssssssssssssssssss df has a lot of fun potential doesnt it i quit after the blot dwarf fortress always ends in fun dwarf fortress and innis and gunn rum aged automatically win good tto see quill and eve team up again dwarf fortress ftw this can only end well please live stream some of this at some point lots of win in this site d new video just after i finished watching the ck2 stream i just stumbled across this randomly looking at videos for another game i am throwing money at my screen for your project but it seems not to be working please set up a place for us to throw money at you preferably with some form of reward such as access to the game hint hint wink wink nudge nudge why is only pleding via credit card possible this is so interesting like rimworld in 3d and many more game mechanics die to extra dimension ill certainly be following this i do like that water is a limited resource but you should allow technologies and gameplay to deal with the issues much like how food is solved long term through farming i think you should allow transformation of salty water into drinkable water through high tier technologies this will solve water collection issues for large colonies as well as generate salt which is an important trading commodity in the old days i see you have weather element like rain in the game so alternatively a late game method to secure water is through constructing large reservoirs to collect rain and diverting them into aqueducts back to the colony i dont see snow yet but the same can be said with snow mountainous terrain should allow snow to collect which then will melt in late spring and collect naturally into streams or natural depressions that the player can take advantage of with the right gameplay these system of resource managements are better than artificially limiting the resource you guys gotta work on the ui but this one certainly seems like the best minecraftlike dwarf fortress out there i was randomly looking for embark videos and was so happy to see this wow this is so exciting im so excited to watch you play dwarf fortress ive always wanted to play dwarf fortress but i absolutely dont have the time to learn so i really love being able to watch you play this is exciting ive heard of dwarf fortress but never seen it in action this series will be a great introduction okay this is interesting i am loving the gameplay just tested it today ill play it some more early next week as well but so far so good for performance no issues to report either controls are taking some time to get used to for commands etc nothing big cool game and keep up the good work you should do a lets play and may be show off the development of the game too that is what a lot of these style of games miss that is pretty important social interaction between pawnsit is enjoyable being able to run homogeneous group with or without outside world interaction looks great will be watching this looks good cant wait to show this off in my channel when the time comes i like the look of this game good luck with it we need more games like this that have substance and engaging gameplay also just wanted to say that im developing something similar to this but its different enough to continue work on it you are doing a great job on this and it should be a very interesting game to play and to watch yt series one thought that came to mind near the end of the video was how good torches would look lighting up the area perimeter walls lamp posts throughout and indoors will the technology remain at the level of fire for light or will you get into electricity as their technology advances thanks for the peek this looks great holy bejesus this looks absolutely phenomenal all the best with this mate it looks good wow this tileset looks amazing game has really come a long way in some ways at least good commentary but sooooo slowwww lol watching a bit late only just saw you mentioned on reddit ill also vote for a tileset over ascii have you tried the meph launcher i see you link to lnp i just tried the meph launcher and i was surprised but it is far superior to the lazynewb it is amazing all of the options and stuff the mephlauncher gives access to mephlauncher link httpdffdbay12gamescomfilephpid13407 thanks for a great episode keep up the great work you just got a sub i dont mind playing to a small audience but i dont want to end up with no one ascii makes more sense to me as its how i have played df mostly the tilesets always leave me wanting relearning yay using a tileset d i like you nice gameplay commentary cool i watched you other one if this i cant remember if you have made tools for all the people i know you might not need 5 miners but do you know if it hurts to have 5 people with picks in their inventory can they equip more than one tool like say one pick one club one ax one knife great job funny im currently workin on 1 map myself also based on a city structure just as large if not bigger also it actually looks like a city forged with roads a parking garage accessible buildings still under beta testing but need the communitys feedbak catch me online by looking for my gt fu3go14 message me so i can invite have u test my map for submission to best forge maps u shall see it soon thfe what happened to conversion awesome map shoe i love urban btb designs so this felt right at home to me pa1nts do more linear infection and to continue on what i was saying it really doesnt look like a real map as you claim still have the blatantly obvious blocky appearance of any forge map yes its an unfair critique as virtually all forge maps are subject to it but you really cant try to say its not an issue i liked it in reach but the aesthetics hampered it looks a lot better in h4 but i think it could have been better if it was done on a modded canvas that allowed for the terraforming technique a desolate city over ran by desert sands would have been much more aesthetically pleasing the map looks great the only problem that i see is the flag seems to close to the capture spot great job on the audio psycho duck i was able to hear you load and clear awsomeness is mine none can challenge him in this subject preacher x21x always drives off cliffs dont let him touch the wheel preacher x21x is the best driver of all time embark did not reach its kickstarter goal but it is planning on launching a early access maybe on itchio in a couple weeks great game more lets plays this game is good but need a lot of improvements trash pick a cold starting area result for 34 months all the people does nothing but run into shelter the best clothes ive made is 5 heat but the cold biomes is 20 or they freeze to death trying to bring wood back to heat the room add hempfor hemp rope purposes just waiting my key xd wanna show this game to the world i have a great rimworld vibe watching this but tell me one thing can we harvest organs and so very bad stuff in this game like rimworld i whish a feature to make something like blueprints you can mark something like a room and rappadly plan multiple for it on the map i need a new game like i need a new hole in my head given the two dozen or more games i havent even installed yet but yeah its on my steam wishlist and ill be picking it up as soon as its available though i probably wont be playing it for awhile i supported it on kickstarter last year so after that failed im glad to see youre still moving forward good luck with the steam launch good news i hope the steam launch goes well when will keys be sent out to itchio buyers sweet any chance of a gog release

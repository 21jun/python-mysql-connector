gratitude to all our users for supporting our game as well as our development team from the very beginning its been a memorable experience to engage in close communication with users to bring about change discuss various ideas and to implement such ideas into our games development while we are discontinuing the game service the journey weve taken together has been an extraordinary experience which we will remember for a long time its never easy to announce service closure of a game and its harder knowing how much time and effort our community members and users have put in to making ava dog tag into an enjoyable game due to various issues resulting in our inability to continue servicing the game we will be shutting down our game servers on may 29th 2019 service closure details 1 we

a little weird idk i cant play it i suck ava 2 looks not bad although their maps still look the same i prefer how they make maps in ava2 blue sky instead of building in the background also simplify some of parts in maps which make them less complicated this game was such a dissapointment nothing like the old ava movement is shit gun play is weird af no escape like hello do they not know the community eboat and espace forlyf and escort like wtf is this broken hog mode shit and gun models look shit not to mention low fps wow i waiting for this og ava was so much better haha timmy use knife

does work but has some flaws rooms are setup by ip addresses or self hosting its pretty complete but need a bit to figure out the setup while the client runs httpsdiscordggqwrtch i miss ava so fucking

all about the new game as it is not pay to win anymore but im so sad that i bascically lost hundreds of dollars spent on the original game i teared a little when i saw india map so many hours spent there on sniper no semi on this map can i still download it how to download did you ever try sudden attack game its the 3rd most played game in korea behind overeatch and lol but i think north america or australia needs that game too so you are that fking lagger i loved alliance of valiant arms and im excited for the new one screen too shaky especially when zoomed in all that is bad imo f3 no semi and sniper gallery bloody shame the maps are so poorly designed dumb question but is this game hard to get into because i do plan on trying this game out ive played games like counter strike combat arms crossfire what like download hey any one want close beta code for this game for some cs skins i got 1 code from slivertv if you can quick scope in an fps the sniping is not good yo

the 1 who liked how the new ava was before it shutdown to be honest pay 2 win or not ive always loved the game u could still rekt the shit out of people who had pay 2 win guns with just one head shot it wasnt that hard to win xd the new cold case looks great are we able to get the black rose team fortress 2 by playing adt yet ava ib steam now yey hello guys im searching for a friend that we used to play in 2009 his nickname was the1eyesnipe i used to play in a clan called ranau77 my nickname was tugaplayerz he was one ofthe higest ranks of the game goddamn only na eu servers again i still remember the asia ban on ijji back in the day which forced me to quit they need asian servers but on the other hand imo it wont get as much traction as blacksquad or iron sight removing p2w will also equal to increase the difficulty which is not friendly for casual players but i aint complaining follow avadogtag community on instagram for any updates can i request a link to download it and is it possible for indonesian servers how to download this game or where i can find in this link no game to downloadhttpsplayavacom as the game is downloaded in steam it does not appear anymore ava was my first lovei remember the feelingthe enjoy i get while playing escape moddude so many flashbacki think first weapon skin was famas firefox and it was pure shitoh those fucking capsulesi only won 1 timeak hawkeyeafter i found out ava is coming back in vanilla versiononce again i have a reason to keep myself alive im so happy this happening i am so happy this game will return 3 for me it has one of the best gunplay i have ever experienced and no game is like this hi i want the link of the game to dowload it who misses india sniper only haah when will this game be made public for all to download cbt right now south america south sea asia stay tuned for more undercoverdude i was a colonel and put to much money on this game it pisses me of but since ava i didnt found a game better than this game fuck it i will play it anyway ucd you should signup to the cbt and play anyway it looks like there will be servers in singapore which is medium ping ava was a huge game for me and other australians whom ive hit up regarding this game the comp scene for this game was actually legit i mean you had cs pros like skadoodle and michael3d come from this game shout out to defkon vs astrick iesf2010 comeback watch this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvytput7usfbi is it just me or do the classes look maybe a little too similar to warface man i had an ak47 origin and m4a1 origin on ava too i havent touched the game in years though and only popped back on for a short bit to see whats happened kinda sad to see it go but its nice to know that theyre now going for a more balanced game im dissapointed i was playing the beta and it was boring guns felt weak servers werent that good either atleast i was happy to participate the beta welcome to cbt october 1922 south america south east asia closed beta test is scheduled to take place from october 19th until 22nd servers will be open 24hours during the cbt schedule if you are residing in either south america or south east asia and have not yet applied for the cbt please apply for your cbt access below selected testers will receive an email with beta access key on october 18th regional restrictions korea japan taiwan china httpplayavacom i will have around 120 ping because eu pretty excited about ava coming around again and cant wait for the open beta really hoping they fix some of the gun play and sound issues also they gotta bring that frf2 back into the game with its crisp sound so iconic for ava sucks that the servers arent in your favor as of now good video my guy have a good one is there any pve based fps game i never played much fps game before beside bullet force but its a mobile game i wanted to try pc fps games but none of it suit me im just casual player most of game i tried to play had pretty high skill ceiling vet players dominate the game i tried blacksquad it just i cant bear getting 1 tap by player who play longer than me looking for some casual fps game i like what you said setting on low i been gaming on pc since the 1997 quake i want fps not looks thats why im on asus vg278hv 144mhz 1ms 1080p with gtx 1070 nice job ill never play fps on 4k or 1440pmy opinion i wish escort would be available but ill probs play this when it comes back cold case blacksquad is still the best free to play fps i know people that have 5000 hours in this game and have spent thousands on overpowered weapons man they must be pissed fuck en masse fuck aeria except iron sight good game but fuck them what they did to ava loved your video played ava for over 4 years my channel has some cool videos its been years since i played this game i remember all the pros left ca and came to this game for a little bit lol your always late in new games because this game release 3 months ago what button do you press to download the game on their website nothing of that shit cant replace the old ca i hope you can aim down sight with all guns omg cold case is outside again d d great i can ads in this game what about all the guns i had i assume i need to make a new acc to right download free i have started dirty bomb and love it it has good devs but no players so if you are reading this play db is there asia server line of sight battle royal is outbeta very old game i used to play this with my brother about 56 year ago the game i remenber so is pve and escort aww sad it not available yet i find ironsight to be dogshit so if this game isnt p2w im excited for it hopfully not too long of a wait 2009 ca would be no oil rig 2015 isnt bad imo wish they released more unique guns not another variant and added forged guns for gp and guns should have built in customization red parts increased dmg fire rate accueacy bringg back perm abilities low and max look the same imo ok i unistalled the original ava from steam im on pmang and downloading ava just not sure if its the original or not oof i tapped ur head behind dat box 1150 nice video ucd quality content as always so is this still closed beta or can i donwload it now cant wait for the full release d ive played this quite a lot but then came the mentioned problems so i was gone tried it later again but it was bad im hoping that this time itll be great again as ive started first time i would love to play this again i had really fun with this game following the tank to achieve a quicker overall time then the other team etc or just the classic bomb planting defusing routine or tdm etc anyway im liking this news thx for bringing this to my attention great vid big question is it going to be on steam this game looks very good i never played the og ava but ill try ava dog tag i kinda dont like the menu i loved chilling in lobby in ava damn i was hyped to try this game out once i saw the gameplay but then you said closed beta so rip anyways great review ucd in regards to servers in other regions regions that already have a version of ava will not be getting dog tag and are restricted from dog tags servers until the contracts they have with the publishers reach an end according to the red duck they want to bring this game to all the places that already have ava but cant yet and understandably so they are considering more servers for places that dont have a version of ava but its not something id get my hopes up about right now at least not until release i also believe that raw mouse input wasnt an option in cbt because it wasnt a finished feature and they didnt want to give players an option ingame to enable it because of that though players could still enable it if they so choose in the files with the notion that it wasnt finished and could be buggy it should be a feature you can toggle in obtrelease im excited to see red duck taking their game back and turning it into a real monster of a f2p fps as ava h hell yes ava was so gooooood back in the day even with its bad p2w model im so happy i recently fully switched to linux so i really doubt ill be able to play it even through wine because anticheat n stuff but its a good thing to know that kids these days get mostly great f2p games with no p2w bs yo i m one from the operatives and would like to share this video with your permission on the discord server next on the review list ring of elysium and also when i played ava i really liked sniper only in gallery when this comes out please make a video bout it finally a video from ucd that i like since ca died ucd does not know what to do with his channel since ive played ava this is finally a video i like in my opinion you should keep making vids about this game i think its good red duck is taking back its own game ucd keep up your work i like this game if it were not for you i would not know ava is returning interesting how to download the link dont have download button where the hell is the game i checked steam ava is back prolly not they need better animations the gameplay lools stale and repetitive but it does give me an old ca feeling so i might like it feels so bad to find out the game closed i used to play that game alot i had a sidewinder and everything knowing that it is all just memories now is so sad even if the game was to relaunch our users are gone dang man all the infected matches anyone know whats happening with the redduck hq they had a beautiful hq building wondering if its already sold off to another company where can i get that flag on the wall woathis is hard news havent been up to date since the beta now i see the game is closed dog tag had potential but there was no tpg or frf2 so became dogshit i was looking for the game wanna see how it plays but boi oh boi i was too late even the website playavacom is dead hey its been a month any news i was 1 of the cheaters love you i was forwarded this video and watched a few bits of itimpressive how little detail and accuracy is once again being used herereal shame that being directly involved still wasnt sufficient to get the message properly i guess all is written with a billion astricks in this scenariohilarious edit had a good laugh the fewe minutes that i could bear to watch tho hey myth do you have the list of creditors i am interested to see what companies could possibly get ava ip i dont fully understand the relation between ava dog tag and tavakavajava do they all fall under the same brand which ones will continue and why were other servers ever gonna get a dog tag or was it just the international market steam ijji was the only time that ava was doing great good content regular updates and plenty of playerbase when aeria took over ijji all the games that were from ijji died eme just couldnt get a big enough playerbase to keep it alive lmao shitty game didnt even last 2 weeks roflmao hey mythsky will ava reborn again rip ava for now i guess for the people wondering ava is a very old game its originated from 2007 in korea and in 2009 for na its been switched between hosts countless of times and turned slowly in to a pay to win based game it used to be a massive competitive game even bigger than cs back in the day for the scene and player base back then it was insane seeing it being remade by redduck makes me happy but it makes me sad that they are removing the core elements of what the game used to be i hope they will listen to all the beta testers and make the game feel like it used to back when ijji hosted it the game has so much potential and if it moves towards the changes needed and maybe even get a source change from unreal engine 3 to 4 it would be a massive competitive game as it was back then this game is gold and should still be around to this day there will never be a game like ava for the people that been playing it from day one all say the same thing born in cs and molded in ava so fucking good my dude guys its a free game if only all these kiddos knew that 2010 2016 ava was the game that black squad developers were dreaming to create get ready mofos ava is comming back i so hope this will be good i used to play this day in day out how they managed to destroy the game is beyond me this game would be a gold mine in the right hands the clash network is excited to present you its first of many avadog tag tournaments250 cash prize httpsdiscordgguxqaub4 the ferocity cup 1st place 150 cash 2nd place 75 cash 3rd place 25 cash head to our discord for more information httpsdiscordgguxqaub4 this game will be free ava dog shit xd i hate to say it but black squad feels like the better game of the two and i played old ava for 5 years 9000hrs and loved it the problem with bs is that it lacks new content and people are leaving because of cheaters and boredom im bored with bs too and i cant play it anymore but if i had to choose between ava dog shit and bs id choose bs any day of the weke im curious how you say that even the old ava in its prime was more successful than cs 16 or source obviously lets remove csgo for this comparison if you look at the overall player count as well as tournament payout and coverage there is very little to compare there yes ava did have a competitive and tournament scene but if you include all regions korea china and the us among others its far from close just thought provoking i dont understand why all these changes it soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo unnecessary i only play cbt 2 games i say nope with all the gun changes that make the game feel in a weird state definitly not worth a download unless they change it back hey flex when will ava dog tag be released for public i never played ava but this time i would like to play it right from the beginning ah i see the iconic x9 is still in the game even though ive heard how theyve messed up the gameplay im still really excited for it i grew up with this game played it ever since ol ijji and i just want to play it again i just hope they nail it by release childhood game glad to see its still alive black squad is way better than this what is the game name nice kills bud lmao finally someone said the truth about this game it actually looks like dog doodoo lmao i played the 1st ava and i had great expectations about this but turns out its just a small graphics change lag and noregs are far worse in this game than blacksquad had 50 ping and my character keeps getting teleported like the 4th hokage on meth also which server were you playing on i met kana in eu but never met you at all lmao the spamming of x9 in chat looks like it could be really fun just needs some pollish these game was so cool either the new players their grapic so bad etc better than in bs so this game are cbt wait for couple years the game itll be awesome the coop demo other guns characters i played this game since 2013 and i lost everything i hope youll enjoy i so wish they would add a kill cam to bs that would be so sick i player this game before but high lvl players dint want play with new players this game not only have bad gameplay model play and weapons i play at garena so i buy csgo more better game and have good community sorry for bad english thx for shared good video only black squad is real for me this game looks good but i love black squad owo new minecraft update looks sick bro play line of sight trash game lel idk about this game brother but it looks nice clip of instagram try ironsight how many does this game cost nice video btw ye black squad is better this one is bad designed sounds viewmodel i personnaly play csgo but i watch your bs because its so epic i feel like this version is worse than the old oneno 09 glove still use sa58 para with low recoil no tks lets make black squad great again the servers dont close description says it all thx for the vid flex beast that was literally my reaction when i played the game i couldnt understand why it was so hyped up by everyone because it was so bad core gameplay is fine but the animations and the graphics look very outdated firing the gun and hitting shots arent satisfying viewmodels look funny bad crosshair customization etc the game simply just feels way too outdated for a game that will be released in 2019 sooits that a nono on ava nice call of duty gameplay just wait till crossfire hd comes out then yall see what a fps game is no shit but this looks like csgo whats the name of the game the guns sound dooodooo never played it and never will name this game today is my bday and im here to say flex is the best looks

download it this is pathetic you can barely call it a reskin because they dont even bother to change the model it seriously looks like the base ava game just with ever so slightly better texture and they just slap a dogtag at the end barely change anything and call it a sequel honestly why dont they just update the base game and if they even bother to make a sequel why dont they at least put some more effort into it this is way to absurd for me to support the game when it comes out i need you welcome back baby we will play together in the future cya in ava dzn or minra how to gel this game its the same with better graphics ahahaah when is the official launch open beta where can i install ava no more enmasse ava is back you ez need practice could you upload black squad i was kalinzange on

have achevmant 1st down i played the original ava during beta this looks like its alot more pollished but i hope there anti hack softwhere is better as well as a few other key notes they failed on such as lag and listing to feedback other that that one of the best fps shooters i have played when it was run by ijji lets hope they do better this time around the website is down httpsplayavacom someone knows the requirementes this game admins ban hackers better then csgo and the admin is kinda friendly this is why it is better when does it come back out fully aaaaaaaaaaaaah goof memories with this game and specially my first f2p fps kinda battlefieldish named war rock it was so damn cool veicle combat and all but later on the pay2win and hakers killed it ohh boi good ol ava is bacc i hope they keep the epic bgm this look shit lol bring old ava back dont bother playing this game there are just head shots only black squad is better ava fan will never say it bad because old thing but because new thing are making it worse badengsorry how i can download it if im subscribed i dont know if its my pc or what but i feel like there is some kind of mouse acceleration even with mouse smoothing off and i have alot of screen tearing can someone help me to fix the stupid shit battleye i cant play this game because of the stupid shit battleye looks generic unoriginal gunplay not exciting sound design is awful everyones in comments comparing this games with new generic shooters when this game is an fucking legend httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ipbkcfoms and it have the old music c people are playing this shit and not battalion it feels like one of those other generic fb shooters all of these f2p fps games you play are so stiff i guess you get what you pay for am i the only one who feels like this doesnt feel nearly as good as the old game movement weapons hit detection and so on i dont know what they have done but this feels off compared to old ava old ava minus pay to win would have been fine but this is not as good hello undercover dudes can u make a video is black squad still worth playing even csgo is free to play now please whats new about this game are you allowed to make a gameplay video with a closed beta game this is remake of this winter map i used to play ava a few years ago fps games just like ppl they look the same but with unique soul as a player of the old ava this game really is lack luster in 2019 i thought this video is from 2010 didnt know people are still making such a horrible games i dont wanna sound rude of anything but this is literally a recloned version of some of the free2play games already available not hyped sorry the problem i always had with ava was that it filled remaining slots with bots looks like its still the same my problem with the game was the sound and mapdesign looks like theyve kept both the same when does this come out do you think youll be playing this game a lot in the forseeable future they ripped off a map from blacksquad this is what combat arms 2 should of been im so bad at this game asymetric maps cheesy gun sounds this game was blast and fun back in 200910 but for a nowaday standards is kinda bad there are better f2p millitary shooters out there such as black squad or iron sights well at least they got russian dubbing made well when is this game playable finally a good looking game this has got me excited this map is similar to one of black squad map game is okay but the guns are just too fking close feels like dudes holding it next to his cheek i cant stand the viewmodel this game is free looks like your typical korean made free to play shooter this game is satisfying to watch for some reason ill give it a try wheres my purpple hit marker this is just ironsight meh id rather have a new black light retribution why are people hyped for this game enemy down i got one idk what so special about this game its just another free to play generic shotter there are a buch of games like this how to download it subriscribe in my channel guys is it going to be in open beta soon when i saw that the servers where shutting down i immeditly went into the shootingrange i played for a good minute it caught me off guard toxic community but game is ok super watch out backstabbers in chat grouped like hyenas link for download please where i can download ava and we have a aeria youtube lover mate it is pitty you didnt see ava during ijji oyu dont even know how god like was the game anyways if you think it is gonna be ok to aeria games it is bad aeria made ava like 90 worse btw no ofence i love ava played like 50 hours a week duting ijji times omg wooohhooo ava aint dead finally d thanks for the vid dood anything about system requirement will everyone be able to test it i love this game so mutch i hope that the escape mode also returns it will be full of hackers what happens to all the money we spent on gunscaps etc any news on that if the fking compagny just put a good anticheat ban the real cheaters like imyoyo didnt make megacaps and fortune stars if they didnt remove aic awc and iesf and if they maked real cashprize in esl ava would not be dead when we will can play ava i used to play ava since 2010 i told my friend years ago that i wish they would make hd remake of ava and seems like my dream is coming true now would be sick to get into alpha but i wonder do they reset our characters when it goes from alpha to beta i guess we will find out once they release more information anyway the hype is real now steam marketing is cherry on top of this new release amazing i honestly cant wait i have games like bf1 and csgo but before that i played mostly ava started playing it i think around 2011 maybe 2010 when ijji still owned it play a while when aeria took over but it really wasnt the same i wonder if i will see any players that i remember from back then alpha test july 18 22 europe north america is it going to be free escape on map like boat was my personal best gamemode and id want to play it some more l im glad man ava was the best game on pc holy shit yes was so down that ava shut down and now i see this cant fucking wait if this shit is legit hey i hope they add sea server and any blacksquad armys here fuck off thanks for the headsup definitely gonna try it china japan korea taiwan will be region blocked what does it means well i havent tried this game even the old versions im from sea and im a longtime blacksquad player i cant wait xd senpai heart me im so excited best gaming news ive heard in the last 5 years follow and join to ava community on instagram avadogtag ava dog tag or black squad notifaction squad 3 first hey nassty do they have that inspect animation like in cs go or bs used to play during ijji era but quit the moment aeiragames took it glad to see its getting some light ggcongrats on 3k subsbtw can you make a video on bs anniversary ava was what taught me how to play fps games i was just a little kid in middle school with a trashy laptop who eventually learned what it meant to actually play at a more serious level the once enjoyable and balanced game was turned into a p2w piece of garbage i was hyped to hear that the game would return but i remained reserved because i knew redduck did not have a good track record i was utterly disappointed with this phase of testing in my opinion it was a one step forward and three steps backward kind of situation i remained slightly optimistic that redduck will improve mostly because they cant afford to mess up again and this was an alpha testing but only time will tell looks exactly like ava i feel like they need to change the gun animations and make the gun look slimmer in fov it just feels outdated the animation and the gun models fov positioning the one real thing they changed about the game was the ak and its shit how to download pls link this game is a dodo love ur videos you are amazing in all the fpswow how are you doing it d you are profi in all games d how to download this game or where i can find in this link no game to downloadhttpsplayavacom this will be like after macro patch or before patch hope it will be on steam very cool uhm this looks like a shit version of a shit call of duty game why does everyone praise it that video gave me a boner i miss this game so much that lucky bring back the old sound hopefully when they release the full game my fucking god i knew they would ruin the only good thing about ava the para sound i fucking knew it was coming fuckkkk where can i play ava been missing it so much paras sound is too bad bring back its original sound please omg love this game i played all version of this game like all around the world hope this dog tag version not drop what but en masse closed ava how you play it wtf is real my life is complete my baby is back cant wait to mm damn this gun is more like slr from pubg xddd para now looks more like fg42 from old ava wait does the map dont change in ava dog tag bro soooooo much better then before wait did they bring back tapping they talk about my 1 taps but wtf is this sound of para and they didnt remove the fking on ranks so its a para with the spez barrel and no anti macro patch i really want to get my hands on sa58 para when the beta comes out xd cant wait really good gameplay footage as always gj andii big love of para 3 when it will release on sea tt love the fact that the para is back but that noise is horrendous that last shotdamn i wish they kept the original para sound otherwise is this para the prenerfed the hitboxes still seem to be buggy this is amazing and btw well played did they increase the flash bang duration when we can to play i will the open beta now d nice dinks im glad the para is back the game is not the same without it wait is the game available to play again join this discord if you want to know more about ava httpsdiscordggvabj4jc httpswwwplayavacom wow when this game releases i do not playing korean ava shitty game anymore cant played sadly this game will be shit like bs if it doesnt impose actual ping limits all the insurgency games play this way lol at all these csgo players complaining how to download the game i was hyped for this game but it seems really really really bad tried it for about an hour was owning pretty hard too 35 kd per match but its just bad shooting feels really strange recoil feels incredibly random tapping seems rng due to randomly popping helmets instead of one shotting do we really need rng when headshotting as stupid as fatals in bs floaty movement movement is slower than a turtle made it to the water options are super barebones no proper graphic settings fov sliders etc crosshair settings are a fucking joke 3 crosshairs to pick from thats it no fixedunfixed alpha dot different crosshair types colours size or anything its 2018 sniper vs rifle balance is a joke literally everyone and their mom is holding angles with sniper rifles grenades are slow as fuck for some reason why sound effects in the game are a joke like from the late 1990searly 2000s sound balance is completely out of whack randomly get your ears wt r the pc required system requirements i dont know if its hard or what but the old ava was better maybe because i played black squad long time and gameplay not the same or what i dont like it but it still beta i hope i see it good for anyone interested in playing the game its offline right now and all this gameplay was recorded during redducks closed beta test when the game is live you can find it freetoplay on steam as of right now the open beta is not announced yet but should be available within the next 2 months short little review the game right now definitely needs work as it doesnt feel very satisfying to play headshots need to do more damage and the recoilbloom needs adjustments because the para main gun used in this video is too easy to use but feels underwhelming at the same time the sounds primarily footsteps need tuning to be more crisp aim punch needs to be turned down slightly as its too harsh in its current state although many argue that aim punch is fine and some argue that it needs to be removed completely diagonal dash strafing left right while moving forward needs to be removed completely because it fucks with the sensitivity when running even if you have it o hi i want the link to download the game i used to play this game alot years ago i also played the pv beta let him play whatever he enjoys playing subbed just for your aim great video good gun control check my channel for videos when are you

wonder can the language be converted to a different one anyhow happy friday wow thats awesome another awesome game my friend one question whats a camper this game looks amazing considering its free and you seem to really enjoy playing it chas it does seem very fast paced shadows look the same like the old one no change got to love alpha testing i have a few questions but i dont know if youre going to respond ava is completely removed idk what garena ava is but thats still up or no and is this only available in the two regions alone for now youtube changed the quality of my video to bad ohhh did it released i used to play the old ava will deffinetly give this a chance first that game is garbage lol that spray n pray with the famas just press w and hold lmb this game will rock again 3 do maay play this game nc black squad better but where can i find this game he isnt on steam sorry for talking so fast trying to get it all into a short video rather then making it long 3 hopefully a revival in 2020 now when the game will come and its canceled download tis game ava greats graphics its first modern game online free top ava and those hackers will find another way to bypass the new game guard though it will be sad ava without escort is bs i hope it will be good i loved that game d good points but crouch spam should never be removed no scope pls imean its not bs we need more like cs go or at least the old ava i never played ava idk if we had ava back then in ph or its just no promotional on the game idk but the game would kill bs i guess i think its good that there will be another korean game out there many people said to me that when the original ava service was ended bs devs actually got lazier because they lost one of their biggest competition but with ava back they should do something more than skins anyway i am really looking foward to new ava and with casual modes added i will give this game a try ps nice video as always i think this is best fps that korean ever made nomatter how manys years past deadsquad become really dead soon people are saying that this game is better than bs really nigga bs 3 ava is ready or again is beta closed i love this game since i played in 2011 and i lost everything liked my gf money xd they can make this game better than bs how to get this game to add to what you are saying about snipers they have less jitter when being shot or jitter does not effect quick scope i will pop out and prefire a sniper and he will 1hk from 30 yards that is to op for f3 if i drop 5 shots in a row on you you should not be able to qs me while i am landing bullets on you the f3 class was op in the old versions and now is the most op that class has ever been while the other classes are the most nerfed they have ever been it feels a lot more balanced for sure but the ttk is much higher than it use to be in the cbt everyone has large cal type armor but it takes more shots to drop them i hope they lower the time to kill finally something new cametry to be god of this gamei think it will be more popular than bs they should make u ava partner development adviser or something xd advertise so they know ur not hacking dude had like a thousand hours in the last one iwas a casual and i freaking loved escort i wish theyd have one in bs as well because its so much fun you are always moving the map changes with each checkpoint its like 3 maps inside of one the only mode i can play all day but one thing i really really want is the scopes on the ars they are utter garbage completely useless if it has more use like bs the game would feel much more realistic and fun we never had the escape mode in the old game tho that would be cool too to add this can be better than black squad i like it but i play it and its a bit arcade or rough i do not know the specific word for the engine it uses i do not say its a bad game but theres something missing i do not know hmmare you leaving bs then i hope bs deves does the same as this gmae but now its dead yesterday i wanted to join clan revengewish in bs when i saw it 150 member the account was alt xd deadsquad skinsquad btwyour intro song smthng other than bs shit u uploaded nice bro keep going well yesterday i started bs and guess what i was getting 30fps in csgo i get 70 fps avg in very high quality in bs very low quality and 30 fps totally dead game im in school again now ill watch at home 6 hr left till 6pm this game is hackerfree who wants nasty to play cs go leave his like 90s kids ava nostalgia 20s kids black squad nostalgia if they ever develop what do blacksquad developers do pride they care only for their glowing skins shytttss i wanna play ava lesss go boisssee dj khalid nasstyy knowledge any chance for asia server couldnt say it any better all your pov are correct i wouldve liked to add something but you just said it all i hope they dont take too long to bring it out or maybe an open beta add 1 tap on ak and bomb sites are labeled 1 and 2 lol just tell me 1 shoot in head kill plz bro dont do that i love watching your playso plz keep playing black squad too wow the kill mark just like cod o wow your aim good how do u get the game feels good to be playing again for people whos curious about what mods im using longe range precision trigger ergo grip this is a closed beta read more about it here wwwplayavacom fkg amibothacker oil not clean water 025 i still love that shot xd so sick nice hack look at 32 sec crosshair autofocus wall lmao slowmotion 025 you can the aimbot gg andi2ninja but the best squad of ava its threedeath x get rid of that shitty music dafuq ruins the video i think 20 bullets would be one way to penalize rapid tapping for suppressing fire your gunskill is insane going to be crazy to see your videos in the future really

when they shut down the game shotgun op is there a way to get my account back from enmasse to this new version with all my weapons and stuff yay more boring quick scope style shooters no thanks honestly i think it would be awesome if they restricted the weapon variety from ava to how it was in maybe 2013 or even earlier when is the official release date got a new gaming laptop and the first game i wanted to play was ava but it was shut down when beta comes out ima play the shit out of it this game is too easy its for plebs new ava fuck yeah lol collecting dogtags in demolition released awesome m870 footage man wtf mythsky xd nice vid timmy so do you recommend the new ava how is the mouse handling and movement same redduck said the ava dog tag will be based on 201113 ava versionin korean version which is most popular version in korea and jpn i dunno they restore old system but so far as it seems to be good one too sad that asian players cant play dog tag because of region lock this is ava2 can i ask something where web to download ava right now is there still a lot of hackers in this game i used to love it but it got spammed with hackers in 20122013 you couldnt even play in a sniper match without just spawn killed i miss this game so much how are the servers add me for legit matches 1 vs 1 or whatever message me for my ign i wonder how can redduck earn money from this

it seems so clunky 10min i smell youtube money alo ahaha game any good or something cause watching video is a thing but playing it is another thing loved ava kids cut their teeth on this game when they were technically too little to be playing fps games was so pretty too beautiful maps loved the tank run damn my dad and i used to play this game alot we spent some money on this game it was super fucking fun and my dad and i was so damn hyped when we got the mp7 night flier with just 3 spins f3 only in india omggg when i showed my dad this free game i downloaded off the internet we were blown away by how awesome it was used to do k12 in middle school and from 20112013 i would play this game everysingleday for hours and hours i actually got to a pretty decent level and my dad kept playing until they took it down he even built his own computer so they graphics and frame rate on ava would be better idk why but i feel like i have a strong attachment to it because of the memories of my dad and i taking turns playing prison break and me teaching him how to use the keyboard and stuff tbh i felt like i was the only one who remembered this game please give us back ava i reaaaaly miss this game remember playing this game on my hp g3 in 2012 instead of doing chemistry homework also played it on my mothers pc man i miss ava take care fucking loved this game my name is youaremeat or meatcore comment if you knew me come back please i love this game damn i wish i knew about this game back then what yall know about ijji oh hey thats my video at 308 thanks for the nostalgia lots of memories from ijji ava days i hear neowiz just picked up the ip and is planning on remakingrereasing it in global region haha good times had alot of fun with the snipers in this game when i got the nova priam though i only used that and the frf2 black dragon for escort i remember when the first euro cap gun dropped on ijji too spent all my money tryina win it in that acc never got it and re rolled a new account lmao think it was the m4 bumble bee or some shit fucking miss this game rip this was one of the better fps at the time and it held up well tbh good times man i remember ijji did have alot of games till they went belly up soldier front karma gunz soul of the ultimate nation genesis ad drift city black squad is the closest thing to this aaaaand dog tag is shut down too so its officially dead is it offline or only online well dogtag was a flop rip ava lol played 2012 until it shutdown india snipers only was alot of fun i miss ava this is the 1 fps game i lovedcsgo is so ugly guys you know thatbring back those happy days of ours redduckpls omg this game we would spam 15 capsule when it reach 30 and some time get 2 of the same gun mass shooting every 3 months oh how the times have changed good new the new ava closed too man this video is a gem thank you for making this i loved this game rip ava now i need to play that csgo again i miss this game so fucking much thanks for making this summary i mustve played a thousand hours of this game starting in 2010 or so so to see it go forever with absolutely no way to relive it again is really sad its rather emblematic of my late teensearly 20s making poor life decisions and playing a shitton of vidya with ava being one of them it was my go to game when none of my pals were online and i just wanted to zone out and shoot at people with poor english and shooting ability got quite good at it near the end after i basically mastered the sa58 para the ijji days were fantastic back before the two subsequent companies tried to milk it and power creep was a problem i however dont know howwhy you had such a hard time getting new permanent guns i ended up with about 10 that i bought with euros i think miss this game so much tons of hours spent on this game with endless fun i remember playing this back when i was a kid for some reason i remember the graphics looking better than this must have been because it was such a revolutionary f2p pc game i have so many memories from this game especially the snake sniper and mackerel melee dude thank you for bringing up that memoriesijji times were pure goldi stopped playing it when i heard aeria games gonna take the leadeconomy were brutal i aggre but i played it for like 600 hours and had 20 parmanent weaponsthose medal were offering you lots of moneydo you remember lockdown extreme there was a glitchwe were throwing a granade to the corner of each door and no one could get out of the cell d maaan for each win on lockdown awards was 30 day silver desert eaglei had 400 days of deagle i starting playing this game on china when i was 10 years old and when i move on spain like 3 or 4 years later i starting playing it on eu version by aeria until enmasse die after that i stoping playing that because dogtag ruin that awesome game but i hope in a future it will return pdi have like 3000 hours on this game and i have spend than 1500euros on it but i didnt regret for the money that i spend because every time i play this game i just enjoy it so much also i have had many acounts but my main acount was hsmachin3 and zhihang both acc max lvl with every gun megacapsuls gun fortune gun everything and the thing that i love when i playing is there is so many pp accuse me of hack and that meke me feel powerful lmao these years are nostalgia and every weekend make a party with my friends for match ranked how many laughs for finish that post i have my chanel of youtube for my ava videos y have made a lot of videos montage about this game and also i have other video games but does it was best fps game rest in peace ava i loved you back in the days when you were publised by ijji the game had so many cool guns which was my main draw to the game its the game that made me discover tons of cool firearms i never had heard ofsako rk95 yea baby had tons of fun playing it both pvp and pve the grind to earn euros for guns anyone remember prison break survival 3 boxes only to get 500 euros lol ever since i saw it being sold to aeria games i immediately knew that this was only going to end badly i got my hopes up a bit when it was sold to en masse because theres no company as greedy as aeria games in the f2p market maybe there is now but probably not back then but i hardly ever played ava post ijji only every now and then then i saw en masse killing the servers and i pretty much lost all hope by that point red duck was in major financial trouble and we all see now what happened redduck went bankrupt and thats that i dont think ava will ever get a proper launch eve ava was finally killed due to stupid incompetent hacking players which abused the ingame euro shop system when the game loses chance to make real money out of the ingame shop system the publishers had the choice to either remove the game or waste money hosting the game while not making any profits in the end it was you the stupidcheatinghacking players who abused the system and led to the demise of the game and there go dog tag because bankrupt lets hope another company buys it and takes care of it until then there is no ava ah remembering how everyone ran sa58s and fgf2s the good ole days when someone is talking about his old broken pc to new thug life pc 111 dailyquest why did it get banned or shifted down i fkng want my black roseeeeeee reeeeeee edit i didnt understand the ban shut down edit2 1 sub loved your personality and chill feeling even that u lost your old game i played this on a potato and i got 100 fps lmafo those were the days i was always confused on how i was able to run ava and not tf2 on my laptop i miss the og ava the reboot one doesnt have that same charm anymore but i guess its still getting to where it once was best free fps game ever made like a hundred diff accounts because i always bought the wrong guns this is where skadoodle from cs go got his start btw used to hella play this and combat arms in 20092010 rip one of my favourite pc games btw 2019 anyone oh how i remember putting my life and soul into this stole my dads credit card to buy a blinged out hk416 running around in prison break boosting people and having an overall blast and escort how i miss you 3 by the way the game making a comback on steam called ava dogtag aeria games truely ruined this games used to play in hightschool had over 10 acc d poleno 110 d great memories love prisen break and escords tgey should renew tgem too youre a douchebag subscribed x3 i had an ijji account originally to play gunz but i also ended up playing ava redduck is reviving ava themselves with a remake called ava dog tag i played one of the cbs for it its shaping up to basically be the distilled essence of ava a lot of weapons removed to reduce redundancy weapons rebalanced small choice of weapons that each serve a purpose focus on sd game mode only the most well balanced maps etc the memories dude literally u wanna cry because this game has died 157 lol how did you say infection xd ava is coming back its now selfpublish by redduck ava dogtag playavacom this gamewill return as ava dog tag really miss it ur an idiot why get political i remember playing this on my potato back at 2011 it was so fun ijji reactor 3 fucking loved the interface and ava was amazing till aeria memories i loved this game new version of the game in beta rn fyi goodbye alliance of valiant arms welcome alliance of valiant arms dog tag this game was good to bad that it got butchered by aeria games i remember playing this game as well it was pretty cool back in the day many hours spent on this beautiful masterpiece you can play ava again oh yeah another game you should talk about is global agenda thx i want to thank ava for making me happy without making me spend a dime to have fun o7 this game will always be in my heart 3 i worked soo hard for this f2 sniper to get permanent aeria games completelyfucked over this game they did nothing but let hackers run rampant corrupting the servers and refusing to spend any amount of money or time to patch it the only thing they did was make more skins for weapons that you need to buy and once they realized no one wanted skins they made it so skins actually boosted weapon stats by a huge amount over time the hackers and the greedy fucks drove away i want to say over 92 of the player base when i started playing the waltherpistol just came out and i won it at the capsule shop loot box type thing expect only 1 person can win then they refill the capsule box back up to 200 yes 1 capsule contains the weapon while the others contain boosters and credits and shit back then i was looking at more than 60 lobbies i could join and over 50 other servers that were full but thatsnothing compared to what they did once they realized they fucked up the game once they realized they butchered this game they sold it i only want the black rouse lol yhea omer was the guy for good f2p games 3 rip mmohut good times crying because i miss those times they shut down my account because im pro player xd the real reason of shutting down is hacking while im not so youre kimpah hmm miss the old days btw im rexer the one who kill his own teammates hahah lol the one who usually play escape mode with pork or bork i think the second they made it so you didnt have to match the rank of the weapons requirement and could use that high tier weapon in lower tier play it became blatant pay to win i dont remember the name but there was one rifle that everyone would pay real money to unlock early it killed in 2 hits to an arm or a leg or chest with the best armor available good riddance hopefully ava dogtag keeps up with basically being the same game as before without the pay to win shit this age was hillarious door glitch lockdown line glitch death valley farming experience 1v9 in soccer melee sniper india demolition first esls gatot was the champ the strongest alliance was defkon i remember all the special things and my heart broke when i found out after many years of non playing that this game has been shut down feels like a lil part of my childhood is killed i remember waking up early just to catch an euro bug ijji players will remember there re always hackers in most of games ava had few of it and since they switched to aeria games everything went to sht rest in rip in peace ava holy moly finally found some ava fan i was plaiyng lit like few years ago around 2013 and i cameback like 5 months ago and saw almost no one was playing it hopefully its coming back miss this game haha i remember playing ava back in 2011 until early 2013 it was the best free game i could find until league of legends which sucks pretty bad nowspent half of each day playing and the other half of the day was spent waiting for my brother to finish up playing his turn of ava i only played sniper and i got really good at it accidentally bought the same permanent sniper twice good times i miss this game so bad still better than csgo imo take my subscription sir man i remember the days when i befriended a hacker in this game after showing him several map glitches using the c4 lmao finding those glitches were actually so fun omg you would need c4 and binoculars drop them in quick succession and you would get a vertical boost which allowed you to get on top of roofs and other stuff the zombies mode was fun as hell too when the population was high i remember in that winery storage unit there would be one zombie who would block the entrance to protect the human friends and all the other zombies would throw the brain grenades to kill them l m a o and then there were those glitches on that map in pve where youd have to escape from these chainsaw charging guys and you would either hang onto that ledge on the ramp coming down or you would stack in groups and the first guy would be a sacrificewhich would glitch them so they just dontmove most of the time it was challenging creative intense frightening but so much fun there would ijji still had it on steam you did a terrible do you remember of this game i just uploaded a video thats entirely better at explaining ava why did they shut it down rip my beretta barbados saved these massive smoke nades before they discontinued them think they were called xsomething dont remember but they were the best fucking smoke nades thicc dark cloud kept them in inventory and didnt want to use them because they were limited durability but stopped playing and game shuts down years later never even got to use those nades i will now miss eboat and espace forever best modes in my opinion with the best soundtracks aeria blocked my account and the reason is hacking while im pro player lol used to play the fuck of that game when i was in school free to play no money and shite good memories played it from 2010 till they shut it down rip black rose i thought ava dog tag was a memorabilia sent to their best players as a final goodbye but thats the name of the new server or remake i still know all of these players dayum it was a good time could you do an episode on atmosphir it was a really cool 3d platformercreator where the players designed their own games sort of like roblox except it had more of a focus on explorative lara croftesque environments with the ability to place gravity modifiers enemies keys doors and i think it even had coding support it just sort of vanished daily quests i went to twitchcon and talked with the devs closed beta comes out late november open beta sometime in december nothing confirmed as of right now they plan to relaunch on steam as early access around januraryfebruary glad i got the tf2 knife good times on my dads pc i only played this to get the ree tf2 achievement item lol still a great game i really liked your video it made me remember all the fun time i had playing those ijji games i used to play gunz the duel a lot sad to see all of those mmos which names i dont even remember dead like they never existed had to make another char what do you meeeeean i made a new char like every half a week just to try new weapons perma im actually really interested what the game will be like under red duck themselves the nostalgia i can still feel how the sako and the hk shot when i think about them or pretty much all weapons to be honest fnf2 and tpg1 and awm just typing them out makes me remember how they played i never ever got those disgusting weapons with pictures on them by the way always used the originals and ive got like 500 to a thousand hours in the game i also never rented and always saved up to get the gun permanently i had like 4 permanent snipers and countless permanent rifles like the para hk sako ak47 ak47mk3 ak74 m4a1 m4a1 mk3 an94 etc etc also had plenty of pointman weapons like the aks74u bizon pp19my first purchase k1a1 galil kriss super vone of my favs mp7a1 etc and it goes on and on so i dont know what you were doing but you definitely werent saving up money to get weapons seems like the renting fucked you over nostalgiaremember scriming3 paying respect to a fallen comrade link of this game plzzzzzzz i managed to buy 3 weapons permanently tpg1 mp7 and a fnfnc only played on the ijji era rip master x master and hero warz vv games called ava dogtag now i got my key for closedbeta tomorrow the zombie mode was called infection

fresh start for ava under a new flag im so excited applied for the closed beta in mid january played for 6 hoursgame is just a mouse 1 game still and the movement is so bad now yo its nasstyy here i cant lie i miss this game and i hope they fix for beta good video and good times bs is way better than ava gun physics is like trash in ava black squad have realistic gun physics and grenade this looks like remastered version of cs go not bs and bye is really nice i like it and black squad why dont black squad gj but how to join ggiveaway i cant download it iam from germany is that why i cant download the game you spray in ak47 or you taping so fast hopefully there will be an ip ban for brazilians i dont think its gonna be popular it will be like one of those flashback hype that last maximum a month when is this game coming out i like what they are trying to do with this ava version but im not so sure if this will attract many new players that arent familiar with ava what i truly hope they change is wallbang hits showing and seeing names through smokes and of course delete binos andi is coming back 3 when is it coming out again i miss ava want to play this now tbh i dont see any significant improvements of this generation of ava over the old one music i want to play too but tw cant join what server are you playing hey i used to play ava back in the day and im wondering what makes this different it looks like normal ava what will make it have a bigger playerbase after its been such a long time since i uploaded a video i hope you guys wont be disappointed with this i know its not the greatest video with the best frags but i didnt get to play the alpha that much so i hope you guys enjoy this short highlight video anyway 3 also if you guys would be nice and vote for me on this strawpoll i would really appreciate it httpswwwstrawpollme16181740 ironsight y warface estn mejor ava hack en masse entertainment spawngun hack csgo for guys older than 12 who know what teamplay is d csgo aint got shit on ava your just playing with shit people and with shit guns go play demo so search and destroy csgo lmao better than cs go i cannot wait till this game releases its been so long i remember this game is 2009 god the memories show some respect to old ava players who hate that shitty comparison awful video the fact that you think this is like csgo shows how much you know about video games do your research before making a video like this it looks better then cs go graphic lol why do you say it looks bad bad review i guess and you play like you never played shooters before people here dont understand the reason some are comparing it to csgo is because they completely changed the gunplay for the dog tag version they added an enormous amount of recoil and spread that the original version never had now it plays like a cheaper version of csgo with tapping and pattern learning unlike the original ava go check the subreddit for it a lot of people are not happy with it and the last closed alpha died very fast because of it after the first 2 days it was a ghost town watch this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4adcbcjbpw and skip to 750 who are u and judge ava ha who are u ava dog tag should not be called csgo or csgo 2 have some respect wikipedia even has basic info for you to be capable of distinguishing between 2 games pls go and educate yourself omg so this is what goes on in a beginners mind in ava i love it does anyone know if the skadoodle in csgo is the same as the skadoodle in ava at 210 was it gojira try sa58 para rifle and you will feel the recoil it did come out in 2007 this is the new version even though the graphics are almost the same also he shouldve changed his fov that wouldve made his experience a bit better it used to be a much better game theyve kind of fucked it up with the headshots aimpunch recoil etc so i cant blame him for not liking it since ive played it since like 2009ish and dont like this new version either will you give me one cbt key plz ahahaha ava is more than 10 years old the original version shut down due to the company that was hosting abused it and made it super p2w the original company revamped it with a new engine new anti cheat and obviously its still in beta they did a great job at preserving the unique and classic ava feel the fast paced sniping in this game is definitely one of a kind its cool to see you playing it d edit the original ava was released in 2007 and shut down last year ava dog tag is the revival ava 2007 csgo 2012 its not like cs go this cant be cs 20 even if it tried great video 3 alguem consegue me ajudar meu jogo fica todo preto a tela n aparece nada warface 1 vai morrer igual iron sight hi how change language i thought this game is dead im japanese user i like

whe does the game releases its worth noting today that i just checked this game on steam and it says estimated release date q4 2020 so it has been pushed quite a lot compared to what they claimed when you made this video what this game exactly is the copy of diablo with differences there is a luxury in creating a totally new game taking risks and not having any expectations blizzard has a lot of work to do with d4 due to so many issues with the franchise and the company itself having to balance the player expectations with new and innovative systems while trying to keep their loyal fan base happy its a tall order for them and at this point im not sure if they can pull it off i sincerely hope they can it could be a great game that takes us into the future but given recent events im keeping my enthusiasm in check thanks for the review man its my birthday today and had this on my wishlist forever im gonna get it coming back to play again 6 months later its insane how much more polished the game is special props should go both to integrating time travel into the game more and also how comprehensive the skill trees are im currently playing a spellblade and all of my skills roughly 15 except 1 have full skill trees from what i can tell its the same for most other classes not only that ehg has created new skills and given them trees rather than just giving trees to skills that were already made as far as time travel there are now time rifts than can be found out in the world either by killing timeshifted enemies or just by exploring these dont seem to have much to do with the story yet but each one you find has a special boss at the end of it and gives gold and experience as a quest reward overall they help the game feel like time itself is coming apart in this early beta phase you time travel a bit in the prologue but after that you only travel once in the current looks nice and clean not full of spammy effects like poe which ive played for almost 7 years also i like the camera angle ui looks worse than poe some high fantasy stuff very high damn this game looks awful this game is it free to play or next diablo is heree awesome this game looks very good i hope there is a way to turn off damage numbers because it pops above everything else and is very distracting want to know whats really sad about arpg as a genre in general you already piqued my interest for this title with the first 30 seconds of gameplay footage in the background how because i saw your health go down thats it so many arpgs now are so easy just spam your most recently unlocked skill and rush through every level without any problem whatsoever diablo 3 i beat the entire campaign without dying and the only times i ever died were when i ran headfirst into multiple mobs of blue and gold enemies simultaneously poe i got bored within the first quest line because it seemed to be more of the same hit a button and enemies literally explode with one hit every bit of footage ive seen from wolcen literally never even see the hp fluctuate lone epoch looks like there might actually be a level of difficulty involved ive heard grim dawn is also great in terms of actually having difficulty im looking for a new arpg to play and its between this and grim da whats your basic class to start to get this one era not area for the love of god rhykker this is like the best of diablo 2 and poe rolled into one pfffft another good arpg with the shit skill tree of ffx this looks fantastic cant wait for the release im a door to door salesman and i met the executive director of this game him and his family were super nice i could feel how passionate he was for this project im going to buy and play this game for sure diablo3 did an amazing job at taking old amazing skills and making them disgustingly bad such a flawed game fround the foundation up which is why it can never be fixed looks cool is this diablo ii remake but will it have skill respec no skill respec is an automatic ignore from me i was thinking onto getting a supporter pack since april 2020 is far away and you had me at your happiness this game has something other company shouldve had how is the movement work is it point and click with a mouse and keyboard or wasd im a grim dawn player and i backed wolcen on the kickstarter since i thought that would be kick ass how wrong i was but last epoch looks cautiously promising cant believe how far its got in development too puts wolcen studios to shame really looks good and im gonna grab it when i can but what is it with people wanting simpler games skill tree complexity is something i hate seeing reduced to basic features ive said this on wolcen gameplay but i feel the active skill upgrades being on a tree is a very bad idea diablo 3 had terrible skill system and companies are copying their idea poe skill tree and active skill gems is where its at so basically its a shitty looking diablo 3 ill keep waiting for a decent arpg maybe ill get one some day making dungeon crawlers all about speed runs inst appealing at all to memaybe chaos bane will bring the joy p waiting for it to come on xbox one merci bonsoir please review lost ark game d lost me at 2020 release youve shown off a lot of great arpgs that have just taken too long to come out i feel with a d4 announcement around the corner and hopefully a release not far off that these games just wont be able to compete d3 competition yeah d4 i dont think so interestingly the pauses stuttering and other lag issues associated with this beta release arent there in the linux version only in the windows version on an ubuntu 1804 based distro its as smooth as butter im having a blast playing a fully offensive fire magesorcerer with some cc im incredibly thankful to this team for supporting linux we dont have many options out there for this genre why do you like so much diablo 2 hammerdin i know its simple build but pure hammerdin is boring and cheap char i know u can luv other chars what is so nice in d2 hammerdin i mean mostly pvp keeping an eyes on it i hope it doesnt end up being another walking simulatorclick 1 button everything dies you win like some current arpgs down there game looks great but if it releases after lost ark ill never see it bought it yesterday it seems super dull levelmonstercharacterskill design compared to grim dawn thought my damages was bad i made an acolyte but it seems that you crit at 400 about im about 3k so i guess im on the right way i tried to find another video of damages but did not find i hope they add an option to only show critical damage numbers as it is now its very noisy on screen i cant even see the monsters when those things pop up game looks good though looks good thanks for rhykker introducing already added to wish list at steam and hope not suddenly announce become epic exclusive when it close to release how does it not bother you that this is a straight up rip off of the diablo spell as a first impression the graphics mostly ui look dated and not cohesive it has the look of titan quest before the expansions and its not a praise just more of the same this has diablo ui an uses the same map style as grim dawn and poe has diablo style skill trees aswell this is diablo 4 lulz this looks extremely promising ive never even heard of this game but its clearly a mix of d2 d3 and poe cant wait to give it a try frickin good stuff man game has tons of potential i hope they dont waste it and can keep up who is this ryker guy the hammerdin was one of my favorite classes in d2 ok im out peace looks better than chaosbane which releases in less than a month i would be all over this if there was multiplayer game seems too floaty for me like things lack impact looks like a hybrid build between diablos charge barb hammerdin crusader with riposte from poe a lot of possibilities combos here currently leveling a mage acolyte but this looks good max shield block with a hammer toss buildso youre playing endgame cap cheap fake copy of diablo path of exile 40 last epoch 10 in 2020 dont make me choose hi rhykker this is folks nice vaal spectral throw build d does look more promissing than wolcen looks like a carbon clone of diablo 3 not sure how i feel about that the end of time chrono trigger is this diablo game blizzard this game looks so dope been waiting for a game like this for so long i would be interested but 30euros for an unfinished beta arpg that has no multiplayer yet like cmon why thats some straight up shameless skill copying by these people can you turn off the flying combat numbers this looks fun havent really heard much about it game music need to revisited because i always go sleep after 15 min gameplay d it looks like one of those games you can only play in a browser lol end of time quite likely inspired by chono trigger oh my god i gotta ask now even if this is answered will this be online multiplayer installing it while watching this video why play this when there are other games better than this clone im in 2019 seeing a gameplay of a game that looks like 2008 i never played the game but im gonna go ahead and say that the 300 armor to minions works for the tree as well as your shield ring skill that you do since it seems to have a minion tag on it is it online only or can i also play solo offline does it include trading or is this a single player only game what shitty facial hair its like poe but shitty and you have to pay for it no thanks ugly graphic like path of exile this looks exactly like d3 looks good now i just need to get friends to play it with me this game looks promising what is this game a full year tho i rather not think about it yet looking foward for warhammer chaosbane rhykker if i may say a word the critical strike chance increase in that talent doesnt give you flat 60 increase in it its from the base 5 which means your crit chance is 8 instead of 5 is this steamonly or im sitting here cursing at my pc because this video was choppythen i read your message lol no biggie rhykker we still love ya diablo 4 better be epic otherwise last epoch will make it irrelevant i had kind of forgotten about this game honestly after the review im kind of hype because it brings a lot of great elements from several places without making it clunky its funny the graphics were brought up at the end the only thing holding me back is the character animations i know its a dumb hangup but its hard to watch absolute shxt game speed of combat looks fantastic movement looks light and fun as well dodging a plus that actually looks like its impactful aswell game looks outdated this is 2019 do better i saw spellblade as a class option and got hyped then i saw i gotta play as an old dude its the templar all over again lol at least i can work scion witch or even ranger into a variation of it though i came here to say the microphone is sounding a lot more on point not just here to say when something isnt right im also here to tell you when its awesome hey rhykker out of the recent new arpgs that youve been poking into which one would you recommend the most for checking out at their current state so excited for this game to release next year you were mistaken about how the crit change node on your tree works it stacks multiplicatively not additively in other words instead of adding 60 to your crit chance making it 65 instead of 5 it instead multiplies your base 5 crit chance by 16 making it an 8 crit chance instead i dont know about the skills your build is playing since im a acolyte lich but some of my skills have nodes that increase that skills base critical change this base critical chance does scale additively with your base 5 crit chance and it scales up before normal multiplicative crit chance bonuses are taken into account for example one of my skills can get up to i think 4 base critical chance if i had that maxed and i also had 60 increased crit chance then when i used that skill my crit chance would be 144 math looks like 5 base 4 base x 1 06 my understanding from reading a thread from someone else on the forums is that each source of crit chance added to wish list thankx rhykker keep going killing and looting looks like crap for 2020 tbh since kickstarter campaign and access to prealpha i really enjoy how this game has been developed nice review of nice game r go indepth as to what makes the hammerdins so different from eachother from their respective games i am guessing map design and whatnot plays into it not to be a hater but i bought and i very disappointed in how bad the graphic are i understand this is beta but i hope final release will have better graphics again im not tying to hate other waste of money if last epoch fixes its stuttersallows for 4k resolutions for high end pcs to showcase the beautyit will succeed also they can always add new eras to add more content they can also add new areas for all eras diablo 3 has made some good improvements but they have stalled so hard game looks like crap on linux so i got a refund it was so blurry it gave me a headache after like 20 min of gameplay a 4995 ausd early access game no thanks waiting til its on sale or full release thats twice the price it should be for a beta i remember when beta testing was free now this shit ugh hammerdin is soo boring and uninspired is respecting a thing for skillspassives and if so whats the cost i want to see you do a game of thrones video i have full faith in this teams ability to execute what they plan to execute within the time frame they established this is the single sentence that sold me on this game i thoroughly enjoy your content so to hear that you not only endorse it but youve got full faith in it sold me thank you for the content crafting is same as path of exile then again who has the time to reinvent the wheel cool game tho might try in video description it says diablo 2 lol this game is copying everything looks like another relaly solid rpg thanks as always for your support of the arpg genre and for giving me hope for games in the future also less d3 more grim dawn d d d it does look very good and interesting main constraint is time ofc so i am not sure how i would manage it but i do want to test it well well well colour me surprised it seems like hammerdin in last epoch is more meta more viable than it is in diablo iii if giving up on my favourite arpg is the price to play my favourite build elsewhere then maybe the time has come to pay it ps rhykker why does your gameplay footage look smoother than bluddsheds i really love these diablo style games and your content keeps me in the loop dude keep it coming the 1000 supporter bundle really turned me off to the game it wont for everyone just me but the gameplay looks enticing tried a path of exile hammerdin its not exactly the best but it can be done so i see wolcen lords of mayhem engine with diablo elements such innovation then again it might end up being better than all of them gonna be honest does not look interesting at all to me the animations are 2010 the skills and look is diablo noone is making new games anymore theyre just recycling old ones and adding some minor upgradeschanges especially not worth the 30 bucks theyre asking pretty much everything you spoke of about lastepoch has me excited for the full release i really like the change that they made to ui with the traditional health globe and mana globe its very reminiscent of diablo 3s ui which is great d another d3 clone hahha i hope blizzard in november 2019 coming with diablo iv and shows the world how hack slash games should be made darker graphic and better more classes better world better end gaming gaming scene is becoming the music scene slowly no originality just warming up old stuff over and over again for new generations sad rifts arenas weve seen all of this before diablo 3 first introduced this atrocious rift system and grim dawn followed with the crucible which is basically what arena is in this game its sad and uncompelling to see how these new games follow their predecessors with samey patterns bringing almost nothing new to the table rhykker after videa about median xl i stoped playing apex 320h now like 20 years ago im pushing demons till fucking 4 am amazing man really is an awesome game i started an acolyte by summoning warriors and mages and then archers specializing in poison arrows then you can suppress summoning warriors and mages so you only summon archers and then you can skill up an aoe to destroy the poison resistance of enemies and then make this aoe bigger with a longer duration and then make the archers shoot arrows faster and faster and on and onit is so much fun 1200 doesnt that just increase your 5 crit chance by 60 and not ad 60 crit chance i could be wrong here i spent to much money on games stop it rykker lol currently playing last epoch beta beastmaster pet build good also hammerdin sentinal might swap my sentinal build after watching this some bugs in beta but having a blast so far now its up to wolcen to catch up or be left behind in the arpg race for the next big game its pronounced ehpuk not eeepahk drives me nuts dude the visual style looks just awful and cheap i hope that gets polished with games like wolcen showing how good an arpg can look i love the hammerdin from d2 i love your videos thanks what ahppened to wolcen lol as a diablo fan and poe fan i must say this game looks pretty good hey rhykker this is folks is it that choppy when you play or is that because of the recording i realize its beta feels like the premise was chrono triggercross inspired reminds me of the end of time from chrono trigger a bit playing a druid atm this game has so much potential it will be amazing at launch in 2020 sounds like a paid youtube review i backed this on kickstarter first and only thing ive ever backed because it looked quite good so far i have to say im satisfied with the progress its pace and regular updates its development feels very fluid looking forward to trying it this round of upcoming nextgen arpgs have potential hammerdin is so uniquely diablo that id say they just copied them on that lol plz do video on classes and skills for the game man the gameplay looks like its from 20 years ago how is it going to compete with lostack new games needs to beat d3 and poe graphics is this for consoles what else have these devs worked on i recently bought a cheap copy of wolcen alpha to support that game what does everyone think about it vs this game which is more likely to be better for coop as i intend to almost exclusively duo with the mrs weve just started guardians of ember which is so so so far eh so 2019 and still no better option for orientation then to display the map over your char the skill system is awesome for being beta loving the loot and the classes seem cool the other aspects of the game definitely show that your in beta i see way more potential with this game than wolcen wolcen seems to be going backwards this game however seems like it could be the next big arpg i hope looks rly good thanks for nice review i jumped on the alpha in november of last year because they are developing a linux client i havent had a lot of play time but that has more to do with my other hobbies and work looking forward to playing this more absolutely love this approach to skills this is the video that made me interested in this game thanks man its not free to play right i dont know if i can justify the 35 price tag i mean the content in the full release will be worth it so i guess this is just to play the game earlier this honestly look really fun cant wait to try this out thank you for the video rhykker idk if i like thevisual landscapes feels to brownish not really compelling feels to dead for me skill progression looks bomb tho very interesting in russia last epoch in steam cost about same price as 60 game regiounal prices and everything i still bought it becuase i believe in devs and last epoch already have or will have everything i want from arpg game will wait for project tl theyre looking at an early 2020 release i dont think i can play a game like last epoch as when it comes to arpgs i like having a ui that is nice to look at and armorweapons that dont look visually like absolute garbage like its predated to diablo i standards im not one that likes games in which force ugly armor sets to get cosmetic sales and also have armor sets in which have no 3d art i like playing something in which armor is your cosmetics while their is no real cosmetics being sold hey devs enemy health bars rotation should be based using the camera forward vector and not based on the character location we need more games like this on console for us console plebs are bows in this game every single streamer plays as either the paladin like class or the freaking bear guy why hammer away when u can spin all day spinnerdin ftw please tell me there arent different typesrarities of pots like in poe so the whole increased x thing doesnt work the way it does in poe great thats totally not gonna confuse me anymore or anything d also t5 is better than t1 this is getting better by the minute d is it just me or does the interface look exactly like a reskin of d3 ui not saying its bad idea i kinda like the d3 ui but come on they really couldnt make it look original at all it seems like all they did was copy exact layout and positions of the interface and buttons and just painted them gold talking about the hpmana orbs and skill bar and the inventory make the arena open no key required to enter unofficially as an unknown but if you complete the prior content and find a writ of entry key you enter the arena officially with renown and appropriate buffs wow that end of time place looks 100 ripped from divinity original sin though to be fair if youre gonna rip an rpg i couldnt have picked a better one original sin was amazing pretty damn cool looking forward to this arpg is thriving any eta on the rogue b lade dancer looks amazing i have read about a wipe after the beta might be worth mentioning yes the crafting materials are account shared love the video that random twig of hair lol p seems like a nice game but the engine looks old it sounds like rhykker is really digging this game do we have an idea of the price range just worried about armour sets level 1 character looks like a level 30 character even the devs have stated that they havent had much chance to make armour sets and havent really given any re assurance that they will be the only thing this game has in common with d3 is the skillpotion bar not the skills epoch is pronounced epic any idea on how wolcen is going rhykker i played about 45 hrs of beta i really like it by release time this game should be 100x better than d3 and poe gotta support this tittle there is much promise in it google riposte and hit the speaker icon even go to the dictionary or merriamwebster sites and hit the speaker icon for riposte there that is the right way to say it not how you said it rhykker lol did i get your attention would love to see your take on inarius death nova for next patch looks interesting but artistically does not appeal to me thanks for the presentation 1202 i believe it is a multiplier of your base crit just like in path of exile so it would be 5 5060 8 chance to crit and not 65 chance to crit correct me if im wrong last epoch and pagan online looking really good and interesting they are both good rivals for blizzard this looks really nice it appears suprisngly polished with smooth gameplay which usually is lacking in these betakickstarter thingys last epoch is super fun ive had it since the alpha and the devs really work hard and communicate with the fan base quite a bit im currently rolling a necromancer the hammerdin build looks cool though i may try it out i could live with less then great graphicsits not that far off from grimdawn but the gameplay always looks so choppy what really stands out to me is the graphics they look so unique and mesmerizing hey rhykker first i like that you show gameplay while you explain the build great idea second crit chance from itemspassive skills works different in this game more like in poe if that one skill says 60 increased crit chance then that means you get 60 of your base crit chance as bonus so if your base crit chance character screen is 10 you now have 16 not 70 damn this game look streight from 2011y wtf and they want u to pay for beta hahahaha hadnt heard of this game until this video but it feels like a good mix between d23 and poe the anime featuring the 4 heroes in particular the shield heros shield seems to have a similar type of growth i like games with a lot of options but hopefully you get many points to spend too so you can really customize your hero very cool vid rhykker really looking forward to this cool time travel based story the concept is absolutely cool definately doesnt look bad thanks for showing the game rhykker oof those walking animations game concept is dope but they need to get shit done until 2020 im playing a lich with harvest summon wraith reaper form mark for death and rip blood loving the game so far im sick of diablo 3 lets play last epoch with a hammerdin just like diablo 3 time travel ruined the endgame im early let me make a joke hey rhykker this is folks gets pelted by tomatos im critting more often than im not thats not how chances work someone please answer me this i love poe i hate grim dawn d3 i play when im bored is this game for me riposte is pronounced with a long o like repost okay this has my attention now when can i buy it easily the best skill system of any arpg and thats saying something as to me the best so far is grim dawn and maybe poe great game already cant get enough of it polish up animations and sounds and we are well on the way hi rhykker just a question are you going to be doing a video about epic games and the purchase of psyonix thank you currently debating about getting this game not sure i share a similar sentiment with you regarding the hammerdin was a huge fan in diablo 2 used a variant that was known as the judicator smitechargefoh hammerdin was a lot of fun but the diablo 3 version seems super limited in comparison in last epoch does blizzard allow you to repec your skill points awesome you are a man of word hope to see more of last epoch on your channel i love your arpg videos why they spend money on making clonesknockoffs there is so much more possibilities in fantasy games idk the gameplay looks pretty slow i like path of exile where i can blaze through a map at 167 movement speed whilst throwing in flame dash teleports and fast af casting edit but the game is absolutely stunning so far the kickstarter was a year ago jeeze where did the last year go you should showcase all the skills while you were explaining them earlier ok count me in i was kind of worried this would be another wolcen molasses dev cycle what about lost ark crafting material is at beta account shared so says my 4 beta toons excited to try rhykkers hammerdin build crafting mats yup everything is shared gold stash mats between your characters nice overview i dived in with a necromancer having great fun why couldnt d3 understand we enjoy the d2 hammerdin frozen orb sorc bone necro etc playstyles and then give us a way to actually play the game effectively using those skills again such a waste revisiting acts in a different time hello poe somebody wrote here that cosmetic transactions will b implemented shame looks sweeeet i like the way the map looks that blue line that shows where the map carries on seems really handy i hate in d3 when you miss a path in a rift and have to go searching for it this kind of map would help identify where you have unexplored map edges im fairly certain by the wording on that passive tree that it doesnt add a flat 60 on top to your crit but instead 60 of whatever crit you have so 5 becomes roughly 8 could be wrong of course no offence but this game looks like its from 2005 you look a bit rough are you okay chrono trigger meets diablopath of exilei cant wait for this game to come out crafting materials are account shared unless the character you got them on was in solo mode graphics look like once youd see in a game from 2005 doesnt look good at all the choppiness is because of the game or its just the editing program fault hey man do you play wolcen let me know its so awesome atm and more is comming to wolcen in may 3 great video its pronounced the same as epic btw alot of lag and thats gonna burst wolcen into the ground d does this game or will it have controller support or any talks of a console release i know you fcking hatersbut i like a controller is this multiplayer the giddiness in your voice in the beginning i can tell you really had fun with that build i hope this game does well scrapped poe very good flying hammers wish games start to do some innovation and not copy other games abilities lineage 3 concepts are awesome maybe one day well get it no lie it feels much better now really want it to release now is the beta open to public i would love to check it out and participate bro this hummers look like spermnice gameplay bad graphicsand feels woody a bit i kinda feel clickbaited as i see your channel as a diablo channel the only thing i dislike about this video is the way you keep saying epoch wrong other than that this looks like a cool game does the game stutter like that or something wrong with the recording the skill tree looks like grim dawn but its a good thing first review on steam says the game is poorly optimized im seeing massive frame drops in this video how is the performance of the game i hope d4 has a skill system for active skills similar to last epoch best system in the genre last epoch have only cosmetic microtransactions what happen to the graphics lol just dont despecialize or you will lose all the points of the skill and you have to regain them from 0 mmm seems nice being an hybrid between d2 and d3 but i prever poegrim dawn that look a like skillhp bar make me remember bad things about d3 jaja i kind of feel clickbaited by new hammerdin but stayed for an interesting game 0000 ok this skill already looks much better than the shitty version that d3 has kk and man i said it in other video and will say again that lifemana and skills ui is just a fucking copy and paste of d3 kk lmao this game looks really interesting i imagine the repawstis actually a reposte which is usually a proc aftereffect like a dodge parry or block in most games is it getting a multiplayer looks okay but hammerdins are goofy for my tastes show us a magic caster class rhykker and maybe i will give it a shot been playing pagan all week thanks to your pagan video im definitely gonna buy early access i would like better models characters hi folks this isnt rhykker this game looks awesome im really looking forward to playing this game in the future looks a lot like another gamehmmmmmmmm oh thats right diablo 3 im fighting the urge to buy early access so its sort of a diablo 2 replica but with better graphics and gameplay looks sort of like grimdawn das blade vortex at the beginning this looks exactly like diablo 3 hahaha this is embarassing just copied it damn this game looks dope im gonna have to try it worst shit ewer the amazing adventure of van helsing i really loved the witchdoctor wich class do you prefer for the beginners cant say that im thrilled with this respec mania it happened in inquisitor martyrprophecy and it is surely slowly ruining the fun for everyone i dont think chars should be able to backtrack all the way and go to new golden path in a whim hardcore becomes softcore i feel confused on that hopefully devs wont make the mistake with all that coop i just want to play with by buddy and we are entitled to the easiest game possible lets face it arpgs are solitary games coop guys are just vocal majority if you look their accounts they play like 15h and then stop often forever now i feel bit smarter because i havent paid the game why they all cant just make different difficulty modes not in dps or hp multipliers but in put your money where your mouths are way if i make a mistake i should have consequence if im serious player and if im not then the easy mode everyones happier than in this middle ground solutions is the game worth buying in its current state like is there enough content and stuff to keep me busy for a while will they be making unique weapons and armor look unique like the in game artwork depicts them i know path of exile still has many items that look like generic rares still not updated and people just cover them with microtransactionsi dont want this to be the case here because its not free to play game like path of exileits seems like thats what they are aiming to be in the future game looks interesting but im too addicted to leveling characters in grim dawn occasionally hop into poe and am looking forward to finally being able to play wolcen at release this month last epoch is 40 where i am so a bit pricy atm but im glad i have the issue of too many arpgs so i can wait for sales without getting bored this game looks like its got a lot of potential and im hoping to get into it at some point but i have 1 issue as unfortunate as it is im a bit of a graphics whore any idea if this game will get some graphics updates it looks like a very old game right now and its not even released yet im hoping theyre just waiting until they have the mechanics nailed down before they work on making things look shiny looks like path of diablo my only worry about his game is the absolutely abysmal animations they need to spend a lot of time on those this frost mage build looks really cool i really like that pincer attack you use in this video do you have a build guide for this by any chance uhg crafting tab it was fine where it was thanks thyworm as ever awesome vid nice build but that armor seems unattainable for me tried farming lvl 23 boss playing 4 different chars to lvl 70 and gambling all the time for that armor and nothing agree with crafting tab changes nice game but not worth playing for someone with limited time since they will delete everything u got the main issue i have currently is having all these conditional passivesskill buff example bonus lightning damage after using a fire skill this u dont see when its active or inactive when you really need to reapply your buffs like teleports free cast and global cooldown reduction either do it right away or be surprised ur mana is all gone crafting item tab is a hassle definite step back from the previous layout what game engine are they using seems intressing but quality looks real dull reminds me of poe cant wait to try the last eepok i dont understand why you think that diablo 3 is a tier a arpg the only good thing about diablo 3 was the gameplay everything else endgame loot farm grind was trash from the beginning the game doesnt allow you to trade and that was trash no skill ups no stat upgrading trash blizzard game like usual a paid for poe lore lore haha git gud i wonder what makes someone to ask for classes that are blunt and onesided lack of intellect or lack of imagination both maybe btw i hope all those awkward attempts to compliment this sad husk were well paid d a year later and it is just now i hear about this project i was trying to pledge the project until i look at the date im wondering how far the game is rn i will 100 get it in the near future reminds u how garbage wolcen is i dont like breaking items im more of a grind longer or work harder to get them my rng luck is terrible i fail 6 or 7 times in a row at 90 success rate so i never get to upgrade things and with breaking usually comes cash items to stop it breaking i do love the ripping down items to enchant though this looks interesting its relying alot on if they pull it off it could be great if not it could be complete shit lol fingers crossed customizing too much a class like skills and what weapons to use for example will made it lose his identity but thats what most gamers nowdays wanti dont releasedate 2020 haha wtf the typo in the skilltree is kinde nagging me chieftan isnt it supposed to be written chieftain or are those 2 different things hello rhykker this or wolcen for me the best arpg is grim dawn in this moment thanks from italy what the this looks awesome we do not need another game we have poe just bought the 50 pack thanks for heads up that will be the next diablo 3 meh too many greens are dropping all the time it looks sound though honestly i did check it out and i have to say im enjoying the game play so far i think they did a great job with this game so far and i love the high level of customization available i look at it this way the graphics honestly are less important to me than the way the game plays the graphics are in my opinion really good and the play isnt clunky but rather smooth i still play diablo ii because i love the game i also play stardew valley hero seige terraria minecraft and gravekeeper just to name a few none of which are high graphic games but i love the way the games are played the game itself is why i keep going back to them to play nice video now you give me a hard time choosing between wolcen and last epoch currently poe stop talking about diablo and talk about this game have you heard the game path of exile try it you will love it rhykker you do not need to explain yourself to those of us who are not trolls and no matter what you explain to the trolls it wont make them silent or happy its so good anyone who likes d3 skill runes needs to step away from arpgs and play pokemon i hate diablo 3 its basically copy paste world of warcraft better off with poe or grim dawn for a more diablo experience whats this sacred 2 or another shit stain like wolcen that you way over hype for a quick buck available in steam looks like diablo ii and sacred had a baby a pretty badass baby well see how he grows up and what he ages into he is trying to compare skill systems to diablo very much but he could take path of exile example and it would be more accurate also its funny when he says diablo has the highest level of gameplay or whatever when again path of exile surpassed diablo 3 in every aspect of genre sad when creators are so much one sided to some specific product and dont admit superiority of another gg awesome looking game got a sub bub the gameplay is dogshit skill tree is okish you talk too much about diablo stop talking about diablo so much it really ruin what you try to convey all i can hear for 5mns is diablo this diablo that the game youre talking about seems to be similar to grim dawn in many ways this game is gonna be something very special i can just tell it why do not you do reviews of lost ark the only game that can compete with diablo and does not copy it launch date 2 years from now yeah by that time we might be playing diablo 4also all i see in this video is someone spinning and winning non stop i dont see most of his praises the game is clunky the currently available classes are uninspiring and nothing really new and the mobs dont seem as iconic as he described above totally pre alpha but it gives me no reason to play it over another game atm the fact ryker says its not on par with d3 makes me want to play it more last frame rate runewaker has had that class system for over 10 years now its nothing new epoch isnt pronounced eepock im in on this one more than wolcen it looks like an accessable game my friends could play and the developers dont seem greedy ill just wait for d4 ill back like 5 dollars and a bit more overtime i wont play the demo though because i like playing finished games or close to finish before the polishing and finishing touches stages the running animation is wonky good starter arpg tho hope itll be deep like grimdawn honestly i dont know how you got this to play so smoothly i mean my computer isnt new but its no brick and i have 2s movement lag and crash when i reach the first bridge after the first skeleton i get its still prealpha but this video seems to have it running fine class system elsword this is why blizzard piss me of when they say it will take to much time to do somthing when they have billion doller incomes from just wow they did this in 1 year and yet it looks better then d3 path of exile will release a timetravel expansion in 1 month ahaha looks good and classic but the release date is so far off i hope it doesnt land around lost ark the passive skill system looks pretty simple to me just a radar chart with 4 axes i think the problem with most new arpg are the classesi am happy to see those classes distinction how are you getting demonetized is beyond me turned me off when i heard microtransactions for cosmetics meaning if u want multiple characters to customize them u will need to spend about 100 at least so switching your look costs real money every time imo this is the biggest problem w todays gaming scene put a 5060 price tag on the game and have faith in the game u created dont charge an arm and leg just to change the characters look and use the free to play or cheap pricing as an excuse to charge for cosmetics omg not this limited inventory again devilian has bigger inventory and each item takes 1 square and not 68 d2 had class identity d3 all classes are the same they are all casters hmm looks interesting too bad it looks like its going to fall well short of the kickstarter does rhykker do all his script himself your word choice is always refreshing love your stuff dude keep on goin its just poe with a pricetag in diablo you have never had any story implications from choosing a specific class build or quests done thats just horribly wrong and missleading i know hes saying funding at 030 but i swear it sounds so close to fucking if you listen to it back now i bet you can hear that now as well can this game compete with diablo 4 hello guys for me the demo is just unplayable they really need to change that poe font forgot all about you brother the game looks cool i got especially hooked when i saw the map changing throughout the epochs thats very nice is it me or does the text and menu look very similar to path of exile basically is this from developers who left path of exile i think you have to compare this games with poe and grim dawn instead of d3 because always d3 is short in customization lack on loot system just have a name low key hinting poe has no class identity lol i really laughed on diablo 3 is a high bar i think of grim dawn as one of the best balance on the fights themselves poe is too focused on damage and lack defensive layers for 99 of the builds that you can make there and d3 is just boring after a few hours i actually like that passive tree display its a little bit weird to look at initially however its a super clear overview of what investment unlocks what skills instead of having to check each individual skills requirements theyre all laid out so you can quickly identify the whole picture great vid as usual they are at 82904 as of april 27th they have until may 17th for the rest idk if thats enough time its an all or nothing kickstarter is the demo online you cannot be invalidated as biased unless you get a review copy which soon will be called influencer copies id like to try it but after playing poe every other rpg skill tree seems awefully shallow and generic the only arpg im looking forward to is lost ark diablo4 this being bias thing is a problem you think the game will succeed will do good play well look great you back it you cover it wanting to cover it in itself is bias so people need to cut the crap and watch it get informed and move on or not watch it lol great vid lots of ideas for a aspiring dev i have a very hard time seeing the character blends in is small and the high angle makes it hard to see him even more when you get in a fight the only way i could tell where you were was the swirly effects of your attack they are going to have to make the character separate more from the ground and effects probably fair to suggest that grim dawn ranks as a b list arpg in terms of popularity but its really the dark horse out of poe d3 and itself imo i reckon its the best one this game will definitely need a much larger inventory or a way to dismantle on the go i also hope the higher tier items will have special things and not just x in stats and such thats what i really in diablo 3 that you can pick up a dagger and it can throw fireballs every few hits best pvp system hmm did you get a chance to see path of exiles royale april 1st update 20100 players in one zone in a last man standing bout i thought it was just an april fools joke till i saw the streams i like it so far it plays really well for what stage of development its at impressive ill buy it time travel well i instantly dont care anymore they have grand dream and an apparently solid demo look foward for a release as for the money part what they are asking in this kickstarter round seems like peanuts if they have as r said even just 5 core members on their team a truckload of respect if they can even go for a year with that i wish them a successful and hickupfree process in the coming years to last epoch dev if you are still here the kickstarter mentioned that you will support offline play but this video presents the game like it is an online only game so which one is it i usually only play offline so what happens to all the cosmetic items that i purchased can i still apply them offline how big is the campaign how many difficulty level available how do you progress from 1 difficulty to another i already spent more than 600hrs playing grim dawn and i am not done with it i am hoping to get the same replayability with last epoch as well what content are available for offline play besides the main campaign will characters created offline available for online as well i frequently reset my skill build in gtim dawn how does last epoch handles build reset interesting game play and concept seems like will have ton of customizations one thing i find frustrating though is why is left click move and right click attack just combine them left click and give me another ability on right d3 rune skill d2 skill tree any day i really hate a system that punish one for not knowing the right choice in advance why do you compare this game to d3 which has failed in every aspect compare it to the biggest arpg at this time which im sorry to say poe alot of the things that are added in this game is the same as poe but with a twist taking what is allready a genious idea to make all items interesting that is something i liked alot but the game is not going to be big if you cannot make a currency system that works i can only play the same style of game reskinned with a different plot so many times im so burnt on games almost 30 years of the same grinds over and over has really wore thin that weapon crafting system where you can break stuff down for prefixes and suffixes is very reminiscent of guild wars and as someone with over 5000hrs on guild wars i like it yt said that this game is grim dawn d rune effects were on gear in diablo2 in diablo 3 they just made it tied to skills instead of having to wear specific items to get same effects what could be done to get the best of two worlds is to simply have certain amounts of skills invested into a skill change how the skill behaves and even better you can have the choice of a few things after that i meanno game has done that yet but i think that would be awesome and rune effects or skill manipulation could still be on gear as well so you in the end manage to have perhaps all the rune effects by wearing gear that has those rune effects i still find the synergy in diablo 2s skill tree to be a very much fun system just that d2 is a game i have played to death by now so i am bored of it but the skillsystem itself i like if you would add options to change how d2 skills work at for example every 5 skillpoints invested that would be just mindblowing due to the amount of customization available if a game wou the fact that the microtransactions will be cosmetic makes me wonder how the characters that dont have bought these microtransactions will look like i think they will not look cool at all if they did then the microtransactions would not make sense a great example of this is path of exile very easy to see who have bought the microtransactions and who have not path of exile is free to play this game does not have that excuse i think microtransactions just might hurt the game more then it deserves as the game play by itself looks alright personally i would prefer if the game would cost more and remove the microtransactions this is most certainly a game ill keep an eye on i do hope they invest more time and effort into the crafting system i miss the old d2 rune words crafting systems and such i agree this game has potential lets hope they succeed d although i do hope they up the number of players you can have in a party were usually 67 players and its hard to find a good rpg where you can run together they should do a 8 player group and i hope they toss in a ton of dungeons unfortunately the game runs poorly on my pc at current even worse than wolcen which was at least playable which is a shame cause i really wanted to try it out but its my fault mainly my computers kinda old even though i can play diablo 3 and path of exile with little to no lag ill be honest if your arpg doesnt have good gameplay im not gonna bother anymore if your playing a game where the goal is to get loot at the combat is low budget and clunky then why would we want to spend more than an hour playing i bought wolcen when you reviewed it and havent tried it still mostly because i am waiting for coop lol loaded up the demo today and im so into it backing the kickstarter with access to the beta i hope they will make the inventory bag larger much much larger this game is gonna be glorious if i could i would donate 50k right away if i had enough money that map reminds me a bit of titan quest looks good and fun i hope they will be funded and finish the game the story sounds really exciting a playable demo now this is how you do kickstarter 1504 and thats where i close the video pretty respectable game quintuply so for a demo and then even more so for looking so jank in your gameplay man i wished i had money to support this arggg eeepock its pronounced epic please lol as rhykker said the engine is not so good polished and graphics is cartoonish i have make a google research about this unity engine to see if they can improve this but i could not find a polished game made with this engine i dont think this will have such a big success if they dont came with more polish graphics like wolcen or lost ark and i dont think that this engine can do much better than this the items are nice story and all they have promise are nice combat is meh for now but i think here is room to improvement if they can change the engine maybe they have a chance on the full release to fight with wolcen and loa and it should be nice if they can change that i will support them hoping that they will change the engine because i cant play this in 2020 wow this looks absolutely incredible i was completely hooked just reading through the kickstarter page im really hoping that this actually makes it to release for now though i cannot wait to download the demo and jump in this weekend love all the vids you do the information you share is well researched and i feel portrayed very fairly not just on this topic but all your videos i have only one complaint eating ramen everyday isnt a bad thingprovided its not instant thanks for this rhykker i downloaded the demo and having a great time with it i really hope they reach the kick starter goal so frekking many kickstarter crowdfund and so on games out therewhile this enables smaller studios to hop on and make games its also getting really boring to hear nothing but the same story this guy is dumb af no wonder he does this dumb crap bet he doesnt have a real job im loving the direction the development team is taking ive leveled a totem guy to level 61 already in the prealpha hunting unique items the specialization of skills offers a nice way to customize your play style i dropped 42 on their ks cause i need this one to succeed i dont se this game being popular in 2020 its too late to release could work now but 2020 nah the way he describes skill runes sounds like sacred rip sacred your ip was ruined by the latest dev rhykker just want to say i appreciate you making these videos youre very informative and you have a good way explaining the gamescharacters to help us gamers progress keep it up thanks again this looks rly great i downloaded it but still cant start the demo it always delete the exe if i try to start the game my virus program is off iwill wait for an update thanks rhykker i wasnt aware of this game i tried demo and i really liked it has a lot of potential skill system is simple to complex super cool item system two way crafting is super cool honestly i think this is already better than both diablo 3 and path of exile im really impressed i made a lightning based mage without any potion use buffs combined with black hole and boy it felt so well customised and satisfying i hope this gets tons of money so we can play the full version wolcen lookes a lot better this looks epic and the devs sound like awesome dudes i thought the artstyle also looks great even though people are saying it looks generic thanks for the vid rhykker d3 skill system is utterly shit and there is nothong fun about that game the way this game looks reminds me of titan quest so silly people today need all these disclaimers we are gamers we should want every game to succeed how can you measure diablo 3 to path of exile in terms of success is beyond me i hate the offline mode part since that gives more options for cheaters thanks for making this video very informative why this guy keep saying things that not true sounds awesome hope it makes to console its only in alpha and already i can tell that this game will be amazing if they wont screw up some key elements of the game and rather try to stick to mechanics that works and try to innovate things that wont break the essential game mechanics 2020 is way too far away so at least they giving themselves enough time with the development so hopefully wont be a rushed project dont look like one played like 30 min but even from this short time with the game im convinced that this game will be great once is finished hope they wont force some weird things in the game down the dev process they seem pretty confident in what they are doing so if itll be only as good as grim dawn id be a happy gamer i believe the loot system in diablo 3 is quite superior to others by that i mean the only pick up legendaries everything else is shit the reason for that is that i dont want to be bothered with picking up every single shitty common item on the ground just because it might be really good i mean the rarity system exist just for that reason just so i know what is supposed to be good if every item has a possibility to be good regardless of rarity then why even bother with a damn rarity system pvp and trading yes this game is amazing running animation is terrible this game is great i adore it i hope they are successful with funding i want to buy it when it comes out for sure this will be shit move along nothing to see here i like how youve adopted arpgs as your niche your videos are always well researched and incredibly informative and your style and presentation is accessible and easy to follow youre a true professional my dude i look forward to more new game reviews looks like another grim dawn awesome crafting system idea promising game saw your video and backed the game it aint going to outshine grim dawn but it looks solid slightly a let down the masteries lock to only due poe has lore and story implications the fact that you are an exile the class doesnt matter that much in this context in my opinion the passiv skills looks like a papi diagramshowing your characters personalitytraits here is a video that might help you understand the connection as to why they might have used this setup httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlrkpchz457c whoever moaned about wolcen can suck you big toe wolcen is an awesome game so far wtf you have to precise that youre not criticizing grim dawn even if it is already obvious you might have a lot of trash talkers to have to do so april 2020still faster than diablo 4 my first impression of the time travel mechanic is that it is reminiscent of crono trigger which is in no way a dig because that was a fantastic game and i am looking forward to seeing how how they revisit that concept with several orders of magnitude more storage capacity for a moment i thought it was grim dawn demo is available to play please support this game it is really good i can finally make a diablo 2 like sorcerer with chain lightning and other chars that i couldnt before in other games because they wouldnt be viable this is a very nice game please support it sometime simplicity is the best dude wolcen sounds better support wolcen hopefully its better than poe grim dawn was okay well polished but shitty grey scale and the combat was meh this game sort of has that poe look im just hoping it doesnt have similar mechanics yawn another arpg being madethis is really getting over saturated they should go for the grim dawn system any class can choose any mastery class diablo 3 rune sistem sucks my friend that is your point of view but in real gameplay realy sucks diablo 2 give you another feeling by upgreading your skills they become more powerfull items they ideed mean something but d3 has limitation but socket runes wich they are as they have been given nothing more d2 gameplay was and is better then d3 despite the fact that with your arguments put d2 equal to d3 is wrong and many of viewers knows ef you want to have more viewers please cut the craps and tell the truth as it is not been afraid to tell it a kickstart with an actual working prealpha playable demo that alone shows how much love and work this guys have put they deserve to be founded but for more money start citizen raized millions just from a demo trailer and this game has already a working demo ps if the 200k doesnt look like much and they dont probably they have a private investor waiting for them to see if they raise themselves the 200k maybe he could add his own money later on them but for me they should raise 300k and dont accept private investors if they can i pledged you can tell its heavily inspired by poe that inventory thing looks the same lol nice to see more arpgs finally starting to try and come out this sounds a lot like poe runescape with better graphics diabo is 6 years old and it looks a decade ahead of this game i guess i have something to try out until god of war releases damit rhykker your damn beard face is in the way so i cant see the action bar unity engine no thank you chrono trigger x diablo consider me intrigued love the time travel idea if diablo had a baby with fable the idea for the skill system is indeed very interesting as a critique the inventory looks extremely limited 1631 ramen the golden food standard for ambitious people xd miss diablo much rhykhehe me too 2020 im hoping d4 will be out by then haha any word about lost ark just a thought but if the combat is standard arpg fare the pvp might not be all that great that being said if its like d3s combat it would be amazing this game have a summoner class minions i love summoner classes in arpgs was interested until i saw the bag size not trying to go back to diablo ii bag size i like the skill tree system you mentionned early in the video ill keep my eyes on it ok yes i love diablo 3s combat but i absolutely despise the monster affixes like exploding or invuln they just make combat feels so broken the explosion one because you have to wait for the explosion to end before you can loot and the invuln one because thats just pure bs monsters shouldnt have that ability also moltenpoison trails are bs too just not fun to have to avoid shit on the floor when the floor is covered by their stupid minionstrash mobs also minions should die if their summoner dies i love the way the skills have their own skill tree you can really build the skill to your play style this has a lot of really cool ideas in it release date 2020 xd its always failed seems promising hate the way it looks sadly hopefully it ends up looking better graphically i downloaded the demo last night and played through a couple of classes so far the game seems to be on the right path of course it is still in prealpha stage so much can and probably will change for the better it doesnt have anywhere near the load on my poor old system that wolcen or poe carries so that is very helpful i did have a couple of issues with the movement ability vs attacks but am getting used to it left click is move only and unable to be equipped with an attacking ability as most arpgs ive played with your base attack on your right click a little clunky for me but thats just me and nothing on the mechanics it hasnt jived with me as quickly as some of the other hs games ive played but am not tossing it aside just yet because it is way too early in the build i am anxious to see how the build goes and what has been implemented through alpha release this fall and beta next year i may have to toss a few backing bucks and see what happens i appreciate these little videos really hoping to find a new rpg to sink 1000s of hours into like i did with diablo lol this related to titan questgrim dawn looks pretty similar another kickstarter arpg tbh does anyone expect good outcoems from these anymore after all the bails halted developed projects im all about supporting and being hopeful but every single arpg kickstarter has had very very poor results even compared to other genres kickstarter projects this one sounds awesome and looks like it is starting on the right path so best of luck to the devs but with it so early things can change ive been waiting for a good arpg but i will be waiting this one and any other arpg kickstarter out wolcen being the last promisestone to be thrown at my ever slimming wallet wolcen was also and still is a let down balance matters devs even durring dev stages noone likes 1 shotting everything a mix of diablo 3 and mu online downloading it now going to give it a try been a long time diablo fan like yourself recently started playing poe with my buddies dont see myself playing that long term the main reason i love skilltrees in rpg is because you get to put points into something that you want instead of having a little bit of everything but everyone gets the same this way if i play a paladin in d2 if i feel like i am not resistant enough i can make the choice to put a few more skills into blessed shield i am then rewarded with general tankyness but i do deal slightly less dmg than if i would have put these points into zeal or blessed hammer and doing it this way it allows you to equip the best gear you can find and tune down your build to what you lack if you get a bunch of items with lifevitaresist you can invest your skill point into more dmg and stats into str to compensate wich i think allows for a better experience overall i think d3 feel of combat is just so fast you dont even bother looking at what monsters you hit unless its a rare pack i remember when playing d1 turning a corner and immediatly running back and be like awww hell no i would be very interested how they solve the bazarfarming issue i think a decent way would be to analyze which items stats are traded the most or for a higher price than expected and adjust the itemdropdates depending on those numbers so if they realize that disproportionally many swords with strength get traded they will increase the droprate of those items so it would be more efficient to farm the item than to buy it you would still have the option to buy it if you want it now or it has a very specific set of affixes that you need but in generell it would be better to just play the game that way supply adjusts itself to demand and you dont have exorbitantly stupid prices for certain equipmenttypes that could lead to a nice circulation of items because the items that get traded most can be farmed more easily so now a different item becomes harder to farm so that gets traded more which leads to the droprates of those items increasing and so on it may be an interes love your work man rhykker any tips for a new youtuber i dont see anything special about this game that would convince anyone to play it over d3 or poe d3 and poe are polar opposites of each other in the arpg genre and they do very well what they are trying to do i just dont see what this game has to offer that isnt in poe or d3 already heard 2020 stopped the video time travelhmm makes me think of chrono trigger people who say that you might have a bias its normal to have one we are all biased in one way or another as long as you admit said bias of course thats important bias isnt the right word i think given the context youre allowed to be enthusiastic about your favorite genre the fact that this sort of flaccid argument stopped you from backing the game just to prove a point is terrible youre not obliged to prove anything to them i personally trust you to be as objective as possible regardless of your investment in the project this one or any other but rarely anything is 100 objective certainly not opinion regarding games that are largely art in their essence which implies certain level of subjectivity necromancer warlock acolyte im in im quite intrigued seems quite interesting from gameplay to monetization i downloaded the free demo from the kickstarter it came in a zipped file and after i unzipped it and ran it i get a pop up that says windows defender smartscreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting running this app might put your pc at risk did other people get this as well should i get rid of the program it reminds me more of grim dawn and poe than diablo o cool finaly some1 implemented class system from lineage 2 looks promising keep us updated rhykker are you going to donate to the kickstarter downloading the demo now i wonder how the devs feel about their game being being streamed i assume they might not mind given that this video exists huhh this game looks as lame as poe it s not just about the graphic but the gameplay too if i would prefer the content volume and some creative solution over the gameplay then i would have already played poe for a long time so d3 is still my favorite arpg even if it s a dead game now from looking at the gameplay the one thing that was bothering me was the fact that the inventory space was very minimal nothing worse than having minimal inventory space i personally love the graphics due to it giving a diablo 2 feel paying for a game after reaching a certain level thats kind of iffy also a bait because you cant say free 2 play game then wanna be like surprise you gotta pay 15 to buy it so hopefully theyll add clarity to the fact that you will have the pay to buy the game after a certain point i used to play a game called dcuo where you reached certain tier levels of gear and at tier 5 of gear you had to start paying 15 for content to progress what not which is fair cause at the time i started playing there was only up to t5 gear with a dlc barely breaking the t6 gear stuff but it was still a surprise and really unlucky thing to encounter due to having no knowledge of that so hopefully they make that clear the rest of the game ski great video will be fun to play i think i prefer character customisation over class identities i like not knowing exactly what im looking at before i engage with it seems more real d another class based arpgmeh still waiting for a make your own class arpg where you can select any abilities in the game and mix and match tired of classes with preset skill trees and abilities i wanna a game i can experiment heavily with like imagine if in diablo 3 you could make a class and use any of the abilities available across all classes the amount of messing around you could do would be fun who cares if a lot of builds wouldnt work thats part of the fun is there an arpg like that looks like a warcraft 3 custom map something i thnk alot of arpgs miss but d2 and poe do the randomized layouts and an anticheat for online those two things add so much to the replayability for d2 and poe i like grim dawn way more than poe but its so fucking boring running the exact same map and again and again and theres no anticheat like battlenet so you just never know if that guy facerolling all the content is legit or not yeah we get it youre possibly too much of a diii fan to ever like a different rpg more however diablo iii is not the gold standard thats like arguing cod is the golden standard of fps when for that youd be looking more at the quake q1 to 3 not q4 or champions or doom series rather than cod and yes diablo iii is basically the cod of action rpgs i will say it is less mediocre compared to what cod is within its genre for sure but diablo iii has already been beaten by games like grim dawn and path of exile imho id also say diablo iii has become a bit too automatic when it comes to its meta right now anyway but that might be a matter of taste more than actual fact doesnt change the fact diablo iii is incredibly overrated we see the same nonsense when it comes to rts games when in reality starcraft broodwar was blizzards last actual amazing rts rhykker could do a review on titan quest that got released for consoles now looks clunky i cant exactly describe what makes d3 feel right but it just moves smoother than all these other games ive played van helsing poe and grim dawn and diablo 3 just feels better ill probably give it a shot though have you tried lan old game called titan quest this has some simlar things to it hey rhykker congratulations on your videos theyre good and i really like that youre covering different arpgs not only diablo 3 but and i hope you wont mind me saying this because i saw you mentioned people bringing this up i think itd be excellent if you covered grim dawn in more detail its a great game with huge amount of content very polished gameplay fantastic build diversity very good graphics and probably the best story and the best world and atmosphere of all the currently popular arpgs so yeah thats just my suggestion to look into grim dawn in more detail and maybe make a video about it in any way i hope you keep making good videos whether they include grim dawn or not why would you craft just to have it destroyed is this some kind of f2p bs oh good another second rate arpg which will never get out of alpha to release looks promising need as many arpgs in the world as possible how is this different than say wolcen it actually has a druid class unlike some looking at you diablo 3 and wolcen for now 1 for last epoch here someone sponsor ye boi with a necro code all the way from zimbabwe changing engines midway through a project never turns out well cant wait for this game im sure they will do a great job if they reach their kickstarter goals can you do a walkthrough of grim dawn pleaseand thank you lol that idea of augmenting whites and the higher you get the more you risk it breaking might be inspired from the mmorpg silkroad online if anyone has ever played that p oh please the skill system in d3 has nothing that can account as advantageous unless youre talking about casuals everybody are built the same way because thats the only way to dish out a max amount of damage ie i love the mine spell on the dh but i cant be viable using it because blizzard never created a dh set built around it as long as they add that preview feature the passive tree seems pretty intuitive to me its like you said just make a shape that encompasses the nodes you want can you give a class breakdown not like a video per class but like a 2min run through of how they function i mainly want to know if a necrolock are minion masters or if theyre skill spammers like d3 necro i wast aware of any criticisms regarding rhykkers wolcen review but kudos to him for explaining peoples opinion of what they perceived him to do that was something that might be considered by some to be defensive but i rather think that was showing vulnerability something he didnt have to do i appreciate that aside from all this there are elements to the games in game fonts that look similar to titanquest and grim dawn does anyone know if this is due to any affiliation between game developers in those other projects and last epoch if not is it the same game engine any info would be great rhykker you really shouldnt care about people who complain about you buying a game and wanting it to be successful you surely want last epoch to be successful even without putting money into it just because we need more good games especially those made by people whore not going to throw p2w lootboxes at us my only gripe would be how generic the art style is there is really nothing special about it to last epoch devs i think that the game is going in right direction try to keep that small scale combat rather than going with 1 man vs full screen of enemies that is why combat in titan quest or even in forgotten game like nox was so good because if you want to appreciate the real fight you need to have appropriate number of enemies 1 vs 1 or 1 vs 5 is so much better than 1 vs 30 diablo has good animation but i still feel detached from the combat itself really like the class selection as well the skill specialization unfortunately the setting seems rather generic also the running animation is really funky the more you take away complexity the less depth youre going to see in the game and the game will feel boring and empty in the late game stages complexity is good you shouldnt dumb your game down or simplify it too much wolcen is incredible but right now its plagued by serious performance and stability issues once they cope with those and add a little bit more content it will be golden 135 comments and 1 view makes sense to me rhyker you only feel the uniqueness of monsters because your not good yet in diablo 3 when we were below lv 70 we felt each monsters uniqueness now after we got good it didnt matter when we kill any monster in less than 2 seconds soooooo its poe lite did all the developers that possessed the ability to innovate die 10 years ago and now we are stuck with all these new ones who never played anything but mobas and cs their entire childhood crafting with destroyable items im out more quality arpg are always welcome on kickstarter oh cool another game that has an overwhelmingly high chance of either never actually really coming out or ending up wildly different from the initial premise awesome the problem with this game not enough stash space jesus christ those weapons take up so much room looks good but if no hardcore no fun game looks boring and old but enjoy your video as usual keep it up whats going on with wow classic is it just a hype thing from blizzard where they plan to stall as long as possible until they announce another starcraft ghost pie or is there any tidbits of info you can dig up for us well this seems interesting im gonna try the demo please take some good things from other arpgs like d2 lod had so many good things that got lost will support great as always every arpg game comming sounds better then d3 20202021 is going to be insane for the arpg world another game coming in years in my opinion the ultimate arpg would have to be built differently devs should start building a pvp focused game and as soon as its balanced move to the pve content that would probably cause the game to be less flashy characters would feel less powerful but that could actually be fun if more complexity is put in combat kind of mobalike style of combat pve then would have to be also changed a little from big numbers to strongermore intelligent monsters some mechanics can also help with a more realistic kind of combat such as backstabing making blocking and moving actually matter highering the overwall difficulty my idea is that an arpg can use a lot of concepts that already exist in action mmorpg and moba games instead of doing the same thing over and over again i might be wrong but i think it would work it sounds like rift going back in time to stop what have hapent i think it will beat the slow wolcen game this might release before wolcen and get all attention and let wolcen fail they are to slow making wolcen and wolcen dont give players more content before release wich i think is wrong maybe wolcen looks better but i think this game here will be better wolcen have a non interesting skill tree i see a better overall choices in this game here i just noticed that the video is showing 1 view and 192 likes gg youtube thank you rhykker nice video its always good to know whats next in the genre d hey rhykker just check crafting in guildwars and guildwars2 its very similar thank you for the noadd explanation interesting skill runes were trash no synergies trash game d3 is the price when you hit level 20 once 15 bucks or monthly a new rpg just another copy of diablo 2 its like how whites are good in path of exile i hate how these games are calling mana something new to try and seem unique seems weakdiablo2 1 and 2 and 3 were voice acted playing any arpg now thats not just feels shitty i cant get into wolcen for that reason i think the rune system in diablo3 is flawed the base spell is usless the second you unlock the first rune but as runes change the elements there are cases where you might want say the base fire hydra for example as it is fire perhaps runes in diablo3 should have added something to rank1 once you hit lvl cap or something as the base spell is never used after youve leveled past gaining it i think in diablo3 they should have had an effect rune then an element rune like i really like this one rune but its fire and i want cold or lightning hearing you say epoch like that is the most nervewracking thing ever its pronounced ehpuk almost like epic release in 2 years hey dont forget grimdawn good video btw hello rhykker thx for all your content id like to ask you if its possible to make a video on median xl thank you man the pasive skill tree its the titan questgrim dawn skill tree but multiplied by 4 my issue with these games is that while they look impressive from a graphical standpoint they often lack personality i know people will crucify me for this but i dont like path of exile at all i tried playing for about 1 hour before i stopped the game has no charm looks absurdly generic the gameplay is fantastic though diablo iii may have its flaws but at least blizzard knows how to build characters and stories although diablo iii might not have the greatest of the stories it still expands the universe very well grim dawn is probably the only one that really caught my attention is this gon be on xbox we need a good arpg game now that is as good as diablo iii god damnit d im freaking bored so basically last epoch is taking game elements of d2 d3 and poe then merging everything into a game with graphics from 1999 no views something tells me thats not quite true the problem with wolcen is its crawling development ever since the umbra daysnothing much happened all those yearswhich build up quite some frustration with many buyers all things considered 15 is dirt freaking cheap for a game of this scale they should have set it higher i backed at 42 and think even that is quite reasonable the world needs a good arpg diablo is about dead now with so many leaving because of the botting problem side note if you choose to back a project then that is your business and has nothing to do with us viewers imho nice work as always im confused does this game use poe engine nice rhykker ive been playing this for a minute now i love it the devs are awesome too very responsive on discord also this game is amazing demo is a must play game looks like from another epoch xd class identity closet marxist p why do we need another one of these kinda seems like the lawbreakers or battleborn of arpg idk why so many are like uh no lol why david brevik dont start a crowdfund to a proper successor for diablo 2 thumbs up for mentioning grim dawn in the description by far one of the best arpgs out there loving this game so far so much fun for a free demo this looks so much like wolcen this thing is ugly hey rhykker this is folks d nice great game all of this look like shitsorry thank you but no thank you d the arpg will never die first why uniques are droping so easily graphically its still meh it needs a new coat of paint like wolcen bruh biden is a pedophile downvote what a clean cool editing style youre also legit funny the leaderboard dick joke cracked me up good delivery does the game lag nice copy of diablo 3 menu i backed the game and i enjoy it but thus far it just feels too empty the zones are huge andthats it you move from one cluster of enemies to another ignoring most loot and only picking up crafting sigils and just repeating rift after rift not to mention at one point it eventually becomes a contest between you and the enemies to see who can oneshot the other first the game shows promise and i love the classes and skill system but it just needs more to make it feel unique and engaging it looks as bad if not worse than path of exile but its not f2p no thanks wherewhen is free demo hi this is stupid question can i play it offline i mean cracked type by skidrow i want to play it badly thanks for the breakdown great vid the zizaran undisputed phrase actually originated from him crafting a 1 handed axe which at the point of crafting was the undisputed best 1h axe in the game you can find a clip of him doing so love the reference im really confused if i should buy this game already halp thy love the vids keep em coming x is there enough content to justify the price after all your gameplay what do you think is it heading in the right direction or pagan online one ive tried poe but the complexity of it is just madness there is too much in it are you serious about the performances yeah fuck that if they dont fix it by launch i aint touching the game mmmno wont be playing this i was considering putting it on my wishlist on steam but if a socalled single player game ever requires an account of any kind to play then thats a clear sign of the rightfully hated always online form of drm being used and thats always a no go for me from one of the devs steam forum threads posting on said forums is restricted btw which totally isnt ever suspicious or anything what business model does last epoch have last epoch is a buy to play game which entered beta on april 30th if you have an account for logging into the single player game nohell no no dev that does this gets any of my money great game im enjoying it quite a bit visually its not bad but most skillsspells lack intensity and characters look bad look at those models they look weird in terms of gameplay its really nice its the only game that actually flows like diablo coming from loki the era changing theme is something i love this or wolcen you need a new mic and a new camera xd as you say at the end of your videa that i enjoy the game is not optimised and with my shit computer i have no problem playing poe or d3 but this one crap only lag absolutly not playable so if you dont have the right config on your system dont buye it it will be only frustration ps thanks for making videos angry roleplayer nice review i am happy i have supported last epoch it is becoming a fantastic arpg i trust you bro i will buy this game today ok then order details product total ardent gladiator supporter 1 3500 nice review could you make a vid about wolcen i think you last vid is about 1 year i like the game so much but it has mixed opinionsi would love to hear your thoughts about its current state i agree and good to know this is not optimized like 100 cpugpu usage kinda thing can meld down your rig i skip phase 2 atm waiting for phase 3 great review this game has a ton of potential boss loot drops are shite lol is it just the video or does the graphics looks old you build looks pretty cool could u do a quick build guide about it if you get the time please 1k pack lul what a ripp off httpslastepochgamecomsupporters man this is gonna be the one great stuff i have to buy this so hard next month purchases will be mh world iceborne last epoch this game keep getting better time to hop back great video man nice overview im going to turn my cpu into a helicopter again made a post already but 074 runs much worse for me than 073 somehow i78700rtx2080 ouch this game looks so great ugghhhhi cant wait for this game to come out and i dont even care that the graphics look super dated because the gameplay systems are simply incredible and far and away better than just about anything thats currently out now and im including poe in that assessment of which im a huge fanboy this game is online i keep confusing this game with poe dont play this game it runs like garbage on high end pc this game looks like it runs like dogshit is the fps really as choppy as it appears on youtube its not the greatest itembut its a spoon i lold at that comment hey thyworm i am trying your build now lvl 27 and i really like it i still havent focus on gears but i like the skills and the way to play it thanks for this build still hoping for a sorcerer build p i hope they gona improve grafic cause i just hate the way it looks interesting build thanks if you ever do a sorcerer build it would be great as i have difficulty to make a good one p hi thyworm found your channel today quality content man keep up the good work love your vids the deeper i go into monoliths and arena i realized ive capped over the 59 elemental protection and needs to focus on other stuff like void poison and necrotic the problem here is getting to that point requires way alot more grind but there is a sure progress since its always a 100 success if u use those scrolls i tried using the other type of scroll and i always get fractured on 3rd try im waiting for you to make a stat guide vid thy my asian math skills is not enough to understand this by myself april 2020 release data and there will be a wipe bro when will be the release also about pagan online this game is dead i v been playing since ever and instant figured out that devs did not want to understand what players wanted what do u think i remember you trying to defend them at the beginning of the developmentbut now what do u say i am interessed in your opinion of pagan online is that the voidknight we see there is it working d ik geniet de content echt graag have the devs talked about optimisation at all i have a pretty good system but it runs super slowly and it should not a little disappointed its been delayed to q4 2020 but feel they know what they are doing at least backers are still getting access in april poe new expansion and league then when that gets boring wolcen comes out then 3 months later this one good times for arpg players d i now i understand why i die in the arena sub50 level thanks x i need to jig my gear hey thy i was able to reach 86 on arena but yeah it gets boring my current setup on my mage is all the way damage on passives and skills and arround 130 of glancing blow im planning to build another one with all resistances 50 and glancing blow 100 the key to this build is getting lucky with t4t5 atleast 2 affixes what do you think should i get this build or just crit avoidance and glancing blow first time hearing about this it looks pretty cool does it have controller support was highly interested until the bazaar word came up unfortunately for me it seems very unoptimized i have a decent pc 32gb ddr4 rtx2070 i58600k and it only runs at 2540 fps on low settings dont know much about this game as i just thought about buying after watching the video here what would i like to see in a game like this well if its playing with time travel as you say i would like to see you fight your own character builds from time to time as boss bad guys hey vulkan u have nice voice and ty for info graphicss not what makes a game diablo 2 and civilization 1 are just two examples of many when is multiplayer ok so im stuck a bit here should i get this or warhammer martyr they both look fun just not sure i alreayd own woclen and last epoch looks very similar whereas warhammer martyr looks totally different just not sure if its worth picking up after the combat overhaulany opinions when this game is out of early access i will check it out thanks for the vid i bought this game in june and wait for release 10 usd i hope it will be good game i believe in creators of last epoch literally havent played because of the rogue absence i usually main a rogueassassin type character looks like diablo 2 w more classes and options i just hope the game at some point begin to run smooth no matter what they add to the game the performance doesnt seem to get better the game still feels like its made on a crap engine looks exactly like grim dawn april 2020 what a joke well be getting lost ark by that time i like how they are piecing this game together in baby steps i really enjoyed playtesting it at quakecon i was told they are making the game they are excited about playing there will be no microtransactions and no pay to win im still playing diablo 1 if the graphics and performance improve this game will be a must play sounds extremely interesting i have been following this game on and off for some time one of main things that bothered me was graphics especially compared to other arpgs around looks like this have been tackled nice surprise all the other roadmap parts looks very promising thank you vulkan for this update feels good to add another game to watchlist the one big problem last epoch has by now its his poor graphic optimization in my opinion with a 1080ti 12gb my graphic card get 70 it doesnt matter if i change to high medium lowthis should be the first thing in their agenda rofl at least it runs better than wolcen holy shit thats a major shift in graphics wow this game is a sleeper gem these ea games really rip off d3 working on grim dawn at the moment and already bought wolcen but this is looking good specially with the systems skills etc definitely going to have a look when its more developed great vid do you think this game gonna reach the same level o quality of grim dawn im actually stunned at how few people are currently playing this on steam it looks like a decent game kinda makes me question getting into it edit granted it is in early access and not complete 4uck this road map what about fixing the games fps drops its insane to have that got really high end pc still just stutters all over p high or low doesnt matter economy sucks p any eta on the phases go live hows the new class compare to my all time favorite totem build i want the games on my personal list finished and all shiny now that was my quarterly tantrum as always vulkan thank you soo much for keeping us updated you make me want to go deepbut alas i am not an early adopter so i wait have an awesome day babydaddy im excited for phase 3 looking forward to when phase 3 is implemented damn your place is cozy the apparience character change with the items or no because it seems he always has the same hello sir first of all great video have you looked into this build since the new patch hit any significant changes keep up the good work and thank you 3 hey you ive reached level 24 and wish to respecc my base tree is that possible keep up the good work watching you playing and then me playing the game leads me to believe i need a new computer why does my game not run as smooth as yours lols wouldnt blood pact be worth taking in acolyte tree since you dont actually do any of the killing in your build its just free damage with no downside if i understand the passive properly edit also isnt the health regen kinda useless you dont have much base health regen to increase that regen for your own character nor do you have flat minion regen on gear either so the increase your getting isnt really being used much at all my minions are not running and finding mobs i need to press a and make them go places yours are just seeingn them outside of the screen i dont get it hi mate im stuck on master missions on pagan online and probably wait until they fix it or something while looking at your pagan builds ive found epoch looks interesting necro with thoose minions super funny do u think its worth spending 35usd for this game considering its beta and i dont know if they reset progress thank you for you videos good job i like these medium short really explaning videos a lot in here and in wolcen you know all so could you explain us glancing blow at some video i just noticed the recording did not record your cursor i always like to actually see where you are pointing when you explain the skill tree other then that nice video and easy to follow build guide d keep it up but has a combat style of maybe like diablo 3 viktor vran or van helsing i like how you say its the combat system of 3 completely different arpgs that have almost no similarities diablo 3 is blow of 50 enemies in 1 second viktor vran is fighting like 25 enemies at once and van helsing is kite everything for 30 seconds so it doesnt kill you outright the ui looks like it takes a lot from path of exile i follow u 4 grim dawn how do u feel this game it worth buying i prob pick it up but why does every arpg has to have this setting i would love to see a futuristic game with laser guns swords big mechs to fight etc this looks fucking awful game looks rough graphics look dull and mobs have no textures you are just fighting the same black blob monsters over and over if this game gets past this alpha look it might be good but will have to see watching him play you can immediately tell that pohx has arpg experience under his belt ill wait for release but so far looks pretty ok last epoch has a skill tree and a specialisation techniques system very interresting that suggest many possibility of builds the fx the animations the design everything smell amateurism compared to poe or grim dawn wow this has more potential than almost all the other arpgs out there right now i wish the devs well on their endeavors here nah poe is d12 based and not at all a good game if i can truly buy this whole game for one price it will be played if not it wont be touched i dont support mircoscams want proof poe is a pile of excrement imagine every car dealer in the world never letting anyone own a vehicle only leasing thats ggg in a nutshell but its a choice right lmfao ive got my eye on the game but i decided to go with pagan online as its trying something different epoch seems very very familiar which is not bad per say just looking for something different from poe or grim dawn crafting is nothing like poe at all wolverine being a secret playable character was kind of a turn off for me not a fan of gimmicks like that is this one more beginner friendly than poe game has nice mechanics but it feels so boring to me a few days ago i watched your grim dawn video and now i have to watch your videos daily just for your wooooaaaaiii intro xd isnt the clear gender gap kinda offensive though there is only one playable female character as of right now which is a no no and also only white characters literally no poc representation whatsoever combat feels like bursting soap bubbles no impactfeedback whatsoever watch the game growjust like we did with wolcen oh wait lol p rekt id like to pick this up just for the wait on next poe league but i do hope the remove a shit ton of poe overwhelming content which made me quit this league for the state the game is in seems really fuin expensive i like that different arpgs are being developed butplease stop copying the d3 gui i am sure you can find different options out there i absolutely hate the graphics just looks really unpolished especially the ui but everything else looks cool that being said i definitely wont be buying it unless they make some serious improvements to the look of everything looks awful optimized slow animation and reaction i know this in beta but cmon this looks bad dat wolcen shade i fully approve omg this is the game i have been waiting for i wish poe had a sort items option really need some cool arpg with good character levelling and all clear smooth fast gameplay i might going for it lets see hows endgame is before but looks really nice so far kinda weird i dont know if like or dislike the graphic style its really unique honest opinion is that ill take anything after what we got with peagon online chaosbane and wolcen even the torchlight game feels wack im not saying theyre necessarily bad but theyre not what im looking for i want something more like what im seeing from this beta the graphics and if theyre serious going to only charge 10 15 imma fall in love it looks interesting hope they dont ruin it like poe your weapon looks like its a 7 weapon from mu online ahahah i liked that touch 35 for beta version of game that looks like one of these diablo clones u could find on cd added to game magazines 10 years ago if youre having difficulty optimizing the game i just had to turn my shadows down everything else is still ultrahigh removed lag completely im on a modern setup as well the crafting system seems possibly boring if everything is deterministic and just a matter of grinding it out not a huge drawback for me but still game looks good though will probably play it on release 35 for beta but its 10 for the game on full releasei think ill wait loved the joke about wolchen p this can be really decent game i like alot those skill and class trees wait is can this be played offline like gd but with an auction house what fps do you have have devs revealed if the game will be supporting mods i mean graphical ones not gameplay altering ones holy shit the ui of the globes of lifemana and skill on the bottom of the screen is just a copy and paste of d3 kk the graphics are trash but the gameplay and complexity seen really good p will wait for the final product tho skill system seems nice its nice to see a seasoned arpg player dissecting a new system so smoothly hey pohx quick question is there any link to participate to this beta cuz i dont really want to pay 35 dollars to have this game not finished also it would be nice to play an a real multiplayer arpg that wasnt steamrolled by multiple people i feel even 1 extra person an any of my favorite games just makes the game not difficult and no longer fun it would be nice to play something challenging in this genre of game with others the shadows look good in this game i think that this game has serious potential but i think they should focus on refining the game as opposed to finding some niche thing that they do differently than other games looks promising and fun are there enough content to pay 35 for the beta right now this game looks awesome cant wait to play it omg tldw playing on minimum graphics due to weird lag issues games fun combats fluid solid game direction will check back in a few months and see where the game goes graphic engine looks awful but at the same time skill tree as good as d2 it seems like the developers are doing it right so right that the life bar is at some border of the screen this guys doing arpgs games dont play arpgs games if youre worried about how the prealpha graphics of last epoch take the time to watch this prealpha footage of poe from 2008 40 seconds in it shows httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvemyj5o5ls here because diablo is dead omg it seems to me a diablopoe mix wich is pretty cool ill defenitelly play it through alpha and beta access great promise for a diablo style ill be watch for sure thank you bludd im your fan you make me buy this game craft system is coolll the graphic doesnt look that great compare to d3 yo this looks pretty dope2020 hurts but good things take time that trade hype though wolcen rest i will play wolcen in my eyes ist the best upcoming game in that genre graphics look 10 years old the game is intriging in several aspects i mean yes its a prealpha and time will only tell the story but having skill trees for each skill is a nice idea for skill customization vs d3s pick a rune and this is how it works but it also means how hard is it to change that skill i was not a fan of either d2 or d3s system d2 was far to rigid with skill selection where you cant or limited number of times to change your skill trees make a mistake and your character is garbage but i also did not like d3s ease of changing either it dilutes the skills and removes the uniqueness i would like it to be more rigid but not punishing like a 1 week cooldown on changing a tree the crafting system is also unique in it that it looks to be useful for the end game as well as early game im not usually the one to be a snob for graphics but this looks so bad for a 2018 game hopefully they are prealpha textures or something xd omg theyre taking one of the worst things from diablo the varying item sizes some being fucking huge for quality of player life keep the items small in my opinion the diablo series 1 2 and 3 will be always the best disgusting me the hp life bar of enemies hopefully all these new games put d3 out of its misery this does look very cool thanks it takes time to make quality im not too sure that we really need another game in this genre i love d3 because of its casuality simplicity and ease to get to all of the content like coldandchill game for relax and fun i love poe because of its variety challenge and encouraging system its a lot more tough but it rewards you a lot even gd for me is not too sticky game in this way but this i just dunno well see i guess im just afraid in 2020 this game or even genre might not be relevant anymore and the hp bar is always an orb just like in diablo looks pretty cool but what i dont like about those new diablo like games is that the inventory always looks like in diablo patch or no patch i will still make updated diablo guides for season 14 catch me live twitchtvbluddshed time stamps if they do not work for you mobile users skills 100 passives 1114 uniques 1320 game play 1556 i like the look of this one just got started on it not quite to sorc yet i found that arboreal ring you werent kidding that is super effective im just blindsiding everybody while they chew on the bark will be interesting to see how this build scales up thanks for this good ideas thank you free balls let me know what everyone thinks about the game filming live twitchtvbluddshed riposte pronounced like repooooooooost a hard o sound bludd its a fencing maneuver hence the e at the end causing you to pronounce the word with a hard o sound im still waiting for a path of exile video i dont get why people are so hyped about this game oo it looks like trash wolcen looks way better this looks like diablo 25 it pains me to devalue the work of the developers but the game looks dated edit scratch that i just watched rhykkers coverage and it looks much much better bluddshed get your graphics settings straight bro i was about to skip this game because of your footage is it worth buying this game if i like diablo grims dawn and pagan online looks like a very bad path of exile clone tbh love this game been playing since prealpha but havent had time for beta yet thanks for the video bludd i would be all over this if the animations didnt look like shit how is using one ability even fun thats the most anyoing thing in this kind of path of exile spaming keyboard games guys any new about release date i love last epoch so much i droped as my main void knight warpath lvl 80 a few fire mages uniques include calamity fire spell dmg shield and full set of rings amulet invoker set and some fire spell dmg soulfire relic and rahyehs light fire spell dmg shield literally now i make your inferno mage 3 the games graphic is a basket case they need to focus on a really really good story and lore and combat spend the money on a really good writer to pull players in and combat you can do without the money you need to invest in graphical assets which at this stage is too late to redo lets be honest just look at the failure of warhammer chasobane garbage graphics garbage story garbage gameplay 3gs to add insult to injury a 5999 launch price which had no chance to succeed youre allowed to fail maybe 1g at launch but thats it youve a recently failure arpg to be thinking about heed this advice last epoch looks great would love to see a totem shaman build is this game worth getting reviews seem mixed pretty familiar with grim dawn should you wait until full release thoughts hmm from what im seeing the game has nicely improved lets hope is going in the rite direction nice build mate is this righteous fire from poe d oh wow this was so peacefull i really want to play this game but the game just eats your hardware even my high end pc sounds like its gonna explode when playing dont know how they make a game but something is wrong in the way they draw on your hardware righteous fire i allways wander if the monsters in the purple color are going to be like that in the finale lunch game if are going to do so mmm meh it would be a disappointment with a very poor animation and appearance my opinion btw you know something about it wow that hyper space tunnel effect is really impressive kinda strange how the rest of the animations in the game are so awful looking finally the epoch has come back ah the joys of my simple youth great video thx why making build guide when you know people cant play its yet until the game actually released date much bigger since you guys last saw it thats what she said how do you think it compares to totem thorns primalist store materials button in your inventory puts all the glyphs and mats away also when you shatter items it shows what you get up where items stats were why i subscribed one thing i appreciated about a streamer wont say their name protect their privacy but hearing his wife and daughter come in during the stream from work he greeted with hello beautiful that i appreciated real people not many do that not sure what happened since your last update but im at level 73 all skills set and started to spec into force guard and paladin im grinding small points on gear but simply cannot push past lvl 12ish monolith or 29 arena not enough damage or defense i mean its way off im just wondering if there was a nerf recently or anything guys i am in super trouble about warpath and void strike do i need to add increase physical damage by increase void damage by or increase melee physical damage increase melee void damage might have to check this game out appreciate the content for le keep checking in on the game every few months might try out a non minion build now haha hey guys i understand its epok and not epic when pronouncing the name damn you pronunciation sites i had been corrected both ways previously and was provided some wrong info ive said epok in all the other videos except this one going forward that will be the pronunciation thanks for everyones clarification will this have the loot system as poe or grim dawn where mobs drop like 1million items and most are crap and u spend so much time looking cheking wich you might pick they copied everything from d3 ui skill animations monsters to loot drops talk about being unoriginal terrible hello can any of you tell me how to use the arena key even in beta this game is bringing some great features into the genre some are old features but are things that have seemingly been put on the back burner in recent years so pumped for multiplayer too for anyone wondering the beta has plenty of content to warrant a 35 price tag just in its current state and thats besides all the extras you get on release judging by this early build of the game its showing a lot of promise the last time i had this feeling i watched a random video trailer in 2010 for a little game called path of exile maybe youve heard of it kudos to the devs here for their open and consistent communication would love to group up when that finally comes out graphics looks jaded like a 90s cheap game another awesome vid vulkan thank you as always for keeping us up to date on this and other other content i hope you have a great weekend looks awesome and even more awesome that an early access game with around a year left in early access already has endgame content in it im playing an acolyte at the moment with skeletons and a golem and it is so much fun eeepock not epic i dont think this beta is enough to keep me engaged for a long time still awesome that its hear but ill probably be bored again after playing for a weekend and then its waiting for the next big update still super excited for this game and where its going i hope theres an option to disable the damage numbers on the screenthey are so annoying the game looks good besides that ive been having such a blast awesome i got a set of 2 rings and an amulet that gives me 500 to magic resistances and a bunch of magic damage its called the invoker set anybody else having trouble logging in through the launcher do i need to install it on steam to play now that run animation on your character is hilariously bad you say there name wrong edit 00 critical beat me to it this game haves a lot of content i know last epoch is in beta right now but im interest to know if i spend my money on this game in this moment summoning skeletons without the use of a corpse meh gender locked thats a nice way of saying uncustomizable garbage i dont play path of exile for the same reason now i knew i saw this video of yours a while back i guess instead of diablo 4 for next year i will settle for this one it looks great why does the ui look like from a console is this gonna be available on ps4 looks pretty cool hmm to ask a question though rhykker have you played grim dawn it is a pretty good arpg in my opinion just wanted to take a look at it as well but sadly i cant purchase cause ending up in scam popups on their website cc anyways this could make me leave d3 oo builds for a prealpha well well kinda pointless rhykker would you recommend last epoch to diablo 3 fans so basically singularity mages pogchamp still too early to tell but it just seems like another arpg clone to me hope it changes significantly during development they straight stole that shit from diablo wtf im looking forward to grim dawn on console when ever the port gets done for xbox one victor vran is a good arpg no way to reset your build i guess we are past the golemglemgolumgolomgolmglem pronunciation issues wait no rhykker thanks so much for this id never heard of this game before and a friend and i justs downloaded the demo after hearing about it from you by the way have you heard about the mmo called fractured that is on kickstarter now its an isometric mmo that is the first sandbox mmo that really tries to cater to both pvp and pve players im not sure its one you would like but thought i would toss it out there for you to look at thanks again for heads up about last epoch i just played trough the map to the arena and did it the 1st time to wave 155 where i died after killing the last monster httpsiimgurcomcg9dvcmjpg id honestly prefer not hearing about this until its actually released seriously its in fucking prealpha i really hate what has become of the gaming industry and these sometimes 10 year long hypecycles how am i even supposed to give a shit whenever a game comes out anymore 832 reduced castrate sounds good i dont understand why almost every freaking arpg has to have hud and menu elements that look like there were designed in the 80s90s this is an instant turn off for me this looks fun lets nerf never do that also you need to have donated money to play the necro not coming close to this one anytime soon i dont like the whole random skeleton thing will this be a free to play game they need a lighting guy also the ui for picking up things looks exactly like poe i want the d2 necro back xd i think you would like the necro in grim dawn any pet in this game is op its choppy but a leap barb is insane as well this is diablo 4 cant talk about the graphics yet because it looks like a ps1 game hope this improves is folks hey this rhykker could points of the skill tree system reset i got 3 minutes into your video and decided to download it for myself xd whenever you praise something i know its coming from a reliable source and wont be a waste of time thank you for doing this community all the great favors you do i really appreciate all the work you put into everything keep it up man while it looks crappy still looks better than poe wow that talent tree system actually looks really cool an actual tree for each talent d i enjoyed what i played but the mobs and and map seem to mesh together making it hard to differentiate on what is whay you went straight ot the mass undead army build tell me rhekker do you favor necropolis in homm this game is great ive been quite impressed with everything about it the devs are always in touch with the people playingtesting it and listening to feedback very interesting skill system which i think is a huge step forward for arpgs as it actually makes you feel like your character is progressing in a cool way and that the skills you are using are evolving nice variety of weapons too which dont have to become useless when compared to skills cough diablo 3 cough and i cant wait to see what they do with the game my main criticism would probably be the graphics but of course it is still in alpha im enjoying it more than wolcen and i really liked that too the running feels really off for the skeletons and the character itself it feels like they swing their arms back and forth so linearly without natural movement to them they should also give necromancer the skill revive which allows him to revive the monsters he kills and fight for his sides for temporary amount of time such as a minute just like diablo ii the more points you put into revive the longer and more monsters you are able to revive im a big fan of summoner build holy shit this looks fun and fast wow looks sick its absolutly awesome for an alpha they will for certain make the game smoothier thank yo ufor the update you are making me more and more sad for my favorite arpg this looks very cool how do i get to test this time travel is a big turn off for me sorry great video rhykker love the last epoch content whoah this is already looking better than that ded gaem diablo 3 this is what i wanted the d3 necro to be wish more arpgs would have the same character building as grim dawn i really like when you cover all these different arpgs and i thought this was diablo folks this hey is rhykker i really do want to play this and wolcen i hope they dont die in development hell nearly an entire month later is this game on steam or is the alpha closed or something lovely game isnt it too bad im on vacation and cant put my hands on necro now my beast master was already freaking satisfying which game is this this game looks very interesting good video would be nice if your voice audio was louder though tbh this looks like bootleg poe how about actually showing the game you did the publishers no favour the most boring first impressions ever this game with pagan onlines artstyle would make me fucking nut this game looks like a dogshit mix of poe and diablo 2 fucking horrible edit considering this is made by what two guys i doubt the game will ever look good and have decent animations very sad is this more beginner friendly than poe will wait for the release at this state does not worth 30 euros pagan online is better and will also wait next month for chaosbane looks like it will be fun but i refuse to ever pay for early access or to play a beta heck back in the day when friends and i closed beta tested stuff like daoc wow lotro etc or in other words when a beta test was truly a test rather than an excuse to sell an unfinished game we did it to help the devs at no cost to us or them was looking last chaos titel so close nice game time to grimdawn the only isometric rpgs that is worth attention are diablo 2 titan quest grim dawn and poe im not convinced this game looks already outdated the animations are questionable and the gameworld is not that appealing to me the last part is quite subjective of course the only thing that actually looks interesting is the skill system and how progression works in this game other than that i cant see that many positive things to be honest i also dont buy into this notion that it just looks and feels that bad because its a beta i couldnt find a statement by the developers that clearly states that graphics and animations will get a complete and major overhaul at some point in development good game for year 1997 great vid and im really enjoying the game too has lots to make it different from the other run of the mill arpgs the crafting system is unique true but uniqueness is not necessarily good i love how gd does it you simply gamble your materials for items and every now and then you might get a good piece of the equipment that youre crafting the problem that i see with last epochs crafting system is that it is only a matter of time before people find the best combination for every item at which point the other options will become filler for the blacksmith screen this looks like a browser game lol sucks to say it but this game is just not up to scratch for a game in 2019 in so many ways why didnt you show any combat nothing beats grim dawn for me i tried this as a demo a while back i liked the skills and loot but the action just sucked no impact at all is this free to play those health and mana orbs look like they belong to another game winkwink even statues on the sides cmon have they heard about copyright ps ok i must admit crafting looks interesting but i dont think it should be the selling point in this type of games hi mala looking forward to what this has to offer i will be waiting to see if i can finally roll a proper beastmasterranger character of course the entire main class isnt in yet grrrr 30 euros for this game no thanks ill wait till hes ended and as they said its probably april 2020 the stats and percentages are a little confusing even with your explanation but its mostly because im just starting out once ive played a bit itll all make more sense to me because of your video i do have a question that isnt related to this video have you played a spellsword build and if so is it a good build for someone starting out its pretty poor graphics and effects i might buy this now looks nice when youre too stupid to make an original game so you rip off diablo 3 path of exile and god knows what else and shit out a poorly made cash grab wow this game looks like shit who these guys expect to compete with the major arpg even grimdawn looks better the gameplay looks clunky and the graphic ismeh i hope they change some things when is the multiplayer component going to be released i want to play this game but i dont know i bought wolcen a while back and thats going nowhere too fast mayhe i must need to wait for d4 sigh id hope the devs go crazy good with the combat and story as the graphics is so meh it feels like a basket case but graphics alone does not a good game make see d2 so focus and concentrate on the above and you should be alright i pray for the success of this game omg stop costing me so much money i was trying not to buy this game this game looks and sounds cool would like to cover this as well but wolcen is takling up my time haha wanna play some time man the game may or may not be good the look and feel of the web site is a complete and total ripoff of path of exile which i have to say does not inspire me to feel good about the game itself the sad part is that its not the game itself its a bleak action rpg there are lots of those but all the imagery on the web site the look of the passive trees ie all the stuff that it would have been easy to differentiate and they didnt looks like they are rocking and rolling very nice the performance still being horrible xd oh nice i cant wait to jump back in so is this just another path of exile game or what first time hearing this game yay good to see another last epoch video mate d love the quality you put out are you gonna post it in the le discord i like the new intro music awesome vid as always really nice video super enjoyed it when i see these damageinflicted numbers at the screen i already kind of let the ball hit the ground idk path of exile cartoonish graphics hay guy epic channel d will they make d2 remastered heh had to watch the gameplay at 2x speed path of exile spoiled me when it comes to clearspeed meta tt hope youll be able to attackcastmove faster over time as you progress in levels like in poe never liked how grim dawn had a hard cap and didnt let you pass certain speed threshold though i love the game you idiots cry that its same as d3 or poe ffs its 2018 what u want a fckin d2 graphics on 2018 game anyway this looks great looking forward outdated those damage numbers and status effect showing up really screw things up every game developer seems to think the moba way is the best way to make a game buh ill stick to grim dawn reminds me of titan quest very very diablo 23 with the look and sound the music reminds me of diablo 1 and 2 damn good music thank you looking forward to it the last epic even though its spelled epoch its pronounced epic this reminds me so much of dungeon seige brevik needs to reassemble the troops and make a new mature and comprehensive arpg reignite whatever fire was under his ass in highschool and come up with a new original game poe copied d2 and this copied poe developers need some originality yay another d3 clone my main concern is whether online multiplayer is going to be hosted by the developers on secure servers like with diablo 3 and path of exile or are the servers going to be open like with so many other arpgs thereby causing the game to devolve into a pointless hackfest in very short order interesting but for my part im waiting for grim dawn new expansion looks cool just would love to actually see an amazing pvp system that stays thriving for all levels finding a balance between skill and of course being the one with the super bad ass rare items should be of course easy to get into so you can lure in players and make sure to have some very difficult areas even early on in the game that maybe arent required for progression but to have a chance at amazing gear also another note on pvp should definitely look into team pvp lastly i want to be able to summon a huge skeleton army for my solo campaign lol i like what i see so far looks very easy though i hope they dont do what poe is doing and make the whole game a faceroll except for occasional oneshots hey guys you can turn the damage numbers off in the settings if you dont like them httpsgyazocom9368b97169c7dda744f25e4dc09d1389 is this game 30 years earlier than d2 or earlier than d1 lol is it going to be free but what really differentiates this game from poe and d3 i cant really see a lot literally torchlight too bad every hit must cause a firework explosion looking very similiar to poe so its big nono for me gameplay looks ok with some nice features graphical improvements that should be made ditch the cartoony feel improve the font no red targeting outline no oversized bosses no giant shiny doors no damage numbers or dodgehit text etc sound was ok throw in some voice acting on boss and others i think grim dawn came closest to what we want but needed more life in some ways looks a lot more like d3 than d2 linear maps 6 skills at a time and it looks like bubble gum exploded all over the screen looks like shit wolcen plays and looks infinitely better while feeling dark and familiar what i dont understand with modern arpgs is why make them 3d when its an isometric game anyways pre rendered is way better for these types of games i cant help myself for me is diablo 2 best rpg game ever made i would not even remastered it in hd old graphics gives the game special atmosphere and feeling during playing just my opinion looks like low budget diablo 3 the music is ok though americano please put some faith into a game like grim dawn this indieborn child is so good and versatile contentwise hope my english didnt break here that people are throwing money at the screen just from expressing their feelings for this game on regular basis i understand you i know what is like to look at every arpg with the same eyes as looking at d2 and being heartbroken of that nostalgic feeling once you come down to your sences this wont ever be d2s successor until i came upon gd i can legitimately sayeven soundtrackwise that this is d2s spiritual successor the problem with almost every game in the genre is that there is no meat to the combat and no audiovisual feedback on hitting and killing your enemies in diablo 2 when you hit something with a wweapon it flinches and screams in pain if you hit it with a spark bolt there is a visual sparky effect on them same if you hit them with a fire or ice spell when things die theres blood spewing on the ground in diablo 3 enemies literally explode if you kill them with a strong hit and the explosion color and audiovisual effects match the element you used theres again lots of blood and gibs didnt play poe as much but i remember some attacks like tornado shot looked cool and when fired at a group of enemies the feedback was some juicy carnage dungeon siege is less awesome in that respect but at least the enemies cry in pain when you hurt them there are some other old games that have similar feel to them like nox and revenant but they are almost a different genre altogether tho anybody know whats a good game similar to diablo 2 that i can play off google play uh i was hoping for something diffrent but this diablo 3 graphic again meh yoooo xtimus bro you should take a look into wolcen lords of mayhem its a game that is also in early alpha stages i am really looking forward to when it is finally all completed i have high hopes for wolcen lords of mayhem and i also hope this game makes the distance also d pffft just play grim dawn i try every d2esque game i can get my hands on so i look forward to this one looks fun wolcen lords of mayhem is good too i will agree with most people commenting i like the dark gritty feel to d2 and i always go back to that game over the others that being said best of luck to the creators i gotta say i dont like the linear path design concept looks cool but i still love the oldschool d2 graphics player vs player comabt r you drunk xtimus xd it looks exactly like poe to me too many things going on in the main screenplus the menus and everything seem to be the same as the other arpgs out thereso by my point of view change of title same gameplay with just a different storyi am still waiting for a great arpgdamn i really want this game looks like its made in the same engine as whatever grim dawn uses seems cool they have 10 classes but you only showed the beastmasterdruid and the magesorc any clues as to the other classes personally id like to see a pirate swashbuckler or a vampiric necromancer type class obviously there gonna have a heroic knightpaladin class but it would be cool to have a psychoticinsane psychic with some sort of schizophrenic mind powers lol just a thought to be honest the game seems pretty good im going to try it out soon 238 big disappointment i dont need to see a big cloud of numbers flying around it totally spoils the suspended disbelief necessary i want to see the art i want to see action i dont want to see a visual representation of game mechanics its like a game that teaches math to 7 year olds where numbers and math are worked into the game this is why so many d2 fans didnt like d3 why must we get wow over over again back on d2 as well thanks xtimus this looks like it could be a good replacement to poe for me specifically can you do a video explaining the loot based rng mechanics and potential economy of this game that is the main consideration i have when dedicating myself to a game these days cant wait for void knight to be released honestly i would like diablo 2 graphics slightly less pixelated diablo man that game is just so legendarynone of these d3poe clones are gonna knock it off the throne when i see this and path of exile my first thought is d2 graphics are still better than both looks promising good gameplay has nothing to do with cgi quality graphics i still very much enjoy playing d2 i also play poe and grim dawn will be keeping an eye on this one thanks for the video couldnt find a single graphical difference between this and d3 same shit way to early to call you guys should have seen poe in alpha the differences possible within a few patch cycles is pretty stunning if you are on mobile heres your time stamps new act 101 skills 313 gambling 502 item changes 624 noteworthy changes 750 the future 946 my wallet is shrinking every week thank god i buy this on steam if it was a system my wife see all the cd cases she would flipdigital is wheres is at this game looks so fun my friends and i really want to try it when multiplayer is implemented very happy youre enjoying the game my brother in law is actually the creator and he had me voice artem the gambler he loves the feedback keep up the great work yo yo yo so i have seen the roadmap for release but it doesnt give dates is there an actual release date for this game or at least a target quarter that it will be released in they added for the paladin skill tree sigils of hope hello im starting now in this game is it hard to get the uniques for this build i dont have the game but im really curious why you said you have decent stats and all your critical rates are 0 is hard to get critical rate on this game really nice build and video mate d cool build best grim dawn gameplay ever d i must say wait a minute what about a thorn build with no wolves or bear something not overly reliant on a football team of minions 1 concept 0012 how it works 2 passive skill tree 0257 3 active skills 1220 4 gear priorities 2744 try spec into skeletons and use rogues only and mages and fire golem with aura shit ton of fun man kills anything in ur path dou have ever played one hungering soul wish it had coop or something im sad the meta is geared toward disposable degenerating minion while the skeletongolems need to be specced for survivability my d2 necro fantasy has always been to walk around with a ton of permanent skeletons since the new patch that improved performance but at what cost yesterday im hoping computers can handle many skelebois with relative ease but not really with 60 its still a whole lot of peeps around thanks for the build thanks what the this is path of exile copy o whats your pc specs regarding wolcen i love the warlock staves seemed useless for a while so having a way to improve that is amazing also try specializing in rip blood and marrow shards they seem like a good combo for a lich build they need to make the sacrifice only activate on skeletons or wraiths because you keep sacrificing the golem and resummoning it is killing your mana i can see your desk top mouse constantly top left of where in game mouse should be ii kinda weirdl nice playthrough its good to see the bone golem in action wraiths look stronger than i thought the mana cost of sacrifice could be mitigated with some of the rip blood nodes meh i hate that its gender locked but its an indie game so its not that big of a deal have you tried a totem thorns beastmaster build yet insane dps path of exile diablo 3 last epoch 10 very high price this looks a lot like diablo somebody tell me why i should buy this make it free on ps4 and im in 35 for the beta are you fucking kidding me hello there fellow last epoch nerds ive opened up a forum free to use for anyone whod like to share their builds simply just go to whatever section youd like to create a thread in and lets share our builds the website is httpswwwlebuildsnet enjoy jesus christ this game looks utter trash all this game are the same shit cant wait till it comes out for the switch just straight up ripped diablo not even a unique twist overpriced right now at 30e i have better options not good enough to be 2019 game this looks really boring looks like titan quest on steroids i think warhammer fantasy hs will be better gender locked bullshit looks like grim dawn mixed with the path of the exile style skill system of interconnected skills the skills shown also mirror a lot of existing ones from titan quest grim dawn and diablo ii too unfortunately the graphics and creature animation looks pretty bad grim dawn is now what 6 years old and running on a modified titan quest engine and it looks better waht time does it go live this looks really good guys i definetly will pay for this dear devs in case youre reading this your primary concern should be with the animations thats what gives off the second grade quality vibe there is nothing that can ruin the first impression as much as that please take it into consideration everything else is secondary at best how much will beta cost on steam where is vulkan where is cpu multithreading doesnt exist but cash shop is implemented before you completed the game approved scam congratulation not to be mean but the game somehow looks worse than poe does graphics wise and that games engine is from 2006 you arent catching anybodys attention when the barbarians or whatever class it was is swinging his axe by only moving his arms ty for the linux version d i really hope the combat can become more impactful like skills feel powerful to use ground stomps shakes the earth lightning sparks like crazy fire waving around like its alive spin 2 win moves makes enemies blood spray everywhere are there gonna be character wipes the trailer makes it seem like this is a game that isnt going to run well the action doesnt look very smooth i dont know if that was some intentional effect you were going for but it might be off putting to someone who hasnt watched actual gameplay on streams and such finally what is this you just copied diablopoetitanquest down to the placement of healthmana orbs and town portals even some of the monsters are the same i hope you get copyrighted for such an egregious copying dudes was made by outsourcing to chinaindia anyway dont buy this junk wow this looks wayyyy toomuch like poe same art style healthbars fonts lets hope performance is decent now alpha plays clunky and choppy i mean i play 2019 games with no stutters at 60 fps all times it looks like a game from 2006 i will try it though holy cow color me excited as well what you think another game like wolcen hourrai at last a decent rpg working on mac the mac community give thanks personally im more excited for wolcen last epoch at least this trailer looks too much like poe so since ive been playing alpha forever cant wait for full game i hope linking account to steam will simple here i come last epoch necro minion build let them do the job for me while i chill and run around ahahhaha backed but am not in the beta anyway to upgrade pledge least this game seems to have better managersdirectors then wolcen does nice cant wait it sounds interesting compared to the wolcen team you guys are a league above them you keep up a steady tempo in develope and deliver so much quality in a short amount of time i didnt even thought it would be possible you have proved to be my favorit develope team of all time you guys show how it can be done some teams could learn from this wolcen lord of fail keep up the awesome work you guys have an impressive development pace the games shaping up to be pretty competent looks great dont go epic exclusive and ill buy it looking great cant wait d i kinda forgot i backed this but it is looking great hooo nice i cant wait to test it via steam good job guys wow this came out of nowhere i cant wait for beta copy of poe last boss is theboss from act 6 lul hopefully multiplayer comes out with beta and keys so my firends could pick up the game later wolcen will kick this played the demo and loved it and april 30 on steam i see spin to win i buy yasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss also that was the lamest notcthulhu ive ever seen backed this on kickstarter sadly i dont have a pc to play this on but am really pleased with the progress you all have made on this if this had multiplayer insta buy got the alpha will the owners of the packs get a new key for steam nice cant wait for beta also seeing this makes me sad for wolcen i much preferred then over last epoch looks so much better than before congrats on coming so far backed this on kickstarter and am well impressed with the progress looking forward to the beta in a few weeks i really cant comprehend that you guys made this game so quick and with so much polish unbelievable looking forward to play the game i jumped in at the 10 dollar line so i still have to wait until the official release but keep up the good work the alpha was really fun i cant wait for beta d great trailer music wow great trailer cant wait i miss the times back when a beta was support enough for the developers now some developers make us pay to play the beta lmfao omigosh the beta is almost here i cant resist the wait i played a demo that had very little in it and i liked it i hope the game will be at higher standards congratz id love to play the beta if i had any money i have been told to get arena key by finishing five monolith in a row without dying is it true or is it as you say that it is random thanks hey folks this is most definitely not rhykker great vid eh looks like it stole a lot of the ui from diablo and sorta feels poeish great video though thanks for keeping us all updated without you i wouldnt even know about this game ok so i purchased the game because i really needed another game as i was playing pagan online and ive maxed out everything there your video helped me greatly and the wipe isnt as bad as i had previously read in a forum post you are the reason i bought this game you are making amazing videos and it is a pleasure to listen to you talk it is very calming kind of like listening to deckard cain in diablo 1 and 2 except you are the deckard cain of arpg on youtube i appreciate your videos they help me a lot in deciding what to purchase this looks so good and you explain it all so well i am really going to purchase this game now except the idea of everything will be wiped is holding me back for now i stopped by wolfcryers roadside seafood stand sign said lobster tails 2 so i paid the 2 and he said once upon a time there was a lobster new subscriber just found you due to this video nice and informational on the endgame of last epoch and comparisons great video wolf video as always keep up the epic work your reviews are making me want to get these games when they come out anyone know if itll release on gog just picked this up and its great this and wolcen are going to be great this is single player right hi new to the channel and interested in the game can it be played with a gamepad arpg arpg its hack slash not arpg witcher 3 for example is arpg great vid thinking about buying this game live long and prosper union vulkan hey do you know if your progress in beta will carry over at launch lol press z to see loot half way through watching beta is looking great am planning to get a new pc in a couple of weeks so this is good motivation got a build in mind focused on ward edit just saw humming bee gain ward on hit sweet also a shadows awakening play through would be good they released a dlc too iirc i bought the beta on steam question can you not forge onto uniques will that change in the future where you will be able to forge onto them and add stats only white characters and gender lock though which is a no no in 2019 i looked at steam and saw thisand i was like er meh gursh i played this in the demo and it was really good i need this how did you find the shapshifting i dont like how it is set now at all i want to stay in form until i decide to shift back not a fan of the out and in stuff great and informative vulkan could u please tell me how to spec warpath reckless combatant branch or void spiral branch 1h or 2h just respecced 10 points from reckless combatant ant trying void branch for debuff cheers can you get this on console or pc only edit vulkan crafting was screwed this session because they assassin blade you originally put in glitched such that whatever you put in showed as the yellow blade regardless of what you put in the assassin blade was filled up by you but then glitched into crafting for the session pro tip do not despecialize a skill all the points go to shit and you have to upgrade it again it is a pain in the ass its here hype offtopic perhaps you know i74770k gtx 1070 16gb ram having fps issues would you happen to know if there was a way to lock fps or have any tips other than changing graphics for fps fixes latest nvidia driver 43039 was having issues so i did install the hotfixed oneruns slightly better but not a fix game fps 40130 loading screen 2350 fps other than that the combat and game is great loving it and thanks for last epoch content got it on steam to support its development good game so far hope gameplay gets better on full release from content and character build this game feels good already i personally still like wolcen more even with less content right now gameplay is on another level hope le gets close more arpgs the better ok so wolcen pagan chaosbane or last epochif you had to choose one from what you know and have played so far what would be your favourite be tried downloading from the main website and my norton antivirus thought the launcher was dangerous and refused to let it download steam here i come i guess oh no is it gender locked 1500 at release 3500 to buy into beta now 1000 to buy full game now cant play until release watching this to go to bed they need to go back to the drawing board with the animations and visuals im greatly interested in this but it looks shit no way worth 35 bucks my friend i apologize for disturb i cant find any game breaking build if you could have the best items what would be your ideal for maximum clear speed farming build like glass cannon build i v tried so many times during alpha etc erasing strike actually it is the most dps build but i fell like i can t find any clear speed like poe build i agree im totally ok with it being delayed as i dont think its up to snuff atm id like to see more depth in its systems ie poe type depth i love the skill system but i think they could do more with itemization ect that being said i havent made it to endgame and didnt plan to until launch so i could be missing some stuff but depth is what keeps people playing long term and i like the idea of a time travel type arpg so keep going so badly want to get back into le but so sick of just melee chars any fps improvement i am running it at 30 fps on low settings on a rtx 2070 0006 grim dawn patch 116 0030 crate entertainments new game 0112 wolcen lords of mayhem 0221 last epoch 0328 wow classic bwl release 0341 torchlight frontier whyd i mention this 0429 channel news i would love some new dlc for grim dawn hyped for wolcen to finally release also about there being no more major releases for grim dawn but new game looks cool nice build ill follow it subbed d very nice video my friend build is well explained i would go with a 2h weapon over shield a good 2h sword can bring cour damage up to 13k crits and even more against the smal monsters with low resistances like the birds the arena do you give reward when you finish it are the skills balanced or are there 12 op builds for each class 1 concept 0350 how it works 2 passive skill tree 0610 3 active skills 1100 4 gear priorities 2245 first seriously though looks like a pretty sweet build i intend to level up a shaman at some point but having fun with my sentinel for now interesting game gonna try it out curiosity level peeked gonna check out the demo good stuff as always very nice video you gave me everythingi came here for looks like a promising game infact im gonna download it rightnow graphics are dated like poe ill have to check if i can get past it will definitely have to check this out thanks for bringing this one to light why are you wasting your timewith this shits man i know d3 is currently dead poe comminty is so strong and you might be late but how about grim dawn i cant find the link didnt see a link to the game missing forgot looks good would like to try website 11 whore games oh nice arpgs are my favorite games this looks awesome thanks for sharing this one z ill be following this game with great interest reminds me of the witch class in poe looks like a fun game so far how many levelschapters are currently available in the game nice would like to see more d2 necro was better it s ok a lot too learn participated in the last epoch public race last year was interesting game shows great potential 927 if you pick cast it on allies can you cast it on your mirror images seems pretty interesting i wonder why its rated so low on steam oh damn i was about to buy this until i read that it wasnt online multiplayer big fail im totally looks like what diablo 3 couldawouldashoulda been but is single player wish had at least a coop where is john woo this game looks straight diablo ripoff lol even frozen orb is the same i bought the game its great fun thank you they should seriously pay you some money for advertisement im buying this 1st day of beta solely and only because of your coverage builds id like to see static orb and ice ward marrow shards and rip blood seeing sacrifice in action would be cool also a comparison of the skeleton commanders vs others basically wether a few strong minions are better than just sheer numbers thorn totem build and roots some of the nodes look neat cant wait for beta who is vacuuming so im curious have you guys tried out last epoch yet and if not why not this game can be play offline any chance for you to revisit last epoch it beta is live now with many supposed patches respecs available etc would be keen on hearing another review to decide weather or not to buy the game the skill system is nothing like the rune system in diablo its much much similar to games like dungeon siege interresting concept but animations dont look good why the fuck do you show you face in a review i want to look at the game not your face and my eyes are looking at you every time you move its fucking annoying youtube was so much better back in 201415 when creators had the decency to not pester the viewer with their faces is it faster than grimdawn the same guydammitt 2750 who made grimtoolscom for grim dawn is doing last epoch aswell httpswwwlastepochtoolscom so we will probably get the calculator some day love your video thx for the way you explain and describe just the right words the right way sounds nice sadly the graphics are not exactly my style but glad there is a good game out for people that like a different game speedstyle always nice to have alternatives as long the devs dont do what ggg does with poe and that is speed clear meta face tank everything no skill 1 button i win and keep the game at more realistic speed lot of us remember old version of poe when it was slower pace and i think poe biggest down fall is the speed clear meta it might work for now but it gets old it will lead to demise of poe in the long run so if this game ends up being not like poe in that regard and factors in skill over 1 button i win ect this will be a huge step in possibly out doing poe for a large amount of ex poe players a very good and detailed review thank you do you have to pay for it setting looks gorgeous character animations look horrid so many says grafic is old but they play minecraft xd this game has lots of skills items customizing and a great looking ui i love it both game is a garbage shit impressed if the combat really is as smooth as you say the only gripe i have right now is i dont like the textures or animations but i think these will change with time the animations the fx are horrible and the overall look is pretty much like your below average generic arpg probably very young developers without much experience just like 99 of the indie devs currently what make the previous generation of developers so good is because they were often geeks in their 30s and they were less dumber because their education was superior nice review on the game put in a good 80 hours already stoked for their progress especially performance improvements i love the game design i have to say the lag is a deal breaker its the reason i never got conan exiles poe is a mature game which has been developed for years while last epoch is a fresh new game it is difficult to make a comparison right the way it looks really rerally poor in terms of graphics animation effects maybe its smooth but it looks cheap and already outdated the mogs are awful i understand its ot a priority but still to me this looks like another copy paste merge from d3 poe grim dawn with no special taste to it storywise ive read a lot of things it looks poor too thanks for the review these skill trees are terribly outdated and mundane now why do these game companies keep using them lv70 on my mage feels good hope path 40 is good so im curious are you a g ook am i the only one to think this game wants to be something else what i mean isthe uiits like they just copypasted diablo3 the color around items ie orange blue green just like diablo3 the water fountain lika floating damaga numbers the inventory the crafting of itemseverything looks like a reskin of diablo3 i know its in alpha but to me it looks like a waste of time and resources to copy a design from another game to maybe since the style looks like it got some fair amount of work done on it change it on a later date but as i saidmaybe its just me stat sticks were the only thing that kept melee afloat lets make sure we nerf melee because its so overused and overpowered but lets make it so stat sticks are still really good for spellslogic literally losing at the game if you make melee anymore so now its not possible to use whirling blades as a caster if your other weapon is not a dagger wb is the only nonshitty movement skill for a caster scepters are worthless now getting two decent wbdaggers is a problem it completely gets rid of any real advantage melee builds had if you arent building range you are losing the game and wasting your time i am impressed actually this patch on 12032018 really helped diversify builds with removing melee right guys melee builds have always been at a disadvantage completely removing stat sticks for melee uses is such an awful idea i would be ok with a nerf but complete destruction of a mechanic you just killed dual wielding for melee builds on top of th game looks interesting still looks like an alpha build so will not be buying this yet but will keep an eye on it if their mtx shop turns into what you get in poe then this will be a garbage bin game for me will see how that pans out before i buy looks good i hope they get enough funds to modernize the graphics and animations ill give it one more year if i wanted to play shitty d3 i would just play d3 i wonder if diablo 4 is going to borrow some of the ideas in last epoch lots of great quality of life features that poe shouldve had years ago i really wish they would get over whatever silly reasons they have for wanting to move everything around manually auto stash would make poe way more fun also mapping is done for me i cant keep rolling that crap over and over i hope this game really takes off still love poe and all but they need to take a hint from this game before they get their lunch eaten whirlwind with a shield looks so retarded ive stopped playing poe after 8k hours mostly because playing in party is really bad cant see anything mobs dont have enough hp will last epoch have a decent multiplayer ssystem all these companies should be forced to give diablo part of the money they make as all these games are basically diablo doesnt look good to me idk im never ever going to pay for a betaalpha ever again i used to play diablo 12 and 800 hours into poe i looked into other games like grim dawn etc but i couldnt get into games like that wow first poeclones are popping up i hope that leads to a rivalry that is pushing both games and the genre forward diablo is done no stash tabs im out goodbye chris leeroy is new friend graphics looks a little dated 35 for an unfinished game with a f2p business model game ehhh no thanks if they are going to copy path of exile or diablo they should copy their business model too release it when its finished for the full price or release it for free and get donations if people like it and want to gain added utility this is neither and charges as much as a full priced aaa game used to cost it has an ah insta thumbs up thanks for doing this review ive been looking for what else might be coming these guys will be good competition for poe when they are out of beta competition is good for everyone d it looks interesting but their idea of limiting the players in trading kills it for me i dont get why developers try to tell players that playing the market is no fun or not a good way to play the game i would say that some players actually enjoy it this is what i love about poe you just can trade everything and for those who want to play ssf they can and you meet someone new on discord or any other community tool and you are like uhh i have a nice weapon for you that can help oh dang you are not yet 5 weeks on my friendlist i cannot give it to you what a stupid idea the performance is pretty bad right now to be expect in early beta i currently the absolutely lowest details and still get a lot of framedrops below 60fps kinda makes you appreciate poe which also runs not that greatly but it looks pretty on my pc you said there is a soft auction house for some kind of items can the others be traded normally though and if not how would you deal with build enabling uniques they already said that in 37 cyclone will be a channeled ability lel i have the same char its op and when i tried others it was boring stick to vengeance d great video very fair criticisms that we will for sure be working on just wanted to clarify one thing at about the 1900 mark when youre describing the bazaar system you mentioned that crafted and unique items and relics wont be tradable some extremely high end crafted items and items crafted with some specific glyphs will not be tradable some extremely high end legendary items will also not be tradable most items will be tradable though what engine is last epoch being developed in unity custom where are those micro transactions at blimey mate good review question regarding difficulty how is it for single and two players im not necessarily a good player though i would say im alright most importantly i love theorycrafting and coming up with powerful builds and usually succeed because of this games like poe get boring very fast for me as they become ridiculously easy the bosses are fine but using oneclick to clear an entire map of mobs with no danger of death like in the latest few poe seasons gets boring very fast for me same with grim dawn diablo end level rifts are alright mobs take time as well as bosses though with the constant increase of power i dont have the energy to grind to the interesting rift levels i usually play two people coop and the mistake i often note in these games is that devs either dont modify enemies or only increase health by 100 or less keeping in mind that thats now two players who buffs each other add more debuffs to enemies and only one is targeted does it have pvp the life of a summoner is suffering looks terrible i dont support unfinished products anymore wait this costs 30 lmao nah ty dont like the design already thought about playing it a little bit maybe but 30 no thanks well i play poe and what ive seen of last epoch its a total rip of poe so why would i play it when i have poe and btw last epoch dont have more combinations plz learn math usually i am open to new arpgs but last epoch still looks much to alpha for my taste graphics and development i really like the idea of this game it looks very easy to understand and to learn just had a freind start playing poe and its hell trying to teach good ive played for a couple of hours now blindly its pretty fun loving the base acolyte stuff and looking forward to speccing into lich stuff if this released this year it wouldve been such a big win last epoch 10 path of exile 40 in 2020 i cant choose i was so excited for my first unique which was a massive upgrade also almost any unique i droped during campaign was huge boost which feels cool because in poe almost 98 of uniques becomes shit after level 50 like half way through the campaign this game ran like absolute arse on my pc anything above very low settings resulted in sub30 fps so i refunded it for now i made a post on their forum and got nothing but silence from the devs i know its a bit rough presentation wise but im actually very impressed by its general gameplay design crafting skill trees gameplay loops is very very encouraging and i would rather have that any day over a pretty looking game with nice animations it just tells me they have their priorities straight polish can always come later you can polish a piece of shit as many times as you want its still a piece of shit with a glossier exterior not even aaa funding and gloss can make a shittily designed game good without an overhaul of its base systems just look at anthem ive played 20 hours enjoying my time so far ty for giving me the code shockdamost on twitch great review how does it compare to grim dawn crafting with support items auction house to sell support items i see where this is going re ost original soundtrack fyi wolcen hired an orchestra httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcg4eawxkwko i like the customization but the combat surprising worst than poe just for some skill especially melee path of exile version 37 no death information last epoch beta 070 actually tells you what killed you and did in earlier builds too i hate pay to pay for mtx if you want a f2p monetization system please just be f2p in addition to the character creation tooltips issue my 1 complaint was not knowing which actives currently have a specialization tree until i unlock the skill at least 3 times now ive rerolled stoked to specialize into a cool looking skill only to find its tbi almost quit the 3rd time like the complexity but the animations do look clunky might give it a miss for now for that reason very super extra omega heavily inspired by path of exile even the overlay map looks exactly the same lol but im not complaining you know i really appreciate how tarke did this whole video in 1 take no cutting or editing just hit going through the game in a natural showcase kind of way you rarely see people do it in this format and its a shame because its very easy and nice to follow i feel like the reason they planned the bazaar like that to counter real world trading i feel like path of exiles combat is more fluid than last epochs given the footage ive seen i like to run through maps at 167 movement speed just flame dashing on top of that just destroying i dont know if you can reach these kinds of speeds in last epoch im definitely interested in trying this out looks like a potential palate cleanser in between poe leaguesgaming sessions is there a groupparty system in it any info on guilds finally a game to play while the mess called poe sorts itself out that was a really good video explaining the game for me a poe player have been seeing a lot of streamers play it but never understood the game at all thank you tarke 1310 whats on the screen that alone made me super interrested my 1 favourite thing in wow is soloing dungeons you are not meant to be doing at least it was until i quit at the start of legion d i levelled so many druids in my time generally stopped at the middle of wotlk dungeons then basically created a new one im weird i know when the character model moveshis entire upper half doesnt move wtf ere good intro regardless wolcen is terrible if anyone even remembers that game trying to get its feet off the groundstill look not a single recursive gameplay loop interesting looks like a mix of diablo 3 path and some aspects of grim dawn and torchlight 2 it definitely has potential if it keeps the better portions of each of those games christ even its global chat is a carbon copy of poe yikesi cant believe ggg hasnt sued this company yet i mean shit is straight up ripped from poe at times this game looks surprisingly good very good considering a purchase the crafting system sure is interesting and the crafts themselves dropping is a cool way to integrate it but i am just afraid that the fact that you could fracture the item or even brick the item totally is going to further alienate the average player from getting into crafting this is assuming that the average arpg player lets say in poe for example a large number of people dont really dabble into crafting it has become somewhat of a luxury sport maybe i am projecting from my past self but the fact that you can totally destroy your item thru a failed craft is much more of a punishment on top of the fact that it was a rare crafting material to begin with i feel is going to scare away the entry players from even trying out some good crafts auto sort inventory and no pay2win stash tabs ggg needs to learn somethings kk waiting for the release to play this game p i know not many people in the arpg scene care about it much but this games graphics and animations make it look like it was made in the last epoch if epoch does not have betrayal syndicates in it then it is already 100 times better than poe review pagan online next sub count some cool ideas here no doubt but this is not the prettiest game ive ever seen great review of the game you always do a really good job of giving concrete critique and dont just say well thats bad and this is good that 16fps aura hurts me otherwise looks cool im early watch me mum wait do unlike in grim dawn are hybrid pet builds viable in last epoch please yes i hated in grim dawn how hybrid pet builds are not viable man i havent bought the game yet but i will at some point i feel like this might nist be the arpg i get really into since diablon 2 and to a lesser extent diablo 3 though grim dawn is really good does have some flaws though cant wait for the full release of last epoch hey i see your gameplay is running smooth i am useing a 1050ti and my game just runs so slow also useing a ryzen 1600x should be good to run this game just having trouble any suggestions still hope they change the skill bar and that hud part it looks so much like diablo 3 give me sheevers bruuuh you give me a build but i cant even play the game im just sad now vulkan hi vulkan looks you are expert in this game can you tell me about stash storage please is it gonna be awesome like grim dawn or cow cash like poe that is really important to me also why is beta ea more expensive than final game thanks a lot waiting for chaosbane whlle playing grim dawn forgotten gods but last epoch looks like one of the titles i will try hopefully it will be good also why did you take the 1 compton node that gives a negative effect but you are only using two wolves also use serpent strike with the beastmaster build cause snek i want a beastmaster build still thanks for making these vulkan im planning on buying into beta and enjoy these videos good stuff this game looks pretty cool already reminds me a lot of diablo 2 worth buying beta i really like this game wolcen too but that is too simple yetpoe too complex to me why is the sword upside downsomeone doesnt understand swords lol love your vids btw keep up the epic work this episode feels like a great stopping point in the lp for now might change classes or focus on getting all these starter guides out for season 17 twitchtvbluddshed lets get right into the news game looks like a solid d3 and poe replacement cant wait for the full version now i need to see businessman bludd all suited up and looking to make some deals hello been doing some research on this game so close to getting this question when you mention that the devs want there to be weight in selection the skills if you are always despecializing the skills and the skills you have are all level 1 how with that effect being in an area that is level 30 vs level 1 skills do you have go out and get those skills high enough to fight for the level 30 area that would be a lot of backtracking gotta say i stumbled on your channel by fluke and im so glad i did keep up these awsome informative videos i love it thank you for what you do good sir so happy i discovered your chanel 2 days ago man and this gem of a game i just backed them on kick starter for the alpha i look forward to your chanel for more updates and august for the alpha i cant w8 for necro and warlock would love to see what will they offer loving these videos great for newcomers to the game and the genre a finished wolcen game is what im really looking forward to owned it for what seems a life time waiting for the finished game before i really get stuck into it i have lot of hopes for last epoch it looks promising my mom played wolcen when she was a kid nice video in wait d4 you recommend last epoch or wolcen ive already mass played at d3 poe grimdawn except last extension pagan torchlight but i need a good hs to wait thank you in advance awesome roundup thanks x i loved the cinematic for diablo 4 it wasenticing xd tho the gameplay they showed looked like made in unreal engine 4 in a rush to show something las epoch is looking pretty damn look and i will go buy it because you seem to like it and it looks damn nice wolcen is a little bit of a controversy its been there for a while but they had some lazy developers and messy roadmaps and keep changing things so the game didnt really evolve until they released the act i patch wich is what you played the game is supposed to be full story and everything on january im waiting to the full release to try and see if its worth playin it kingdom come deliverance now with mods omg we are in for a ridexdddd yaiii you bought the grim dawn expansions i wanna play it again i liked it a lot i want to level up the reputations and get to max level it is a nice game indeed and last but not least why dont you have remnant already its a must its an incredible must a at least 2 years for d4by that time well be playing poe2 lost ark last epoch and a handful of other arpgs which one is better last epoch or wolcen looks like a boring and dated diablo clone to me they copied d2 character select and in game ui and half copied poe and other games skill tree mechanics and crafting i dont see anything original or new or even remotely interesting here there are several other isometric arpgs out or in early access right now that look better have fresh ideas are more fluid etc whats the minimum requirements for this game bought it but it seems my pc is to slow 15x playback speed for the win this game looks amazing so far is there any plan of adding a local coop similar to diablo would love to play this with the wife i love this game looks like it will be great but i also have read that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done the campaign isnt finished and gameplayperformance bugs are many and i absolutely hate playing unfinished games also future character wipes makes me more hesitant currently sounds like a great buy for streamers but not worth it for average gamer going to wait for final release is this better than wolcen lords of mayhem this game is amazing and its another example of what blizzard didnt get right with diablo 3 im starting to enjoy all these indie companies more and more because they cater to the gamer more and not some greedy ceo 11th hour gaming has a good thing going on here with the loot skills passives and the list goes on and on im really enjoying the game was really looking for a new arpg and i love this one i really like playing druidranger like classes and im having a blast with my primalist played over 15 hours so far in beta absolutely love the game cant wait for the finished product druid class huh hm cant decide between this game or pagan online to buy but nice video man edit also wolcen seems really interesting this is really hard for me but pagan online is currently on 1st place on my list great vid as always off topic though i hope you dont go to blizzcon this year spending so much money for such a disrespectful company is not fair to you or anyone else purchasing a blizzard game i dont have a problem with if it is good and not heavily monetised but spending money to go there for a company who does not give a well it is not right love your content keep it up 35beta after kickstarter croudfunding hey whats wrong this is not aaa product i just want another arpg with solid fluid combat like diablo poe feels wrong to me lets give this one a go is it going to be free to play btw great information keep up the hard work hi im excited about this game and the infinite possibilities of builds i play a necromancer and for now everything is going pretty well even in beta the game is fun and lets you see tons of possible builds there are certainly lots of bugs but a first patch has already been released after only 2 days after the official launch of the beta very cool u know anything about necromancer at that game i see that the drops are much lower quality i am looking for a diablo cloneish type of game that i bought into a couple of years ago early access i managed to find the homepage a couple of days ago but now i cant find it again so what do i know about it not much tbh it had terrible reviews back when it released early access people thought it was boring and repetetive with boring loot there are 6 classes or 8 classes cant remember and you pick 2 of them and distribute your skill points among them i remember shadowknight and engineer being two of the classes you could play a dwarf the game had dark magic spell type graphics was at that middle ground between torchlight and diablo there was housing it was an mmorpg anyone can help me find it as soon as any mtx any mtx all all affects character level in any way im out screw mtx once again was looking forward to this game but will wait 6 months to be safe from the gameplay footage it looks like there is still some polish to be added the animations looks a bit clunky i realize these were the first levels on the character but why do games nowadays need to be tuned for small children i mean your health bar doesnt even move a four yearold could play through that so pointless looks like a good diablo clone ive started playing grim dawn yesterday but im not fully satisfied gameplay is slow quest system is clunky half of the time i dont really know where i have to go or what i have to do what happens to proper tutorials in games like this explain the basics and explore as you go diablo 3 does just that great story great graphics great buildguides and if you wanna have a good time slaying some mobs for fun its also possible arpg is becoming a scene with endless grinds and endless time dont get me wrong i like games that push you but i dont feel at home at these kind of games sometimes i play diablo just to chill by slaying millions of mobs i dont want to spend 1 year to complete a build and have my endgame gear its just too brutal if you know what i mean i hope last epoch doesnt fuck it up grim dawn is so freaking boring to me ive played it since before there wasnt even 1 completed chapter it was boring then and it is boring now grim dawn is where its at because a nice dlc is coming out tomorrow you pay for the dlc and the game but the game has no instore money to buy whatever its a purely arpg goodness like the good ol days yeah if torchlight frontiers pay 2 win i will ditch that game in a second same as wolcen same as last epoch path of exile maybe piss the crap out of me but at least the developers have a nice free to play game and its kept like that im not sure how drakensang online is pay 2 win or whatever but that game is pretty fun actually tried out today will continued play it and see what i can get for free out of that game mu legends is cool but when it limits u to redo dungeons i find that stupid umm yeah so grim dawn is cool i dont know i just love it so much i love the dark fantasy of the game i think it plays good sucks to screen capture it heavy on my hardware figured something out to get it good to broadcast it p i hate the rng and fracture fickleness of the game i have had stuff fracture way too often when there is only supposed to be 10 chance to fracture game is very fun though but sometime frustrating due to getting great item with good stats and it fractures when it should be 8090 for it not fracture also there are a lot of skills that have very vague descriptions on what they actually do and how it affects things in your build if they need money to move on then the microtransactions are fine if they stick to cosmetic stash space and so on and just w8 and see it will come to wolcen aswell i have no fate in developers these days regarding microtransactions they are all going that way but the different is what the stores offer time would tell torchlight frontier is going the pay to win way wich is a turnoff and i wont play that game wolcen and last epoch i have buyed and have had a good time in those aswell but do they go the pay to win way ill trash those aswell controller support thats what i wanted to hear im looking forward to playing it never thought about that but youre right its an excellent week so far for arpg fans is this game worth the 50 to play it now or should i wait it looks ok path of exile is leading me to that path to exile if i keep playing that game lulz its pissing me off at the moment i need a good arpg i have grim dawn already is it worth playing that game more should i get the dlc or should i give this game a go where should i spend my 50 what the hell im early this game is great i probably did 10 different mages and acolytes now just starting with the primalist bring on falconer not digging any of the class atm im waiting for wolcen release and this onethe game looks awesome its like a diablo 25 maybe with endgame content poe mechanics really like it while watching this last night i played back the part where you brought up chili mac and my wife wanted to make that for supper tonight lol she added some chopped onions with some mesquite and creole seasoning to the mix with a pound of ground beef i love arpg and played just about all that is out there and this one is starting to shape up ill definitely be keeping a eye on when this one releasesone this is needs more mobs giving a shadows awakeing vibe with the empty maps you are repeating yourself waaay to much sera free to play path of exile a guy i watch on twitch named vox swears that this game is the best shit since sliced bread and goes on about how great the graphics are but the graphics are absolute shit the gameplay may or may not be amazing but i cant say never played yet but visually it is sub par and its sad that people have such low demands and expectations which is why we are in the shitshow desert wasteland that the gaming world has become standards peoplestop selling yourselves like whores to every shit game developer and have some standards was watching a stream where the dev was in chat handing out a couple keys too apparently its going to be in beta at the end of the month and available on steam cant wait 5 years time jump we were in 2004 we are now in 2009 the graphics have improved but god damn those animations are awful hope that improves looks alot crisper for sure and i love what they did with those worms this game gonna be awesome holy shit this looks awesome my only fear now is that it ends up as another d3 judging by the skill unlocked at x level up but the multiple sub classes system and passive trees already show promise playing new grim dawn expansion now got burned out of path of exile too quickly this league wolcen looks and feels great but the content isnt there yet so last epoch looks like the next awesome arpg and with these sweet graphics improvements wolcen lost the next gen crown and has some competition wish gd looked like this lol thanks for your coverage of these games my man keep making videos why the horrible music instead of just game audio vulkan the hardest arpg working man on youtube this game is insanely expensive compared to wolcen any word on beta in april i hope this will be a buy to play im not interested in free to play junk it looks crisper now for sure a step in the right direction it is shaping up nicely i hope they bring it on gog looks closer to wolcen now have you played since the latest update they are on 073c now holy aura got moved up a tier in the paladin mastery tree so now you have to spend another 5 pts to get it theres been lots of other changes to the various passive and skill trees as well im sure just curious as to whether or not this build is still good after the changes that were made yet to get the beta but ive watched some videos thinking about running a lunge vengeance erasing strike build leaving void beams then using volatile reversal going back a few seconds to keep the beams not sure if it would be effective crappy business moves aside i think warhammer is better than wolcen i played a couple hours and was not at all impressed at least wolcen was on sale for 19 seriously which warhammer game is actually a good game they are made to sell mediocre overpriced buggy crap under the brands fame but how did you get the mirror haha unfortunately poe generally has a difficult first week in every league my good piece of advice after 6 years is to take that first week and level up build your wealth and do the things that make you most of the time not the league mechanic and get ready to lay the smack down in week 2 one of the interesting things about poe is that you can get really rich in lower level content if you know what you are doing the way season passes usually work is that you spend 20 to get 30 worth of dlc so it is most likely that season pass holders will get three 10 dlc packs i hope this helps your perspective happy holidays to you wolf and your family unless tomb is the last season pass content for chaosbane then you are way off base complaining about people only spending 10 bucks on one piece of season pass content they could have more big updates coming for season pass and those that didnt get the season pass could spend upwards of 20 dollars more than season pass holders did i personally like the game i do agree it needs more variety for sure though but it by no means is a bad arpg anywho just thought you might be jumping the gun on your anger that people only paid 10 bucks when more content could be on the way next year perhaps i dont know for some reason i cant play poe more than a couple of days a league anymore skipped the last 3 entirely maybe they will come out with more dlc that will add up to the extra 2000 we spent im hoping this game gets better like you i paid for the most expensive one and have not played it since aug will have to see if its worth going back to thanks for the video im so hyped for wolcen full release in january warhammer chaos bane of everyones existence no longer even around thanks bud trying this one out now hope you do more classes in the future amazing build i will try it for sure thanks for the guide if you want a pixel graphics game like diablo rather go for chronicon on steam its a lot better than it lurks below and sticks truer to diablo sort of gameplay not to mention cheaper also made by a single indie dev ill be buying wolcen but only after they release the september update and depending on the quality and quantity of the content it holds ive been playing ilb its a very addicting game and cant wait to see the finished version im buying them all im excited about last epoch i feel the game has a good team and a lot of potential but im worried the game will be too similar to poe what do you think im a simple man i see wolfcryer uploading a video i upvote i agree with you about a game being fun to play that is first in my book great graphics are just a bonus i remember having lots of fun with my nes dont you not have a phone haha so much diablo3 clones outthere hahaha it looks very similar to grim dawn is there any word as to when its leaving alpha im itching for a fun loot based fantasy rpg but want to wait until i can get the full experience rather than play just little bits this game is ugly neither i think i just downloaded off website i will try to re download or pledge etc thanks i think i missed kick starter window thanks for reply take care one more thing it allready looks better than the sad attempt of necomancer in diablo 3 looking forward to play the game and that awesome necro hope this game soon becomes beta looking so much forward to it but i think the support packs are to expensive so ill w8 until beta looks like im going back to pc console just dont have good games anymore so where does one acquire this game or will acquire it which one do you like more overall at this point and time wolcen or last epoc reminds me of the paths mod for titan quest favourite build in there was the lich for me looking forward to when last epoch comes out that minion army definitely will be one i try out perhaps the first why do i see path of exile in the description box is this game going to be on steam great work very explanatory i have the druid and mage how do i get the other classes do i just need to update game or does it cost money thanks keep up the good work if theres a thing this game its doing right its the class tree holy shit if every class have like the acolyte the game will be a masterpiece youtube implies that im watching gameplay of poe ive watch a few last epoch videos now and the mob quantity and density seems a bit low i hope they increase it wow this game like path of exile 7 years ago i bought the beta on steam and i cant forge onto uniques do you know if thats how its going to be or if it will change in the future it shows 4 spots open to forge onto but wont let me forge it says cant forge onto uniques thanks is anybody having problems being able to pick up items from the shop i can highlight them but when i try to click to move it to my my inventory its not moving i tried every which way i can think of to move the item i definitely have the money but its not letting me grab it hey garret good game loved it i like this build in the video do you have a guide on it i want to try it out hi are devs force players to play every class like in pagan online or u can play only necro with minions to get everytning important i saw something in the interwebs about some company releasing a new diablo arpg kinda game have u heard about that thy how to install last epoch i cant found this game pls help dude your reviews are fucking hilarious keep up the great work only 360p i like the way you talk you have your own and funny way of talking as for the mage are there any projectiles or every spell is in the form of novas seems nice but its a bit expensive to get it for alpha and beta i mean they should have put it at 20euros like wolcen wicked 1 take my money 2 that is all you cant even make a 1 min video where we can understand what you are saying because music is 5x louder than the guy talking why would i trust you making a full game now i wanna be a knight no offense to the other classes but void blades sound a lot cooler than cloth and armor hehe with the latest update you should try the same build but with the werebear form you can get tons of extra protection while dealing even more damage with your swipe and entangling roots nice and informative video thank you 217 when your wife sees how you really jerk it when shes not around for the last three weeks ive been complaining about my hair line now i feel stupid wave 35 hardest boss nice clik bait one shot him with my druid werebear i hope to catch the stream in the future but nice video hehe the tree doesnt pull from the whole map those floating eyes go around on the map regardless of what youre doing p im almost always miss your streams hey alvis thanks a ton for the coverage and im glad youre enjoying the systems if anyone would like to get a copy of the prealpha you can join our discord and download for free and chat with our dev team kickstarter is april 17 2018 httpsdiscordappcominvitelastepoch 9 months later still alpha i really hope this game is not gonna be like common asian p2w shit with bind to bind on p2w stats store i hope everytihng will be tradable just like on poe and ofc many skill tree options as well as items gonna support your kickstarter project we have to support the new ideas no matter whatas we see wolcen has no progress from the devs1 year early accesspeople wants to see something new besides poe and d3 how can you call this a pre alpha its def not a pre alpha looks more devolped then a pre alpha when it release if they fix how the character move ill get it the movement dont looks natural and bugs me xd this looks good i believe in you we need more arpgs to choose from other then poe and d3 nice i wish poe showed damage points pretty sure poe will kill this this game seems forced just one word wolcen this game is a copy of grim dawns character customization and crafting system and poes defensive mechanics in a shittier way no words to say idk man after playing poe for years i dont find other games customization being attractive anymore i kinda get a poe lite vibe at this stage of development thats not a bad thing ill be following with interest dang all the upcoming arpg looks alike the graphic base looks like wolcen lords of mayhem only the ui is placed differently o fantastic coverage psyched for the kickstarter last epoch hits kickstarter april 17th 2018 sounds good for pre alpha but lets see the progress looks awesome build i love speed trash killer builds but the game needs polishgore and explosion effecs should be added i have been following this game for so long im so happy the game is getting better and going in a good way cannot wait till it get realse nothing in the phase saying about when the gambler is to be implemented cant wait for the game to come out so i can hear more opinionsreviews before deciding if i should buy it or not d good news when is phase 2 coming out

this is a bad optimized game or it is a game with many objects and calculations that make if it makes sense that you spend a lot v i cant turn the screen whenever i play and idk why welcome to the footage all youtubers use lol i download from steam where music dont jump across half of the map its more fun and challenging to do what they want you to do this game is the reason why i try random free games off steam you look like the guy from lanky box to be honest funny to see people like bronze medal omg that s incredible we made it let s move into the next level when i restart as long as i don t get that juicy neon medal xd also i always search a way to trick the game and take ultra shortcuts using glitches or making jumps that aren t supposed to be possible for exemple i have 0 sec on level 7 and 336 sec on level 8 lol edit thank you for the vid i realized i could make another 0 sec timer on level 9 not easy to get but done edit 2 after searching for more shortcuts like for the level 9 i found ultra shortcuts for 9 out of the 12 levels on tesla factory ultra shortcuts are ways to perform 0 sec timers but i also count the 3 sec timer for the level 8 so clustertruck but outrun and try to be more creative and go outside the map and go back in theres a thing called spacebar us it before u rochet jump hey man for lvl 1 i got 63 secs and for lvl 3 84 lmao i no life this game try out aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa for the awesome youll love it its on steam this reminds me a lot like tf2 jump maps i noticed i accidentally put the same narration twice so do skip from 244 to 322 i am sorry about that so you can just resume the video from 322 where i rate the game 810 ps if you did watch till this part you are awesome the movement sensitivity is so damn high ayaya toxichype how does he do the 711 jump how does he just accelerate like that anyones help would be appreciated the light off levels look so cool but im too bad to access them i got 0 sec on alot of tesla u dont use the minor glitches its sometimes a lot easier than the normal fast way and u can get a pretty 0 sec timer i dont understand how youre getting so much air time on some of these jumps i might actually get this game lol seems really cool 057 commentary hah hipp hupp hup huuuu hu that was close i always wait for your videos because i know youre gonna make my day i know this feeling i just mastered world one and im so fucking done i almost ripped half my heart out i slammed on my desk threw my mouse just to finish that piece of shit im so fucking done this video gave me extra anxiety thanks cool its free i cant believe it this looks bloody amazing so much fun this looks fun i think this would make a good vr game this looks sick very cool this run seems cool i just cleared level 6 in 069 seconds lol not sure how u are going that fast i cant get below 85 seconds on the first lvl wanna play wit me my discord is yaguy0530 can i use this ill give credit to you this looks like alot of fun reminds me of tron with the visuals whats up with all them adds you should play splitgate on stream its on pc on steam rip the really good run xd my brother played this and blamed everything on me c the new hat dlc looks fuckin totally sick nice run now get a 155 on the last level there tesla jail its actually possible to get a zero second time d hey man good video next video can you maybe try to play fran bow or sally face this needs more views and definitely more likes work on the mic tho this game seems addictive but ill keep away from it for the sake of my eyes i honestly think this game would make me rip my hair off first speedrun that says lights off that isnt lights off that isnt even a speedrun because no red medal isnt a speedrun supposed to be fast for evey like i get i will add a only true ahiru fans will know trop styler mec wawhou hold this l for this video hey cool run you should check out my run of the same levels on my channel if only you could do it faster if you wanna see fast check my video on neon boost tho good job if you did that in 1 straight run its like a phone game lol what the fricks wow 0 thats amazing i am stuck on level 12 though dude you can do so much better its possible to beat most of these levels with a time of 000 ill be uploading some vids about it later hey there im the composer for the game you can contact me on twitter alexeiost but i really have no problem you using the music d muy buen analisis crack muy bien tio

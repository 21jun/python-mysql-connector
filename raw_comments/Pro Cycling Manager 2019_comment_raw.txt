king in the north fuglsangs 81 and 82 definitely seem fair after the spring he had but maybe recovery should be lower than other grand tour contenders to reflect that he has weaknesses over 3 weeks i bet the old tactic from 1217 to set the pace with your leader in front with one guy protecting him still works set a solo pace between 7075 depending on his stamina and form uasely works stupidly too is this a completely separate game from the tour de france 2019 game you never take drinks on a mountain does british cycling team already have their changed sponsor from sky to the new one please help me out cant launch game i will pay anyone to help me with teamviewer or whatever just bought pcm19 now waiting for benji and worlddb so whats new about it typical same gameplay like every same years past 8 years this game is not worth buying so prettier graphics they moved the bars alittle changed the colours made the text harder to read otherwise pretty much the same as previous version what i am interested in did you notice any ai improvement did it seem like the ai worked like a team more then before etc its a joke how bad bora is compared to some other riders in the default database i wish climbs were more tactical ai physics for summit finishes is my biggest area for improvement personally if these stats are the same on tdf 2019 then i have a lot of editing to do before i start doing any actual racing personally i wish that they had chosen a classic alpine climb to end the race rather than a new one if it was down to me every grand tour would have stage 20 as a classic summit finish do you think pcm 2019 is better than 2018 a group of 17 riders in the final 5 km how is this game close to be realistic bring back 2011 didnt seem to be any evidence of the new multiple leader system here which is slightly disappointing wtf pinot 82 mo izagirre 80 mo sam ommen 79 mo and enric mas has only 78 mo how they can say ia is better no leader attack or tactic henao go out and do stupid thingsthis game is very poor now is it real that quintana has got 83 mo nibali must have 83 can anyone confirm that tdf multiplayer will be like armada or ultimate team is the battle for kom still a big mess like pcm 20172018 or not we cant see that cause you made a solo race ill visit this stage and ride the final climb myself im very excited for it ion izaguire with 80 mountains bernal has no stamina though i hope you play the difficulty extreme is it bernal should probably get a nerf in the realnamedatabase can you not see how much water is left why not getting water for tom they should make it that the teams group themself together and the large teams at the front looks good i noticed barguil with 79 mo is there coming a tdf video again is there a database with the real names what are the ameliorations in the gameplayai m o n s t e r w o r l d h a l f p r i c e you should play monster hunter multiplayer is pretty funny feck off im not paying your medical billsthis is america this guy gets it deletes emails hillary another hysterical video ive yet to find a callmekevin video that doesnt make me happy absolutely without a doubt kevins my favorite youtuber this has to be one the worst games ive ever seen whats the point of it theres someone in my gym who looks exactly like jim pickens and its scary because hes literally a feckin tank wait lidl is croatian sponsor cycle this i want cycle please bring back bad cooking but change it up a bit like do bad crafts or bad workouts or something played the game a bit and its real good tbh day 1 of asking kevin to use a canadian jersey if there is no irish one but wouldnt you be a gamer knowing the or playing the games that is unknown hahah but most likely a hipster gamer yus the title alone made me laugh out loud haha youre right i am dead inside this is so funny because my father used to play this game when i was a kid so this gave me major flashback as a twenty something now obviously it wasnt the 2019 one as a cyclist watching this was fantastic went to go see if he actually left that review and its the top one theres so many belgian flags in this game dafuq is this

west of loathing i forgot is kevin still a nazi yes or no i know he doesnt actually exist but i actually feel sorry for the guy who just stayed put for 3 hours i think what that review was trying to say is that the game doesnt have real people in it and it should which the reviewer didnt realize would be a legal problem unless the developer paid for a license to use real people and i have a feeling this isnt made by someone with that amount of money sukario idk why that pronunciation tilted me so much he used the green screen anaconda kiwi i know you are out there i just wanted to say i love that name it just cracks me up xd pls upload more wait i thought this was a game where you own a recycling company when it comes to the summer sale i think starbound took the cake no game on all of steam had that much of an increase in the player base last weekend check out the spiffing brits video for more info seriously though it is a great game and id love to see it played on youtube again how about a horrendous collab with rt arguing with each other until both o0f you starve to death love it those headphones look litwhat are those noooooo play monster hunter pro cycle manager but my

kevin complains that there is too much cycling i love you man if you really want a game with cool cars and other vehicles you should buy gta 5 it is a bit expensive but it is worth it if you want custom things there are mods but it has a bit of nudity and swears soo yeah if you dont like that you can buy a need for speed or forza horizon 3 or other games with cars if you want a sandbox game that kinda combines everything you like you would like garrys mod it has a workshop witch is huge it has tanks planes bombs helicopters trains star wars and a lot more things and it has a lot of servers of military rp star wars rp or scp rp and many more they are all great and have some funny moments like you just mind your business when a guy comes blasting the ussr anthem while killing the cops or some other things or if you want a sandbox game about space that has spaceships you are looking for space engineers in it you can create a spaceship or a station and there are costume maps and

try to join smplive fight the anti cult coalition if you enjoyed the video dont forget to leave a likecomment subscribe for more correct me if im wrong but some of these skills that you get by spending level up points seem unrealistic such as being able to see the bars of your competitor irl you wouldnt know how other riders are feeling the more skills you acquire is like having cheats imo a great insight into the new game who cares about pro cyclist mode they should be focusing on improving career mode and ai game play im so hyped to play pro cyclist again only layout changed nice can u do some video with elkov author they need to change the manager confidence in pro cyclist mode it so stupid you win a bunch of races early in the year but you take a hiatus mid season and it goes down by like 3040 when you havent raced its just the same as couple years ago they treat it like a milking cow like fifa games the only thing is its not a aaa game no buy for a 4year old game with some minor tweaks proud of you youre the best im really liking what im seeing the climbs tooltip is absolutely amazing imo i just love it the new ui also looks really nice and as with you the changes in pro cyclist might make me a bit more interested in it id like to see the hidden stats thing in the future implemented in career mode for now im happy that the transfer system is being improved i just hope the ai has been improved in that department as well and also in season planning thanks for showing us what well get this year ah thats bad there should be more available skills than points you cant be good at everything what is this year maximum level in pro cycling i only plays career so for me its a big disappointment some colour changes i mean come on the game really looks better visually and mechanically so basically a copypaste of 2018 my main take away is that you can pick a lower potential for pro cyclist finally fml i have plans today already guess ill have something tot watch in the morning youre making us exited cool that you are allowed to show it early gl with the stream i cant understand half the things you are saying hi did you find out why you cant choose all the jerseys available when making a custom team its weird because there are a lot more to choose is it ok to never select what equipment to use before races im not sure how equipment works so i just never touch the equipment page is that ok will the game auto select the best equipment available for each race thanks i started a career with evenepoel he i trained him to well then couldnt hire him next year nice vid keep up the great content the way you are talking is sooo relaxing when do you use relay mode for career you should try and get the climber jersey you may have to go in a break they never change stuff in their new games it is always the same gameplay chris froome best rider in the worldnot sagan lmao hey decathlon gamer i have a game for the decathlon if you want to play it because it is up to you it is fifa where you can play a career mode player or manager where you try to be the best player in the world or win as many trophies as possible or an ultimate team where you are trying to get a specific player or to get a number of coins but only if you are interested because it is your channel just found your channel and subbed immediately such good quality videos amazing video the work you put into the video the lineup graphic before the tdu start is really cool have to love the attention to detail and effort put in keep up the good work looks amazing you have put a lot of work into it it really looks professional great work looking forward to new videos fantastic video top notch design and editing really looking forward to more of this great start to a promising series you played really well but youre a tad too dominating in my opinion what are your difficulty settings perhaps your riders just had better form from the start of the season looking forward to more and i really hope it will continue for longer than most careers do take your time though i know it requires a lot of work congrats on an amazing start to this career with great resultsperformances the gameplay part of the video was great as always and you really raised the bar way up for everyone else i liked your recaps and the team lineup screen is pro level stuff absolutely stunning cant wait for the next one now a question how did you manage to trigger fitness peaks so early in the season never seen something like this dont understand why you have so less subs absolutely incredible who you designed the line up and the trek news also like how you cut the vid although its half an hour of vid it never gets boring just amazing really hoping for more episodes thank you very much maybe there some mistakes greetings from your viewer from germany best pcm video ive ever seen well edited and put together really well edited video amazing mate keep up this was absolutely amazing you put so much effort into this vid and its just amazingly made goodwork great video really loved the presentation looks like a lot of effort went in to it and i appreciate it looking forward to this series great work this vid was amazing you are the best pcm yter around i think i am looking forward to this this was great your one about the management aspect of the game didnt have a lot of info in comparison i wish you explained things in that one ike you did hear how to use energy gel please will you do climbing tutorial i would like to know how to manage resistance any chance to increase ui during race i find it hard to read but there is so much space on the screen nice video learnt a lot would like to know more about the team management side though if you make more how are your graphics this good just bought the pcm2019 and the landscapes are primitive without a supporting public how can i add these graphics could you pleas set the database from 2019 in the 2018 game would i be able to play this game on a mac hi benji great video subscribed keep up the work mate your voice is so sexy you are the best guy in the world is pro cycling manager 2019 better than the 2018 version this channel is extremely underrated but i just subscribed this is the year i stopped buying looks the same lol he should probably retire killed me xddd how do you zoom out l with mouse scroll now working for me may buy this seems to be the best of the games ty for the analysis are there injuries and or bike crashes ty are these full stages i played the tour de france game many years ago and it would always skip the middle of each stage you would only get to ride the first and last 20 km or so i might try a puncherstage racer with very good potential myself but just for myself hope you can keep this series your rider is doing great lol trying to celebrate an 8th place looking forward to this mate hi anyone know how to assign a contact of interest which level of difficulty do you play this would be more fun with random generated riders so you have totally no idea of their stats oh another naesen in the peloton when comes the career with bora the prize points for best teammate classification already exist in other pcm d and can you take me a doubt the recovery on that mountainhill when dayer was done and then youre done but he pass you like nothing happens before and drops you easy that is because of stats on what mountai hill endurance and really glad to see this last videos even tho all off your videos are awesome d its always good listen the enjoyment for new games ahah d i love this series i love the way you say skive lbet om danish what does the green bar do do you play on pc hi benji i would like to create a descent specialist but im not sure which archetypes gives the most advantage to downhill no way i started with my pro cyclist by adria mobile its possible to race an entire season at 95 fitness level without ever crossing the 50 tiredness its a bit stupid is the worlddb online already do you need to buy for some cheats chrome doesnt accept me to download the 2017 version does it work in career mode for 1 created cyclist how do you get ineos instead of team sea hello can you send me this stage thanks this is tense two dead people fighting each other haha was dying when i heard that one you should be commentating on television upgrade kruijswijk btw hes better im not bernal 82 mountain its normal really enjoyed it benjamin this was the consolation prize for pinot thomas was in a strong day but pinot just sat on his wheel for most of the time and then had enough in the tank to finish the job you know youre a youtuber when you manage to get 40km of pcm to 16 minutes p how did you do this camera i can not how do he get all to be 100 fitness please can you do a mountain stage with trek segafredo by the way peter sagan told in an interview at radsportnewscom that he will stay with bora till his retirement i like that i was there today absolutely amazing great work that you and your friend realized to build this short stage overnight big gimmick and service for your fans do you think pinot could have won why r u skipping the iseran stage buchmann should be 81 kruijswijk has unrealistically low stats welcome back to my channel guys ive taken a good month off youtube i felt like i needed to refresh and recharge and no better time to do that than over the cycling winter break ive found it fairly tough this past year to stay consistent on youtube combined with a fulltime job and other commitments hopefully i can do a better job in 2020 im planning on doing just one or two videos to cover the dauphinesuisse and other tdf buildup races so we can get to the tdf more quickly im also considering starting a pro cyclist with the 2020 db as well as some football manager videos this year i hope you enjoy the video today amazing comeback mate great win with porte at the top of mt baldy but i liked the stage win with skujins even better by now you may have realized i absolutely love that kind of wins from the break i dont know where to ask this question so ill do it here how did you manage to get a pro cyclist career with remco evenepoel in pcm 2019 i would loooove to do this on pcm 2020 but i cannot start a career with him since he is already a pro or did you just recreate him yourself and gave him similar stats great video and very good racing you did keep up the good work welcome back thanks for the great vid again great to have you back loved the episode as always i think that queen stage performance was one of the most tactically proficient ive seen on youtube i really like your videos where are you from well lets win all 3 grand tours next season haha isnt your rider too good atm haha you make my exam period very hard with this upload schedule keep up mate maybe increase the difficulty manually like 01 or 02 outside the game like joe does to make it more exciting stop 99 effort to the line save your red and then sprint to the line when u can make it gives u a much better chance as you get up to a higher speed and so have slightly better momentum love this videos man keep it up wheres van aert worth looking into the mysterious abandon of dennis in real life yesterday its not just the climbs but also the fact that nibali has 80 downhill and dennis just has 70 first 431 this didnt age well lol been enjoying your lets plays played the cycling manager back in 2005 looks like the current versions are all too buggy to buy for me but watching some gameplay has been enjoyable i have no idea what is happening in this game xd are you a big cycling fan that you know all the details 1223 dont ride on extreme ride on something like normal or hard hi benji any chance you could upload the startlist please thanks hoped for bora but nevertheless i am looking forward to th next vidos good work rip wanty hey benji i also make tdf content and have been inspired by your great videos to post more who do you think will be the dark horse of the race hey benji im new to cycling used to watch the tdf a couple years back do you think they should add a power ranking and rider specialty to the cyclists the pcm looks awesome and learning the strategy seems intense but exciting i would not have a clue as to where to start but watching your series is quality for sure as to all the pcm ai concerns they should just make 1060 multiplayer rider lobbies human control cant be mimicked best to play against real people just made this others might find it interesting current power rankings by riders in the tour for 2019 httpsdrivegooglecomfiled1d7y5lhekbd2zgaftbvf0bu55cxskrjviewuspsharing july6th i have also the same bug with wanty you could settle the halvorsen notes of the sky team im missing todays episode of the adventures of benji naesen with adria nice try with valverde but this finish didnt really suit him im sure youll get a few stages with him though movistar may not be the best timetrial team but you also dont have many riders with totally crappy tt stats you may still surprise us hint rewatch your own video tutorial of how to ride a ttt about wanty now you know youre welcome for some reason this happens with wanty on every tour de france race it is a really weird bug hey benji i had the same bug with wanty group goubert on pcm 2019 on the mount ventoux challenge race the complete wanty squad suddenly was 20min back meaning that the complete squad dropped out of the time cut i hope that bug will be removed muur van geerardsbergen is too early in the stage you should put 100 form for everyone because landa has only 86 so you will struggle a lot with him i want the stage editorrrrrr benji do you know the sure date when we can download it is there coming another pro cyclist video i need it hello im french you can soustitres on french just found your channel through benji naesen great video keep it up this is the first time i watch one of your videos i gotta say ive never heard a native french speaker speak english that well you made a good effort losing that horrible accent most breakaways just fall in the end of a race i dont see a great importance on breaking away good to see someone doing a career with a wt team instrad of shitty homemade lets take a custom conti team to the world tour which they play for a season and give up good shit mate keep it going love it mate will be following mathews for wc in leeds it is so stupid that matthews and other green jersey contendors dont go in escspe groups in thst game juicy prediction would be shocked if alaphillipe does that tomorrow hoping simon pulls a 3rd stage win though 2103 that house disappearing you had so much of these glitches in the video day early matic carrick keane defensive midfielders at least thats the theory i agree we need to replace himanyway good pcm 19 vid im just getting into it myself before the contract interest bug put a halt to that duch and belgian teams use to be into classics thanks for the tutorial dg your tutorials definitely make it easier to get started with pro cycling manager if u recon a stage you will get 1 rcd on this day more questions since you say you have to change the objective to get the right time for the fitness peak will that effect the race that u wanted to make the peak for if i want to be in top shape for the tour de france but choose a later race because of the time it takes then u will loose the point for tour de france as an objective i think u get 1 point every day of the race as it is the objective but since you choose another race you will get that point to that race ouf bad explanation hope u understood u can do infinite relay well not quite u put everyone on mantain position apart from dennis then dennis will stay at the front great short vid last one im watching b4 going to camp for a few weeks thats unfortunate but im sure youll make up for it in the mountain stages with such a strong tt team i think you could set everyone to 1 second with tt skill 70 and a bad race day condition they might have slowed you down cheers cant wait for enrico this afternoon mitcheltonscott will win in real life i call it now in ttt you have to put them like 20 or more seconds otherwise you will finish it with a lot energy left thats the main reason of the time loss the only reason the fitness thing is op is cuz killrob is just to op at managing fitness you briefly mentioned mountain vs hill stat in the beginning can you explain when the game uses what stat knowing how the game works behind the scenes seems pretty important attentiveness is not that bad at lvl 3 you level up faster in october november december and january you barely race but with attentiveness at level three you get 240 points either way in my opinion there are not that many other useful skills to spend points on in general i do find that you can get to a very high level relatively fast im in the third season and i have 79 avg at 21yo it is a bit op on the other hand nobody wants to play 6 seasons just to get at a competitive level p great video as usual im going stream it in few min mc speck go go go d 2810 you always seem to get a skill point at every levelup at a certain level it stops giving you improvement of stats though then you only get the chance to choose an improvement every 2 levels or something i have problems with my pro career save game i renewed my contract with gazprom russian team and when starting the new season i experienced a game crash the game crashed as the new season was loading in and generating team calender do you have any fixes love ur vids 3 some great analysis and insight into the new game in this one good job killrobplays i shall be stealing much of this knowledge for my own game please help me out cant launch game i will pay anyone to help me with teamviewer or whatever which level of difficulty do you play i am italianthis career is perfect are you taking my idea of going for all the 5 monuments usually they dont give bonus of a breakaway in the first race but i dont think they change that but i guess not you are either dicky mcspeck or you are not beta testing the asscushion 3000 technology oblivion good feminist excuse me what the fuck whats the correlation 007 oh look how fantastic and different the start screen is oh wait it isnt its just reskinned 110 oh what else did they change the max rate is still 30 420 there are 8 potential levels in the games mechanics but only realistically the 58 are worth anything the rest end up at 70 peak avg or lower 1143 so they reactivated the spyglass hooray it has been deactive but not removed from the game mechanics since 2011 1456 wow i dont like the new profile images they look depressing enrico chivaldori is actually pronounced keyvaldoree haha looking eachother and get robbed a tip 85 maximum speed without draining red woow this rider potential is insane ahh im going to enjoy this to reduce the saltiness for this playthrough i think you misunderstand the hold position order the hold position order will only hold position behind every other order i think so at the end of a race the ai extensively uses follow effort and relay orders the effect of this is that your rider takes up position behind all riders with a different order than hold except get water i have seen that with an effort at 95 or so you might hold your position though might be wrong though anywhoo good luck cheers nev is it worth buying with sale and is it different from pcm2018 hi kilrob could you provide me with a link to the episode where you explain how you set your scheduletraining i cant for the life of my find it jagged alliance ohh my sweet childhood that looks perfect can you play mutliplayer once i wonder if deidrianna reitman shows up also i wish you could rename your helpers ice ivan fidel and kaboom maybe is it like you need 1 skill point for lvl 1 of the skill 2 skill points for lvl2 of the skill and 3 points for the lvl3 of the skill has baradouer always had that effect i thought is was a stat that only matters for ai i thought that skill would be overpowered when i saw it and given the level of fitness you managed to plan for it seems like they forgot to make the tiredness accumulate faster so that you would need level 3 in the skill to be a proper cyclist good start mate your rider seems like he will be crazy good with those potential stats happy to see the new game could do without the feminism joke though nice man glad that this is back which db are you using why rejecting that offer of bora everything is better than staying at cofidis since you werent using most of your team on mountain stages heres some advice on how to use each rider beneficially without making an inefficient train you want to have your four weakest riders protecting the four strongest until they drop away then have your two strongest protected by the two spare until youre left with your strongest domestique protecting your leader maintaining position at an energy that will drop you near to the back of the group on an early climb if the following descent is long enough for you to move back through the group at a steady rate on the final climb you want to have your energy just so it is blinking red so you stay relatively at the front at as steady a tempo as possible as for making trains you should not place all the riders in the desired position in one pause as theyll drop back looking for the wheel of the rider theyre set to follow and each instance of this has a chain reaction causing you to fall through the group this me are there gonna be a the chase this year bora is my favourite team you shouldnt use arodynamic positioning when climbing unrealistic not accepting bora because of the shirt looool nice vid are you planning on doing like a youth team road to glory career mode series does the vuelta have no sprinters lol how come it always are gc guys in front of peloton keep up the good work love your vids i cant understand why they removed slow motion sprint in 2016 if i remember now you have to paused to give orders in the past you could do it during slowmo sprint which was much more climatic and exciting best and most realistic leadout is to get train leader protecting the 2nd and to put the second at 85 power this is the maximum he can do without wasting red jauge most optimal cuz hell always stay at the limit and ur train leader will get at the maximum that makes the 2nd not wasting red so for keep the train when the first is exhausted u just turn the new leader of the train into protecting the 2nd the 2nd to 85 and u keep going on like this the goal is to have the train leader at the maximum possible saving the red jauge of all your train members there cannot be better cuz if anyone wants to go faster than you he will have to make his sprinter use red jauge which is a bad thing for him once ure about to launch the sprint u trigger sprint on ur sprinter no one else he will start the sprint being protected his leadout man will give him the acceleration while hes still protected and as soon as his max speed is reached u leave the protection ur sprinter will benji where can i find pcm 2018 database for 2019 nice play something that allways works for me on the champs elyses is making my 8 person train at around 30k your winner should be on 6th position the first two riders keep riding at around 88 untill they are gone one by one then 3 over 90 you should aim that your fourth rider starts 99 when it goes down the last time in the tunnel when he is finished the 5th rider can go 99 in the uphill part of the tunnel and at the same moment your 7th and 8th rider should drop a gap put them on following the sprinters this way your 5th and 6th rider can make a big gap your 6th rider i can manage it with nibali at the end of a grand tour will be able to do the last 25k by himself really cool to win this stage without sprinter and in the yellow i often put my sprinter in the 8th position so sometimes you can even make a full team podium anyway amazing work with these videos why is there no ineos team sea is nearly as good as kris run great to see riders trying to do the last kilometers like kwiatkowski in this video the game looks good i like it the other sprinters started way too early i hope its just a one time thing and not an issue with the ai i cant barely see the yellow line when its next to blue i dont like the breaks you make to adjust to situtions not realistic but every player plays different i play smooth great ride wout lol i wished herbert would speak again like he did in previous episode bummer rohan for the win is herbert using a twin lost count of the wins now even though the oppostion was pretty substandard the break away was lovely done that myself a few times now the pack chase then all of a sudden stop and they dont catch you think its scripted in somewhere along the line arent there any national championships you probably should have tried to do relays when the group fell apart usually the willingness of other riders is influenced by your participation its worth trying to relay for a while and see what the others are up to there were 2 guys that appeared to want to relay hi registred riders are linked with sponsor objectives registering your best rider madsen for all sponsor objectives will grant you 23 pluses so 50 satisfaction registering him for tour of denmark will give you 5 pluses 100 satisfaction danish rider danish sponsor danish tour so that tab is pushing you to building international team but of course registering some unknown french climber for parisroubaix will grant you nothing even if your sponsor is french you have tips for all sponsor tabs under that dropdown i heard you have no idea how it works sorry if i misunderstood database download great tutorial thanks a lot thanks man this video is much appreciated what a database you have beautifully done mate i honestly thought youd gone too late with sagan but you really timed it perfectly if only sagan could sprint so well irl p other guys will only do val thorens basically the last 59k of this stage outclassing everything quoi de la fuque benji i cant follow this pace of watching just great to see you back at it love the content thanks for this series when you choose teammates i do believe they follow the same training program as yourself which means that they get in top form at the same time as your rider if the vuelta is as good as the giro was were in for a wonderful ride i was sick the last 3 days and discovered your channel 37 episods in a row d thank you great progression keep going in my own pro cyclist with stats similar to yours i get dropped if i dot 85 on the final hill haha how do you do it man youre unbelievable you should try milansan remo next season my pro cyclist is 85 mountain 80 hills and ive won it three times by attacking in the final km of the poggio doing acrobatic descent and aero position into the finish definitely something you could do did you pick great champion in the beginning of your career and do you know how that choice affects the progress of a career because i cant really see it in my careers skills skyrocket regardless congratulations froome and the guys was like who the hell is this guy i t a l y i s t h e b e s t e s t lesson learnt never look at the comments before watching the video benji at 2650 you mention that you dont know who to scoutobserve here is a tip click the space button and see the names from your group after your team the first cyclists you see are the favoritesmain competitors so click on their name and scout themm the list is descending so top cyclist in the list is the main competitor what do you think about pcms decision to remove bjorg lambrecht from the game is there any way to play with him as a rider now what a career already damn crazy the thing is the competition was terrible only kwiatowski in next season you can win liege bastogne liege tour de france and lombardia if your preparation is amazing btw those attributes are so ugly what a win congrats man way to go benji great victory hi benji i live in the same town of trofeo matteotti gp matteotti and i have created the race on the stage editor same to reality if you want can i sand the file to you you are a world champion keep this series going its so good to follow cofidis better have a white shorts world champs kit what an episode congrats on that beautiful jersey and lets get more my pro cyclist which is malaysia didnt get to race world championship i think that you are using effort cursor too much especially on flat parts thiis is the reason why your rider lost a lot of energy however you have so high mo skills that you can easily beat riders with mo 7578 its essential to save as much energy as you can and working within group of riders and make relays love the videoes but the first thing you should always do is to maximize the attentiveness in personality because youll be able to progress your rider much faster whoah that bloke is clearly on epo plot twist they selected the wrong naesen oh fk cant wait to see you riding grand tour as a cofidis rider and in world champ jersey i would like to see you aim for the secondary grand tours so i thinks you should have a fitness peak for the giro and vuelta but its your choice sad to see it end if you would start a new save arkea samsic got a pretty cool grandtour lineup with quintanabarguil would be a cool rebuild its a shame that you stop the sunweb career mode maybe you can do a career with another team or a pro cyclist or are you gonna quit pcm damn it 28 away from catching it while it was in the century club youtube videos with fewer than 100 views does anyone actually play this game im watching these your continental team i really dont understand why you dont have a lot more views your voice is so relaxing to listen to and your videos are perfect is the game really that unpopular hmm i dont get this so a really good climber will run faster at 85 than 95 because his mountain stats are better than his hills stats is that correct understood this was what i was looking for what an awesome video i have like 1500 hours into the pcm series and this was still very informative i have a problem when i marked your worlddb 2020 subscribe it does not add it to my data list on the other hand it is on disk as a result i cannot use this database anyone can help me solve the problem thank you have you finished the pro continental teams you know what would be awesome to see if you could do the whole soudallotto and lotto soudal thing apparently soudal lotto is for belgium races and lotto soudal is for all the other races or maybe the other way around help me please i have a no steam version and i cant download it wait u are alive we need a free link out of steam to download it was already wondering where youve been good to see you back on track why dont you like isreal cycling team when was the last enjoyable pcm 2015 for me i stopped buying in 2017 great that there is a 2020 database now thanks for giving me motivation to play this shit game always the same every year nothing changes 0 realism when will you upload some videos from 2020 gratz on getting the caja rural contract is it me or did someone from the breakaway actually won in that final race not sure love that youre back but spyingobserving makes it kinda boring just an opinion tho keep up my dude great to see youre back solid work mate great attack to get almost a minute into the downhill too hey benji youre winning this giro easily well done how do you do your camera turns i dont mean with the numpad but the raising and lowering great video hope you can win your first grand tour very nice series just started watching but hooked already makes me want to buy pcm19 im repeating this stuff from a lot of videos in grand tours the time gap on flat stages is neutralized at 3km to go so everyone is on the same time if nobody dropped early unfortunately there was no pelotonsplitting magic in play this time it was just wind again on a more constructive note im really enjoying your videos at the moment benji but have you considered playing without pausing for me it helps increase the immersion and fluidity of the race was waiting for this keep up the good work benji ofcourse its demare time gaps on stage 8 that mass sprint win was hilarious benji the machine where you dropped bernal there was already a gap between his wheel and yours but his red ran out slightly earlier so that short extra burst you had at 90 along with your slightly stronger stats is what did it rather than the aero ability with the level youre at now short uphill climaxes seem like a foregone conclusion 1323 seeing the stage classification after genuine gaps between the riders st really cyanide aerodynamics is just insane 27 kmh on 7 climb dot 85 79 mountain rider benji is mad he won two in a row first what do you think about tomorrow 59 km long stage and bernal or alaphilippe off topic killrob can you let me know what database editor are you using to edit the contrat of interest bug i cant find any 2019pcm editors online nor in steam i dont see in tools the 2019pcm editor ending it after the tour sounds pretty good only if you win nicely done on final mountain stage why not you try to finish your pro cyclist by winning all the three big races giro tour vuelta the same year if you win the tdf im fine with you ending the series but would we get a new series bora career to replace it it would be incredibly boring for you but id love to see you try to pull a triple giro tour vuelta in one year dont mind if you finish it or not however please can you do another pro cyclist with maybe a sprinter afterwards if you do unrelated question does anyone know for certain if the barodeur skill actually does sth when you do not simulate a stage for me the joy in pro cyclist mode is the climb up the ranks once you are at god stats and you pretty much are already with plenty of stat bumps to go you are just so far above the rest that the game isnt challenging anymore in the slightest of ways especially once you count your skills you won the giro without a fitness peak but with basically 2 rdc against 5 rdcs and it wasnt close if you dont mess up it wont ever be close again that at least for me doesnt sound like fun content if you keep it going for too long i would very much like to see a standard career mode custom team continental start young talents for me that is the most fun i am having with pcm getting that first wild card once you went conti pro battling for those top 10 places etc seeing and competing in different kind of racesterrain is also a big plus a career mode is more work the planning calendar and stuff just takes time but i think it offers something more than just steamroll you seem to forget the world championships in your schedule i bet you will try to defend your title which would probably mean another episode already looking forward to it if you manage to improve your tt ability a bit you could attempt the double rainbow challenge look at which world championship route is used in the year youre in to look if you have any chance congratulations on winning the giro you should do whatever you yourself want to do in pcm everybody is always laughing at those hopeless attacks but you do them anyway and that makes for good content so do not continue your rider if you are fed up with him but start a new and interesting challenge but if you are still having fun then just continue him just do whatever you like and then i am sure the followers will also like your videos benji try to beat lance record of 7 tours with those stats you can easily win giro or vuelta but the tour is the tour good win gratz man you actually took control of bowman much later than you should which would have helped you much more if you increased his relay sooner the little details are the ones to watch out a few race strategy improvements still needed but youre improving cant wait to see you on the actual mountains i dunno if you can but one thing you need is to learn how to play the game first seems it is not the first game of the series you play and yet you still make some basic mistakes its not an accident that your cyclist is completely gassed out in stages where he shouldnt be but this is just constructive criticism from a veteran of the series other than that love the videos already subscribed and im hoping this pro cyclist series you are making lasts for as long as possible great work keep em coming will watch the video to find out how you do and will comment later hope you get that first win good luck m8 who are you im play this game but simulation days take time more than the time i played really missed you and your great videos its nice to have you and the series back the pcm legend yes finally hi benji i finished my procyclist career a week ago i m a bit cross cause i wanted to have higher attributes i think its a mess i think they had to raise the level up until you reach 85 on every feature wow i still own jersey here so glad youre back man but its understandable that this being a hobby it sometimes needs to be left behind you got what mattered the most which was to please your manager with the top 5 it wasnt bad at all and most likely froome and dumoulin had tirreno as a season objective seriously nooooo welcome back good to see you back on the road to glory are you sure the break in recording was caused by work or was it the mental trauma from the stage 4 blockings got to use the eel ability wait youre alive 100 youre kidnapped and theyre forcing you to do this is this real welcome back benji quality content once again it was about time yes fing finally its good to have you back dude welcom back man nice video like everytime its a miracle its nice to see some content again benji but work is always more important than gaming hi guys its benji here finally this might be my lucky day first the f1 race and then you returning finally your back wow didnt expect this one finally i and i think everyone here missed you mate finally thank you benji hope you will be much active good luck 1948 disgraceful from the worlddb team bouhanni waiting for a teammate is so unrealistic another great video also appreciate keeping tirreno and paris nice to separate episodes it really aids the continuity btw id recommend not steering riders in sprints as the ai is better at navigating around other riders unless youre completely blocked in nice race did you see what i did there a stage win and 6th in the gc are not bad at all a shame about stage 4 but that ending with porte was such a deja vu for me and pinot winning the race i already feel the pressure how can i get stuff like you i mean banners bikes discs wheels ec only sprint with teunissen in lead out and start that at 18 km the rest of your team just go 99 hi do you preper all fitness of all riders i am doing a carrer with jumbo and all my riders except importants are in low fitness in the tour i only preper the fitnnes for roglic kruisvick van aert groneweagen and de plus jajajaja isnt it way better to make a train of your strong riders in the last bit and let the bunch totally die sometimes i got the feeling that you dont attack in a very tactical way because u also want to ride for the gc of dennis just learning the game myself so correct me if im wrong nice vid nice for dennis he somehow managed to stay in top 5 d yor are saying it zarakin or i just hear it like that thats zakarin d zakarin instead of zarakin i demand you to review on my marvelous creations acm cars in beamng when you press the energy gel button you dont have the energy gel effect yet you need to wait for the gel to activate so try clicking the gel button a bit earlier for an example in the sprint click the gel at around 5ks instead of 2 the gel effect is very good so dont ignore it and try to time it perfectly i miss thos gamei had a heart attack and it stopped all my riding i miss it i see riders out and id never take away anything from thembut i sink inside i used to play this game religiously i really miss it i dont even know what requirements it would take to run it nicei dont think they are the same on a console benji trying to pronounce slavic names is so funny why is asgreen wearing the danish colours he is only itt champ hi is it just me that are struggling bigtime with this game first time playing the game so decided to play with ineos your update the planning page doesnt work sometimes riders are removed from planned squads for a race and if you make the mistake of changing teammates between bikers midseason you are screwed work ok until registration of second part of season 14 315 changed a couple of teammates now everything i plan is lost when i go out of the planning chart tried 2 times and everything is gone when i go back had some of the same problems in the first part aswell but this was ok after choosing riders one more time dont they test the game before release this is kind of basic stuff sad because the game is kind of greatbut this makes it not playable very very strong place 3 nice one and also compliment to radoslav rogina nice mate this game looks so boring which database you use for the new champions of the country good video youre eating your energy bargel too late and so its not kicking in if you eat it at slightly before the 5km mark on a flat stage it should kick in during the sprint at 900 you tell that you know that it will be the mountain which will matter for the stage how do you know if it is the mountain or the hill i never knew sorry for the bad english how do u open the profile map at large and slightly transparent like u often do i can only see it in the information window try to sign for jumbo if they want you good job benji i love this series i really like the the number 2 skill in the tecnique tree the aero dynamic riding on the flat if you for a attack on a hill and get a way and its flat afterwards when you are pacing very useful only drawback is you cant sprintanyway enjoyable episode highs and lows why arent you setting the pace for all of your riders in the team time trial no wonder you fell back since all your other riders had a automatic 70 pace which meant that they had more energy heres a tip the number 0 on your numpad selects all your riders and lets you set them on a selected pace at the same time about the observation you only have a very low chance of seeing the yellow and red bar with no skill points put into observation personally i have 2 skill points in it and now i get to see it everytime plus when i click it again i can sometimes see his fitness and daily form aswell i waited way to long for a world tour team to contact me in my 2nd season ended up on the same team for the 3rd season maybe use the willpower ability next time you easily could have won the mountain stage p why do i have no spectators while the race graphic settings are on in professional cycling on flat stages the time gap counts until 3km to go there is still no time limit fix for sprint stages why pcm why whitch workshop do you use future of cycling in the end the results you got in this giro were amazing but these final three stages were heartbreaking i really thought mollema had it loved seeing ciccone taking that win he fully deserved it phenomenal giro uran and mal were just too strong in the third week while mollemas form was slowly fading podium 2 jerseys and 6 stage wins great result hey joe i also make tdf content and have been inspired by your great videos to post more who do you think will take the first yellow jersey at this years tour de france can you please make a video how you explain how you do a pro cyclist mode with a real rider good vid oh man i really love de remco evenpoel serie sad story the new ui looks insanely good imo and the crash thing looks great as well nice video really looking forward to that tdf series will that be uploaded like the dauphine one with multiple stages in one video or one stage per day also have you decided on a team yet great sprint finally more sensible crashes as well eiking have the stranges card i have ever seen please help me out cant launch game i will pay anyone to help me with teamviewer or whatever refais des hors series ct cool hier puncher roglic normal i hear fuck stygro in the oreillette cartman is me in discord hi joe recently started to follow your channel would like to say something very quick its mads pedersen instead of pederson keep it up great aggressive riding at strade well deserved win 1518 chasing group getting the tow from two cars there the uci are sure to receive some outcry about from us trek fans more importantly though great win in strade just a shame the buildings were blocking the view a bit at the end its gravel not cobbles the strade bianchi parcours looks realistic af did you just use worlddb or another parcours wow you were on beast mode in this episode mate really strong performances and great tactics strade bianche was beautiful a shame about moschettis injury dont know if you were planning to take him in the giro because it might be too tight and even if he comes back in time his fitness wont be the best wow what a weak startlist for omloop must be a problem with the game beautifully done in strade bianche so excited for this series arkeasamsic for next series jumbo visma next please great great save and great series for next save i can suggest you education first i was just about to start following ill be premiering tirreno adriatico in the trek career tomorrow at 12pm bst would be great to see you there very entertaining race those final climbs were really intense loved it i saw the video only after the real race and when i saw mollema going away in the civiglio i just thought no fing way it would be beautiful had he won in your video by doing that now lets have that tirreno i timmsoski can you make a video or explain how did you get your helmets and bikes patch i cant find anything with pro xycling real helmets and bikes from 2019 best wishes maybe sprinting with bol i completely get the pain of missing to record those stages 4th is a great result and two other jerseys you did really well about the transfers go for buchmann definitely sunweb mainly goes for germans so id say you should do it as well geting buchmann would be cool and who has a 100 interest of the rider not in your dossier like fuglsang and valverde maybe there are some riders i would like to see on your team nice way of commenting love it i like this style actually the videos become much more fastpaced and keep you glued to the screen i enjoyed my experiment with catalunya in my series and got good feedback just as crossinho mentioned i encourage you to keep some of this mixed with the live comments about the races that stage 6 was weird with the other favorites just staying behind but maybe they were all simply energydepleted lets hope porte doesnt crash in stage 9 of tdf because he looks to be in a solid condition when will there come another future of cycling another race punching above your weight on gc i think the placement of riders in the break was good thinking especially with the lack of mountains support in that dauphine lineup as well as to secure a good result for mullen in belgium just as with mairaos postcommentary videos i didnt notice much of a difference whatsoever aside from the shorter watch time its the same great quality were used to my friend who does not watch cycling asked me who my favourite youtuber is and i answered benji naesen and he said who the hell is benji naesen you did okay i guess you basically lost the same amount of time as me in this ttt and i havent seen anybody doing really good so far did they make ttts harder this year still 19 stages to go so you can still get this 54 back jumbovisma didnt change their shirt for purely estatic purposes it is not allowed to ride the tdf in a full yellow team yersey the official team name remains lotto soudal only the positioning of the sponsor names changes i think yo benji have you tried doing a ttt with just the 5 best tt up top for the entire race i figured you only need 5 racers to finish so you might be able to get a better time out of just the 5 instead of using the 2 horrible tt ef jersey looks so bad in the game are you gonna upload pro cyclist as well today jumbo visma has more black because the yellow yersey and whiteblackyellow isnt nice hey benji i feel like something is wrong with the graphics on this one i dont know of it is just for me but i can only choose 180p or 360p benji i think this is going to be a stage where i just finish in the peloton 10 seconds later benji attacks with the whole squad and 5 times in finale himself mate thats where i study kahlenberg its beautiful up there lets hope the team you choose will get promoted to cwt you should look out for messages telling you about the teams budget situations and signings if you change the rate of the relay the pace button gets unlocked great videoooo congrats on 5k when i win stage how i can do celebrateing can you add the european champion jersey mohori should have this aerodynamic skill already in default what the team for bincbank tour i am hoping we will get todays alkmaar europens it would be a crashing festival again as it was in edinburgh for kom i think that they should reintroduce the double points for summit finishes however i agree with you that this years tdf was an odd one to say the least maybe it just shows how no one got an upper hand in the opening 2 weeks yes i am getting so happy everytime you are uploading a new video did someone say steve cummings troll please make this videos shorter there was a vuelta a columbia it was a 22 race i believe it got upgraded killrob do a classic climber procyclist and just take a look at his potential youll be amazed hoorah your back thought you had been abducted by cyanide i see that the the dumoulins were separated at birth and taken to different countries its the french veteran samuel doumolin hes retiring now and switching to vital concept as a ds he won a tour stage in 2008 please make some more career mode i love that series bro why you use rohan dennis to protect when there are riders like teuns that can do it dennis could rest for the last climb cheers how do you rotate your main camera ive play tdf on console for awhile now and this definitely wants to make me switch over to pcm so much more control and more indepth analysis mid race how do you have team ineos 6th is pretty good with valverde plus green plus kom plus i dont know how many wins that was a really successful tour now making a constructive critique i think you over did it in the pausing in this video i literally cant sleep as i have no idea whats up with benjis adria life great seriess too bad you couldnt reach top 5 thomas was lucky that landa had to give up otherwise you would have destroyed him great work benji how do you see so many supporters where do you do that in pcm you have so much control and overview on everyone of your opponents compared to tdf for console thats probably what makes me like this game so much even though i just play tdf this video already has 2 likes and its 9 hours until its out you lose your domestiques because they always ride in the wind just drop in the peloton and go to the front at the important moments why are you driving for evenepoel in gp de marseille mallorca may not be a wt race but it is used as an early season girotourclassics prep by a lot of them i know there is something bad in the game but you have to think about its a low budget game you make the game to easy by pausing it all of the time thats a good boost if only on a mountain stage benji we got this win in the bag also benji gets second on that stage so in gp kranj it might be better if you do not attack with 30k left you use a lot of energy and dont recover enough that it is worthwhile there is a reason the gc favs usually only attack on the last climb also this tactic worked for me in pcm 15 set the pace at 8588 and wear them down on climbs attacks takes out too much energy and just setting a high pace worked better for me transfer system sucks belgium rider with best mountain stats in game 4th season with 50 victories won some wt races like but no offer from a cya world tour team if you want to get away you need to go 99 because thats how fast their going to try and catch you why cant i stop watching your videos haha 1509 my name is on screen hi benji how do you use the buttons like sneaking for example theres a tactical move wich consists in blocking your opponent by putting yourself just in front of him when you see hes gonna take you over i know it looks bad but it helps d hahalost this onetoo fn schlegel try to not jinx it for your next races keep up this series are you going to watch the tour de france while it is in belgium 1615 my fucking teammate nice video benji i wouldve accepted the sport vlaanderen offer great career keep on going what a finish dumo vs ineos man i almost want to give you a thumbs down for you not giving the win to poor sam you wont need those 4 seconds you can easily control the race until the end but its you so i know youll keep the allout attack mode on you only want win with tom dumoulin i have a solution for the stealth tree first off it should not be amount of times being used it should just be once a race you only surprise someone once and probally the first time now it can still be 3 points first point you can surprise the peletongroup when there is more then 50 riders in the group second point 25 riders and last point 10 riders under ten there is no way you sneak away 12 but technique should have been split be able to pick downhill without the first two however actually all the skills need to go there is no need for this they should replace it with a skill that boost one aspect but punishes you at the same time so being able to pick how well you do in hot weather but have a penalty in cold weather another example if you want to have a higher fitness peak you can do this but you will also get an extra low when you lose your peak regarding points distribution i wouldve suggested they keep the 36 points and 37 levels however the skills shouldve been priced at 1 point for level 1 2 for level 2 and 3 for level 3 essentially its the same 15 points killrob suggested but it gives the player a feeling of a pointprogression at each level hey i loved this analysis and i do agree with almost everything you guys said i do however think that your take on the attentiveness skill is a bit off while it isnt very powerful initially it gets more value over time this means that if you plan on playing a long career over many years it becomes worth a lot more if you pick it early at the higher levels leveling up takes 300 xp and 1 point in attentiveness gives you 5 xp pr monthat highest potential which means that every 5 years you get xp equaling 1 level so 3 points means 3 extra levels over 5 years so if you are the kind of player who intends to play those long careers it might very well be worth taking its also worth noting that the xp from attentiveness is a flat amount while race xp have diminishing return both because you will no longer get the first time bonuses and also because the better you get the harder your objectives will become making it harder to achieve them at least i feel that its much easie where can i find the tutorial on fitness any links 2212 im sitting here at home nodding along thank you indeed willpower is bollocks right now im tempted to ramp up my tiredness for the laste couple races of the season just to be able to trigger the willpower that cant be right loved it u should definately do it more often d the stealth ability is not mentioned outright but its unusable at the 15km to the finish at least that is when i noticed the button being grayed out i dont agree with the fact that we cant see our own teammates stats from the start in a real team even if you dont know them the team has the information on what each rider is capable of and will pass that information to the other riders so in my opinion you should always be able to see your teams stats that or make it a toggle in the options menu to please everyone i feel like theres one argument for fitness peak that wasnt mentioned and its that extra days of the fitness peak usually dont cover the days that matter what i mean by that is if youre a puncher you probably only care about having your fitness peak during the 8 days of amstelflecheliege classics if youre a cobble rider you really want your fitness peak only on flandersroubaix which is also an 8 day period even for a grand tour rider having a fitness peak in the first week of a grand tour is not as meaningful since first week is usually only flat stages and you can get the rest covered with a 15 day base fitness peak 640 so benji thinks 12 points because it would look good in the skill window not because it would match the difficulty of the game be realistic or have any value to the game it just looks better not to have all skills lol killrobs argument however makes perfect sense collab of the ages really cool and interesting that you do a video with benji how do you get this camera angle you missed the decimation of the wanty team here worth looking down the stage result a little slower nice start so close at the end in the actual race there was only 2 mountains sprints i wonder how they ended up with 3 in the game you research what to play allot dont you cuz over time i have stumbled across your channel multiple times tour hype its better if you do a sprint train with about 5 or 6 of your team members that way you can get positioned in front of the peloton and closer to victory vive le tour get the juices flowing before the main event a little later can i update my db whitout restarting a career mode thank you thanks where i find the real names db hi benji i have difficulty to create new teams i dont know how to modify database and add sponsors could you do a tutorial about this ive looked for it on the web but the tutorial were for older pcm does anyone know wehn multiplayer is coming to tour de france make the accelarion off van der peol 85 hes amazing make all of his stats 85 please up the mod to pcmdaily for the people that havent the game in steam because we have it in other form xd there are no pictures of the runners what does the green bar mean on a cyclist so the database gets updated right if i start a career with the database and there is an update for the db will my career get effected already thanks pls upload more videos today of pcm 19 pro cyclist mode hey benji i wanted to ask you if pcm is playable on a laptop as well im watching your videos for some time past and i was thinking to buy pcm 2019 but i dont know if the processor and graphic card of my laptop are enough you can change the stats by buying it from steam thank you for the video benji the db is very good as always keep it up hi do you know if there is a db 2019 for pcm 2017 because i searched in the workshop but i found nothing thank you for your help nice i believe that its not extreme difficutly tho theres no way nobody attacks last climbs sorry nice one cagey stage but worked out nice victory but why are you killing the guys in the back with 85 pacing d they can rest up great job with this one waiting for the final stage serge pauwels what a hero if he could do that in rl than he was a big hero this was a strange one it didnt go according to plan but i think it turned out actually better you now have two guys who can go for kom and freaking pauwels for gc ai is so stupid yes new video dont follow attacks just go up a steady pace and dont sprint uphill use 99 dot from about 12 km out if your energy gell is active you can even go from further out great video again keeping the leaders jersey is awesome those final climbs are real nailbiters with your nervous commentary keep up the good work love it cheers dont count out bernal i played this giro with roglic domulin had a 3 min lead and bernal attacked on stage 20 on the penultimate climb he took away 6 minutes and an overall be prepared for stage 20 good luck hi on db 2020 there is an error in the calendar the tdf and the national championships overlap it is therefore impossible to play a career and a procyclist i repeat on flat stages the time gap is neutralized at 3k to go so if the peloton splits at 15 km example there are no gaps regarding time gaps most of the time its about the stage type that 30 sec gap would have counted on a mountain stage on flat and hilly stages the times are taken x km before the finish i think it was roglic who crashed during the vuelta 2019 might be wrong there during the closing kms he also didnt lose any time its the same in pcm even if you create a 10 minute gap in the last km of a flat stage it wouldnt count as far as i know no idea what the exact km numbers are though love those pointless attacks in leaders jersey benji never changes how do you zoom out in pcm ive been trying every button and in the keyboard shortcuts tab there isnt an answer either thanks in advance great stages mate ardilla looks dangerous so could be a close race hopefully the tt will do good things for you though this is cross hi benji you might know this but normally in pro cyclist you can give your teammates their energy gel by pressing i on your keyboard d these videos are so cozy to watch love them plan de corones is a gravel road as well and stage 16 looks insane this giro is awesome the long time trial could be the stage that wins you the giro you should use aerodynamic positioning in the last 34 km it helps you save your last bit of energy also using your effort curser instead of attacking is much more effecient loving the vids can you bring a live pcm some day when will a new future of cycling coming yes a new episode of my favourite series im spanish fan and i think tour channel it is amazing you deserve more subs keep going do you have the last stage of the tour of czech only 4minutes and the podium we follow darryl impey of mitvhelin scott kind regards p do you know if theres a greece national team in world db i want to create greek rider and i dont know if i can participate in world championship nice video hi benji nice video again i have a question how do you use the acrobatic button and de aerodynamic button here i am watching another video and thinking that it would be brutal to see a career series of yours with a weak team i started one with efapel im in season two and i would like to see you play with a team of that level to try to learn something with you it would be a bit unrealistic to get to 85 mountain before world tour so 84 is realistic ha jk can you do road to glory series with a continental team d that would be amazing just love it best series on youtube in 2k19 hands down 2055 ive finished my third season in pro cyclist and i still dont understand the progression of attributes at all it seems so random there are levels where you get almost nothing and then suddenly you increase your primaries by 5 points also sometimes one specialization is clearly better than the others for some reason i remember one level up where stage races and mountain climber increased the same stats but mc just gave more points ive had fun playing this mode but it was kinda weird at times i like your try and make a teammate win concept on the 2018 tdf xbox game in pro leader mode basically a worse version of pro cyclist i set myself the challenge of only controlling myself instead of other riders it did of course lead to me trying to win with other riders despite not controlling them i found that sprints were almost impossible but hilly and mountain stages i could win the issue was it was almost impossible to win any form of group sprint such as intermediate sprints and koms tour of utah is really hard yes another video of benji

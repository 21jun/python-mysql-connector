lookin forward to the release you have the perfect voice for these videos looking fine i have to say i hate to see videos about games i cant play myself i thought i could play the demo as well right now but then i remembered its tuesday today so i have to wait a full day damn those early keys people uses to present games earlier than releasedate i dont have problems with the earlier keys a day or two are okay but then restrict the videos from coming out earlier very nice writing for sure i love how the gaming community has embraced indie developers and how their games will sometimes be top sellers on platforms like steam and gog over the big corporate distributor games man i hope dangerously funny plays this as well the hacks great art style im interested to see the full demo im getting hyper light drifter vibes from this and im all for it cant wait for the demo hello there again 3 ive tried the demo and ive come nowhere near to beating that big spider can it be done i dont see how when i dont have the mobility due to the webs good video cant w8 for full game d thats a cool game o the style remember me a bit of jotun but in 16 bits and i do like a game with diferent classes and playstyles xd dude you are so rude to her try not being so bossy you sound like a prick i feel so bad for her you must be a handful yeeeesssssss so glad the beta is out whhhyyyy i just told you not to he whined even though she had attacked before he finished talking wow yassss was really waiting a long time to see you play again this game in further development stage im so happy and i will say like you wander i think its one of the most beautiful pixel art game ive seen so far 2230 i would like to see more games were players kinda have rolls in their team if a beta is a partial complete realize would that mean a beta demo is a de this game is diablo with an interesting world and gorgeous graphics this game looks dope god the graphics are gorgeous the characters remind me a lot about old point click adventure games and the world looks cool too sort of post apocalyptic with ancient tech unfortunately the demo ended yesterday so this is a bit of a cocktease i just love that game waited so long to see u play it 3 nanananana bergsons bergsons xd couldnt resist style is on the level of hyperlight drifter i would call this a roguesuperlite instead of a superroguelite makes more sense that way right stick aimed autofire interesting thats so cute this looks amazing graphicallystylistically hope that it comes to consoles eventually will you play religion reminds me of stanley parable you should do another dd campaign ive recently started one myself and its just the best idk know why but this really makes me think of diablo but also weirdly a game called sacred citadel will you ever play the best rougelite minecraft the art looks a lot like hyper light drifter super fun though once you beat the boss the beta starts over completely tutorial etc wish it would go back to where you left off before that but i understand they want it to be limited for demo purposes first i know its pretty common for fantasy settings to use realworld names but something about kevin always makes me laugh this is such a beautifully designed game though im looking forward to the release 1710 that water so beautiful the question iswill the game have replayability i love the family aspect i can think of so many party rpgs that would have been better if the party was a family baldurs gate for example thx for the video how move in this game is possible move with mous because i dont like wasd movment hi vulkan i hope you are having an awesome weekend and i thank you as always for great coverage i think this looks great all around i love the idea that this is the tale of a family david eddings belgariadmalloreon instead of the ragtag group of travelers you mentioned you felt like the main character in a wonderfully narrated fantasy novel that right there is what perked my ears up i will be keeping a close eye on this again thanks for the great content and cya soon look great but i would rather play something like this on my phone i dont have a monster pc to play phones games on it i like a challenge will the game challenge me ill give it a go looks like funbut when it comes to consoles do you have any idea when it could come to consoleim currently playing div orig 2 and chaosb as my arpg looks really nice i love this game so much i cant wait for the release you kinda mislabeled the game though by heart its a rouge lite the game also wont have loot because its a rouge lite you die you start over from the beginning with a small progression system in the form of a gold sink and the skill tree i for one am super stoked about this game as i have been since i came across it several years ago definetly gonna sinking a crap ton of hours into this when it gets released i saw wanderbot playing this for a short series but it wasnt available yet so stoked it is free a pretty dam cool little title looks similar to dragons crown aesthetically but with more arpg based combat is it coming to consoles looks fun might check it out also morta means dead woman in portuguese looks pretty good love the waterbased graphic style its a cool game most likely pick it up great review vulkan been waiting for this nice game looks like you were using the green gemstone things to purchase items from the shop ive been playing this a bit too not sure how i feel about it im definitely not good at games like these but i keep coming back to it so i guess i like it though i also think its kind of meh they extended the free demo through the weekend in case anyone still wants to play it i had the same bug as well man good video i feel like this game could use 4 more skill slots though combat seemed a bit repetitive but maybe im thinking more of something like chronicon instead of a traditional twinstick like isaac where you just have 1 or 2 attacks anyway you are earful at games and what makes you think you open boxes with your skill points did you even read or pay attention to the games tutorial section crom you need to get as much gold as possible trust me on this one the more you upgrade perks and stats your char and soon entire family will benefit from it more health and attack as well as money find is needed badly also try to get as many accessories as you can they will be valuable on the long term looks cool i am sooo far behind on your videos i am so busy sad to be missing out this game is amazing looking foward for the release holy shit why are you so rude man you was so egoistic rude to your companion just keep saying what she do wrong or what she can do etc its a new game but better have old friend please be more of this when is part 4 comming damn those game crashes thats a major issue when ya lose that much progress it should at least do a temporary save the second you get to a new floor if that shit keeps up while you were talking about stingy health there were three pots right behind shells character ya coulda broken open to look for some btw that was sad but i like the game the looks are really interesting and the gameplay looks fun and chelle seems to be doing pretty well all dashing into the front aside d just a shame that you doesnt get to do dialogue you guys did stellar with furies and aegis could you cycle through the mural text a bit though i am guessing there are about 3 texts for each you should recommend her to run infront of you and aggro then go back a little put down the decoy and go behind you about 6 sprites behind you then start unloading cause she throws faster and do more damage the longer she attacks if the enemies are weak there is no need for a decoy but this formation pulls the enemies into a line and the the sword attack hits all of them with the knock back and then her fireballs kill them before their attacks hit you if there are ranged attackers you run past the closer enemies and attack them this pulls them after you and she kills them from behind before most reach you this works best when you can move backwards into a corridor which you should do cause running to far into into a huge area pulls all the enemies really sorry to backseat i just noticed she wasnt using the decoy much at all despite it being so useful to pull most enemies away from both of you rest in peace progress you will be remembered for all the hardships you gave us the looks good but all the crashing very very bad hope this is only alpha state with all those crashing first one here this game came out of nowhere with fucking awesome artwork story voice actors fun gameplay such hyper light drifter vibes waiting for you to start coughing blood this looks fun d this looks fun d pretty sure rea was playing the violin backwards lol im happy to see an iranian studio make a good game i wish i could play this game but my laptops too broken now to do it va reminds me of darkest dungeon and it gives me ptsd from the game of course the archer would play the violin you play it with a bow is that the voice from darkest dungeon this game looks really cool i love the voice over when it comes to these type of games normally make us read it i also love how its called children of morta which means children of death they should totally play fat princess adventures on the ps4 together its really fun 20th for no particular reason the enemies dont trigger traps but still take damage from them this is a pretty kewl game hope to see more dudes the stumpt bros playing again yeah old style games how i miss them dang this is intense this game looks awesome so spoopy cant wait for the next video 1 closecombat fighters ministun enemies on hit 2 without shield john swings faster and has a bigger arc 3 skill rightclick with johnthe swords its one of the best abilities in the game now that its rereleased could u revisit castle crashers and i dont like saying this but could u please like so stumpt can see gotta love them team fusion videos rick and price are the best also this game looks very interesting and cool im looking forward to more episodes of this series please finish this series does anybody know what does that mean 1 like an extra tree in the rain forest im the first one hear its local co op only thanks for sharing this game with us its so beautiful i still enjoy every single video on your channel keep up the good work i love your stuff man please do more of this game this game is amazing but its criminally short loving your children of morta playthrough keep this playthrough going please the point in revisiting dungeons is to collect items for side quests like gathering ingredients to heal the pupper someone more popular than me tell splatt he hasnt played as kevin definitely looking forward to getting this game must have more deploy the crevasse boogie great game great narration need more thank you for this series splattercat love the game hey splatty been a fan of your content for a while now first came to your channel with your playthrough of the children of morta demoearly access which i loved youre absolutely charming im kind of blown away by your roguelike skills really enjoying this latest playthrough of children so do please keep it up lots of love t y idk about the later bosses but the 1st area is so easy that i literally kill him in like 10s ps the divine relic is the best relic imo you can deal 500 damage basically 1shot a stack of mobs without taking any damage splatty love your videos and id love to see you play through this game dont forget to use the item to take its effect please keep it up iv almost beaten it but i wanna see your reaction to the story and bosses please do more of this my dude you can use skill points from character selection just select the character then go to skills charms last forever during the current run unless they say temporary you can activate 2 of the same charm they stack ive had 5 active at once with 2 at x2 play lost trenches in caeldippo caves to unlock more for book of rea i found 5 in there on different runs play silk caverns in cealdippo caves to find the portal go in and chase the bird try not to die get egg used for resetting skills tree lots of elites and enemies did the puppy turn into the brother the naruto run on melee guy is awesome keep it up spatt good times this looks great hopefully gets to the ps4 soon so disappointed this game doesnt work with the ps4 controller looks like a decent game then again it doesent have enough innovations to stop me from thinking why not just play path of exile instead if i had not played tons of poe already i would probably enjoy this one ps yes i know its a pixel art game and the skill tree is different etc but poe is just so much more complex that this one looks like a mobile game clone in comparison full play through more please so much money left laying on the groundmust be nice to be so rich you dont need it looks great more please fyi the bruce lee fighting sound is not bruce lee himself full playthrough please is it me or does the sound effects for killing enemies and collecting money sound alot like diablo great game the narrator has an amazing voice damn nice gameplay tho first time im seeing this game ty ty yea loving this one splaty d you need to use the gemstones to pay the merchant thats what hes asking for 23 gems enjoyed watching you both i found the mouse and keyboard works well for the archer when it comes out for real i would love to see you finish the game it might just be me but is the narration a little soft great game but the puppy wolf id like to see if it makes it it looks really really good nice one really enjoying the story interesting gameplay well done that was a very nice gameplay d nice indie gaming man while about a month late a good example of a roguelike that you two have played would be a robot named fight since the closest thing it has to meta progression is unlocked items for future runs im really happy to see this game back this looks so good plz show me more as an average height man with extremely small feet i take offense could you weave the theme of a family duty like the bergsons into a dd campaign i clicked as soon as i saw the video omg the pixel art and animation of this is amazing i love this series and hope you continue making videos xd 042 how i feel about every superhero movie accept it and be a boss wander can you play astral chain its good wander i know you have several games going at once right now but ashes of oahu just came out its a bit janky but i was wondering if it was on your radar at all sometimes i really get curious about how wander and chelle record these videos together because sometimes they sound like not being so close to each other and that make me curious about that edit 1848 is like when playing crypt of the necrodancer and the shopkeeper sells a ring that give discount on shops or he sells a coupon that allow you take one item free and they are normally cheaper wandercan you go watch your last gibbus a cuthulu adventure cuz i wrote something that took like 10 minutesthx bruh how do you pump out this many videos a day looks interesting enough for me to go back and watch the first episode coop mode is only supported for two players and as goes for the online coop i dont think that exists for children of morta im pretty sure its only local but i could be wrong really a cool looking game well played nice gaming have a beautiful weekend very nice video my friend thank you this game is very pretty interesting demo of this game mate total watch supported you got our like thank you so much for your demo gameplay haaaa looks like a fascinating game yeah u r so right

between pages a place of unimaginable beauty hurgh heurgh i played this for the first time last night great game reminds me of beyond the beyond i keep seeing you two when i search for indie games so i guess i should follow looking forward to children of morta its free to play in a short time in steam gods this is a beautiful game hey wanderbots i know this is a fairly old video but just seen this is coming out of the switch soon cant wait to pick it up is this game ever coming out just tell me when please or you know what take your time with this game and make it wonderful experience i am really looking forward to this is this game still under production so long since i heard of it and such potential when will it release local co op wow thats def a buy right there i hope none of it is procedurally generated i love the hand drawn pixel art look but pg would start to look repetitive check out eitr if you like games like children of morta aesthetics ok ok when you got the shrine and the family thing this game went from hey this is pretty and kinda cool to damn this game is really cool holy hell im in love i kinda dont want to see anymore until i get my hands on it the health bars look like cookie monsters yeah there was a satchel on the ground they could interact with and both of them walked right by it this looks great cant wait for it to be released dont take too much damage dies immediately wat welp i had this thng on my wishlist forever since i really liked the graphics but the controls look so weird it also looks like hyperlight drifter btw continue your fucking sentence there got it out of my system sorry i have seen the trailer for this game and i am excited i want this game so bad wander it looks so good im glad you finally did a playthrough of this please keep it going you have achieved wolf pup hey wonder dragon quest is on the switch now and there is a demo as well look forward to seeing you ave fun when is it going to be released closer to christmas in the first level in coop before the pup there was a wall that was kinda shimmering i think secret room reminds me of hyper light drifter at least at the beginning man this game is real fricken cool never would have even known about it wihtout you thanks wander whooo nice im hyped for this i really want to see you cover more of this game it looks so cool when it revealed the underbasement sanctuary at 1440 i nearly screamed because its almost identical to an idea of my own for a fictional story ive been working on for years i swear the gaming companies must have psychics on their payroll 1207 in there is a typo in the description of divine relic powers they spelled time as tiem reportbug i was hoping to see someone cover this so jealous you get to play this this looks far better than the trailer youve convinced me ill give it a shot how did you decide on the helmet guy for your channel icon morta means dead in portuguese just to know is the volume lower than usual for this video i had to crank up my pcs volume quite a bit to actually be able to hear things edit ok the video is fine it was apparently related to me having messed with the attenuation option in discord which for some mysterious reason just lowers the volume of things all the time instead of only when people are speaking on discord i am buying this games just for the narration looks prettier then hyper light drifter ever played that i want to play this game soooo badly theres some amazing pixel art games coming out this year hopefully this alongside crosscode is what im looking forward to the most when he missed the object in the woods at 955 it hurt my soul especially since no one in his chat mentioned it what happened to your views you had a lot more during the fallout series ur the best love your vids wander btw have you heard of breath of death iv and cthulu saves the world if your ever out of rpgs to play those are some fun indi titles your constant i have a certain way i rush and do things please stop doing things a different way unless i tell youits okay is infuriating wait did the ui change between episodes irt late at night and the white screen when it crashed hurt my eyes yo your girlfriend found all the quest items dude wow that crash echoed through the digital world oh golly its runtime erroramon 503515 concerned that you arent nice enough to shelly morta is the name of the mountain that they live in you keep mentioning the map too her and you arent even paying full attention too it you are rushing and missing a lot please slow it down that trap thing sounds like it was made for wander im binging this series need more episodes lol keep up the great work the mother looks pregnant to me wander just relax and look around you rushing to your death isnt why we are here just like the others have mentioned you had missed out a path and even though you are the tank you are also the dad please stop sending yourself to the grave before your daughter thanks ive got a pretty good sense of direction he says as he misses a section of the cave in the top right d this is such an amazing looking game you sure do like to rush in

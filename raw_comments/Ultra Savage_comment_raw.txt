wander the best part is whenever she sneezes like that and i say gesundheit she always makes this like weird mao noise afterwards its great shes embarassed embarassed chelle is peak chelle me that is the most anime i have ever heard a real person be described like wander quickly followed by mildly indignant chelle me i stand corrected first he reminded me of broly from dbz than with the seccond world and the gear he was wearing it reminded me of fist of the north star and with the training robe he kinda looks like ryu also he has a bit of jojo feel to him gallafall may be a reference to gallifrey of the doctor who series but could be also a bit too far than a hole water worldand there was also a rough wastland world might be an attempt to imitate the movies max paine and also water world darn it i completed great heros beard after you showed me the gameplay now i must out of free will do the same for ultra savage and spend a whopping 239 on it and have another 24 hours of joy from it spending it could take a couple of days me personally i would love to see you get back into the dd play through us and campaigns and speak for myself even though i probably dont wander what was that rpg you say the devs who made this created you just keep filling the bar even if its already full why you should just about fill it get the power then sell the rest because the bar cant fill beyond whats shown i dont care about strategies im going allrounder its effective for me your overstuffing your fusion bar feed it till it is satisfied the power up then use the extra junk to feed your fusion bar more this was very lol i really hope you continue playing this game even though time is your biggest enemy whoa wanderbot has now become beefyman of the wander star supreme this reminds me of the fist of the north star the ending was real coll dddddd this game looks amazing i dont personally like this but for whoever like this or if there is anyone then you should make more for the other fans or yours 145th view absolutely love this game already great heros beard is the previous game from this dev that looks almost exactly the same ill be keeping an eye on this for sure hey lazee can i ask you a thing when you use an auto clicker what do you use i use op auto clicker and my is not so good yours is better pls help oh and love your vids i was the 126 sub d love your vids keep up the good work hope you will be have 10000000 subs d this game on xbox first umm lazee howd u get the speed up cuz i dont have it and time skipped 4 times i finished the game tho but nice to see you playing a little advice is max out the 3 first passsive and meditation i found after 12 time travels i started focusing life and yingyang to about 5 and going fury i havent been playing super strike or really any active skills i used tornado earlier to help on the bigger mob packs but once i was able to get enough early stats passives just destroy i found going heavy aspd and str early then getting hp and chi aspd on gear im at second to last planet at moment 4 phases into it and its been a decent strat i think i should be able to get to final planet tonight maybe one or 2 more time travels keep up the vids its a cool game ooo ya super pro tip lock any gear u dont want to sell lol it sucks when u clear out upgrades by the bag full remember to put on 2x speed if you had it on im sorry on mobile cant see if its on edit oh nvm you turned it on this is such a good game and video ultra savage is pretty cool first i recommend to you to max out hp and def stat first both capout at level 100 and then investing in offensive stats this method brings you the first 1015 time travels way further than ur strggle i made the same mistake in the beginning too still no fury cmon man lol keep at it time travel time for sure earring comes around the next worldish the bottom slot comes with costuming where u can set a piece of armor u like the look of and that will be your appearance no matter what armor u have in the chest slot i personally enjoy the dragonball gt orange and green grandmaster robes u get later on keep smashing worlds this on mobile max stat is 100 would recommend to farm even more offline d you will need about 10 time travels and the needed level increases every time edit try out a run after time travel with full attack hp and the first 3 passives first and you can just klick the max roll on enhance to go max upgrade in one go dont forgett that the weapon dmg doesnt do anything for your dmg just get a good one with a lot of crit crit dmg and attackspeed have fun make more idle heros videos please thank you first comment already know ill love this episode before ive watched it new update new world max travels to 30 now so i got a couple more to go arena gives u enhancing points if u win hey llama d glad you went the str hp way there was an update to get all stats to 120 as well and some other stuff btw you should get the passives first 1st 2nd 3rd then the revive thing and after that just maybe the heal on kill but i would then go for the berserk mode for the arena i have no clue what thats for or at least if you have done all normal bosses there is as far as i have seen a extra boss in just farm more timetravels d will be a lot of time edit nearly forgot that the sword ist just a stat stick ignor the dmg on it always get the crit crit attackspeed hp dmg or something like that on it no mention of bone princess there in the background of the skeleton red light district i think ya should play more hades its next update is out right since the last time you played it wanber have you thought about doing another dnd campaign first one who commented hello oneshark i want to ask you somting can you take esgrima2 off kongrate and fix all bugs in it and put it back cuz i am relly sad becuz pepol are now despret and get money scamed becuz they are trying to sell class that is buggd and some pepol scam money from them i buy it i will do a review son in goku ultra instict d will buy it great heros beard was a blast this one look like its on steroids edit just bought it idk why but watching your viedos make me sleepy like i could see through the 3 next video youtube make me see even if i said it not to i would love another dd campain on your channel ooh webcomic yes but i wonder if you could have the main character sort of be a modern day american twenty something that was really kindhearted and really lazy and patient a problem solver and could figure out how to put together something without instructions to an extent and always both really low stamina and easily ache for days with any effort and has a sleep problem that is treated with a cpap machine with very specific settings where he suddenly finds himself in the middle of a fantasy world in the middle of a massive pit where every single class and race of characters and many dragons werewolves and very much dead phoenix birds totally all dead and unable to be revived with some magical artifacts and arrays around glowing very brightly and by the time he even realizes what was going on the fallen into madness person that was trying to make himself an sort of ultimate and well rounded overly powered being dropped dead fueling the entire ritual since the guy had been born heyo wander not sure if you really read the comments on youtube very often but regarding what you were talking about in this episode i have a really cool idea based on what you were saying not sure if you really know anything about his content but many a true nerd made a fallout based choose your own adventure through the medium that turned out pretty fun the main difference yours could hold is youtube polls for the viewers to choose what the next scene you create be possibly throw in some voice acting by you and chell for it and i think it could be a very unique and fun idea i have that same nightmare but instead of remembering about it from a report card i would always remember it on the finals day and have to make a frantic effort to learn a whole semesters worth of material in a day whenever i wake up from it i instantly worry i am forgetting a class this semester until i realize i havent been in school in the better part of a decade they are no robo naziesthey are a highly sufficiant incorruptable and strict police skeleton force wich was trained to prevent the fleshys trhread to the population first to claim first because yes super land ep 3 is missing please fix is it bad that im only here for wanders storys my view on college is so jaded the only truly horrifically hard classes was literally the 2 remedial math classes 7th and 8th grade math i had to take those 3 times each and i only finally passed those because i ate up all the extra credit and not because i knew how to do the maththe downside here being i am effectively locked out of a bachelors degree because i cant do high school algebra and not because i cant do bachelor level work lol every other class including ones in my own major and electives i was beyond baffled how anyone could find the content hard to grasp or meaningfully engaging and was constantly surprised at how 60 of the class struggled while i was just goofing off and lightly flirting with everyone lol youre overlooking the obvious wander your biggest advantage was that you were more dedicated and had a greater interest in actually studying than those people whom you claimed were better than you they may have had more raw talent but in the end that counts for nothing if you cant stay focused long enough to use it for anything could this be considered shadow boxing oh boy here we go again another shit game jehs this is beyond crap great game the ability is 12 seconds but you have sped up the game x5 so it seems less also the shield reduces not stops damage and the percentage is basically the amount its reduced the damage by im looking for a new series to start watching should i start this series or idle heroes as for the ability it probably doesnt last 12s because ur not at 1x speed also theres a percent when levelin up because well what else would it level up the percent is the amount of damage it reduces if u progress far enough u can clear a full run with shield active you definitely want it maxed for last clear depends how far u wanna go keep at it for the first clear anyhow i played it right through till tt 30 and theres nothing else to do but ya long story max passives run 3 active why only 1 like come on guys support lazee more i have a new idle game thats called idle zombies u can play it if u want lazee i have been watching you for a few months so i think a little criticism is alright youre doing fine with the games but use your head a bit more you said it doesnt last 12 seconds well of course it doesnt cause it is set at speed 5 it also doesnt help that it is a active skill i know you want to get through the game quick but we dont mind if you slow the game down keep it going man this series is great i wanna see you destroy that next planet since as of right now youre getting slaughtered lol fast and fury lol i havent opened this for abit apparently a new world update coming with possible new skills maybe some new build ideas for clears good stat plan hp needed to break through strongest man office one shots and most definently final fight phases i run into that glitch all the time how did you manage to fix it sometimes it was so bad i would have to restart the pc when episode 14 still waiting play more idle dice and look at my comment on 3 of idle dice well i finished this game yesterday d youll need 20 items for end game and yes atkhpcritchanceatkspeedcritpowcharm dont throw your points in def no sense 100 points in armor 20k armor when your items 20 give you 23 mln armor those 20k just useless trash o k what state r u in because it was uploaded in 3am for me pretty nice those necks are one of the first bigger upgrades sometimes i would go 12 on upgrades they dont cost much and can get u past a stick point to farm they added a skip on that last update so as world 15 become farm straight past u can actually go to the higher worlds without clearing the lower its kinda nice since there is nothing u will use on those keep grinding im still working on my way to 30 then ill stop lol maybe they will add more but who knows nice first again 3 videos ive been first for this week i could oneshot me looks down punches self in face dbz halflife httpsyoutubeyjmyschoow played it for years better than the newer released dbz games one of the biggest problems for the stats is there is a damage floor ie enemies will always deal x amount of dmg to you no matter how high def is pumped and the enemies hp scales so much faster compared to your atk that the encounters boil down to being an hp check its good to have your def high so you are always making the enemies deal their minimum dmg but after that it is useless is the gameplay sped up why is the dude autopassing levels come on im using all rounder strategy its good to have things balanced rather than focused on only 2 stats tip selling items individually is more effective than selling your whole inventory try a seagrams escape wine cooler my favorites are jamaican me happy the peach one i cant remember the name of yeah zero health regen is what was making it not as easy as last episode i also really dislike bitter flavours and taste the biterness of alcohol in p much anything which is why if at all i drink with higher volume and i was recommended limoncello by the barkeep of my trust which is a lemon liquor that is supposed to be sour and slightly sweet with no bitter at all maybe you could make something out of that i also really dislike bitter flavours and taste the biterness of alcohol in p much anything which is why if at all i drink with higher volume and i was recommended limoncello by the barkeep of my trust which is a lemon liquor that is supposed to be sour and slightly sweet with no bitter at all maybe you could make something out of that that one punch man reference tho i hate this planet i gotten so stucked here for so long yesterday i had something really goofy happened i have maxed out the chance for reviving and literally my guy revive his way to victory i was just looking at him and been shocked that this worked consecutive normal punches one punch man reference lol i love it in means of drinks im more of the sour taste or sweet than bitter a good applecider never fails me though this is actually called a game hahah consecutive normal punches is deflenty a refrence to one punch man lol what kind of weard games do you play man its getting wearder by the day that looked like the uniform of the justice worriors of universe 11 from dbz first of everything how can someone put so much effort into obviously bad gameplay what vision did they have there is no way a good story can prop this crap up looks like someone put one of the newgrounds flash game on steam if you enjoyed the video dont forget to leave a likecomment subscribe for more you should play fury survivor pixel z its a mobile zombie game with rpg and loot hunting aspects good spot to grind on at beach and pillar for abit i believe at that point was another stopping point and a time travel making progress though still only at 3 travels so along way to go keep at er the little optional levels on each planet arent meant to be beatable your first few times seeing it also grinding out levels doesnt do nearly as much as grinding out time travels because eventually youlld time travel around 10 times and have 100 stats and 40 skill points for free definitely loving this series i think you should make the episode a bit longer tbh it goes by way too quick and i think that it wouldnt hurt putting a little bit into hp too bought it today no time travel yet level 112 and stuck at turboncromania last map even farming the map before that didnt helped after 2 hours getting nearly 1shot way way heavier d glad its simmiler to great heroes beard oh and i went full attack and hp hp and auto heal skills first passive first was so much butter than i thought and you can increase the gameplay up to x5 and im on like the 7th time travel i didnt understand how you fast forward it some progress today couple travels and youll have a great start of stat and skills to blow through the first 4 planets id start going to chosen ones fury as soon as u can the damage speed boost is great to hammer through keep after it its a fun game to spend some time in here and there i always max str speed first but when u get enough start pts id start dropping maybe ten into hp for the synergy with life recovery current build active medi 10 fury 10 cspirit 10first 3 passives plus damage speed modifiers all max higher power and fury duration also max lev 184 at moment looks coll i look for aspd atk hp as a go no go crit pow is nice aswell grindcore def is useless dont put any skill points into it fucking trash more please always do face cam please next time travel dont use atk spd just think about it every lvl the next level of atk spd just gets worse and worse because its an additive bonus while both dmg and hp are an exponential increase please upload soon again i still love this series d you gotta try fury aswell this round believe me fury and max fury time is win wanna see you get that final world gg grinded out a full clear yesterday wanted to push as far as i could no gear no fusions made it to the ship first phase was kinda fun next travel isnt till 199 now so im pretty much maxed but ill prob grind it abit more till everything is maxed full keep at that grind once you clear super fast its pretty sweet first bet you wont pin he pinned it you def dont need any actives besides heal and shield but ive done a couple full level end game with some different builds keep at er the one thing i do think is pretty key is grinding after the time travel is first available but once u get a few insta deaths type take the travel and redo enjoying the vids as u play through im just grinding travels to max everything and insta kill the final stage lol its still fun i still keep finding some new legendaries and such and just max upgrading i dont time travel until fusion is hard and i cant push any farther hey lama just a little tipp you can go 5x speed and farm offline more since this game takes tons of hours farming i know you dont want real advises but you will get items with way more stats that are way higher and with every time travel you get more enhance levels so you should grab more hp edit the weapon doesnt increase your dmg only the shadow dudes dmg he doesnt get the attackspeed and crit that you get just get a weapon with good stats the damage is not importent for your dmg you deal way more just get good stats like always have fun keep going with the series until you beat the final planet as its enjoyable to watch u play games like this prob grind off cam get above 100 push some stats and get to the last world at least i feel you are resisting the chosens fury but u should give in to its power lol keep the vids comin i love this series well i gave the infos in the last videos have fun only do atk and hp also dont put any points into anything else besides those two until 100 besides maybe 510 points in chi first love the series you should keep going i love following you along with the vid dang bro you got wrecked at the end lol hey llama d just to make things sure for you the blade dmg is absolutly useless your charakter deals tons and tons of more dmg so just grab one with hp crit atacksped crit dmg farm the last possible boss legendary loot possible when you are stuck go full attack hp until they hit 100 both then get attack speed and crit up armor you get from the items later on the game will show you when you need the stuff and get the passives done first defhp self heal then the attack one with each time travel you unlock a passiv or active skill you will need probably 1520 time travels to be able to kill the boss and those require eacht time more levels done hf and gratz to 10k subs thats the shit i like 10000 subscribers congratz ya strongest office will do that until u farm up u can move onto the next world and farm the first couple or drop down one need that hp first how can you ride on this roller coaster dont u be skere hah a stylish way to get bbqd in a forest fire didnt think about that one lol this is so unrealistic no theme park is going to build a rollercoaster that takes 6 minutes to ride the que for this ride would be tooooooo long how did you get all the trees in every video ive watched them all i would just make the coaster because i am not that good at sceneryp 33729th here oh im late this is so satisfying seeing it move so smoothly dang thats a lot of trees youve never laced buddy is this a gersouer or a intamin i actually just watched this for 2 and a half minutes how do you hide the camera section right under can you pay me the game when will you learn to build a good and realistic coaster just watch some povs and learn the different models and what each one does please make ur coasters more compact and dont just shove a million trees in its way theme it better that was great another job well done yall should check out dragonpuffstuduos are u almost done with the golden rollercoaster i really want to see it hey i have a friendly suggestion for your channel here it is actually attempt to learn some physics instead of just extending the pieces to max length and making simple hills and turns and then slapping on some prebuilt vertical loops that is really one wild roller coaster 754th view 0th just throw your hands in the air and wave them like you just dont care cool you should name your channel buckle up i dont know what am i 1st no 10 no 10000000 yes 6th apparently hook

awesome imagine skyrim vr but combat and damage is blade and sorcery this the type of dude to try hard in monopoly oh and if you want to play this you need one beefy ass pc i tried playing this on my pc but i had to turn all graphics to low as well as the resolution in order to play it smoothly and my pc was 1500 bucks and is less than a year old just saying before having actually played this i was like i can do this after having played this this man has become a god to me this is how fight scenes happen in my head kratos are you that cool its remaind me little bit gladiators fights at film spartacus blood and sands this game is a dream of bloodthirsty maniac 0 but its awesome and epic i certainly loved it d hii am a new sub you sound like soos from gravity fall good luck in getting this monetized 044 100 i felt that so bad this is crazy butcher of blaviken part 2 930 the chair just straight beat the shit out of the guy lmao you are sooo good at this game o someone should do a prototype mode play with alex mercers fucking claws or blades your mom will be traumatized after seeing this this is the most beautiful thing ive ever seen a skilled blade and sorcery player if this game would be more realistic like with blood and possibility to cut of head etc i might even buy vr this actually looks good instead of someone randomly swinging their sword now do it on normal speed this dude must feel like a surtified badass nobody give this dude a pencil people wonder why we find this entertaining and its cus its hella satisfying so sad its not in psvr killing my bully for hours they need to turn this into a singleplayer rpg the world needs a vr spiritual successor to dark messiah i wish there isnt too many cuts or fade to blacks overall great video imma hit my moniter or my piano real hard when i hit this game when your bird gets killed by acouple of peasants im done this beast waht if this was multiplayer who killed his dog this is epic dude youre a fucking kylo ren in this game when i play it makes me feel unstoppable probably my fav part about this game is how you can actually slit their throats and they die instantly hey is this available on ps4 every kill looks like some shit from the original assassins creed trilogy soundtracksong at 153 cringe title yo who gave john wick a headset well im convinced im spending money tonight this video sucks you didnt show any of the coolest parts how do you throw your sword and regrab it in the air using the vive controllers someone is really into this 154 this guy lookin like a white medieval james harden toss a coin to your witcher oh vr of plenty merptv vs joshdub who would win in blade and sorcery definetly merp he ninja moves me electrocute poke with sword pewdsi whould never hurt a woman merptva 053 gives me inspiration for my dd character skyrim cold be like that i need play this for be a normal people john wicks secret lost long brother we kill together we die together what a pleasant game nice a game like this with zombies one scene made me realize that assasins creed style weaponary and sneak attacks would make it even funnier 330 323 idk why but this kill is my favorite kill oh you were that kid playing with lightsabers 010 is legit some game of thrones bullshit cant wait to get my vr for christmas i already bought this game on steam and played it at my friends house and after a day of school some killing to let your psychopathic self take over and go on a killing rampage is awesome feeling 133 when someone calls you gay but your john wick 3 percent british 7 percent spanish 90 percent john wick john wick and shadow of war combined bro youre a blade and sorcery master 247 yiger if u wact caleb city u know what i mean lol but that woman at 50 was holding well against you xd really wish they had this game for the quest no one crusaders when leonidas play vr 720 close your eyes and let your imagination run wild 708 for a second i thought i was on pornhub everyones imagined a scenario like this at least once in their lifetime what vr does he use welcome to the arena good citizens of the empire you came to watch a fight and a fight you shall have lower the gates 223 looked insanely fun holy shit this dude a beast too be honest i do not like this fighting style it is so vulnerable and risky that was an action film right there didnt know gru was such a good gladiator when the guy got pinned onto a wall and grunted it was kinda sad girls locker room ewww i hate pe boys locker room cool 118 he stole my biscuit from me and he will pay10 pound basically if skyrim and god of war and john wick had a threesome plus one step to make sao in real life the combat in this game shouldve been imported into skyrim vr omg this is so cool god i wish i could afford a vr headset so its this hawkeye vr i changed only do stuff like this in slomo damn this guy is good he should join the spartans 148 when my mom sees my report card man you are the best yt i saw xd all out bloodshed thats a german longsword how is this monitised is blade and sorcery out on psvr yet who can agree with me that some of these look like assassins creed take downs 153 you can see the misery in this dudes eyes go to 711 and close your eyes you should go full star platinum agaisnt one of them mediavel john wick this is fun aint gonna lie u dead ass looks like the fat katana dude in the weaboo meme lmao click bait madara vs the shinobi alliance i want this game so bad clickbat 235 epic technique i laughed so hard 249 my favourite wish they would bring this to psvr did this mans go to a ninja academy i play this on vr and im so dramatic chairborn i cant even play this game because my laptop is too slow for it i have everything it needs except a good pc if combining this fighting with skyrim vr wwmere possible it would be epic that is one reason why our society has become so brutal i am in favour of banning such games 248 that was super badass breaking news local man goes on murderous rampage while wearing virtual reality headset that has said to give the user insane abilities into the real world bystander dear god why so many people so many children and police officers gone who in the world can stop this rampaging monster i hope this game gets more and more realistic so its gotten to the point where its just a real life mass murder simulator i really fucking want vr now hurry up you should do more of these vids i cant stand the ones were you talk the doom guy in medieval times be like this what are youtube dont call fbi its a video game that was

cool till he starter talking imagine what the next 20 years of vr will be what mods did he use this game is so cool before i got vr i thought this shit would be easy but its really hard if you dont

hitting the guy on the wall he was being a bully making him give him money you can be john wick in this game because theres a pencil nice sign this man up for the area 51 raid 316 you in minecraft pvp u really savaged man yeah go for those goddamn knees for honor took a massive turn that was john wick in medieval age 148 greatest punh ever i love how he just casually pushes away the shield and the stabs her in the face its not even that savage literally no one overpowered anime protagonist he needs to make more videos like the intro only if there was a story mode assassin creed you put the vr system in the description yet there is no info on what vr are you using oculus vive please share thanks i think all those dudes killed his medieval dog or something clickbait show off getting vr just for this game an actual demigod at work bois this is the reason why i want a oculus merptvahhh super easy john wicki found a opponent cant wait till vr allows this to be multiplayer this dude is 100 a real life assassin the cyber police when the see a mean comment bro i think the creed is calling you the first 5 minutes and 35 seconds made me hard your good but the swedish kneeattack is better so this is how the game is meant to be played thinking back to the people having strokes and dying would love to see a video of this guy jumping around with his headset on to do this shit i have infinty emote in that game this is boring you thing you are a god at this game even my grandpa can do match better when you hack dark souls im thinking about getting a vr just so i can play this game for now i play at my friends house so thats how psychopaths are created i see i see we are getting closer to sword art online stop showing up on my fucking feed with your annoying ass 148 at that moment he knew he fucked up if there is a skyrim vr with gameplay like this i will gladly buy it he is so good y kill the wamen john wick approves this the warlord we bringing to the area 51 raid 152 you have my respects stonk and i hope theyll remember you is john wick playing this a wrong video and anti gamers said gta was violent just shows how ignorant they were i want this game scary man tho we are so close to real vmmorpg like in the different novels he should have put full body tracking footage in this this man is gonna raid medieval area 51 worthy my great ugly alcoholic god wtf is this gruesomeness how do you flip the sword like that in vr now just imagine someone with some actual sword training going to town in this game it would be clean af godamn your a badass with those moves d the bad thing in the whole thing need about 3k to be able to play this do you need full room scaling for this game to be any good i have a rift with 2 sensors atm suggestion talk a bit mannnwhere did you learn all of theseso proo its remind me pewdiepie with knees attack 534 from stabbing over 20 times to the head to putting a bucket on someones head merps like deadpool and john wick how is it so clean i loved the talking part to be honest that was the best video ever your like john wick but with melee weapons what vr device are you playing on im confused how youre not getting tangled in the wires when youre spinning around guards god help you if this man raids area 51 235 it was cool as fk hire this man for some medieval executions in games why the hell would you spend more then 500 on a vive me cant wait to save up 450 dollars to piledrive a sword into someones face i am uncomfortably hard at this point 108 when all else fails punch his face honestly i got hit with a wave of sad whenever i saw a pined or scared face random guy fortnite is better than minecraft me 322 this game is gross i love it how he do the kicks tho bro this was amazing how the fuck do you only have 635k subs and yes you will get blamdforsome shit that goes down because of this hahahahaha 412 conveniently placed spear hmm everyone else cool me please come out on oculus quest i dont care how low quality you born in the wrong age m8 shouldve born in 16th century this game has an interesting affect on people you should have said to the kid lets put a smile on that face the best game ive seen please do more im surprised this man isnt verified how much does his vr setup cost not including the pc your actually a beast at this do you need a pc to play it by connecting it to a vr headset or do i just need the same vr headset as you do and if i need a pc please tell me which do you use you know the 9000 meme is super dead im a speaker for the dead memes but this was so dead i literally

try breaking their neck please gentlemen ready thine swords and shields for we shall finally embark on the finest crusade of the century this is a game i can play instead of banging my controller on the ground man your a great killer me imagining that i was him my ancestors x shame john wick of the medevil times i was just thinking a mace would be a cool weapon in this game 314 is its slow mo in game and they edit it to be faster so it looks real i got impressed i want this game and a vr so bad 050 that girl knows here how to fight ok now we can go to area 51 sir john of the wick the iii no one wants to see the whole video in slow motion dude i was playing duel of fates while watching this it was fricking hilarious my guy you are a god not a savage people play pingpong how i see it dude

who uses the word savage correctly for a video its so bootiful wow i love your videos i love your fighting this is most definitely not for me maybe if the characters were alien then maybe but otherwise i just cant dead pool is trembling i really really wish i had this game it would be so cool to play i hate his voice but hes good forget about sorcery when you have this man bro he sounds like the jooker from dc here we see ezio the assassin fighting for his freedom need him for area 51 raid i want this so much archery 100 u should be able to decapatate limbs on here lol what console

legends say one man slayed countless men and women who opposed him in battle hes killed 4 meter titans with a sword and dagger he can defy the laws of nature and time if you ever find this gladiator to cross paths with you run this is like the movie gladiator dear god i hope someone doesnt go on a mass murdering spree with a sword or hatchet theyll blame this game john training simulator do you need full body tracking for this game violent as hell i would time stamp most savage parts of the vid but i cant bc its all fuckin incredible what the fuck skill madara against the entire shinobi

wounds you didnt want to leave him a chance huh the video is un ironically genuinely cool bro its alita battle angel up in here jon snow simulator this game looks insane but vr stuff is expensive and got no room when your were fighting those giants it didnt look cool it just looked really stupid and funny because how weird they look and how high you jump when you binge watch anime this is what i thought would planned out but instead fail are you using slow motion and then speeding it up in editing leaked transcript of the pitch meeting for this game you basically get to maim and kill people for no appearant reason cool holyshit 000534 he could be the new moon knight or deadpool this is what you wish you could do to bullys click bait that happens when my mon say you dont get vbucks this dude played this game very well when he has the bow and arrow he definitely has aim bot is the hell bro hes why to good how can i play this this man is a god amongst us we do not deserve to be in his presenceyet he allows it dibs on merp during the apocalypse chill your insane jarvis the john wick trailer 236 that was impressive as fuck this game looks fucking sick do u get it on ps4 vr he is the

people have to fight off like 1000 enemies that have some actual ai ridiculous you really 360d her lmfao 235 i see the blade but no sorcery youre like if kratos and john wick had a child the music at the start sounded like the music from south park where all the girls break up with the guys whats with all the spinning moves do you have a wireless headset or something the roman empire want to know your location this game is sick wtf medieval john wick to medieval deathpool 106 you should have gone for the head doomslayer with medieval weapons dang thats deserves a sub lmao what is this game are

killed because youve got no cover i felt gulity while im watching this vid you should cut off theyre headlegshand it would be nice 720 close your eyes and you got the weirdest gay porno 216 i thought this was going somewhere else can you make more of these in your next vid of this game you need to try and execute enemies like they do in for honor and try breaking a neck with a spear watches one episode of game of thrones well that escalated quickly i mean that really got out of hand i wanna be honest this is so fukkin epic holy fuck dude its either your a highly trained assassinhitman or you

i had enough money to do this in vr my childhood dreams would come true for honor in vr good job you killed a tiatan with your training nice to finally see someone that can correctly play a vr fighting game most people sort of meander about in their room or flail like toddlers but no you made this shit look gruesome so professional if only skyrim had this combat system lol wtf is this 416 if any of us versed him this would be us why u no dismember and decapitate imagine vr games in 5 years with awesome graphics and better fuller controls geeeeeze once i grabbed a dead corpse and fucked it its a nice game this is technology gone berserk 019 thats for fucking my wife 025 thats for smashing my daughter when im an old man kids will be playing games like the whitcher 3 in vr what do money you this vr set can you cut off limbs could you pls stop swearing i am 9 years old i feel so bad for those gigantic midgets you murdered this is the true spartan warrior so fucking brutal ugh this guns insane one way of getting rid of anger issues assassins creed in vr peace keeper antigank montage how the heck do you get big head mode is that the studded armor from skyrim yaaas give me that game of thrones vibe you have to make a 20min montage on this game its just his gaming chair this the future i prefer the video with no voice look like kids mind when become angry i like this its so cool chair man how did i know you were going to call him that god of assasins good fighting 016 that was clean what vr set you using pov game of thrones jonsnow if i ever get this game im finna see how many limbs or holes i can make into someone before they die i found my new hobby lol 410 that punch was so lit theres a fine line between execution and brutality i have a problem with throwing my controllers when trying to throw a weapon perfect this is what ive been looking for i want this so bad this this is amazing xd that was funny this is the definition of it looked cooler in my mind now just dub 618 with joker saying you wanna know how i got these scars he says die bitch when hes beating a woman with a chair i can already smell the raging feminists so this is what clint was up to during those five years i can definitely see a work days stress going away with this xd well the only thing more incompetent than the npcs would be a mangeridden poxinfested medieval serf on his deathbed what headset was used 360 degree is never been a thing in vr unless for show cause you have wire all you need right now is just the pencil that game cured my cripling deppresion your so good your like john wick twin thanos i am the destiny merptv hold my sword edit u are a fucking legend finally a dude that knows he is doing in this game do you think anything like this will come out on the quest i wanna get into vr but i dont wanna have to build a 1080 pc 230 owwlet me help you well bye you beed to do this game only for 21 fancy and all but very impractical if you really fight like that you are not a very hard target to kill even if you would have all the gear real fighting isnt meant to be fancy its meant to be effective so unless you are some sort of an immortal creature id pass on that however this style of combat would surely be appreciated in any rype of fighting scene on tvtheater etc the male fantasy intensifies thats how you are supposed to play this game kids i hit the like button 10 sec into the vid holy shit man youre creative and thus rises the god of combat and slaughter best youtuber ever subbed if john wick was in ancient times a freakin bunch of lemmings running at you with sharp weaponsjust asking to be disposed of from brutally murdering loads of innocents trying to defend their home turf to putting a bucket on someones head and punching them in the balls classic you know i always thought it would be easy to score a stabthroughenemy kill boy was i wrong might be because i operate my vr in a confined space but meh still fun when you can stab them pick them up and then johncenabodyslam them onto the ground speaking of i found the best combo is a sword in your dominant hand and a dagger in the other use the sword to make them block then stab them with the dagger merptv is the kind of guy to walk up to someone in medieval times kill them but nobody can do anything about it because he would just kill them to i probably wouldnt enjoy playing this its just too brutal games like postal 2 are nothing compared to this and seem only moderately distasteful can u cut heads off is that compilation of final season game of thrones this game is brutal i love it this is satisfactory intro of kill master xd yeah you can fight but can you dance this made me moist lol xd i felt like i was watching witcher every kill you do it satisfies me so much does this make me bloodthirsty calm down there winter soldier doing a spin attack with any medieval weapon especially swords will get you laughed out of a room by any person with even a hint of knowledge of historical sword fighting though im not going to lie you made it look pretty badass in most cases id love to see you 1v1 skallagrim to see how that goes another video with merp being a bad ass i didnt know that there was a vr version of for honor ps after reply here is your rwoosh put 15x playback speed on and it looks decent when you play to much for honor this is what happens when u play for 9000 hours 134 did he just grab is beard and then proceed to stab the fuck outta him xd cool take a shot everytime it fades to black 720 listen but dont watch the male fantasy right here lol i cant stop laughing this dudes got no fuckin chill when he starts smackin bitches with the chair like your ugly bitch damn his job must be pretty stressful 110 pfff aimbot im in genuine awe at his fucking skill im blown away i love the badass moments i cant wait until there will be vr games like this with bomb as graphics story line and stuff close your eyes and listen at 714 this is the tale of the worlds greatest assassin i wonder if people dont know about vr are thinking how do the controls work is it all quicktime events this game looks like a skyrim on a crack i wish to dual wield and do all of the peacekeeper executions yes why cant i get that game on ps4 if someone tried robbing his house you know they wont make it out alive this what happend when shaggy uses 01 of his power what vr should i get to play this game these fights are so repetitive why is this so satisfiying my god how are you so good at this i can barely get my controls to work right bro you have to take medical support this was good until he started talking 924 i guess you can say he got elected to chairman of the board just started watching your videos and it was the pocker games then i had to keep moving to other videos your fucking hilarious keep making videos damn the shit felt so real i felt bad for the npcs merpplays basketball and reaches basket coachthe freak are you the hulk nobody forhonor peacekeepers 133 i dont want to meet you in real life you can grab enemys heads sooo one question can you snap someones neck which blades better like if axe comment if sword ah yes the game of thrones vr 202 good now 206 let the equalization begin imagine if there is pvp multiplayer mode godlord this is so satisfiying to watch but still dont know how it still manages to dont get banned this video one part of the move in the start was the execution of warden in for honor it would look good if there are alot of archers and they make dead person a shield imagine skyrim vr with that fighting id like to see you try making a video like this again after the recent update the ai will actively try to dodge your attacks now this in the dying light world would be even more awesome lethal man the feminists are gonna love this game pfff aimbot they made medieval combat they made giants its time for aot vr what is this legolas god of the wars is over 9000 savage and he is the one the fighter of the wars at least you wont go to prison doing this that is a very good pass getting stabbed in the forearm and then punched like a bitch im getting this game hitman joins the game meoh no yeah something you would see in a cage fight psychopath simulator and to think youtube recomended me this video im waiting for multiplayer mode i wish a version of dishonored 1 and 2 came out that was like this 322 when i explained it but my friend still didnt understand listen to 709 without looking i remember when this game was just starting to get popular and i thought damn this guy is pretty good at this game i go away for a few months and suddenly youre medieval john wick u are a pro and u go hardcore kill dude get there ass soo how is the monetisation going look ok but think boneworks vr has lot more potential overall with their gun mechanics and they also have swords too all in one vr experience you are soo good at this game how do you flip the dagger so easily i have to use my other hand you must need a massive empty room for skills like that wait do you actually have to jump or is there a button because the jumps seem to be reasonably slow kirito on minimal quality setings it almost sounds sexual this guy has got some issues you play on playstation vr or vr on phone this was awesome you should check out for honor executions and do it in this game hell it would look cool meet the swordman finally i can pretend to be a witcher without the police arresting me for assault 0854 28 chair wounds i need to play this game bro is this him actually controlling the character or just a animation at first it was all intense and then near the middle of the video it just became fucking around this is some assassins creed shit here john wick wants to know your location imagine them adding a multiplayer thing like gorn players vs merp who will win 715 though try the two shield tactic pretty much bash the fuck out the enemies this is awesome violence in videogames is teaching kids to be violent uhhh old person you see how much fun i am having doing this would you really rather i do this outside of video games instead of inside them its not teaching sht its just a medium that gives us space to do things that you would probably rather us not do out in greater society if i had this game i would only go bare fisted why are you so good edit and violent lmao you put baskets on npcs heads in skyrim too didnt you where is sorcery these kills were sponsored by slow mo this dudes definitely got four lighthouses and a big ass room lol the accuracy is impeccable with those movements this is coming from someone who shuts themselves in all day playing video games all day and i think you played this a little too much keep going this is basically just a 20th level fighter in dd shadow of war vr edition why murder people when you can 360 noscope them with a double sided sword down a fucking wishing well mate fuck altair and every single assassin or robin hood or whatever this is fucking john wick with a fucking sword and a bow on steroids rigth now holy shit imagine fighting merptv oh nah u dead lol start at 709 and close your eyes this guy has some anger issues 842 this is sparta this looks fun but wheres the sorcery blade and sorcery is just not shown howd you get the giant dudes o its over 9000 just think about if they made a multiplayer open world version of this where you can make clans and fight other clans im poor someone buy me this is this game for ps4 i i need this so much merp why make everything so bad assthe moves the spins im shookth why does this feel like its a movie trailer this video need a free flow flava beat with the shitty spins and bullshit attacks i still liked it atleast it looked cool 323 thats right i want to be atleast half as good as merp at this game if skyrim vr was actuly made well you can tell by his breathing that hes lonely fat 019 if that was in update 5 dismemberment update its gucci this is what happem if you combine john wick dna whit robin hood dna guys hes not that good hes playing in slow motion the entire time he just speeds up to normal in post could you please a lot of you are a vet games because thats the way here playing oh ok second pass house is the game called god you got a cute everybody and we buy the car you need a d or four or six or seven around 210 the 2 kills look like far cry so much 99 satisfied not enough idk if this is really cringey or really cool 225 really do the infinity war the i told youll die for that merp is the ultimate warrior it was like he was trying to find a place to put his knife but no place was good enough close your eyes at 708 until 728 and enjoy play of the game as killer the new attack on titan season is looking pretty good very well made man keep up the extremely talented work is this for psvr i wish i had a vive i put my milk before my cereal i have played this and there eyes slowly close when you stab the too many times bruh he is fuing savage what kind of vr are you using what is this guys setup and how is the tracking so good ok on a real note anybody that believes he could do this in real life against real warriors of the middle ages just need to stop commenting lets not forget this is a video game and he is playing make believe with a bunch of computersai the ai in this game have a set of animations that are not unique they dont function like an actual human does so of course you can be dominant in this video game by copying moves youve seen on the internet lol im not trying to be that guy but come on if merp was currently teleported back into time in real life right now and had a duel with either a real knight or a real viking etc with real weapons he would get royally skullfucked what is this game for the console im sure you can fly holy shit holy shit jon wick over here ugly gods badass moments 134 this looks like an execution taken straight out of far cry or something and they stillcant make a lightsaber duel game 152 theres something here that just clicks for me the music the slowmo i dont know i cant explain why i like it so much are there any other vr games that allow you to interact with enemys like this game does but better i like the idea of just going mental and killing them with such level of control but is there games that do it better than this this is like if bethesda remade skyrim for vr instead of just the controls assassins creed in first person 400 damn the new season of attack on titan is looking great 335 assassination 100 credits this guy would have fckn owned in the middle ages i am now surely going to buy a fucking vive vr set just to play this game holy shit this is so violent hey man idk if you knew this but it would be cool for some trickshots when you jump you can kick at them when right above and it makes u fly super high by like using their shield as a stepstool the most insane thing in this video is how well you do grip flips man holy crap spent way too much time in this game and i still cant pull that off most of the time bro wtf youre john wick in this fucking game i think he was just born in the wrong century roses are red violets are blue dont give this main a bow or hell kill u d is it just percision or is there actually something preventing you from your hands going through things 535 lol where am i how is this not demonized merp you should play a gaffidi artist game and draw your logo 800 how hard was that hit lmao bro i forgot that one scp which is a acient warrior that cant die he is essentially merp in this game now i know why people come back from wars traumatized and today we use guns that when compared to sword axes and hammers provide a much cleaner and less agonizing death are you dutch and whats with the big people 425 are you john wick sweet damn remind me not to get on this guys bad side how do i get this game do you enjoy hurting other people i need play this this game is perfect for my jedi training this is somewhat satisfying this is a great way to get your anger issues out i was a famous explore like you till i took a broadsword to the knee p the first youtuber ive seen actually do some badass shit in a game like this this must feel so fucking cool in vr the best youtuber do some wrestling movesxddd this is another level of badass so epic are you not entrained whats the point of normal games if this is possible can you toss them all into the well your a master the best intro that ive ever seen umm hitting women is bad mmkay calm the fuck down kirito uhh merp its your psychiatrist calling they want you to go talk to them about your mental state no they want you to talk not smash their heads on the ground well i dont know if theyll put you in a mental hospital i guess it depends on how sane you are according to them so this is what john wicks ancestors did huh this is kinda edgy and retarded this looks like the funnest game ever created its over 9000 11 i feel like playing this game would release my inner john wick i use to be a traveller like you until i took a sword to a knee lol wut flaming sword click bait 625 its bleeding cus youre not flossing enough this is the future of gaming this is so satisfying man i wish i could get some of these faster throws and swings i have hand tracking issues at high speeds on oculus the giant bobble head are creepy asf just look at the epic smack merp does at 408 just smacks a giant which looks to fun to just punch the living daylights out of them or just like merp also does stabs them in the head with knives or arrows cringe 334 death from above how does he fight dudes one by one bad ass it would be cool if you create for honor executions just an idea you made me like this game u wouldve been perfect in the medival times we need a multiplayer version of this with pvp first blood double kill triple quadruple kill killing spree i wish this was for the ps4 vr no matter how hard i try i cant run people through with anything but the mace and the dagger how do u do it jhon wick mode activated i wish the ais were crappy tho good vid 0 i just saw that crazy then but i like it this is epic this shit is like chuck norris levels of savagery this mans a fucking psychopath he is a knight a thief an archer a pirate and a viking all at the same time he is the merptv its fun but jumping around in my living room like that is kinda crazy so basically all the enemies stand there and wait to die the mechanics look fun but the ai looks so braindead that the appeal would lose its magic quickly is that bad i had a boner the whole time but what if he will fight skallagrim this might actually be the gayest thing ive ever seen omg this game is everything medieval at its finest is this an oculas only game or something 920 i am become death destroyer of worlds original creator of the chairman wow you kill bots cool gameplay better then play vs others people soooo where is the sorcery 800 didnt realize this was an asmr channel is this like a jon snow simulator or more ser arthur dayne i wish i could see this guy cam though i was looking for some pro playing this game i think i found one to get someone down in that well you have to awkwardly grab them while theyre alive and go down the rope be letting go and grabbing it again too bad this game has a system to make it simulate weight in its weapons leading it to feel like a mess thats some ninja shit right there holy shit thanos in vr when someone tries to eat your chicken nuggies 408 are you not entertained isnt this why you clicked on this video wow u r good in this game you defeated my army of gladiators killed my assassins but can you defeat my titans i emperor gregor find you most vexing merp 154 nooooooo not the bearded man any mods installed ok i think you got to into it and i thought skyrim was epic this is like vr assassins creed what physics settings did you use wen you activate the modality god this is dope imgine there would be a predator mode for this game with wristblades and stuff to mess around now i want vr even more this shit is cool im glad i randomly clicked on it got is real assassins creed dude make the wrath of the ugly god iiii with those big giants with big heads how he can rotate sword in air while he not roteting it 634 how ho lee fuq i want this just imagine skyrim with this mechanic top 10 anime battle this man is killing the most thots in history this is what happens when the movie 300 hundred gets better dude did he just jump in vr to kill this dude omg that was lit 038 almost there kirito just wait you lose the coolness when trying to act cool 236 thats me the next assassins creed is here kids if only oculus wasnt that expensive or the game could somehow be on pc or nevermind i wouldnt have the feel but you are a legend good work these would work in real life if he practiced with heavy controllers i need this for stress reasons i wanna play this game so bad whats with this mans stabbing people in the head but good vid m8 man i wish i had that much room in my apartment holy shit i want that this is so fkn badass tho pvp or pve im real life you lose right it is i sir john wick the loyal knight now this is the type of shit i wanne be playing in the future but like open world elder scroll fantasy shit but modified vr it annoys me that theres no exit wound i wich there was dcapitation and dismemberment the first one was like the warden execution from for honor omg when i saw how crazy this man was i jumped up scroller down and subscribed instantly 100 level witcher man when i watch hes eyes like they begging for mercy 155 this game is everything i ever wanted i just found out that killing women in revealing outfits is my guilty pleasure at 319 you can kill the bad guy by hitting they heads on the will mlg dude cool john wick simulator alot of jumping stabbing in the face and flipping the weapons i guess this is the second game closest to dark messiah first being dishonored anyone know where i can get oculus rift for a reasonable price the way you use the bow and arrows you remind me of oliver queen on the tv series arrow why do i feel bad for virtual humans gravity laws not included if this game had multiplayer we would be destroyed the first third of this video was epic the 2nd was pretty good too however the giants definitely need some work the last section was mildly disturbing went from savage to sadist and i cant say i enjoyed watching that for too long but you made it all better with the chair that was hilarious dude did you fight in a fucking war chill he kinds sounds like uncle from rdr2 but with an accent this game is avaible on vr ps4 i want this game if rambo lived in medieval times i feel like im watching one of those dishonoured insane mode videos imagine if this was multiplayer if you can try to stab them in the butte hole is he using a wireless vr headset wow skyrim has changed a lot this is so sparta i dont know how but this curie my sklodowsk as long as its not pvp i cant see whats so amazing in killing 0 skill bots u can do it in any game on easy difficulty this looks super fun godhmmmmm angeloh no

someone do a bar fight i wish i have the money to buy these wow this is some special kind of autism holy shit u made this game look epic fuck ur good at this game the games fun but its not very responsive if i swing fast the blade has like a lag to it and the blades get stuck in the bodies quite a bit this shit is so badass lmfao that uppercut was hilarious i really wish they would release this on ps4 this is the game you wanna play if you wanna feel like a badass they should make one thats is in this time so that kids can learn how to fight in schools or on the street if only school shooters played this gamr i want this game this is the coolest shit ive ever seen in vr love this and hope you come out with more blood and sorcery holy fuck i want this epic war for honor this is what sharpness x looks like father stab them once and there dead me die you medival shit stabs fifty million times in the head yoooo the end were u start hooping them boys is hilariously cool stop spinning around dumbass 556 dear god its lord buckethead this is like a dream come true better than going to a shrink air out all of your anger on pixels im getting this immediately yes medieval women fought alongside men and they were doing it halfnaked who the fuck made this guro simulator now i want to play the game this is so cinematic i love it cough cough cough long live the king me killing them bots i know whos coming with me during the apocalypse just saying this game is fuckin sweet i wish vr wasnt grossly overpriced is this the high ground way playstation vr i would rate this f f for fricking epic what in the good killing time mere could be shaggy apprentice these remind me of the cool slow motion kills from skyrim this is like a action movie xd elder scrolls 6 looks sick you sound like coach steve from big mouth the reaction time of merp when he plays medieval games theres going to be competitions in the near future for most creative killing and i will watch them all i bet this game is violent please make the game for psvr epic this actually looks lit this is spartaa this game and vtol vr just finally sold me on a gaming pc 1299 and a rift 349 when a game sells not only virtual reality but a high end pc it means its a really good game im excited af ok so youve clearly gotten to good at this game this fucking game literally the only reason i want to get vr kratosim the god of war merptvhold my beer it is my impression or the first kill in the video looks exactly like an execution from for honor that god level how the hell do you walk btw youd never want to jump in sword combat the intro tho too notch when your gf says shes pregnant me 408 923 that so makes sense chairman get it for some reason am i satisfied jesus this is something i would like for honor vr edition 926 me when my girlfriend says that she needs to sit down is it just me who was visibly and audibly orgasming at this game this game really needs dismemberment what is this game where can i buy it finally somebody that plays like an anime character bullied kid vents 18 years of hatred still waiting for the sword up the ass which vr is this for when your dishwasher breaks and tries to rebel against you this is some graphic shit lol if you could cut off limbs and heads thatd be even more epic the chair meta when gandalf gets his weed money john wick the game 13 century edition damn this game is awesome lol does nobody else find this incredibly disturbing im the only one okay great what does your mother think when she comes in your room real life assassin wtf is this shi this shi is so cool but so gross but so interesting when is this coming out for ps4 this is how you blade and sorcery pls other video of this when the punisher is born in mediaeval times that nigga got knock the fuck out i do enjoy the fanfare but lets be honest real quick with all those jumps and spins you would be the first to die on the battlefield your honour we would like to present exhibit a they really need to add dismemberment so that there is a actual reason to use slashing attacks 003 when u see ur friend take ur phone i want this but i have no cash we need this kind of melae combat but with guns honestly the intro is the coolest thing ever i cant decide whos more skilled and fun to watch baron or merp you sound like the 2d mario its scary how good he is at this game 133 altairs fighting trainer this game looks great you get to fight both females and males equality i feel like im watching a movie trailer wow this was awesome you definitely got my sub man whenever i see you today a dagger into their head its just fully satisfied thats not 9000 thats over 9000 you are one brutal mother fucker but i like it 730 clearly he got a piss bucket but the chick do look fine oh wow its elder scrolls arena you should be called kangaroo tv for how many times you jumped for a kill that game looks like so much fun 638 that was awesome i wish my vives trackpad was able to make such smooth and precise movements your doing some very very unnecessary things if i saw you on the battlefield id call you a fucking cripple you tbh would feel cool but look like a syndrome just imagine walking into a room seeing your friend play this game chairleader the entire time i watching this my vocabulary shrunk to jesus fucking christ specifically in that order skill 045 slash block stab beautiful this guys favourite words are ugly man kill that colossus im gonna go buy this game now edit i got it and the games amazing x3 this shit is wild lmao imagine there was a multiplayer xd everyone would die in this guys hands xd me when im told to go to school its over 900000000000000000000000000000000000000 who else thougt this was from stealthgamer this game looks sick dude just triple tapping everyone xd now i want the dismemberment of gorn and this will be the best vr game of all time i like to imagine that this is what jamie lannister fought like before his incident if i had a vr headset i would play this all day this is how skyrim vr should be 2 minutes of bad ass like if u agree where has this been all my life that is a good skill you have from the enemys good job dnd but you use this to act out kills instead of stats and dice why isnt this in my house already that was so bad ass what a fucking legend this is the game weebs buy to practice their katana skills yes now this is the blade and sorcery i wanted this looks like a good place to find some ingredients this guy probably has a collection of knock off katanas that he shows off to his star wars comity group friends damn just knows how to sword fight l bro he plays exactly like me man i wish i had a htc why did the stab at 220 remind me of walking dead reminds me of those high chaos dishonered videos recommendations for the best vr platform to play this with this man is a unit seems like a fun game to play but not for long unless you become a murderer this is odly satisfying to watch now this is a worthy man to be dovakiin hey we need a soldier like you join is can you grab them by the pussy and cut their heads off though man your a pro this is sparta dude do you have medieval fighting experience in real life you kick ass that was the most beautiful 10 minute video ive ever seen great work whats the name of that game and i thought gloria borger was goodholy shit man what vr headset is that not gonna lie i think this video sold me to spend 350 on a useless another dimension product called oculus rift lmao never new this game existated intil this video great game for people with alot of stress john wick 3 looks good merp should just go crazy with a daggar and 28 stab wounds dat bitch better warch this httpsmyoutubecomwatchvgqe39cgrfr0 looks like merptv is the god of war omg you are pro i luv you video this game needs multiplayer the last like 5 minutes i swear i could hear a little joker in his voice this is great every 5 seconds i would say oh shit this game is fucking brutal i love it you get a subscription how do your cables not get tangled this guy has to be some trained kungfu dude swaggersouls should play this the ending of this is messed up how does this work do u have a controller or two handheld devices and if so how do you walk around and jump ect your commentary sounds like the jokers from the dark knight 2 merptv you smooth with it merptv the true god of war this is when you watch some gore video games with extreme moves and if you play the game you gone into a psychopath mode you might be a good roman soldier the 5 minute intro tho why you do that didnt know this game existed mate the medieval jason bourn i have played about 510 hours of this game let me tell you this shit is way harder than it looks can u fight like captain america the next fcking kirito all members of the assassins creed brotherhood we are the best assassins to ever exist merptv hold my beer finally a member of the brotherhood who can get the job done this is fucking badass xd its over 9000 epicka walkaepic battle sword combat is much better then gun 122 top 10 anime fights you should matrix dodge their attacks xd hey merptv i think you should play this with pewdiepie the both of yall would be funny while playing this game together lol this is gonna be the first game i get when i recieve my vr headset looks so fun i wonder if this game will be in the oculus quest i hope it does damn how many hours have you been in vr to be this agile youre using locromotion to move right or the touchpad please calm down there man nice vid ugly man attack on titan season 1280283 why do they all stand still for so long why dos every one keep stabbing with the broadsword hes pretty dam good with all the weapons though theres no way you can be this badass whitout being one of the games developers this may be the most epic vr vid ever created this was my expectations of skyrim vr i can only imagine how many times he probably yanked on his hdmi cords you got some movesbro womens equality at its finest 1110 best anime you are trash merptv you should be in the hunger games this is what happens when kirby uses 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 of his power try hard tbh i am sorry i was about to refund this game because i clearly wasnt playing it to its true potential especially knowing you could put a barrel over someones head and deliver a nut shot lmfao holy crap i need to get vr just for this lol geralt is that you this is like a intro to a fighting game 101 that was fucking badass mad probs you have roten teeth need to cut it out stabs neck oh shit yo speed it up to 175 or 2 welcome back frank chairman this makes me miss chivalry dude gorn vr skyrim and game of thrones had a threesome and this was the end result a calvacade of

turns on sabatonpowerwolf albums lets deus vult brother virtual reality merp is a fucking phsycopath i will step out of the shadowsand teach them true darkness u should try to reply for honor heros combat moves like the peacekepper or the lawbringer that would be sick that superman punch thoooooo 211238 is this women abuse i dont know but i laughed at every kill your doing am i crazy 134 looked like a far cry takedown question i have played with vr once before and every time i played this the wires ended up trying to strangle me how do you keep that from happening from all that turning its confirmed merp was a medieval warrior back in the day no mercy gameplay god dammit i wanna to buy a vr now and do the same like you i mean its horrible but sometimes i really want to do that in vr of course 95 percent a fucking 30 year old fat virgin in his moms basement guarentee it gorn kill them all blade and sorcery vr epiccnes cool vid but what game is this this is y i need vr prime example of video games appealing to the male fantasy hahaha vannosgaming would be proud can u actually break necks and noses is this considered dark humor cuz im laughing at people getting slaughtered i want to see this guy only use his fists this man makes the game look fun unlike other players who only stab savage mode activated you are all gonna die have a nice day hes the crusader we have but dont deserve they should make a star wars game like this doomslayer looks at his ancestors portrait doomslayerwow my family sure is awesome this guy fights like ares holy shit that was awesome wow merp u have grown a lot since 5 k subscribers i remember ur onward videos let this be a lesson never piss him off because you stand no chance after what i just saw demonitized this is definitely on pornhub now the most amazing thing i ever seen he can show him stabbing people and blood coming out a little but cant even show him punching a few npcs you should prison shank them american me style the only way this could be better multiplayer boss fights 247 see thats why you dont spin cool is it this shaky incam vr you should try the connor kennway moves on assassins creed 3 he has a bow a tomahawk sword and a hidden blade i love these videos there so cool to watch and your so good and talented at the game hope you do more videos like this i sense a lot of pent up rage nice you are great in this

cables jesus christ its genghis khan teacher your work is falling behind merp what is going on merp ive been training teacher trai literally gets destroyed by merps skill man you got skills i can never do that 00 are you really good at this or is the ai bad yeah after pewdiepie play i bet if he was hired for cinematic trailers he would fucking nail that shit in my opinion the daggers are best as they are quick and poweful 710 this is porn 20 had fun watching this vid keep it up there better be a mod where you can slice off limbs that would be insane cant wait to see a goblin slayer mod for this damn your the best one yet whats with all the jumping in combat do you want to die combat in vr looks like how you would fight in your dreams swinging slow and shit lol can i play this game in ps vr this game will go from gladiator simulator to serial killer simulator in 1 hour can we get this game on ps4vr just wow nice bro i keep thinking this is a skyrim killmove compilation damn good stuff

game it looks cool while we studied the books he studied the blade did john wick just buy a vr headset and then bought this game its bloody piece of shit dislike imagine if ubisoft secretly motion

vr game that you can do your cool moves an stuff like that honestly merp u scare me u do this in real life for a living i just hear u yelling ugly man flower shiieet this should be a new assainn creed game youve watched to many movies lol this guy good holy shit we must protest to get this on psvr 231 move aside shield you look lame when the ai blocks your attacks gorn in 4k unrealistic combat but

accent i used to be able to do thisuntil i took an arrow to the knee what if that game become realistic cool holy shit its cool to see a youtuber to not waste time and try to do cool stuff instead if the gameplay and then cool stuff like if u call merp a waste of time go fall off a mountain why is there badly any talking the only man that can stop thanos it helps me relieve stress can u grab it by his feet how could u kill this beautiful woman must be a very hard game i cant tell if this is either rly gay or rly cool this game needs dismemberment physics if only this were how combat was in skyrim vr someday maybe just getting into the vr scene any recommendations or stand out must tries that our group can get into are you use a hvc vive pro merp is conan the barbarian adolescent power fantasy the video assets from reign of kings looks like it for me hhaha back hand under hand damn this gameplay near realistic for vr game reference 700 gets me every time if i ever want to go into a fight regardless if they have gun ill call this guy with his fucken swords and shit this sold me on the game you still have no match with pewds knee attack you shouldnt talk in these videos you ruined the awesomeness in all honesty i didnt even mean to click on this video but i couldnt stop watching i susbribed he must be a jedi those jumps and the way he turns around it can be denied oh mythis is fucking epic its the broom lightsaber kid guys hes evolving i just got this game and dream about being a god just like u but until i will stay getting hit by chandelier watching this makes me want a vr assassins creed game the only thing to make this game perfect is a mod to make the enemies look like liberal politicians 844 begone thot sorry but dark messiah of might and magic was released long time ago merp goes downtown in real life gets in a knife fight tries to jump 12 feet in the air and then gets fatally stabbed his last words were was there an update i was unaware of that slow mo and those black screens are so cringy tbh huge overuse in my opinion all i could think in my head was deus vult you should take some hema lessons and use the learned techniques in the game youd be even more effective you look cool sure but if you went against another player if it had an online feature who had just as much experience with the game but he also had hema experience your defeat is almost guaranteed ps when you spin your body around its very cringy this is unironically gay 713 eyes closed i feel like its required to subscribe after this savagery this is more like an movie they should add in guts greatsword and how he splits all his enemies in half the part with the giant people taught me one thing vr needs an attack on titan game oh so youre just at 9000 not over 9000 put swords through the back of your shield youll be unstoppable d this feels satisfying to watch i want more mehits blunt party feels good to finally be back in the social sea after 5 years in the joint pleboooo hes doing drugs me triggered 155 goes turns myself in exactly how you gotta handle them small titans on attack on titans 408 dude the first secods of ur combat reminds me of the combat mechanics of the known as for honor man terrorizes village and kills all the villagers in sight bro i have never been so amazed in my life by vr you are a god lol it just seems like these are the kinda kills that either a villain would perform on a side hero or a hero to a side villain this is what people never seem to get about vr its only as lame or as amazing as youre gonna make it in other words if you dont want to look like an idiot while doing it put some damn fucking effort just look up some presentations of even beat saber when normies kind of wiggle a little bit check linus ces 2019 vr presentation some lazy ass journalist is playing in the background and then compare with dedicated players who actually have fun and sense of rhythm he really did her like that 227 really makes me murder thousands of people this was a cool video instructions unclear stabbed a homeless man 43 times watching you kill a man by smashing his head into the side of a well earned you a sub this is the best vet game ive probley ever seen i was kind of hoping that he would spin and get stabbed in the back or shot and he would run around with a sword or arrow in his back now this is equality both men and women being turned into swiss cheese jesus someones been training can you commit sudoku in this game if more vr games were like this id consider buying a vr set in 56 years when the prices drop due to competition 527 nah man you are doing it wrong titans weak spot is on the back of thier neck this is cringe and awesome at the same time could you imagine an online mode do you think it could work well sir you got a new subscriber by this tat was some mad skill holy crappp its jason bourne this is how mafua works ok calm down conan new tes looks great i like the part when the players were big this violent is so realistic it will probably make people video game 710 in real life you ugly but it look good wait you can actually do stunts in this game i thought its just all about knee stabbing bruh this game is like heaven for a gamer i like your channel man sub from me better than gta 5 better than red dead redemption better than the game ive seen this makes me mad cause when they finally invent real vr im gonna be to old and probably dead and wont be able to experience jacking my brain up to a computer and jumping around like this guy i am a kid and i saw this if the first 50 seconds of this vid didnt make you want this game or gave you a reason to subscribe something is terribly wrong with you i need this game now edit i got this game now 400 titans i thought i whould see the flaming sword boy was i wrong i just saw something way better cue the epic music okay now that was epic long disheartened sigh wtf this isnt canon better than sword art online whats ur setup do u have to have a big ass room or something where is the red sword i have never seen a pro like this yo who invited the spartan i like this 99lv boss what game is this holy saiyan father that intro tho 322 wheres my money lebovsky wheres my money vr is probably going to be the best on ps5 seem incredibly therapeutic i must play this please train me i need this game if in medeival times warriors had gopros ur smooth asf is this a real game me man this is actually awesome too bad its almost over looks to see im only three minutes in me yeaaaahh compare this to pewdiepie playing the game i want this game i never knew i needed something so much until i got it this feels so good to watch what the hell so cant you make a spiked shield by stabbing a knife through it then its ez game this games amazing if you use two daggers you can go full v on these poor motherfuckers cant get any more savage than that this is what happen when you play too much assasins creed thats brutal lols hahahah nc moves btw keep it up you can make many subscriber with that hahaha nc vid assasin creed vr now they just need to make a star wars one 109 you have failed this city its over 9000 master assassin i just eliminated an emperor and his entire army merptv hold my beer finally someone who i can challange to a medevial john wick ultimate kratos simulator duel no suffragettes were harmed in the making of this video oh no he got a chair chairs are dangerous in this game one did hurt me this is like an assasins lnockoff of skyrim its just the hide armour tho i always like watching these videos of yours dude you look so awesome as you do it i wanna play this game hes a true spartan needs more violence though i need guts i need brains i really hope they make this game crazy graphic in the futureobviously not but can still hope right why is this satisfying to watch lol i feel like im watching a dishonored stealth kill omg dude your a fucking badass i really like the new assassins creed vr version wonder what this looked like irl if only blade and sorcery whet on psvr than i could feel but probably not look as cool as him this is fucking awesome nothing wrong with this video merp you should play with josh dub takes off headset holy shit im tangled in wires assassins creed vr im getting a psycho vibes from this after all that nut shot was the subscribing point for me you need to hit the knees 028 merp still got them moves holy sht nice fighting skills at the beginning respect ok who taught john wick and kratos the fusion dance you should do a serious video of this where you fight with nothing but barehanded tactics would love to see that still prefer regular games because vr is only limited to what you can do physically with your hands plus the physical aspect of the object not being there is a bit wonky and breaks the realism you need to calm the fuck down bb just close your eyes and listen at 708 id get vr just for this game its over 9000 merptv simply is a god i think whoever merp is his medieval name should be ronin this is how elder scrolls should be oh thats so epic vr is great damn man love ur blades and sourcery videos so well choreographed i feel epic just watching this my ugly man how old are you cause you might be a highlander with that big sword 237 holy shit this looks amazing this is so cool is this vs real players can somebody please tell me when he talks how did this get 4 ads 914 chair mannnnn will riseeee a serial killer in the making new elder scroll like this 10000010 by ign and they thought mk2 was a violent game 523 sounds like a bottle of sprite being opened for the first time yes another video by vr jesus wow that was literally the coolest thing i saw all week legit couldnt stop watching it had to rewind like 20 times lol red wedding training simulator merp do you use a htc give or an oculus how do you fight those big dudes he was fighting just imagine when there are rpgs with this kind of combat system built from the ground up that will be a glorious time lol his moves would only work in this game if he fought a real medieval martial artist he probably wont do so well nonetheless cool video on shot its merp i never looked xd youre a fucking savage mate nearly gave me a boner its really cool but i cant get over the useless spins like a retarded weabooo but otherwise great video love the kill where you just smacked the shit out of him like this 323 and this 126 this is stupidly awesome when goblin slayer attacs the adventurers making fun of him 019 he got the knees what vr rig are you using your hand motions and bodyjumping is so on key more of this if you put xxxtentacion in the start of the video looks like a really angry medieval guy what happens after you watch goblin slayer damn i wish i could afford vr simpsons has the longest intro merptv hold my beer how many hours do you have in this game because jumping alone is hard enough plus but you can do tricks i must get this game question who gave ares a vr headset for his birthday this year is this legitimately this guy playing this game its like amazing its like a movie video games five years from now im in me when i dont get my weekly win on fortnite now immagine in 10 20 years when well have mastered this technology to the extreme the point in time just before virtual reality diving this is going to be horryfing you lerd from assassins creed that look realy fuuuuuun this game would be a great way to relive stress 28 stab wounds but the video isnt bad mic quality is shit m8 shout out to ovractivehes awesome at blade and sorcery i imagine him screaming with every kill too many slowmotion make the video boring and this guy is potential psycho now this is what vr was made for is this on ps4 vr cus i dont haw a pc im not saying consols are better im just saying i dont haw a pc is this the new mount and blade 76 need new pants the one true god of war 033 when you are playing with cousins when you were younger and they dont listen when you play fight this game needs more gore i want to behead people this guy watched got and spartacus for sure this would be even cool with dismemberment and its already fucking awesome most of my creations go down the drain too well i guess it really is time for deus vult you dont wanna mess with merp in the medieval times i love the poor giants trying to use a buckler shield barely bigger than their finger straight up psychopath do you have any video that shows you playing id love to see it seeing pewdiepie playingw as funny i wish i could see you performing the badass stuff this was so badass hello chair man all hail our lord and savior dishonored in another level edition i want this game 1v1 me in be minecraft fam i think that of all the players in youtube merp makes the most epic of all this dude is definetely on some kindve watch list me anytime i play skyrim vr on psvr wishing i had a vibe to play this and or gorn bird box i really need a vive i have this game and damn is the claymore sword hard to control without mods and thats how mafia works 231 wow you can interact with all objects what if you grabbed her by the hand can you subdue the enemies imagine this bannerlord in one game was this john wick a hundred years ago but can you do the swedish knee attack doing the drop and catch the knife is repeated a lot and takes away from the coolness of it my only complaint is the lack of dismemberment that gorn offers as a vr fighting game but im assuming its in development 455 is diane from the seven deadly sins 717 close your eyes and imagine whats going on if only i had a bigger room i too could be this cool the only thing that is missing is the body mutilation from gorn vr and this game would be awesome that how mafia works playing this after a shitty day at work or when your angry would be so fuckig therapeutic how do you not get completely tied up by the vr and headset wires wrapped around you i cant imagine doing this i dont know wat is it but its awesome now they just need to add dismemberment is he using a vive or oculus this looks like an assassins creed trailer lol was the montage in real time or just sped up slowmo also you sound like heath ledger joker playing this game and thats cool more vegetai cant read his savage levels it 1000 no 5000 itshis savage level is over 9000 first time playing this i just grabbed people and bashed their heads in with a sheild repeatedly me mom i want a vr now mom for vrchat me no for this game this is kindof like a dishonored combat game in vr i like it mr corvo imaging the blades of chaos in vr people think this is badass it is but imagine how stupid he looks in real life while hes stabing someone reminds me of centurion from for honor the nightmares thats a medieval flashtime simulator please do a video of only a badassery montage conan what is best in life this is oddly satisfying i am glad this appeared in my recommendation i would love to see the video of him in real life quietly grunting and jumping around the room so do you have some kind of wireless vr headset i see you doing spins and stuff like that so it looks that way your playing better than pewdiepie thats also just going for the knee the new for honor game play looks lit you should take ones hand and see if you could use the dagger to pin it to a wall or table it would be gross but awesome damn never piss this dude off 333 that was so fcking awesome ok who gave guts a small sword run run my children the gods have arrived merp is a god at this game 510 jack the giant slayer 248 when you try a flip for the first time this video is actually so good between the epic montage and the spoofy shenanigans at the end i was pretty well entertained through out fun stuff is this oculus or the htc vive yea who bought kratos a vr headset 459 wtf is doing hitler here i would play this all day if i could die by the sword lives again the kneees what vr is it this is badass asfbut you look at what hes doing outside the game i bet its a sight to see this is so satisfying imagine 1v1 pvp ranked no magic no arrows guild 10v10 ranked customized wardrobes for guild emblemsplease this game really needs an update where you can cut off limbs and make it more gorey looks kind of boring this way 908 mr chair ooor ikeaborn this is fucking insane what the hell i need this game merptv other gods hate him hey call me tits man i havent even watched the whole video yet and i now want to feel like a badass actually the most bad ass vr game ever how long did you play this game before recording thot destroyer 900000 now imagine this with massively improved models and textures certified knight training today i would like to start the movement of permanently banning spinny moves spinny move has been proven to be especially dangerous to the user rather than the enemy vr peasant my life is a movie and im the victim i need more of this 710 close your eyes and listen for the next 40 seconds this is so satisfying is this game for psvr so dramatic yet satisfying go for the knees go for the knees i can imagine some 600 pound man is doing this for some reason holy flip flop corn on the cob macaroni and cheese that was amazing i need this but with a hotline miami theme i love the part where he stabs the archer in the arm with the dagger then just straight up punch them entered the john wick mode holy shit that perfectly combat skill the new assassins creed movie looks great very nice gameplay sir had screaming hell yeah taking a shit lol me im against all violence i hate it also me 704 this turns me on i found robin hood i love this vr stuff so cool and man your killing it merp 230 lmao lemme see that pretty face cool 720 and thats not gay porn the medieval john wick i work with blades now and then best advice dont turn your back on an enemy unless they are downed or have yielded damn this game really awakens the psychopath inside us sam hyde in a self defense situation finally someone whos actually good at this game this game is about realistic combat what kind of jumping spinning attacks d sorry for the reference but nappavegeta whats his savage level vegetaits over 9000 best 10 mins of my life what merp does on vacation watching it in x15 veeeery cool top 10 heroes that can defeat thanos even with the infinity gauntlet in seconds btw hes breathing and the way he talks he fat the fat from his throat makes him sound like that and no im not making fun of him its actually true it happens to people skyrim has left the chat if i do those move with my vr at the end i ll cry infront of my irl wrecked room merp went sicko mode close your eyes an listen from 717 to 740 708725 just close your eyes and you will get the wrong idea i love how you can punch grab and kick them just uploaded a few takes of that for fun hahaha john wick in dark souls 1 for the throat stabs when they tell you video games make you violent what mods are being used or is this just the normal game john wick montage 1300s edition the legend say he ready to fight the knee master the new elder scrolls needs this fighting system otherwise i wont buy it the greatest warrior who ever lived these girl in this game is the best i wish i can play some game with these character 333 assassins creed aeriall assassination this is why i watch you you do everything i want to do on vr games but i dont have vr keep it up xd ugly god is a great swordfighter one of them have james hardens beard why are you ever this good why isnt the sword on fire bro this new dishonored 3 looks awesome skallagrim would be furious if he saw this assassins creed odyssey vr the old elderscrolls 4 bucket trick tip of advice dont attack their shield theres no point in it attacking around under or maybe even pulling the shield away might be a good idea but theres no reason to strike a lifted shield thats so fucking cool the big guy with the tiny shield made me laugh i wouldnt walk even close to this guy mega clickbait reporte of course are you sure that isnt an skyrim mod holy oooooooofffff 025 yo i didnt know for honor was in vr 445 an ad popped up saying the young ones of today look up to see a bright future he went sicko mode this is all great but can we get a pommel trow kill the rightly ending well there goes the monetization attact of titans you must have so much space in your room if you can do all that wheres you new video they need to add multiplayer to this game that would be epic fuck gorn like people are saying add more dismemberment and shit like that and this would be even more sick than it is it was the day they all feared the day the ugly god sent his most deadly warrior to destroy his enemies the ugly knight just bought a vive pro cant wait to play this omg in need this in my life with realistic graphics and physics oooh i love this imagine this combat system in vr mixed with the open world of skyrim damn youre good at this game when theres online pvp let me know a pro scene for this game would be intense xd id really like to see this added to ps4 vr im broke as shit so i couldnt afford any other headsets tht look epic man ur always accurate atem shot i think i gotta play more the man to call to during an alien invasion you should do a move where you stab an enemy through the head or chest with a spear then pull it out from the other end and continue to walk away kratosis that you new to the channel love your content can we get this boy 9 million oculus or rift and is full body tracking i want to play that vr 110 the new robin hood i wonder if feminists get triggered by thislol holy fuck i wouldnt want to fight you in an arena though i would say you inspired my urge to stretch my legs and kill some things god i want to play thia game so bad 159 hey beardo eny last word ye oof why do i feel like you are being such a masochist knee attack i wonder how many sjws would be triggered here is that multiplayer be gone thot its so easy no any body else laugh while watching this hm havent seen this chuck norris film i played this and went to the renaissance festival joined a quick sparring match and beat one guy feeling overconfident i charge the next guy and got my ass completely handed to me still pretty fuking fun do you use an htc vive i cant tell if hes a psychopath or a badass i was promised a flaming sword feminist slayer this is in a nearly future please stop it with the spinning moves in a real sword fight youd be dead from that now thats what i call gaming this video is giving me hardcore henry flashbacks love it what lvl of badassery is it just me or are all the creative kills have to involve stabbing harder or grabbing them and stabbing them it seems a bit repetitive thats why i think the part he actually talks in and messes around is much better i did not know you were from the nederlands awsome man i love your videos man keep up the good work greetz from belgium ha thats right ik hoop dat je snel aan je 1mil subs komt 357 attack on titan medieval edition bruh if you jump in a middle of a sword duel you are leaving yourself open to attack this is sick makes me want to play dude are you okay seriously are you bro you look sooooooo bad ass its realy itatamint sorry for my bad engelich the spinning is a bit extra but the video is great imagine if combat in skyrim was like this what game is this i need it in my life this is the most badass thing ive ever seen god he sounds like akan from hardcore henry god those spin moves are cringy both the user and the ai watching this made every ounce of blood in my body go to my penis assassins creed anyone you were once a brave warrior in a past life u r a badass with two knives pls more like this pls pls its fucking fantastic wow you know how to make a vr game already badass even more badass this game is my game i can do bad as stuff but soooooo goood but i dont have lol how is this still monetised this game was on my radar but seeing this makes me willing to make the purchase thanks for the awesome showcase 616 why so serious 247 was too much for me to handle dear god that was epic this man will survive the zombie apocalypse this is what i call equal rights mtherfckers be cool to fight against goblins these clips are annoying me why doesnt the person with the shield block and stab at the same time tell kratos to go back to sparta with merp let me guess everione of them is your boss 355 you know when that big guy popped out i thought damn finally an extensive fight scene with some badass moves stabs sword into his eye instant death honestly what the hell did i expect thank you very much for the video you were immediately killed if you applied it in reality peacekeeper in a nutshell subed and ready for more it is fortunate that the ai in this game have the combative skills of child cancer patient i challenge you to a dule this channel is what ive been looking for that badass moves pushed me to subscribe great vid man if only elder scroll vr was this lit hey sao look cool in vr u need a hug man merp is basically ezio on steroids holy shit when they meant games causes violence i think were getting a little bit too far with how we can release our inner rage in games but all in all looks fookin amazing you forgot the knees when you buy kratos vr headset they need some milk he went sicko mode skallagrim would be so triggered right now if he saw this its not fair they are tooooo slow and you can overjump them but still interesting spins and jump attacks are silly and gay dont kill wahmen yehh opening book of decapitation age of equality did anyone ever tell you to respect women this youtube video hold my beer this game is cinematic af historys dumbest 1chair man what a massacre john wick sees merp who are you merp im you but medieval and more badass lmao i love how serious the video is it seems like its a never ending badass trailer then the commentary starts a more realistic looking gorn im down boy this certainly is cinematic wouldnt work on people with proper training but yeah slow ai still impressively cinematic haha thats cute kid you should check out what skallagrim did on this game damn imagine this shit online this video gave me the strength of 1000 men my beard is now full length and i ride a war horse to work 3 episodes of goblin slayer later levi rage mode shit right here this new combat mod for skyrim sure is immersive new subscriber here jesus i love your content i need this game im getting it when i get more ram what trying out for a fortnite clan is like 230 merp time to die merp oop lemme get this out of the way merp stab fucking hilarious you could make a free vr bundle where you can get a free vr and this game to come with it also free i hope this makes sense when multiplayer comes along please take on skallagrim go for the knees boi wtf the brutality what game is this looks epic af finally a man i can go on a crusade with wheres the sorcery holy shit i know that everything but the player is like half speed but it does not change how amazing this fucking looks 700 is the funniest shit ever instant sub i wonder if your parents watch your videos they must be proud who decided giving merp a vr headset was a good idea now hes gonna go around murdering real people and calling them ugly man which headset oculus or rift and if oculus how many sensors now that was epic tried it get killed and love it lol the unofficial blade and sorcery vr trailer how do u get 1 enemy to spawn at a time close eyes at 0719 i was once an adventurer like you until i killed my entire family welp demon has just joined the game removing limbs would make the game better im not good at tricks but am sure as hell good at dodging and attacking this better graphics story best game of the year p does the game have an option to go in real time shit now i want vr lol that kill at 136 was brutal af whats with all this fantasy swordplay just once id like to see the real life videos of these guys doing this 620 that face he makes when you miss the tooth just screams bruh that was epicsubscribed i bet youve tried it but would be awesome doing the same but with the telekinesis and magic i was born in the right generation now i want it thx this somehow ended up in my recommended i cant say im disappointed lol those obese humans look like the titans from attack on titans but shorter and less creepy this needs to be on psvr ive never heard a more annoying voice in my existence thus far i want this for psvr with fire and sword stay down 733 bro you just gained a sub if this game can play online with another player it would be great oh hi aragorn is it u as long as it works in the game so nice to see a youtuber play a cool game and do cool stuff in a cool way its like a breath of fresh air or a breath of bloodfilled air i like this game fuck those hot knives videos and that shit this is way more satisfying im pretty sure this guy is now on some sort of list of high suspicion cause he is basically trying to use medieval weapons when youre new to the game then you realize you are a boss dude you should do more parrying and punches and just make it feel cinematic and dude those moves are 1010 xd its on easy difficulty tho the npc reaction should be improve this feel like you fighting a doll a thrust against the metal on that round shield while leaping seems like a good way to either break your wrist or disarm yourself what 5000 hours in skyrim translates into im gonna turn into a psychopath with this game i can see it now this guy is the worlds greatest ninja fighter hey use a lightning spell and use it on your weapons like an arrow i promise you wont be dissapointed 251 gets hit once unacceptable dislike video i would have way too much fun playing this game ancient roman warrior bless by the gods themselves these are wicked i fucking love this game its so fun to grab an incoming arrow and then just stab whoevers closest with it lol chevy that nut punch was amazing imagine playing skyrim vr but the combat was this good how do the controls work how do you walk and such the thumbnail was a let down that beginning made me want to shout dome glas an then you heard merps voice halt you have violated the law pay the court a fine or serve your sentence to the 357 dislikes are you not entertained is this not why you are here lol the bucket on the head 100 family friendly id be a terrible person if i didnt subscribe after that badassery literally for honor in vr onward to fight lu bu you really have turned psychotic is it at normal speed or youre just a fan of slow motion waiting for the day vr becomes a full body experience without controllers just imagining the possibilities is giving me chills first few minutes of combat power level 9000 first second you hear his voice power level 8500 a idea someone should mod the game to make it oblivion arena that would be awesome those crit kills are awesome im so glad to see im not the only psychopath this game looks so fun haha youre ruthless how the fuck is this monetized hahahaha cringe 759 with that shield what vr headset does he use oculus rift or htc hive version yo if skyrim had this it would be so sick who bought kratos a vr headset dang im so owing this imagine online for this game is he dutch lmao my favorite thing to do is to strike from above and once they block it watching their face as they fly away after blasting them with a left hook makes me laugh so damn hard they look completely surprised at the sucker punch i love playing this game after a long day at work 1980 in the future well have flying cars and cures for diseases and shit 2018 medieval bullying simulator i think thats the funniest vr game to play i ever saw hopefully this violent shit will keep some of you nutters away from the streets blood for the blood gods skulls for the skull throne savage level god of war make a video with skallgrim this video should be sponsored to promote vr fck all ya shiny vr ads gib us some spinny sword flipin brad pitt like sword jumps and we cool fav kills is where he stabs the archer in the arm with the dagger and then 1 man punches him in to oblivion finish him you need the dude that says that for the final blow edit also the executions is this multiplayer well someone is having the time f their life xd really awesome video we need dark soul mod in this game when you realize you can be a spartan warrior raw as fuck what is name this game high speed medival arena action simulator poor guy with poor girl assassins creed a parent is foolish if they let their children play violent games no offense just stating my opinion me after 30 seconds i dont know what this game is but i want it right now they should have an army just come in a rush you god this looks so fun but id have to buy a vr headset first that pommelstrikedownstab attack at 248 was a thing of beauty the next elder scrolls should have combat like that your like the only person ive seen whos actually good at the game cant wait for a dismemberment mod gender equality looks great here 704 some wing chun going on why are you spinning thats completely impractical edit jumping too christ they should add dual wielding epic sao music intensifies ok but can we rape inthis game i want this game this shit is like john wicks great great great great great great grandfather or somthing never seen or heard of this channel but that intro alone made me sub lol is this on ps4 gorn remastered 110 how pro hanzo really play to be honest i want vr for just for this game you didnt tell us you were a real shaolin monk bro decapitation dismemberment is the only thing this game needs so dope bro decapitation dismemberment is the only thing this game needs so dope oh my god that jason borne or born idk but can you do a tutorial on how you set up the vr headset because i want to try and get one and play this one day you deserve way more subscribers than 419k you deserve like 1 mil or at least 800k pls do more funny and awsome videos love you man imagine when this game have a multiplayer mode i watch this 3 times a day and today makes this the 6th time this game looks like so much fun 641 it was at this moment he knew he was a piece shit as merp would say the start was epic highlander mains from for honor intensifies when he beat that guy up like he was kung fu master i lost it good vid man this is satisfying to watch we have the new and improved attack on titan the main character being merp and as captain good gameplay but your commentary and voice are annoying unneeded nonsensical difficult to understand and really intrusive talk less claymore the perfect warrior doesnt exi star wars needs a new hope merp is the one to bring rey down 700 my brain decided that this was so hilarious just not to breathe for an entire minute straight well now we know who trained leonidas ill buy a vr headset just for this game vr compatible gloves with tracking of each finger when now imagine this with a gameplay style similar to dark souls now that would be fun the fbi would like to know your location it was so cool until the talking started hey guys want a sprite cranberry wow this is epic one handed increased to 100 ohh my fucking god this is so badass and even turning his weapons backwards for extra flair teach me is john wick behind the vr sees fancy dancy moves skallagrim would like to know your location how the hell i played this and i cant even do super easy back to gorn godmode for me xd imagine if he could put those movements into reality wed all die holy fuck id say where just about there with vr now boys this is it bout time to invest in a good vr system this is dope i want this on psvr por favor 046 merps most formidable opponent of all i think merp enjoys this too much this inspired me to buy the game its super fun pretty nice combat and lots of details put into it not bad for 20 bucks its kinda cool but i preffer skallagrims more realistic approach woow amazing intro the ugly god strikes again but with a savage level over 9000 is this on psvr merp can beat thanos hes a lot better than pewdiepie i play like this except not as amazingly cool p i just stab them mercilessly its fun to murder people virtually w kids who born in this age are too lucky that game looks therapeutic at 322 its a shame you wouldnt pull a mountain and smash his head against the wall so fast and hard he dies instantly oh well good content nice cool plz make the next blades and sorcery video with this song httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv86c94bh3jxc i have one problem with blade and sorcery videos no one and i mean no one even touches the bardiche if multiplayer comes out you should fight skallagrim probably what you see while in the animus skallagrim will punish you for your wrong forms would like to see you two duel my creation omg wtf this is next level shit and this video alone deserves an award lol

gentelamns we got himvalve okey guys we got him permbaned vac banmerptvoh what a lovley day login at pc go at steam go at profile what why i did get vac ban take pc and throw it out his houseend this dude is a beast clickbait your play area must be huge id destroy my walls if i played like this 8d 1 of the funniest vr videos we need gornlevel gore up in this bitch man i like how he stabs his sword into every shield he sees like sure thats gonna help a bit too many spins for my taste but else great vid what vr headset and sensor was used i want a chairmander for pokmon oh this is so satisfying yall act like hes a god this shit aint that hard to do have you seen actual gameplay of the game 800 what the music holy crap he fights like leonidas love the for honor execution in the start the last of the 300 hundred warriors as we watch him beat the fuck out of peopel its over 9000 i like it when you hit they head close your eyes and listen 713 no homo but that chair man right there wanted you to sit on his face after playing this and you took off your vr glasses you will notice you have smashed everything in your room yo if you want to have real fun playing this try out what i did its basically captain america but in infinity war two buckler shields a lot of head smashing the hits feel so strong but it always takes 2 or 3 hits maybe theres a mod to increase damage with velocity also if you stab someone with a dagger and then smash the dagger further into their body with the shield it feels so brutal this man could kill the god of war with a spoon youve got my sub your vr gameplay is absolute fire keep up the great work are you not entertained is this not why you are here this is what i want to see brutal merciless and unrelenting savage rage this is combat i dont think you will remember me the new john wick in medieval action movie starring the one and only merp question what are some tips for new vr users to not want to vomit everywhere whilst playing for honor in vr this dude is a legit badass xd i bought this game because of this fucking video that iz not real life sword fighting techniques that was epic loved the video keep up the good content wait this is what i do in superhot vr holy shit thats so insane dude never have i ever read the title of a video and it be so true this is the most epic video i have seen in my life the second i heard his voice my brain said ugly god guy also thank you for not being so creepyperverted to the bodies lol just imagine playing skyrim in vr with that kind of combat system dude big fan but play something else already also glad you made a partnership with chris but you guys need to do your own things feeling like im watching the same videos but from different points of view 438 wow the new attack on titan looks great holy fuck its good but the boobs dont have enough jiggle physics this game would have me letting out way too much of my psychopath side lol this this savage level untouchable cause

full of screaming and dying very good quality video the ugly bucket man this is the best thing ive ever witnessed fucking hell just imagine 510 more years of dev in vr i will quit my job and become a full time gladiator i will follow you into battle follow the ugly man into war chairman this game desperately needs dismemberment and gore 541 is when he starts talking this is badass this is savage level 13370 minimum dude i need this this looks intense this is like a more realistic gorn game 100 would by if it had dismemberment this game is so fun was that a giant post malone you stabbed in the face ur freeking amazing omg i would pay so much to play this dope asf would be brutal if there is decapitation added this game looks amazing but lets switch the human with goblins and call the game goblin slayer vr that nutshot lmao legend has it merp is actually the reincarnation of the god of war never anger him or you shall receive a slap to the face does he have any mods installed oof that was so cool ugly guy someone send this to pewds maybe itll unlock his inner nordic powers omg hes like the god of war on sreriods me when you let me have a sword this mf trained by the league of assassins badass all i have to say just badass calm down satan 324 oh come on this is still not brutal this video is gonna be me if i see one more fucking tik tok ad every op character in fantasy anime if i buy this i would only use my boxing skills to see if im a good boxing gladiator merp is having too much fun with this game why do i love this channel cuz you can say offensive things to each other without anyone getting offended today my oculus arrived and i played this game but than i had a headache how can u play this game without every kill is one oof you have finaly taken advantage of a true warrior i challenge you you are the chosen warrior merp what vr setup do you use my good man the moment you grabbed a dagger and sheathed it in your shield tough xd you made me want this game so bad thank you please heart this its the ugly man warrior a new challenger is ready to shit into battle haha yea thats right 800 the sound is from spongebob lol xd no commentary are you using a no weapon drag mod in this the combat with the greatsword looks smoother then i can manage with the normal game great video you could make trailers for this game lol you see that smash her face on the ground xd it would be cool if you could grab them by the leg and throw them you are weak merpyou are weakall you need is a nuke to kill humanity no its savage level 1000 thousand because it isnt even near savagery but if it was it would be over 100000 that moments when he enters the arena the gladiators know that they fucked up they wont be able to advertise this better than you have the clips that you did could be a trailer for blade and sorcery yo u make it look like this is straight out of a bloody movie merp if there was a vr rpg gamethat u liked to play u would become one of its legendary players looks like a more realistic gorn dude its just a game calm down 228 thats one of the greatest things ive ever seen omg i want to play this so bad sweaty try hard every time u killed someone i thought of the song lucid dreams btw its a good song is this a pc game is this playable without a vr this but with tw3 ost merp you are the legend of blade and sorcery i didnt know you were that good in this game 904 lv1 chest plate be like also i feel so bad for npcs i love the longsword stuff bruh this is amazing up to 538 merp has 48 confirmed kills he is a classified serial killer let it be known they should put ninja in this game ryu hayabusa style man 843 now that was a missed chance for some real fun imagine having this in skyrim vr d goes 10 minutes into blade and sorcery without using any of the sorcery gg yo this is dope what vr game is this workout for today is done 110 aimbot activated i want remove heads that start kill was semi realistic to me man this channel had so much potential this is obviously going to get 1 million subs one day imagine if they added decapitation that would be awesome 708 close your eyes and listen for like 30 seconds damn dude you look so badass like a god but hey where is the ugly voices of evil god and goddamn you are so fucking scary when you kill that enemis when you dont speak is 705 a ip man reference when he punched the japanese dude in the head been his knees lawl just what i like nothing but epic scenes xd every time he pulled out the sword and made a scrunch just feels so good if there was a zombie apocalypse just give this guy a sword and he will just survive and eventually kill all of the zombies bhahahhaa freaking ridiculously funny awesome editing man waiting for this next video xd i would kill the endboss with a stab in the stoma and also kill me at the same time so it gets more intense this game is excellent if you how play its so cool to watch someone play this game like a bad ass imagine a coop for this game fuckin giants huuh lol yea in medieval times merp was known as captain ugly omg hes gotten so good at it it looks like professional combat if they can add dismembering to this game it would be amazing there are two different types of players in this game there you and then theres joshdub these all look like actual martial arts moves please for the love of legends remake scenes and fighting styles from troy and gladiator and the titans called him manslayer game of thrones season 9 kill montage looks good fun fact if you put brown in reverse itll say nword you should try and swing someone by there feet 704 to be honest this guy should be playing as star platinum for a jjba p6 anime i cant stop laughing when you grabbed that girls face lol i wanna play that

can use electricity skill try and grab their heads then use the skill this is so goddamn epic uglynation that super move speed bro 230 mhm excuse me miss wow the video is not even about a 9000 degree sword clickbait i love these even the kratos one 917 omg its chairmander challenge for every one you kill you have to put there bodys in the well the compony should make an ad with him playing look at the moves ow my god remind me never to get in a fight with merp good job ugly man this is so cool another man who successfully climbed mount targon so your actually the best fighter at the game and stabber that fucking intro sequence was smooth as fuck with the kills but the rest of the video was godly did they improve their slash collision mechanics they look a lot better you are a true spartan

are some of the best ive ever seen your ugly levels are over 9000 for anyone who played this game how can you reverse the grip of the weapon on the fly or jump really high i know how to move the position of the hand but not how to fully reverse the blade downside jumping also only gets me a small lift hilarious brutality as always im you found the giant mod they become much harder to kill p anyways i hope you had a nice christmas d i rlly like what you playing there merp the ugly god has ascended this is pretty much a deadpool movie being a badass one minute and then screwing around the next i will not stop until my prayers have been answered we need a piece shitugly man montage inhuman reactions makes ugly man ugly you should use a axe and stab them in the chest like thanos and thor scene in avenger infinity war like this to show merp you would kick the mountains ass how to get hearted by merp just tell him heart this if you love your fans i want to play this game soo bad but it freezes my pc after 5 minutes my parents always told me as a small child that the ugly people are savage i now know what they ment now heart if you love your subscribers more blade and sorcery thank you for not starting this video looking at the mirror and throwing your hands in the air god bless you he most epic ugly person of all time when will online mode come out i want to see you you destroy ctop click bait i happened upon this channel awhile ago ive got to say this is literally the best vr content on yt ive bought games just because of his personal reviews or playthroughs thank you merp for making bright days youre pretty badass for an ugly man where is the classic russian god i aspire to be this good oh no hes going for the kneees 016 kratos kills a entire cilvization 950 ad colorized merp is a bloody fuckin assasin combined with a hitman combined with a mercenary im worried about merp mental health wish this game had dismembermentcuz the way he plays it would be amazing is this the trailer of the new hollywoods film dude i just react ypur video yesterday you have 111k subs and now you have 412k subs wow this game should be called medieval jhon wick simulator press f to use glock pin me or you will longer be the ugly god needs more sorcery less blade i recently bought a htc vive but it killed my computer great content tho keep up the great work yo that move at 227 was sick as hell merp love how you hit her in the head like that i really like how we get these serious videos to go along with the ugly man antics really works out well imo merp when he actually becomes a gladiator does crazy spin moves and tricks other gladiators stabs in chest once you deserve way more subscribers the video was going so well till he started talking most annoying voice ive ever heard somebody plays this a little too much p i actually fell asleep for five mins and woke up to die ugly bitch one way to wake up from a nap 405 attack on ugly the merpening randomly smacking some poor fuckers with a shield sleep sleep youtube fucked up when they didnt invite you to youtube rewind 2018 000 reminds me beating my exwife goodtimes dude you want me to teach you hema not exactly like this but kind of close someone make a mod where you can break limbs the one and only grand master in the ancient martial art form the way of the ugly ninja ctop has nothing on this john wicks great great grandfather there was no fire sword my day has been ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable clickbait title i came here for a fire sword i never got a fire sword dislike all hell the ugly king look at his power he is a god he is the god of the ugly amy we all love the ugly king 3 050 ive been waiting for this moment since that basement fight in farcry 3 so beautiful i bet this comment will never get pinned i think i found john wicks ancestor i think u practice this game all day you make the movement look so fluid then again you probably have an htc vive while i have a wmr headset dont get me wrong the tracking on wmr is impressive just not as accurate as vive cameras nice work speeding up the footage ugly man why is he so good at the game attack on titan ugly edition the merpinator they should remake skyrim vr with this game more commentary merp you are so funny i just want to hear your voice you sure you werent a warrior in your past life this is so awesome like a film trailer unrealistic you didnt rape any corpses it went from cool to merp it kinda remind of 300 battle scenes stop killing the female characters my family thought i was watching porn this is so badass love your vids they are amazing and to think the ugly god himself climbed out of that town well those that worshiped him were deemed ugly gang members and those that opposed died gloriously in an ugly battle for honor execution vibes anyone thats right ugly man best video yet it is the funniest i ever seen love your vids keep slaying those bitches merp lol i wonder how he looks playing this these clips arent just onetime events he practices this craft to bring us the best in murdering mythologyhistory i salute you sir this game looks fun to fuck around with this is sick wireless vr headset is the best way to play but thats like an extra 400 i think what someone was training bet you it wasnt on hard mode still cool though merphtv is a bad as a in this video love the constant my dude using any mods or is this all vanilla edit despite the attack on titan dudes lol i think merp is from the medieval era and the gladiator of the year goes to merptv the best assassin long time ago a legendary warrior calledmerp oh okay merp he was sealed by the magician of the forest because of his crimes but merp got free after the magician freed him for merp to make the biggest massacre after the magician have her wife being killed by the village calling them witchesafter this merp decide to killeverybody in the village and become the legendary warrior again and so he did and had claimed the master death sword of level 9000 to use as a weapon of destruction and bloodlust this shouldve been called ugly god 3 300 edition lol he went balls out and jumped down the hole after the enemy this shames leonidas the visualization of a man in his house endlessly punishing peeps through goggles while grunting in an accent makes each day a little easier this game is fucking awesome its cool to see the enemies start to have a small chnce you know what he has the best content on youtube better than all youtubers in youtube rewind 2018 he is the legend lol looks like a friendly type of game heart this if you love your fans always wanted vr so i can reenact things like the executions of shadow of mordorwar merptv worlds best blades and sorcery play in a million ways imagine this game having multiplayer and u end up fighting this guy this one is definitely my favorite of all the blade and sorcery if anybody ever watch hellsing abridged we need anderson to do the voice over this video that thing is smol if only merp was thor in infinity war he would always go for the head when a highlander finally does his class love it when you do this game

did you mean this pinokyo games yo if this was in nintendo switch and with those beats i completed the gameincluding collecting all of the music notes what about ios i download the game this is very

perfection this is a great geometry dash 23 update where is the music i need more geometry dash is in another level is this going to be on ios i know this game is on steam but can it be released on

in the future the music is great when is the next update it is such a good game i have live streamed it like twice now im already play this game xd completed all the achievements idk why great game speedruns may come close to tenth of a second if there will be any active runners lol im looking forward to see more levels in the future fun game beat it in 25 mins theres only a tutorial and 3 levels after though you could keep playing to beat your score die as little as possible and collect all the musical notes throughout the levels downloaded today on steam its short but way too good

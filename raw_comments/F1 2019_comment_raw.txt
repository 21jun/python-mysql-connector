when you play shows other fireballs like cinematic that you need to open the menu or is it automatic how the radio works how to talk through the radio you need to press something or it is also automatic please answer you dont like mclarens race strategy then switch to ferrari being a ferrari fan i hope season 3 goes good do a ice race in fh4 its ah 2020 what steering wheel is he using anyone else who cringes when he says sharles leclerc ferarrithe perfect strategy doesnt exi rebull in brasil3 soft sets ready for max nick is the ken miles of f1 2019 well that hasnt gone well has it we got a long way to go before we get another drivers championship where are the fires 618 nick defenetly flashbacked here never shoulda switched imagine this actual situation in 2021 williams being top dogs followed by mclaren with ferrari red bull and mercedes making up the mid to rear of the pack itd be a bit like brawn all over again 617 deffo span it what happened to ferrari you nick you happened its a new car so you have to get used to it i also went to ferrari en seasen 2 where tehy only had opgradet the engien but no aro got f1 2019 for christmas first f1 game picked mercedes won first race it appears this is almost the way f1 should be mclaren and williams have returned to their former dominance with top drivers and the leaders have dropped i think kimi ignored the yellow flag in the qualifying in my career i did the exact same thing this ferrari is like in 90s or 80s is kvyat really pronouced kivyat called it mate i dont want to put this as something offensive but i dont think your that good at the game im so so so so so so so sorry nick welcome back to f1 2019 me its 2020 ps you can tell nick is going full tryhard by picking mclaren and ferrari which are the cars that pretty much are always leading i see yur tactic pal nick i added you to my friend why dont you use the sterring wheel for forza today i bought a corvette in heat and its lvl 344 in other wordsits as fast as your lamborghini love the series nick mfga make ferrari great again nick every episode i absolutely love this place is nick driving automatic i thought he moved go hass um that aint how u quali my guy wasnt happy with the strategies and then went to ferrari why do u complain about mclaren pit strategies then think moving to ferrari will make it better nicks strategy in season 3 give people cursed cars verstappens problem was that he was on hards and not mediums thats why he was so slow is there a lamborghini f1 car if there is be the lamborghini f1 car now you can be promoted to toro rosso and demoted to red bull bring back the old crew2 nick pls more f1 vids like so he can see dont say a ferrari is heavy nobody me italian hand gesture intensifies 105 huh i thought ferrari were just flamboyant and quick durability is german well as richard hammond would say they let the italians do the brochure so they would just lie if you know top gear news you know how do i always lose my front wing but you dont how is it slow the goal for this season fully upgrade your car mattzaba03 red on the webcam meme i like hey nick the only reason fh4 sounds arent accurate is because they dont want to get copyrighted in qualifying if he actually tried to finish his lap he couldve had another attempt because a lap is about 120 and he had about 122 left you have to be more agressive finally new episode play street legal racing redline aw i thought you went to haas get him to 2 mil subs before 2021 these midfield races will make for great vids day 32 of asking nick to do afh1 lets play kiviat what mehappy because nick moved to ferrari what means his teammate is my favourite driver nickleclerc moved to mclaren make ferrari great again the italian donald trump if only did he post more of this 119 i wish i can say thank you in person but i might not be able to survive the smoke for a second i thought you went to haas from a pro press accellerator smoothly tifosi next year will be our year next year 408 u actually surprised me by joining ferrari please dont tell me that you play fh4 in that wheel one of the best episodes of this series so far great battles and a great drive nick looking at the damage in the middle of a corner and screws up the whole corner yes racing nick yes very do a gumball rally in the crew 2 oh boy this is gonna be sick love to see you in red nick dose the force feedback on f1 2019 feel alright also what wheel are you using questionwhy is nick driving in automatic nick mclaren screwed me over with the strategy also nick goes to ferrari could you show the upgrades you do since its not as fast of a car that was some crash haha nick mclaren were giving me stupid strategies also nick moves to ferrari ar12 play mud runner with tomcat 619 i wonder what happened there when you cut wheres nicks comment somebody tell me how williams became the new mercedes turn your assists off its orange not scarlet red nikki poo your dumb why would you do that if you were doing so well and your pits were fine and you still managed to win the ai are not getting better your just slower with ferrari nick with mclaren 203 nick with ferrari p19p12 when f1 goes by a crashyou son of a bitch im in lol nick you only went from 19th to 11th nick can we see a mincraft stream on twitch yess new season but can nick penetrate one of the best channels yay im early 12 to comment i think love your vids nick 348 is the funny edit dont forget the merch hi nick love your f1 vids keep it up well then hey nick i love the helmets in the game they are awesome rugbymadfan smooth operator now also in the game it is maxico imagine lewis hamiltons title fight if it wasnt for mechanical failures nice way of eliminating an opponent aarav aarav omg lewis hamilton dnfs again also aarav doesnt upgrade reliability ever what about a double episode for the season final d didnt you say in another video not to stack penalties wake up aarava upgrade the reliability 1 if you qualify into q3 but take penalties do you have to start the tyres you set your fastest q2 lap on 2 and if you get promoted into p10 or above due to someones penalties do you have to start on your fastest q2 lap tyres weber took me out in my first season sprint to glory zero reliability upgrades surprised that hamilton dnf can somebody do a supercut of aarav saying actually throughout these 80 odd episodes verstappen is now in the conversation for a title this game is cursed ive seen how strong drs is as i set a fastest lap against my friends at cota at the end of the race no fuel fresh softs and my friend beat my time with worn mediums because he had drs and i didnt hey im not even gonna watch this just tell me when he is changing teams please like your vids better now then bens weber just pulled a hamiltonalbon brazil move on you aarav you definitely need to learn how to drive especially from tom97 hamilton dnf 6 times yet f1 2019 is saying he only dnf twice what hamilton have more dnfs than riccardo at this point verstappen by renault with a red bull helmed aarava doing an smooth operator and now verstappen in the championship fight with 1 win omg that game is actually crazy cause you are exactly like sainz in brazil from 20th to podium hamilton is out of the race can you believe it you just cant make this stuff up lmfao you do realize that it was literally made up dont you whens the third season of rtg you are paid to sponsor the game you have the tricks and you have no social life you already knew hamilton wouldnt be allowed to get away with another win lol aarav dont be surprised that lewis dnfs all the time just upgrade you reliability aarava weber is being respectufull also aarava squeezes weber of the track i think lewis has the bad luck to pay off the quali boost that he had at the start of the season weber thought he was albon and you were hamilton 1240 thank me not lets get this bred bois great video first 026 pls stop the video it was at this moment he knew he fxxx to be countied do you u use a steering wheel i dont get it when im in full speed i can barely turn the steering wheel but when ur in full speed u can turn it 360 how how would you like to be in that haas at 0056 oh my word your race suit would be full 331 what is doing helicopter nice video nice vid didnt saw it yet but i know it will be good nice gameplay fair driving and cool graphics fresh meat how much for the game please shut up shut up shut up pleaseeee i dont play this game because it doesnt have commentry stupid option to watch behind not real you have mirrrors minus for game too much of talkhad to watch with no sound f1 2019 free httpsmuacashcomtintuchuongdanchoimienphisieuphamgameduaxef12019html record the race then comantate after while you watch the recording theres too much midrange in your voice audio on the ps4 slim is it possible to change commentators language in this game cuz that crofty guy is annoying and boring 458 you overtake out of the track are u using the sterling wheel controller or regular controller its a shame how they did the animation when your car is in the pit and turning from the lane to the crew and then back again literally a shame is it ps4 game or pc game my channel play f1 like sub pliz comment xboxpccom domain is for sale its tooo easyyyy i am russian go for kvyat 1057 youre not overheating your engine because you rev your engine by upshifting late youre overheating your engine because youre braking with the engine and not the pedal downshifting when youre still running high rpm so youre braking with the engine and thats why you have high rpm in places that youre not supposed to have if this was a simulator you wouldnt even be able to downshift at that point and even if you could youd spin your car on a straight line because the braking of the engine would be so aggressive you start downshifting at the same exact moment when you press the brake pedal feeling like a saddo prick because i needs to get a better android device to download this great game just saying it dont mean shit i am very big fan of f1 why does the graphics never look realistic f1 2018 steering wheel turns but very slightly when you pit check it out skip to 912 2633 httpsyoutube24sayd4yge f1 2018 steering wheel turns but very slightly when you pit check it out skip to 912 2633 httpsyoutube24sayd4yge great commentary especially with comparisons to 2018 and the lovely real life comments like with vettel and canada loved it continue it but no performance pressure more overtaking shown in the preview version loved it nice to see what 2019s games got hows the multiplayer is it well and alive can you play this in vr can drive the lad took me a while to get to watching this video and i must say that the ai look so tough this year on 2018 france was an easy circuit to beat the ai in the race but it seems the polar opposite this year madness you are driving on too high gear im still playing f1 2014 lol ya you cant smash on the gas what wheel do you use thats not right the williams car pulling away on the straight against the ferrari why f1 2019 no motion vr httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjvlpo6a5hx0 that race pace is kinda trash for a youtuber bruh and you make 100 excuses pit entry is bad how does it compare with f1 1996 on the psx they need to get rid of the halo all my buddies always tell me once im winning oh godmy batteries are lowoldest excuse ever now do it from the cockpit view its so much easier from the elevated position a view of you playing in the corner would be awesome in my edition the steering wheel is different why there isnt the prancing horseit is like this one httpswwwgooglecomsearchqf12019ps4onboardrlz1c1ejfaenit693it743sourcelnmstbmischsaxved0ahukewjrhujhwijahw1unekhcngctqqauieygebiw1366bih657imgrckkwkvwh9zw17im 250 if charles turned into a white walker william faster than ferrari hmmmm very realistic los que tengan el juego agreguenme al whatsapp q cree una liga httpschatwhatsappcomcju68z4zpgvltvfpmlglf3 bring on grid christ and they killed jesus pierre gasly in 5th what a yoke those engine and downshifting sounds are awful this has to be the most boring race ive seen in decades wake me when the seasons over interesting for ps4 do you have the option to play it on with motion control using the dualshock controller just like gt sports they have to fix the pit entry and exit how do you activate the ers stop the corner cutting gotta video suggestion now your played the game for a bit if you had to choose one version of f1 to recommend to a beginner which version would your choice and why also id like to say thanks for all the videos over the years i have enjoyed watching them not today you struggle to do multiple things i cant drive adjust fuel mix and ers and ask informations to jeff you do it all so easily i thought this was another aarava challenge and almost had a stroke trying to understand what first to last means ben my mrs insists on talking to me when im playing and expects an answer even when i dont answer it seriously impacts my concentration just listening and thinking about anything other than the race totally agree with you grosjean complains his engineer itb oh no 210 how do you play with keyboard fresh meat 406 for the race start bit disappointing that the 2019 game doesnt have the 2019 french pit entry hopefully it gets updated can you steer with the ps4 controller in this game essentially using it as a steering wheel like in gran turismo 1213 5 second penaly is a yoke a yoke 1853 they cut there all the time in the race htf is the mercedes faster than the ferrari in a straight line codey you really don fuckrd up if i were doing this live you would hear a loft of swearing do a challenged carrer in cockpit camera i cant watch of these videos non of this you tuber ride in cockpit view they play in kindergarten view been your fan since f1 2018 can i request you 100 race no pit kind of stupid but will be challenging ben you should do a youtube championship with scott aarav and tom i often play career mode while talking to friendsfamily on the phone it actually helps my driving the less i think about it the less i screw up the pentagon lens flare is too extreme they need to dial it down nice run i gotta check the new game out sometime i am a new one at this game and i really want to know how the hell do u know when to change gears intothebarrier sighting one of the engineers on the haas squad he got fired from mercedes after last year lol the unrealistic physics in the put stops ruin it for me ruined last year 500 10 hour time penalty for car 16 for leaving the track and gaining an advantage let the gas go before the braking zone ben you cant really rev and engine brake in this game its gonna hurt you ben downshifts before he even brakes when does it actually come out you have the beta test advantage thats a joke they should fix this gasly would never finish 5th unless everybody else got a penalty is it possible the lack of straight line speed vs the ai is down to them running the low downforce stock setup dont know if they do that but it would be nice if they did for circuts like this monza ect question are the 2010 mclaren and ferrari included to the legends edition if you put it in rich overtake you would be faster than the williams good stuff which racing wheel are you using you mentioned the ai is to fast in the straight line it already felt like that in f1 2018 i was playing career mode on lv100 ai having 3rd season with mclaren and with upgrades my car is miles away from the other cars when it comes to power yet even without drs starting from pole pole lap was 08sec faster than 2nd place i usually end up 4th6th in the 1st round cause everyone catches me on the straights like id drive a 2019 williams mate you are driving on a different track lol your own setup is genuinely shit like what possessed you to believe the 2018 type camber and toe settings would work without ballast smfh use 320 12 for camber and 010 026 toe 500 so we got a new need for speed again the ferrari is slower than the mercedes story of the turbo hybrid era i can drive normally when im talking to someone while driving amd i drive on 105 or 110 ai do more setups for career mode pls why are the tyres still half shiny after one lap in real they are not like that half a lap and it is gone danny ric 2 electric boogaloo why does entering the pit box still look so bad the wheel doesnt even move i know its not a big deal but it has bugged me for years give us manual pit control how did he get rid of the 5 second time penalty wiliams bether than mclaren what a joke that wouldve been so embarrassing if the williams got me back i laughed hard on this lolololol d why the hell cant you just overtake these guys on the inside in last corner because they run inside you like no tomorrow theyre just like theyre unaware youre there williams are too fast is f1 2019 releasing to consoles before pc on a friends ps4 it says that its got 2 hours until its playable but on my pc it doesnt say im in new zealand btw so in 2 hours it will be the 25th of june williams was pulling away easy he was closer to the car in front so more slipstream ai also doesnt use 6 6 wing more like 5 or 4 i dont know what codemasters has done to the engine sound but they sound much worse than last years bottas and vettel set the exact same quali time 130121 can you do one of your career episodes live i would tune in for that how come hardly anyone uses cockpit cam on these f1 games its so much more immersive pitlane not changed yet is there no overtake and hotlap on the ers do u use flashbacks in career tiametmarduk lewis pole lap on this episode is that exact same as his last year at paul ricard he protec he attac but most of all gear paddles go clac xd they havent updated the pit entry in france id love to see a video of you lapping an f2 car and an f1 car around monaco and monza so we can better understand the performance difference between the two cars great race bro really enjoying watching you race and commentate you have me going in a state of f1 meditation just watching and observing look at the front wheels light interval is still shit i love f12018 both career and online but they need to fix this graphics like gran turismo were the lighting in all forms is amazing both tires have the same white glow bs on them consistently which is bs ferrari shouldnt be slower in the straights mafia in f1 2019 too when gaslys ai perform better than him irl 458 thats probably not legal but were gonna press on anyway yeah about that i hope they give ferrari their alternate 90 years livery instead of leaving it blank 1231 what the hell oh ffs they havent changed the pit entry 127c engine temperature not great not terrible ive seen worse he cuts the ai up all the time do first to last with kubica will the services be updated on the day the game is released ben on the straights use overtake mode to get maximum straightline speed it burns off the battery more but its a huge difference vs high mode 3 sometimes think the reason that this game is so great is that modern f1 is essentially a computer game more live commentary pls would really love to see more live commentary videos ben isnt the pit lane wrong 500 ben gets a 5 second time penalty after the race 210 has anyone seen scott intothebarrier there i was actually 07 seconds faster around monaco while having conversation with my friend who was sitting next to me and became slower as he left the room i love how ben goes all the way back to pre season testing to say the car was good cause ferrari is now qualifying in p7 100 race in mid field team i hope when they change the cars in rbe day 1 patch the car orders will be like this williams toro rosso haas racing point alfa romeo renault mclaren redbull ferrari mercedes what do u make of the ricciardo penalty 1543 interestinglmao it isnt a tiametmarduk vid without corner cutting preordered the game and suddenly it was here on saturday and i played a few hours and i agree the ers is harder to manage than last years game ben in the end you didnt need to rush for time because you never missed anything ahaha when are you doing a video showing the 2010 cars more like 30fps in the cutscenes for us its pretty bad this is better than the actual race today any chance we could get a video on your take on driver transfers being in the game thats a pretty big game changer for me and would be interested to hear your thoughts on it bet you wish you skipped the race today to just play more of the game fix that noobish downshifting the williams is pulling away because you are running 66 wings m8 the ai probably uses setups that are more suited to the track than the default setup there should be an option for you to set people in what grid spot you like you can make a reverse grid that would be cool 139 yooooo jd here trl limitless its sad were cant see tire wire thats garbage mclarens need a buff and williams a nerf breaking news ricciardo got a 10 second time penalty for leaving the track and rejoining in an unsafe manner ricciardo v norris lap53 and for leaving the track and gaining an advantage ricciardo v raikkonen lap53 so he finished 11th rather than 7th now i can see why the penalty was applied but the stewards in f1 are really killing the racing in the sport the second i heard the sky sports commentators making a deal about it i knew something was going to happen the rules should really be rewritten before the fans are completely stripped of good racing fast to lirst 1135 i always have that with my mom she always talks when i concentrate and im there like ye ye sure 1 hour later did you do this already me what you never said that slipstream is not strong at all on f1 2019 the wheel didnt turn as you went into your pit box sebastian vettel gets 7th place in qualifying fia we will wait patiently good video ben i think this is upload 3 today so good job hi ben id really like to see you racing the new 2010 cars at spa ben are you able to do an f1 2019 game review because i dont know if i should get it or not 26 seconds stop ben thats actually a pretty slow stop to be honest i hope they fix the pit entry on paul ricard tho edit and the pit exit pit lane is in the wrong place should have done this while the real gp f1 youtuber championship please ben still waiting for those glorious moments and those dodgy ones too 1249 what happened i feel the ai get more slipstream effect so their straight line speed is better than player they need to fix the pit entry with the day 1 patch havent driven on the game today most of us havent driven on it at all yet i can already guess that the first game patch will be the change of the pit entry in france how do you go about earning points to buy new liverys oh man f1 2019 and the pit stop still looks like shit codemasters to dumb was this recorded before the race ben be honest is 2019 worth the price lets wait for the day 1 patch and see how the ferraris straight line speed is after that at least you didnt take out your teammate bet ben wont like this comment i dont understand why they dont let us choose the starting grid it would be so cool to simulate real life races should have called it the first last to first challenge as its probably the first for f1 2019 can you please show us the 2010 cars hey marduk im looking forward to your next f1 2019 career mode hey one question or maybe two what do you think is the best setting on this game to have a fun and challenging experience and also what team should i start off not mercedes or ferrari because its to over powered from the start in my opinion do you think like racing point or mclaren could be a good start and then grind my way through anyways thanks and keep it up i love watching you the pit entry is not anymore in that place does anyone else find the engineers voice a little bit annoying dont really know why they changed it from f1 2018 this race was more entertaining than the real version loved it i changed my xbox time location so i can get this game a day earlier gg is this gonna be a boring race aswell ben is there gonna be another career mode episode who else is annoyed about the french gp today good f1 keep up the good work love you vids first person to watch this hi first just four more races to go were getting close to grabbing the world drivers championship now is champion leclerc youre turning so bad on the bends although you can also play in low mode youre using a controller and not the wheel running to much wings and taking bad lines could you post some qualifying videos please do you put voices of leclerc by yourself do you play with the ps4 controller nice video bro please more f2 races how many hours did you played f1 2018 and 2019 just videogame could be leclerc world champion leclerc disgusting this time no good balance too much understeering but always very compliment how can i lock up with xbox controller look at that pit stop strategy 3 stops with the softs you dont see that very often hi i really your content can we play together and do 100 races who likes ferrari leaves the like hey can you give us the full view of the circuit on the left bottom side very nice race as always my friendyou drove amazingkeep up your great work as always why is ferrari so slow on this track cannot even get rid of perez still no update that switches gaslys and albons teams what you use for this game ps 4 or pc nice lets go baby you make part 2 you finished this serie quick very bad car to drive in every turn of this track understear everywhere same track speed as monzas you win the world champion first f1 2019 gameplay with the mercedesamg petronas motorsport on the track albert park in melbourne australia captured 4k hdr on the ps4 pro note im not pro at this game so please no btching that im not driving like the real lewis hamilton difficulty is at 60 hard to view this video in hdr you need a 4k hdr tv or device with youtube hdr such as the samsung galaxy s9 iphone x etc you actually drive really well in this game but i play f1 2018 and mercedes sounds so much different compared to the 2019 mercedes dont you feel ashamed using this line sounds like my gardener cutting the grasses so they stopped making another demo i have bought formula 1 2019 3 days ago and my best lap time there is 122183 i did it with medium traction control without traction control its incredible difficult but people say that without traction control you can drive potencially the fastest how do you get hdr working its permanently greyed out for me despite having an hdr monitor i think once games master the natural movement of necks and clavicles it will be imposible to differentiate from reality so real you unknown the drs mine was 124761 here is the key to be popular upload garbage video with garbage quality with no skill and get 500k views for 12 days nice work youtube if nowadays f1 cars had some propper sound i would absolutely get that game but those v6 vaccuum cleaners just want to make me throw up did i tell you the definition of realism realism is watch this fuckin thing over and over and over again expecting to find a defect and that is crazy what ever developer makes this game should make motogp i love the way that you drive are you use a break assist 130 the starting grid was wrong robert kubica was not starting dead last the halo view that were used to seeing on tv has the telemetry data obscuring the rhand mirror whose bright idea was that ai difficulty is too low its not entertaining when they dont fight back and you need to work on your theottle control mid corner as well as your braking dont always brake when the chevrons on the floor are turn red you can brake later and still slow down for the corner meaning you can accelerate out of the corner much better ground hog day same shit different year when i was a kid the best race game was outrun this is on another level lol looked like the car had a spikey windscreen strange can anyone explain what that is not enough money for buy ps4 pro perfect the graphics look sick i saw myself in the middle of the crowd that day was amazing doesnt look very exciting yet still more exciting than the real thing pointless this really cus you can only see the 4k if you have a higely expensive 4k monitor plays best on ps4 pro have it on xbox x and pc rtx 2070 at 4k the graphics ps4 pro pushing out is incredible considering its most underpowered the difference is visible only if you stare at area or zoom btw ps4 online community is what makes it best on ps4 just shows that this is an arcade game not a simulator go super fast slam the brakes at the corner maybe bash into someone in the process repeat again next lap as someone else already said its like mario kart but with amazing graphics i still have the 2015 the car just spins out of control in the first corner sorry guy but the game on ps4 pro isnt beautiful than f1 2019 game on my computer the quality here on ps4 pro is the same when i put the medium quality on my computer broke your front wing lap3 so game run 1080p 60 fps on ps4 pro id love to see a nascar game like this these graphics physics and dynamics are awesome looks the same as past copiesstill cartoonishno realism looks good for the playstation im sure it looks better on the x graphics look outdated hope it will look better in pc looking like the first f1 game on ps3 for 1012 years no improvement garbage and this player suxxx xd lets hope smtg better for ps5 because this crap ps4 i didnt even buy are is anniversary the best racer is hamilton i drive better than cj someone here do you know when is release of digital version in ps store asia holy fk this is terrible driving get good 1st be4 u post a vid thank you but no thank you until they remove disgusting halo great visual but sound is no the sound of the engine little bad cool bro its easy to activate the drs using the triangle button in the drs zone tv or monitor which brand bro why f1 games is better than motogp the graphic looks guud though your not good its okay the gameplay was entertaining wait 4k on ps4 pro are you joking ps4 cant run 4k lol i want to be a tester so i can play it toolol come on tomorrow for the release ps4 pro have 4k i think you say 1080p i thought this was real for a second wow this game is so real reading the comments make me laugh looks so real 1 change to cockpit cam 2 turn off the hud and track map 3 turn of racing line 4 turn off driver names 5 turn off automatic transmission driving aids 6 do it again f1 look like ps3 game compared to gt sport why you dont play in xbox one x the xbox x is more powerful then ps4 pro telling hamilton how to approach turn one what a fail they need to remove this kind of stupidity from the game waow you haven t takes a drs and you overtake valterie bottas if you dont mind me asking how did you record in 4k on playstation pro not blown away by the graphicsthe new grid looks better valtery its james why has the f1 since 2018 such a awful windshield i love how much he use his drs lol you are not a pro but you drive better than noob on online sorry if i made mystake im french f12016 still my favorite f12017 and 18 the ai cars too perfect i think coddies are keeping things back for the ps5 they have gone as far as they can with the ps4 712 theres a cut in the video of two different videos i would definitely take 30 fps in the rear view mirror rather than a shorter draw distance is this the highest resolution im getting 480p60 hdr i cant even watch this in 1080p why yo graphics looking good this looks waaaaay superior than gran turismo in graphics i hope polyphony makes a huge jump in graphics for gran turismo 7 which is rumored to be release with the ps5 f1 with tanga watching this on a iphone 5 is this real life or a video game pc or playstation sound tamiya motor toy car sound amazing race the best last lap whats up with gear unavailable im losing a lot of time with that which camera settings do you have pound the like button if you were also waiting for vettel to crash any moment d what is name game you missed one more lap of pressure and you won i wish codemaster make a change on the pit stop crew something like they can make a small mistake where the tire not attach properly to your car or hiring better pit stop crew so you can get the chance to get pit stop speed below 2 second top awesome race shut up jeff copy that can u custumize the hud aarava pls concentrate more on driving than talking the game makes hamilton look shit not fair at all he should be unstoppable 337 dont want to be that guy but its q1 sir has anybody got any tips on lowering gear box wear 100 distance without upgrading parts f1 should have more crashes car flips laps seven i think you can pit now full safety car at the beginning because its too close i dont think you should pit yo dumbass u turned in verstappen u blind or smt my career has almost a safety car every race especially tracks like australia baku monaco austria ect sorry but tha t incident with butler was your fault you went for the apex wow your home race im in 6th year and i never saw a safety car baby off white helmet nobody aarav that collision was definetly not my fault can anyone gameshare me f1 on xbox at least david did not say lets talk about the engineer like damn i hear him do most of the time in toms vids its you fault you turned in sharp love your videos keep it up bruh the lack of safety cars is actually game breaking for me not for me i got the safety car twice in a race yeah its never aarav fault goodness gracious to many caps man and verstappen makes contact with us very clearly turns into verstappen aarava the safety car never comes out in a gp safety car aight imma head out please learn the bloody english language in hindsight we shouldve took the gamble ever heard of the past participle bloody imbecile what kind of moron are ya whats with the blue squares on pos 154 is that a wild aarava did anybody notice jeffs weather report it literally says quali

codemasters needs to fix the sc and vsc trigger conditions i swear wing breaks fall under vsc and that pulling off for retirement isnt even worthy of a vsc or sc do a road to glory episode pls aarav i thought this was a vanilla career when its torrential rain in the race the safety car gets pulled out aumatically that 1 person that disliked the video its not the rarest event love your vids greats out the netherlands nobody aarav when the safety car comes out omg the rarest event in the game love your content plz keep up the good work and when is the next road to glory episode i was on this secripn on an f1 video and i see your comment and at the same time this video wow ay waddup aarav greetings from bulgaria pog you the best best youtuber ever safety car is preparing for brexit finely a new episode early gang where you at first hey i used to do sims like this on psone in the late 90s and my brother used to laugh his head off at me and give me all sorts of shit 20 years later youve done the same thing and have over 400 thousand views nice lobby with a lot of fairplay before watching the video i was asking myself ayrton or bruno kappa the way he pronounces ayrton lol hamilton on p1 and vettel on p2 screw vettel i can never tolerate him after what happened in canada last year hamilton will beat him before his hero senna could overtake him hamilton in the last lap hey ayrton its james how do you get the engineer to talk you senna would not accept the current f1 cars at this point how many 100 races have you done at monaco ben is like you live there already hahaha enjoyed every single one tbh when hamilton is behind you senna its james voice crack at 1316 how much for the game prost in the ferrari around monza 100 do u use brake assist its literally impossible without it so senna and schumaher werent real life drivers this is a huge gap since f1wgp n64 say eh please its so lucky to have the riccardo hamilton edition 0000 how is riciardo there why is ricciardo on your background 525 the screen went blurry this is the second time i heard my name from a f1 youtuber first aldas now ben racing at 100 id be half asleep by lap 30 haha the real god thing to see that this helmetdesign still stands out of all the otherstodays helmets simply dont have any character anymore maybe they should the audio name the magician cause magic senna does anyone know how to deploy the safety car in f1 2019 for the ps4 i dont understand whats going on are you driving a car or observing a race i ask because you peek in to other drivers and also see replays can you have race commentators on would love the commentary screaming when i overtake someone surely senna would be in ferrari that feeling when you finnish p3 2233 ayrton its james we need you to box for wets they use petronas in malaysia motogp use f1 race that mean they still support malaysia wtf that couldve been sennas son racing for mercedes unfortunately he never had one easter egg was ricciardo at the start says the game is realistic in real life you would crash 308 times passing hamilton up the hill in overtake mode and the rain light is flashingway to go codies the light should only flash when harvesting on a straight or when rainingits time to fix it senna is the best of the history how do u race as senna or prost in modern cars did you mod to get him in a gp because i have the legends version but i have to go through carrear mode if senna was racing today he wouldve been banned before monaco when a game gp is more entertaining then some irl gps how do you get ricciardo on your start screen was thinking the whole time you were playing with bruno senna should of made it a wet race and made him start from 16th this game is super unrealistic gasly in 3rd leclerc stuck behind a williams a williams running in the points a dead man behind the wheel and vettel as the second driver oh my how are you able to drive as senna or prost in the modern cars in f1 2019 far out how are you not getting cutting penalties youre literally taking short cuts try keep it on the track why is your fuel on minus right after the start love the f1 2010 paddock music pls post a video of your reaction and view of alexander albon to red bull and gasly to torro rosso nice video keep going with these f1 2019 gameplay 426 coretion if you dont go for a gap that deusent exist you are no longer a racing driver sad by ayerton senna its just alfa romeo racing in 2019 do career i wait for it senna said that yes a very good 100 race around monaco with a great battle between both mercedes did you do another career mode save to make this video btw 259 sprice up nice english ben daly hamilton isnt that great of a driver he just has a better car and unlimited money you pit him against senna in equal cars and senna wins hamilton has never had to really race senna said the if you dont go for a gap you are no longer racing driver quote senna is the best f1 driver of all the times is this career mode we are competing to win if you no longer go for a gap that exists then you are no longer racing driver ayrton senna so is senna in the normal version of the game too or do you need the legends edition i dont know what i should get the normal one the anniversary edition or the legends edition cringe worthy material the last thing i wanna do is chuck it in the barrier at turn one you mean like what he did to prost in japan 90 shut up already senna all the way boys nice video please tell me what settings have you applied for steering linearityetc i feel like steering is impossible big lag thanks great video and great tribute how did you get a new career mode made if you used the same account as the one you use for your career mode and other video content which i like at 210 how is it possible that norris did 111512 and starts in 12th with no penalty when the pole time was a 1min 15 seconds laptime is it because it rained unrealistic arcaadeish overtake on lap 68 not blame you nor me just game if im not mistaken senna drive for ferrari so why in this world you chose a mercedes did you run out of fuel in the last lap or did you want lewis to get closer why do you guys always play with the tcam why not cockpit its literally just this guy driving a mercedes with a different name thats is the thing that makes the f1 boring it would be great if we could save our names and be called by our names who agree with my opinion if yes live a thumb up if no live a comment i have the legends edition but cant drive senna and prost httpsyoutuberwsmpaaqzba sorry f1 2019 but the real sound is here when senna hopped into a new f1 car that was starting to get electronics in it he found it different he couldnt handle the car like he did before and that caused his death damage on hit the wall multiple times clips his wing and other cars wings multiple suspension shunts while hitting other vehicles takes no damage yep another codemasters arcade racer hamilton has absolutely no luck is the most ridiculous quote of this video the s in charles and the c at the end of leclerc are not silent watchlisten to his interview on the f1 youtube channel beyond the grid he introduces himself at the very beginning how did you get ricciardo in the menu screen what a amazing race and video im brazilian and i really appreciate this race senna is a national hero in brazil it was awesome see the sennas helmet on a race again even on a game wonderful video ben ham would smoke senna if they drove the cars of today senna would smoke ham if they drove cars from early 90s ham would smoke senna if they drove spec cars seriously how hard is it for codemasters to get the freakin pit stops right get the steering wheel animation sorted i paid a lot for this game its now worse than the 2018 game howthefk is that possible put jolyon palmer in todays mercedes and even he could perform they should have all the playable drivers names in the audio name options just choose rain man ben its his nickname do a get fired challenge i have the legends edition how do you play as sennaprost in modern cars what the fia need to do to make f1 a lot more exciting implement a new rule simultaneously to the new regulations in 2021 which changes the old rule from top 10 drivers receiving points to top 15 drivers receiving points in motorsport manager you can do this and the points are allocated 25 20 16 13 11 10 9 8 7 etc until 1 point for 15th this completely opens up the championship in both the drivers and constructors as the midfield would constantly be battling for points and we all know how close the midfield battles are now imagine if points were up for grabs to get an advantage in the constructors championship 1 the performance of the cars are far too disparate for the midfield runners to get constant points problem solved although of course this might change with the new regulations but there are always going to be backmarkers arent there 2 the championship these days is never really close enough in both drivers and constructors to is this vettel win being investigated after the race or is the 5 sec penalty for vet update still to come he just renamed as senna it is him not sennas ai no team orders at mercedes james hold my beer valtteri tapes james to a wall i might do a bruno senna career now or maybe a nico prost career with senna or prost ace for career race start is very hard in 2019i always start bad tbh its more like hamilton vs tiametmarduk since it isnt a senna ai controlling the car why would they include the legends likenesses but not their names senna and my and my favorite driver the goat still lives hell never die hell live as long as we go for that gap forever senna its if you no longer go for a gap that exists you are no longer a racing driver and ayrton senna seth that rains far too much on f1 games were gonna juuuust get p2 proceeds to stop before the finish line what was the ai difficulty codemasters has a whole dlc dedicated to prost and senna that costs more money also codemasters lets not include their names in the commentary replays and highlights ingame are cool how i can play with senna wasnt senna referred to as the magician and prost was the professor use sennas throttle technique d if senna was in this race hed be wondering wtf happened to mclaren and williams everyone williams 18th in qualifying me kubica in 17th at the end of the first lap 434 i wouldnt worry mate even tho youve not been around as long as old codgers like me your enthusiasm for the sport and your respect for the history of f1 shows and youre providing us with entertainment what are the haters doing hope ur good 000 to be fair we found out what it would be like in 2010 2011 and 2012 even tho i heard loadsa ppl saying schuey made a mistake coming back im glad he did he was the best for years and even past 40 he was still keeping up with ahem half the grid if you play at 110 not chance win one single race why simplyyour drive is ridiculous 423 vettel said that xd if you dont go for the gap then go home i think he said it like that is it weird that i wanted leclerc more than verstappen to win in austria while im dutch netherlands your commentary name could be mr monaco 6 time winner in monaco you have mr monaco in the commentary names and you go for the scientist game has ayrton senna character but no ayrton senna audio name nice one senna the best big boss if legends has gone to the trouble to have the images of these drivers it kind of honestly surprises me that they havent also added commentary snips so that yes you can have senna spoken in the game it just seems like an odd omission i wondered why graham hill was called mr monaco when senna broke that record of his retard supports codemasters bs by buying the legendary one gg so helpful dude only misses the rain you really represents senna in monaco fantastic drive you should drive him in the brazilian grand prix by any chance same distance and same task 100 distance starting 20th on the grid why the video quality is so low even in 1080p senna the goat end of hamilton vs vettel norris etcor senna vs mansell piquet prost schumacher berger etcpoint is senna faced better opposition and dominated from 8891 and was even better in the rain he was feared and respected by all and won during a time when computers were at their infancy and drivers relied on mechanical downforce and had very little safety measures in place when he was killed in 94 drivers worldwide payed their respects even dale earnhardt mentioned him after a win at darlington and payed respect to a legend he was quite simply just better than everyone else in the mclaren mp44 and seemed to have been born to race rip ayrton lewis and senna thee racers racers hamilton gets to race against his idol in other words how we wanted bruno sennas career to go 113 no matter how many times i rewatch it i can only see a grand statue of a buttplug why even pretend to be senna if you are just going to be yourself epic video really enjoyed but senna has nothing to do with it or am i missing something does playing senna give you different stats or something can you please say fettel and not vettel almost every word in german with an v in front is pronounced with an f drivers were great for their era but some were ahead of their time micheal schumacher was a class above everyone until his very end senna was putting one on top and against the best of his era of fantastic drivers then lewis has come along and i think only really max would have a chance up against him in equal machinery so when people say hamilton is not the best driver of all time i think youd find if he were put against senna or schumacher hed be a fair bit quicker as drivers in general have got progressively better and lewis always seems to increase his level with each threat and challenge hes given this video remembers me about my race in the seconds season of my career mode with my overtake with a divebomb on charles leclerc at turn 8 the corner before the tunnel portier d 118 is that a huge buttplug when you said up next is giovanazzi sounded like you said gio the nazi as you play pc can you edit the game files and let ayrton sennas ai race against the current grid oh god is that real rumor has it that senna spun out in qualifying because he still dont get it this is a very poor video idea and execution bud if you no longer go for a gap that exists you are no longer a racing driver was said by ayrton senna im my career mode williams came 6th and 7th wtf there were statistics released on kaggle that showed that hamilton wouldve been faster than senna in the 1988 honda based on throttle usage brake efficiency and car potential it was a machine learning algorithm that came to the conclusion however it didnt take into account manual gear shifts with heel and toe braking which arguably adds a lot of difficulty to the driving can anyone explain me the damage system in online races sometimes the opponents are ghosts and sometimes they are there no ben that isnt possible yeah right senna starts 20th on the grid in monaco he should probably be starting 1 lap ahead with his qualifying pace and mastery especially in monaco no senna nor ayrton name in the game seriously codmasters 430 the person who said that is the guy whos driving tbh i think the whole f1 2019 game is controversially disappointing it is worth a 10 dlc from 2018 at most the rivalry aspect could have been expanded to such a satisfying degree codemasters are happy to send influencers early access but for some reason wont listen to the influencers suggestions to make the game better go figure 0 i really like this 100 race videos hamilton couldnt even lace ayrton boots if they raced in real life wanker tbh i think he could have go to the 1 stop since his first pitstop had tyres in the 30s u have the professor and the scientist makes sense anybody elses game crashes randomly on pc i wish their was community creations for helmets and gloves like wwe this proves that vettel is best hamilton needs to outperform his car before anyone can compare him to senna why do you have to do 100 races on a track where nobody overtakes no one do it on a power track with heavy fueltyre management ffs it feels so fictional watching you overtake drivers in monaco which would be non existent irl even if you were an f1 athlete should let the hamilton and senna ai race hamilton vs senna vettel wins by 30 sec lol can anyone game share f1 2019 with me please on ps4 it is not senna it is benjamin in a mercedes o 100 race in 25 minutes wow ben you are fast vettel beating both anyone else notice charles is lead driver over seb i didnt watch the race but going off the hamilton rosberg incident verstappen would get a penalty since rosberg did if you no longer go for a gap youre no longer a racing driver pastor maldonado 1958 what was that u should do michael vs seb on spa or hokenheim max is the greatest driver of his generation damn austria was crap i dont get why they did have senna and prost as audio names how long would it take for crofty to say two names i think senna wouldnt be a good driver in todays f1 beacuse he was flatout guy in the race it would be very hard to win because of the tyre management since ayrton also has an ai you could mod him into career mode and look how hes doing shouldve medium to hards use me as a verstappen deserves the win 100 button waoh amazing overtaking what level of difficulty do you play yo can someone help me when i rev the car at the start my wheel just starts turning right when i reach 10k rpm whilst standing at the red light got a fanatec wheel no assits pls someone help me so you are saying that you are as good as senna sure bud can you put the senna ai in a modern car you cant drive as senna if you want to know if hes faster or slower you must have the senna as a ai to see that kimi p10 with a lap 4 seconds faster than hamiltons pole time senna in this game doesnt really look like senna thought why did you slow down at the end 001 in canada they have stroll and hamilton and now i see that in australia they have lewis and ricciardo which is really cool for proof see ar12s videos senna here in brazil was also called chefe or boss nobody ben and we are just going to get p2 george russell driver of the day for not locking down the bottom 12 viva la williams id prefer next career mode but ah well and max takes the win if senna raced in this era in a mercedes then he would probably meet with the fia senna his number was 27 not 12 everyonedamn lec almost win that honda rule now me how tf williams is in 18 position how many flashbacks needed to get that ending right haha just about got p2 good job there lad williams didnt lock out the last row also williams we are the champions aarava and ben uploading on the same time penalty for max hamilton out of the podium nonhamilton fans this puts a smile on my face benmonacogreat racing i went to look up f1 2019 on xbox 1 but i cant buy or download it can you do michael shummacher with ferrari this is absolute bait for rf1circlejerk how we at boyos austrian gp was fucking lit hamilton finally pulled his dick out of the podium for once max raced to his fuckin max and ferrari did ok for once fucking lit race ben sennas nickname was ayrton magic senna capital video as always you are on an absolute tear keep it up early what do you think about the incidentverstappenn leclerc i think it was kinda clean max pussed him of the track damn i completely forgot you could pick the faces for the legends edition i was so disappointed with the lack of content for the legends edition that i didnt check the avatar options what do you guys think of the verstappenleclerc incident the scientist vs the professer would be nice some people say max fcked leclerc up some say he maxed him up perfectly timed upload ben right after the f1 when im still in a good mood d f1 2069 gameplay monaco 100 race world champion that year vs verstappen verstappen goat you forgot who was senna driving for it was mclaren dude not mercedes can this day get any better any career mode today ben woohoo what a race at spielberg austrian gp then a tiametmarduk video man im having one of my best days god damn arabs and ben uploading same time wtf notification squad where you at after the race verstappen disnt need penality ben calibrating maxs breaks at austria gp start today max got his best win also the best race of the season ferrari fans think that he deserves a penalty for passing leclerc wow im fast just like these two third max might a penalty for that punt actually first to say what an exciting race austria has given props to vert and leclerc and clearly honda is on top of their game on this era yo this rivalry is like ksi vs logan paul 2 lmao 13 is actually a bad number tmatn2 are you will do another f1 episode what steering wheel hey iracing i would go with ferrari even though they might want more out of you with that car you will have a better performance so you can give them what the want because of how much power the car will have this game looks amazing im downloading it now 22 steam folks the ai driver level is very easy its okey i love this game no joke i got it for christmas dammmm what is it about him and that reporter its a kind of stupid to get crazy and act like a champ cause winning races while playing on super easy ki on 20 the other cars are nearly standing this is too late to say now but damn dude you suck at racing xd the amount of opportunities you had to overtake is ridiculous on another note youre my fav youtuber you should go with mclaren because they are a pretty good team i think you would fit in i think butler likes your caricature more than your team mate your so selfish 630 should pick red bull best team ever my favorite too himill choose lucky number 13 meunlucky o called tmartin 2 but chooses 13 lol i tried drs and then go around at yas marina and i crashedthen got token out of the race still waiting on that season 2 i like this video but deven butler is a jerk and your raceing in austria rugbymadfan choose art if you play that mclaren is a good choose 1242 can i have your number just had to subscribe dude al the love fron indiakeep em coming its a beautiful game 1639 youre in austria hi you are cool hey i just wanted to know what equipment you are using to play the f1 game thank you you red bull 13 usually isnt used in f1 due to it being unlucky in the motorsport so i wont be surprised if you dont win half the time lukas has left the chat red bull i would join red bull haas theyre american the f2 car got no power steering in car tyres are remains samein f1 what does drs mean red bull question why does a racing game have better looking cgi people than other games where it would matter more lol astion martin redbull racing alfa romero or red bull aston martin lukas have gotten first place cool catit gave zero fux about you your video your monitor or anything else what wheel are you using and are on console or pc what wheel are you using and are on console or pc whens the next stranded deep coming if you car is wide its always the front wing not the tyres i need this game so bad red bull red bull what wheel did you use in this video ok im not an f1 so pls what is drs okay youve gotten a wheel thats step 1 from being a noob but if youre gonna play in tcam youre always gonna be a noob 1800 you hit the drs checkpoint after the car in front which is why you got drs and he didnt perfectly timed mercedes wins because of there better engines even though ferrai is faster why did he not go with mercedes the ferrari is the fastest man are u using controller love that cat show the entire race the way you play and comment is extremely entertaining dont you dare edit out parts how to download this game i like it so much i want to play it i played moto gp so i decided to play it too i was wondering why he hit the brake so fast on that turn lol aston martin what wheel does trevor use this is formula 2 not 1 im telling you aston martin red bull racing is the way to go 3409 cross eye agent red bull aston martin sign with aston martin bro it would be sweet to see a honda engine killing everything red bull or renualt austria the red bull circuit cool video more such highlights are warmly welcome from tmartn2 ur driving with 40 ai they dont give full throttle after a corner go aston martin red bull red bull second race in red bull ring spielberg you should stop and then you go pass him and then try to get first toro roso would be a nice challenge the drs detection sone is a bit before the drs sone so if you are less than one second behind in the detection sone and overtake him before the drs sone you still can use drs even though you are ahead is this another season u stop playing half way through like mlb 13 is my lucky number that i wear on my travel baseball jersey toro rosso man do it in easy please i beg you are getting better results than others why didnt you select number 14 cause thats double 7 i would race will redbull ferrari is a good one to chose in your f1 2019 game i like red bull but i think you should try mclaren great vid btw tbh your driving really irritated me f1 2019 and norris albon and russel are in f2 red bull dont do one shot qualifying in formula 1 2019 it looks like they took some steps in the right direction with the game i love what ive seen so far and im thinking about purchasing the game go with mclaren we have the same lucky numbers lol the race trac is the red bull ring i dont believe you know much about f1 because kimi rikknen runs number 7 do u have the steering wheel setup hi can u try out fifa 19 career mode i think it will be fun thank you the number 7 is not available because kimi uses that number keep grinding bro ome of the best gamers you were right in saying it was simulated to let him pass to go along with the story line of the gamemaybe you should do a dummy run again just to see what the convo is when you actually let him pass u got me curious as to what would be the different outcome to the story line max verstappen had to worry about a large lizard on the track so im sure a cat would be no problem for him hahahaha if you are within a second of the person in front of you at the detection zone you are able to use drs even if you pass the person before the activation zone way to go with the american team i hate lewis and mercedes is only fast on the corners lol vettel is all over the straight lol techlany yes you do use drs behind but theres something called a drs detection zone where as long as you are within one second behind at that point you get drs on the coming straight and get a boost i guess you could say but i suppose your a fast learner lol represent america i know your fairly new to this but 36 outta 37 would not be the last lap in racing lol bella is an enemy of progress you suck return to mario kart jeez that guy sounds like gareth walker from fifa 18s the journey renault race along with ricardo red bull race with verstappin one of those two would be good if only nascar heat was like this dude i love watching your videos your passion for games just keep me coming back cool video please go with red bull or ferrari mclaren if thats how u spell it i just downloaded the 2018 game awesome game really enjoying it i was a game tester in f1 2019 check out my name in qa game credits he wants to adjust the difficulties but keeps the green lines on the track if you didnt know number 7 is used by kimi raikkonen aston martin red bull team red bull you can use drs when overtaking asswell just so there no danger between the 2 drivers bro wtf this is white peoples nba2k mycareer if u need any techniques for f1 2019 go to ar12 hw been doing this for long time more overtakes than a full f1 season take the haas you can come in top 5 every time little tip rn i honestly think that having the camera view in the bottom left is better since there is almost never anything there and i thing that it would look a lot better because having it right next to the race leaves the viewers to have the issue of not full view of the screen this isnt rlly critiquing more like giving a hint of what other people dont want to say i hope that you see this and use it at least once just for the experience red bull i just got 2017 which is great cant wait to play this in 2023 lol im a true yorkshire man so i dont pay more than 15 quid a game lol go with mclaren just because they have nice cars its really hard to use controller at this game its really hard to use controller at this game you should sign with mclaren theres a guy at my gym that i swear looks exactly like yo trev ive been so tempted to ask his name but im pretty sure it is not you you should go with mclaren full race i love the game take redbull red bull or mclaren what wheel is he using i like pretty much how you can set up your avatar like that i wish theyd do the same with gt stop talking and learn to drive in cockpit view go for alfa romeo 1830 dude sometimes you gotta lick that stamp and send it mclaren for your f1 team pls can i get an activation key for the f1 2019 pls can i get an activation key for the f1 2019 drs is activated if you are within 1 second of the driver in front at the detection zone which is how you were able to activate it id die for a nascar game this indepth you should of named him ling long dingaling or bing bao no racisim intentended red bull team aston martin hass ftw u look like nf the rapper bro you get pointss for overtsking u fd ur team lol f1 isnt sll about who wins i do like to see the f1 content but to make it a bit more interesting turn the ai up and some of the assists off as that is why it kinda broken as all the ai were just taking the racing line and not going for overtakes go haas since you are american is this only on xbox 13 yesssss thats the best lucky number 13 is my birth day put a wheel cam red bull racing plss was your face cam a potato this time red bull nice races mani have f1 10 and its pretty cool but not as cool as this one this guy is like theradbrads little brother lol am i the only one who saw that weber got 3rd so why is he complaining 2535 holy crap the timing dude mclaren all the way go for hass reason for drs when in front you were within 1 sec on detection line how did you even get up there psttt cats can jump you know you got drs off albon at austria because you were behind him at the detection point only ogs remember the video of him walking around at like a park after him and his girl broke up alfa romeo and pair up with the iceman rikknen the best personality in the real scene didnt know you watched f1 xd currently smashing it with redbull monaco was absolutely shite to race on aston martin it matches your name aston martin it goes with trevor martin red bull i like seeing the whole race you are adding a lot of dialogue which makes it more interesting hell i will be getting this game for myself i say go with mclaren uh i prefer to skip the avatar making thingiemagigie red bull a racing game with a storyline awesome haas all the way seems like u could get them to a championship 101 hes already racist but do practices each track and short quali i died when he said red bull for the red bull teams but it was really aston martin choose alfa youll be my teammate damn the mouth movement in this are pretty good please red bull you realize mclaren and renault are by themselves because they dont have a secondary team i thought we said last year you shouldnt do this again wow happy to stumble upon this i actually had to double take when i saw tmart and f1 austria this year was raucous keep up the career d dude i watch drive to survive trevor martn team tmt i just came from f1 austria red bull ring w would choose renault the way drs works is based on the detection zones marked with circles on the minimap if you were within a second behind the leading car at the detection zone you will have drs at the start of the drs zone i dont know if this was already said or if youve figured it out in later videos who else thought that at 550 he sounded like chris smoove why does jeff lowkey sound like bear grylls gotta go with redbull great team for up and coming racers dont sleep on haas tho same trev watched the netflix drive to survive series then got into f1 no shame my guy your not a noob to me no highlights please use the drs and ers please in formula 1 in all seriousness my favorite youtuber playing my favorite series yesssssssssss this is cool but i miss mlb the show if you let your teammate pass you would the outcome have changed i would love for ferrari or mercedes but my dads company mapfre sponsors renault didnt know f1 even had a game with all the girls and their questions this game feels like a dating simulator lol but its cool i like the fact that nobody realised he is not playing with a wheel but controller nice choice you opted to have number 14 as your race number thats maldonadoa number maldonado was an f1 driver who had a reputation for crashing this will will go well you just started watching f1 you missed the good times its really dull now red bull is this on 20 ai ever consider a nascar heat series red bull do what the game tells u twat ive watched f1 for 10 years so of course we want you to do the full season red bull racing 1236 can i have your number i laugh so loudly lol aston martin red bull racing 2520 87 of americans on the road in f2 all cars are the same i guess he doesnt know this i want him to do mclaren 2050 no but they have to deal with up to 8 gs of force i love this game and ur my favorite youtuber and i like tmartn2can u do mercedes please lewis hamilton is in that team or do ferrari those would be what i would want hard yea but good edit oh yea and id love to see u in mercedes ferrari or the others respect for trying to get number 7 i like that number too trevor is pissing me off with his driving learn to how to drive plz drs works for the person being behind within 1 sec in the detection zone the detection zone is normally a corner or 2 before the straight itself so if a driver overtakes the opponent within these 2 corners hes going to have the drs although being ahead of the guy he just overtook wow my favroute number is also 7 full season please tmartn2 plays f1 the end is near joking aston martin aston martin 1227 wow her eyes 3 hahahahah tmartn just like me can i have your number 2028 what a beautiful adorable cat 2430 you are visiting and playing in a country race track near my country which is uae looking forward when you play on bahrain track my country trevor you should use medium traction control it is way better than full because you have more control and can go faster but you almost have to try to wreck to spin out please do wheel cams hell yea i love f1 this is gonna be awesome red bull can you play this on a console you tend to turn your wheel too much in the corners try turning of understeer enhance in the settings and your wheel should then stop snapping on you when you get past 45 degrees give it a try see what you think but from my experience playing this game and doing league racing it helps a lot go for mclarean great team red bull u can act like a comentator so u talk over d gamplay and highlights go with haas the wanna be best of the rest and you may be in the top to so haas is good for u ferrari ofc im more of a nascar person so idk how im gonna relate to this series redbull or mclaren why not be a black guy ferrari please pretty sure 13 aint a lucky number pls choose red bull if you can should pick mclaren what kind of wheel do you have red bull red bull please something wrong with your facecam bad quality for me i dont mind it but i was curious because you always have the best content if you dont know there is a thing called ers it gives you more speed depending on what mode you put it in however you have to recharge the ers because the higher mode you put in the faster it goes but it runs out quicker what wheel is he using the move that u did were on de second race u were on de out side then cut to the inside is called the switchback move haas team america your also watching drive to survive on netflix yay more f1 you have to put the difficulty more higher because it seems to easy the ai racers were taking challenges like blue flags i totally want this game for my birthday 2032 when youre girl thinks you texting someone besides her choose racing point i want you to pick mercedes know my favorite brand i need this game asap i would go for red bull and aston martin because why not red bull is a great team and you will be teamed up whit max you couldnt have chose a worse time to try and get into watching f1 its unbearable i think you should go mclaren or haas so put in a vote for both im pretty sure all f1 drivers have cats in the cockpit edit renault american boi driving with an american team haas thatll be cool try a 25 race so that you can create strategies during pit stops gosh his argumentation is so retarded aston martin id go with haas they seem really good i say red bull personally red bull play more what difficulty is this how easy is thisssss one the mini map there is little green circle at a certain point which is called the drs detection zone i you are within a second at that point of the track you get drs in the next zone trev go with haas they are not in the top level but still good enough red bull renault please continue this series i love f1 moto gp please go red bull or renault you need to find a difficulty level where you do as the car should and then let your skill do the rest imo to get the most fun out of this game is not actually winning but grinding and racing faster and slower cars so you experience it all mclaren after the day on e pastch theyll get a boost in car speed and probs will be the best of the rest as they call it itll will be good mid pack racing but also allow you to develop the car thorugh the season to get up to the top three teams red bull ferrari and merc stick with haas also increase the difficulty thats why you fly by everyone on the straight go up to like hard or medium word of advise dont fulllock every corner it slows you down you need to choose a lower ranking team so you can work your way up instead of being expected to qualify fifth like every time turn your game volume up 7 is my favorite number to turn off assists and increase the difficulty go with renault or red bull increase the difficulty please do wheel cam just a gopro on your head underneath your selfie cam on the video would be awesome why not make a poll in the cards i looked at the comments and i think im one of the few people that want you to go with mclaren so is it even worth saying pretty sure its unlucky 13 not lucky 13 great series trevor gotta go with the best mercedes all the way haas is a good midfield team to choose wheel cam go with mclaren red bull this will be a great series red bull bro you can up the difficulty because if you have a turbo issue is critical and you will lose so many positions but u gained so maybe 75 pls take red bull red bull aston martin so you can sing aston martin by ricky ros when you win started watching f1 with the 2019 season you poor boy haas as the primary choice mclaren as the second red bull racing as a f1 game veteran i would choose renault as you will be competitive with the rest of the field and can challenge up front very well pick either mercedes or ferrari go with haas gnther steiner for the win join red bull welcome to the f1 family its fine to hear that you watch f1 sometimes question for everyone who reads this whos your favorite team and driver for this year i go with mclaren lando norris choose mclaren sign with haas 232 anyone else see the wtf1 logo on the front wing trevor show us the full qualifying and show the highlights of a 50 race trevor show us the full qualifying and show the highlights of a 50 race i like to drink red bull so go with red bull and plus you will race against mercadecs and fefrai take red bull watch their yt videos on how cool and fun their team is up the difficulty go with red bull and release them from the underperforming gasly you and max will conquer the ferraris and mercs together love the vid ps i would increase the difficulty a bit definitely go with haasd mclaren pls i will pray to the f1 gods its not weber you pronounce it vaiber mclaren or red bull continue please and if can then renault team racing i say go for mclaren hey trev when you get to f1 make sure you dont show the full race because then the videos would be over an hour long go with red bull go with mclaren love if from suriname go for haas astin martin red bull racing hes liking all the comments with haas in it go for redbull my guy 13 july is my bday so lucky number 13 red bull or haas your choice keep up the good work why does his camera quality look so bad red bull just go for the f aston martin racing play need for sped the run its amazing thought the thumbnail was legit you as alonso always says you always have to leave a space all the time you have to leave the space i think it seems easy to u as u were playing the crash go kart game go mclaren and you can be with lewis hamilton i would go with ferrari or red bull please make this a go with red bull racing please choose mercedes i would go for mclaren or red bull racing red bull red bull red bull alfa because kimi rikknen is in there or mercedes caus valtteri bottas ferrari it will be fun to watch you win this guy doesnt have to worried his tyres are cold red bull hey trev if you want climb the ladder in your career you should definitely choose a midfield team like haas as you suggested but alfa romeo is also fun btw drs is measured at a point in the lap right before you can activate it if you were behind the driver at that measuring point and you overtake the driver in front before the activation line you can still use drs and the driver behind doesnt i really like this series and you must choose red bull i dont know anything about f1 but i think you should go with haas also keep up the good work trev kimi has the number 7 red bull for sure i really enjoyed this episode and i believe that highlights would be better for the video another episode plz red bull all the way men i love how you have a wheel and your still leaning lmao no highlights i like seeing everything also every driver gets paid to race each lap there hardest and thats how it should be red bull best option max verstappen its too easy for you tmartn up the difficulty a little bit pick either maclearn or redbull house flipper upload these episodes daily please i loved it and yea do go for mc laren or aston martin my god as an esports driver in f1 this hurts to watch good career continue trevor that first race u did u was meant to be slower than ur team mate but u had the difficulty too low mclaren is a great car to race to take it from mid field to the top please choose ferrari red bull all tha way red bull why do you brake behind cars just go around if youre faster please continue the series you and your fans literally need to be gassed i think you should go with red bull cause you can work you way up in f1 with a bit of a challenge and in the end it will prob be more fun buttttt redbull gives you wings so you cant beat that if your looking for a challenge and somewhere to learn how to play it would be good to start with someone like maclaren renault or toro rosso looking forward to who you pock and i always enjoy your videos keep it up aston martin redbull racing renault or red bull red bull you should choose the maclaren team for your f1 career aston martin go for them choose mclaren try traction control off nooo number 24 is the way to go jeff gordon i would love to see you pick ferrari thats one of my favorite f1 teams red bull all the way man you can easily overtake in turns i would go for alfa romeo because they are famous for making good racers and you become teammate with kimi rikknen you should probably choose either renault or haas as they are both good cars who compete at the top of the midfield as well as competing with red bull in some circumstances aston martin red bull or mclaren alfa romeo or haas pls continue i really like this game mclaren haas or renault theyre not in that top bracket but are nicely positioned for you to work your way up do mclaren more longevity for the series ferrari or red bull and youll be winning by race 3 itll get dull red bull you should choose maclaren go with mclaren you should do dive bombs on corners it will improve your place in the race red bull red bull red bull aston martin bro if u dont choose ferrari or red bull just imagine bella is an engineer tinkering with the settings yo tmartn go with mclaren thats a good team and has a lot of fast cars bro go to aston martin redbull ferrari is the best choice red bull for the win red bulll red bull ftw you should do edits of races haas bc they are a okay team and could use a rebuild aston martin red bull choose aston martin red bull mclaren please this looks like real awesome 0 red bull 100 i would highly recommend you to watch tiametmarduk i think it would help you a lot the drs drag reduction system has a detection point before every drs zone if youre within 1 second behind of the car infront of you at that detection zone then youll get drs no matter if you overtake the car infront great video and i know the series is going to be awesome but you need to fix your wheel you shouldnt need to turn the wheel all the way around to get the car around also when using drs make sure to stay behind the car in front for slipstream try to get mercedes red bull aston martin if you want a young and cool team red bull racing is a great choice red bull fan id say haas because there a decent team in the midfield a little work on the car itll be up there with red bull mercedes and ferrari there an american team aswell so itll work well with your nationality yo is there a site that i can try my luck and try to win some cars or what not my brothers friends cousin is in the hass f1 team im 13 too haha i picked red bull very solid car go with aston martin red bull racing youll have the option to race with one of the best up and coming talents in the field max verstappen and as a bonus they have a rivalry with ferrari and mercedes for taking the lead for the season their cars are fast through the corners but quite sluggish when it comes to straight line speed so with the difficulty set higher up i think youll have an absolute blast racing with them and taking names with the red bull redbull has some the youngest and flashy drivers and team the ones you like are all good teams but i say mclaren is the best to go you could go with your home team haas american team but there less experienced than the other teams mclaren is good place to start if your just starting f1 the want to be quick near the end not at the start they will always push to make the car as fast as possible and they do quick pit stops play red dead online again should pickredbull or torrsross pick mercedes plz if nor go redbull sign for red bull and post full races not just highlights to make it more intense and interesting live stream the whole race and make high lights for vids trev play nhl 20 you can create a player and have a series like the show dont choose a top 3 teamred bull mercedes ferrari if you choose alfa romeo or haas you could go the next season to ferrari becouse they are ferrari junior teams you are american so you can choose the only american team haas so haas is the perfect choice do ferrari if you want to start off high if not do mclaren oh my gosh please trev play super seducer 3 with chelsea dont turn the wheel to full lockyou cause understear by doing that red bull red bull i think you pick redbull because you have opportunity to win the championship go with redbull or mclaren go to red bull id say go toro rosso so later you can get into redbull easier which is nice cuz it competes with ferrari and mercedes and then later on make the step to mercedes ferrari in my opinion ferrari is the best also mercedes is good but ferrari is the best i support them 100 aston martin pick mclaren or redbull because why not right mc laren is the best bet can i have your number got me hahaha great vid please go with mclaren to bring back their glory days take off some assists to make it more challenging trevor where is mlb road to the show 19 id say go for ferrari or red bull especially when youre going to be increasing the difficulty these 2 teams will be more competitive than the others also if you want to make it more fun and challenging you can turn off traction control and abs but you will need to trail brake slowly releasing the brake as you start turning in as for race distances and lengths you can choose 5 laps 25 or 50 of full race distances to experience pit stops and tyre degradation like so he sees please go renault they have the sexiest car and theyre a decent midtier team too renault because theyre the best of the rest outside ferrari mercedes and redbull team mclaren you should do a wheel cam trev really cool series please do a full season if not more mclaren or renault or haas plz any of these 3 you picked the ferrari driver academy so you should go with either haas or alfa romeo go red bull alfa romeo 75 difficulty and 25 race petronasrenault f1 teammclarenaston martin red bull teamtoro roso and trevor keep at good work and love to watch all f1 2019 racing please continue this series this is so much fun to watch and i know everybody is going to enjoy the vids that you make imo red bull would probably be the best pick because they arent quite as dominant as they used to be but you are still up there with verstappen and such go with a middle team there is way more action in the midfield so i would go for mclaren renault or haas go haas because you are an american and haas is an american team aston martin red bull i think you should join the renault formula 1 team go with max 2254 mehe a fliping russian go with alfa romeo and look at youtube at max verstappen hype you then know why and go with redbull i would choose redbull becouse they are the best with max go for alfa remeo aston martin red bull that fits in well right i would definitely watch if you did a full season take the ferrari mclaren for sure pick red bull please choose mercedes or ferrari dude bro choose ferraris team ferrari would be good if not then mclaren r u able to do more gta plz when the new casino dlc comes out alfa romero because alfa has more interest and is one of the slowest car but you can upgrade and made the car faster id say go with aston martin red bull or mclaren both very solid this is going to be a good series love your videos tell cooper and koda i said hi i was thinking ferrari such a good car in the actual f1 its faster then mercedes in the straights go for red bull nail em in the wall trevor 2019 should go with one of the top 3 and amazing driving i cant even drive like that in a racing game you should go with toro roso there really slow in a straight line but fast in the corner i would say alfa but in your 4 choices id pick haas but you really need to be more aggro in driving and learn how to setup the car and choose strategies tiametmarduk has some good guides to that mclaren bring them back to the top pick mercedes aston martin youre trevor martin script writes itself go for haas or alfa romeo red bull go with redbull red bull or hass plz make this a long time thing like mlb take redbull it has sebastian vetel and it is good for competing you should choose a low end team then through the seasons you can work your way up to the big boys please pick redbull choose red bull do full season of this go with redbull red bull talking about young teams theres only two choices alfa and racing point both rebranded from the ashes of couple older teams that basically werent doing so good on the money side or on the track as to the cool the newbies would say that lewis is the cool on the grid but really kimi the iceman is the real deal so why not help alfa make a real impact w kimi join aston martin the american accent really stands out when they pronounce european words aha also trev your wheel is way too low it needs to be lower torso height red bull hello trevor nice video again as a french f1 fan ill be glad to answer any question about f1 or explain you strats and others things about it do not hesitate this is gonna be my fav series choose renault or red bull chose renault beacuse they are midfield team and claim you way up f1 you should pick haas f1 team if you cant get mercedes or ferrari try with williams or red bull or maybe even force india bruh 7 is my favourite and lucky number as well anywho you should continue this series i absolutely love racing games this game had me clinching my toes and i wasnt even playing it go with mclaren dude go with ferrari it ll be perfect for you the car is great but the drivers havent been performing on the desired level irl you could go with them because ferrari is kinda like the underdog compared to mercedes and thats because of hamilton you could challange him for the title i think it would be a good rivalry haas or redbull more realistic aproach whould be haas you should post the highlights only t looking forward for this series go with red bull pick redbull racing or renault because then you will be able to compete against the high tier teams i love red bull but i think you should honestly do alfa or mclaren makes it more fun to fight the midfield instead of gapping everyone in one of the top three with drs you can use it if youre within 1second if the car ahead when you cross the detection zone the white line on the floor at about 1747 even if you overtake the car ahead before entering the drs zone youll still be able to use it red bull pls go with renault with x can say want to team or devon butler i shouldnt be taking my hands of the wheel proceeds to take his hands of the wheel plz do red bull because their my fave team and im only gonna get f1 2019 if i see a red bull career wtf tmartn does f1 new favorite youtuber what wheel do you use trevor im voting for red bull racing ferrari is coolest and fastest f1 cars ever made mclaren boitheyre on the move this year you choose your favorite we dont tell you what too do you choose what you want and you are my favorite youtuber i just cant wait for the next episode its so exiting and please play on the wheel the whole series go with mc laren please choose mercedes 1810 drs activated because you had just passed the guy in front red bull if you want to see that beautiful place again watch the grandprix this weekend mclaren a once great team that has struggled massively over the past couple of years restore them to their former glory for now up the difficulty to 40 and if its to easy for practice and qualifying at melbourne then bump it up to 50 for the race on sunday like so trevor sees aston martin mclaren or aston martin id say go with alfa romeo as they are a backmarker but not terrible you can fight for points with them dont go for ferrarired bullmercedes or renault as you will finish in the same place every time ferrari are too op in this game choose mclaren and work your way to the top or go with ferrari and compete with mercedes as the best go with haas please do mclaren i feel like thats the perfect sweet spot nice game u should continue these series god please stick to driving in circles red bull aston martin would be my choice go with red bull or mclaren keep up the good work and say hi to cooper and koda for mep please man do mclaren you wont regret it pick haas mclaren or toro rosso haas can beat red bull because it is quicker in a straight line mclaren has a new feel to their team and a new driver line up toro rosso also has a young driver lineup if you pick renault one of your rivals you wont beat devon butler if you pick red bull one of your rivals are a pushoverlukas weber in game ferrrari is the best car play 25 races to start of if you feel its to short play 50 races for your ai play 75 hard if your picking a midfield team if you pick a top team play on 80 expert dont run elite to start of with because the cars are harder to drive this year if you want the most realism run these settings damage simulation safety cars on rules and flags on corner cutting strict you need to update the car to stay competitive minor upgrades 2 weeks major 3 weeks ultimate 4 weeks if you want to be even faster you dont need to turn the wheel fully right or left thats why you dont feel like the tires are gripping just just turn the wheel the exact amount and nothing more the you will be significantly faster love that you are making this a series keep up the good work red bull gives you wings go for mclaren it would be cool if u choose a midfield team and then upgrade the car during the season to make your way to the top perhaps alfa or mclaren or renault think about racing with louis hamilton mercedes of course red bull pick the red bull team id suggest haas an american team for an american driver and a good potential also you might wanna take a look at some videos from aarava or tiametmarduk could learn a thing or two red bull can be a good option to beat the 2 big ones ferrari mercedes aston martin red bull i would go red bull aston martin redbul and put the damage on full little tip braking for a corner you have to go on the accelerator instantly and if your close enough dive bomb them on the inside of a corner renault have good cars to have good places in races red bull will you retry iracing or nascar heat i like watching the hole race on this video its fun to see how much it takes to be able to do what you do haas all the way newer team with a lot to prove not to mention as the only team based in the usa could fit well with your driver and you could be their first champion rebull is a great team for a mid range car so i would recemend that ur cam is uh choose aston martin red bull its a pretty fair and decent choice they have a really good drive too youll probably keep getting a better car from them as you progress later on rest is up to you and yea pls do this full series and dont show the entire race only the key moments of the race would be fine continue the series in my opinion alfo romeo is a good team to start with they arent one of the best and your team wont be asking for a lot in the races why not do highlights as one series with full sessions as another and give that cat some extra treats since i pretty much had to subscribe after seeing that let your teammate pass you tmartn hold my speed what kind of golden retriever is coop go with mclaren i would say ferrari if you want to be competitive or mclaren i think ferrari or mclaren would be cool red bull either alfa romeo or renault i think whole racers would be better like whole baseball games with the mlb series i say you go with hass since its american or go with toro rosso they have a really young team please do a full season love the vids do the aston martin one trev do mclaren its a midfield team that with the right driver can compete with the top guys instead of just putting it on easy mode with the best cars also dont feel like you have to talk most people they play these games understand you need concentration so if you go quiet well understand ferrari in my honest opinion would be the best option but a midfield team like renault or hass would be good redbull is a pretty good team too haas or mclaren would be a nice starting point tmartn cant wait for the upcoming series of f1 2019 red bull is the best forza ferrari cmon trev lets resurrect the winning days of ferrari on this series red bull redbull or mclaren go red with ferrari red bull for sure trev you should go with haas id be cool for you to be an american driver for the american team do nascar heat 3 mclarenred bull drive for astonredbull id go with red bull or mclaren trevor i think haas is the best option because they are the only american f1 team and they are one if not the youngest one so i think haas it is pick ferrari because youre in the ferrari program and they are high value so yeah the highlights are more enjoyable to watch and go with haas go with mclaren they were one of the all time greats and you can lead them back to the podium what does drs mean red bull please do not stop i already love this video i love ferrari and mclaren pick between the two mclaren sportsmanship over showmanship i think joining haas would be your best bet you should learn about how to use the different fuel mixtures and please do at least a 25 race red bull in order to have drs you have to be within 1 second of the car ahead in the drs detection point which is a bit earlier on the track than the drs zone by the way love your vids go mclaren for sure bro also id love this as a full series different side to racing instead of fh4 red bull haas is american plus no one picks them for these playthroughs u took ur timr no you moron no one wants this we want episode 18 nba and we want motogp you kok sucker you should do renault they are fast but not to fast so its a challenge renault would be the best fit theyre not a cop out like mercedes or ferrari but they can still just as easily compete with the best and they value sportsmanship over everything i appreciate how he pronounced albon correct i meant to say you can break later than any other team it makes it to where you can get through this corners way faster trust me actually join redbull join ferarri do not go pass 107 ai level because u will never win i think alfa romeo or aston martin definitely red bull compete with the top guys red bull racing trevor everyone is doing mcclaren hass is my choice pick mclaren redbull keep doing what u doing tmartn can you do face cam and weel cam at the same time i am a avid f1 fan but the drive to survive series was something of its owni loved that series and i am waiting for season 2 play forza motorsport with the wheel pick mclaren i vote for red bull and this f1 racing series will be interesting red bull keep on making these videos and do a full series on it hi can u keep uploading this game because i really like it red bull or ferrari go with ferrari like if you agree wheel cam plz red bull please do a full season and chance mclaren they have reliable engines wait wtf 38 that fast do am redbull racing i have ps4 xbox play ps4 better get confused with x on xbox than ps4 like the series keep it up mclaren could be the one to go with you should do what hollows doing and play gta 5 either renault or red bull would be good in my opinion love you by the way trevor keep up the good work definitely should choose aston martin two martins connect or has hey tmartn u would go for haas and check your insta dms i would say to go with alpha romeo they have the highest interest in you which could mean good paychecks along with them not being to upset if you dont get a podium finish a time or two do full races definitely and race for mclaren redbull definitely suits you the best you should go for the martin also love all your vids especially the rage ones keep up the good stuff i would like to see some dirt 20 now that youre using the wheel go with ferrari haas all the way man youll do great with them mclaren for sure red bull drive red bull mclaren hands down no you should have a steering camera from the back i meant to say you can break later than any other team it makes it to where you can get through this corners way faster trust me please do a lot more of this its really fun to watch and i like the graphics and stuff but like im saying please do more of this what quality is that face cammm aston martin red bull im currently playing f1 racing 2018 and trust me red bull all the way they have the best braking and the best top speed you can break earlier than any other car in the field and you have better acceleration i dont follow f1 racing but this series is really cool plz do a full play through and i think u should go to mclaren red bull or renault i would say go with f1 drive to survive series was one of the best netflix series ive ever seen hoping miami gets approval soon because one day i want to experience a live f1 race red bull ferrari please been watching for years love the vids and also cooper and koda keep up the great vids think you should go with redbull or mclaren definitely go mclaren especially with your sportmanship answers to the interviews red bull start in the midfield with either toro rosso mclaren renault or alfa romeo and work up do red bull no balls definitely go with renault so you can fight in the midfield and try to catch up to the top 3 its not the car its the driver so who cares if you pick amg or ferrari go for red bull for a top fight but for the mid field go renault or mclaren haas because it is only american team f1 is super fun to watch and i will enjoy watching the series if you do make you are also one of the best youtubers ive seen and im a huge fan i think you should go with mclaren some of this driving is tough to watch man choose redbull trev choose ferrari or mclaren redbull team would be fun you should really make a poll i vote red bull make sure you have steering and braking assist off too go with renault because you can work your way up to being as fast as the ferrari cars lets show those euro driver whos boss team haas tmartn you would be better off setting youre wheel to 360 degrees in the wheel profile so you wont have to turn the wheel so much go renault preferred or red bull auston martin 3rd rb and 4th ren fastest ferrari is fastest and mercedes is 2nd for some odd reason if this was me i would do alfa romeo basically covered everything you said you were looking for in a team i say haas racing never won a championship so you can get there first like pick haas american team american driver at 133 there was coopers name red bull go with aston martin redbull im hoping mclaren is your choice they have a great reputation and beautiful cars you can always upgrade to ferrari once you establish yourself mclaren is my pick big time supporter i am so excited about this series i would like either redbul or the mclaren teams hey trev go for renault red bull aston martin free sponsorships and it goes with your last name renault or red bull or toro rosso renault for sure even tho i like the mercedes i think renault would be a good choice midfield team fast good car perfect choice ferrari foe show man go for haas it is american team you should go to redbull be cocky as hell please please do the full season renault choose them bout time i see the sim love it trev go with the williams trev it has to be hass youre american dude and hass is american owned also new to formula 1 think this would be a perfect choice trev u should check out the new spider man far from home vr trevor you need to read trev you need to change the race to 25 or 50 and the pit stops can change the race on the strat can change the hole thing and the harder the tier the longer it last but the grip is less and it is slower and the softer tier the faster but it last and the ers is important for you to use and in the beginning you will be given choices for fuel and tire choices you will want to have about one to two laps extra on fuel so you can use rich mix more for a faster car i already know that i am gonna love this series you should pick mclaren anything you say to the press can become very very public umm yes emmathats generally how the press works hands down ferrari go with haas i love that series you should keep going for a part 2 go ferrari please play mlb again you should play monster jam steel titans you only done 3 episodes of f1 2018 and i really enjoyed it please do a full season of the game you will really enjoy it red bull for sure go with red bull since youre only doing one season upgrading goes fast and you can maybe bring red bull to the top red bull plz full series pleaseand trev you can skip up to the parts when you get ahead one by oneit would be the best watching this when u were picking ur team i was thinking where is the lambo red bull the f2 cars

video out of all the sport games so far this one besides nba is probably my new favorite would love to see a full series of the game i would do mclaren go red bull they are like mid tier red bull gotta go with alfa romeo and prove yourself mclaren or red bull have grosjean has your teammate hes a fan favorite drop a link to the wheel that you got haas m8 its the americans mclaren choose them im a huge ferrari fan so obviously me personally i would go with ferrari oh and hey im going to send something to u guys you should pick mclaren aston martin i never got why there are points in racing but i loved adrenaline rush from watching this the surprise cameo from bella the astro cat was definitely the highlight go with red bull they are the best in my opinion and for the next my career can u do ufc choose renault and have hulkenberg as your teammate gotta go with the mclaren meh dude ferrari go with ferrari please please finish this series it will be good please do mclaren pick red bull you are awsome keep it up and dont do a short race make it long yea i could totally watch an entire series on this would like to see you do nascar 2019 too dude i getting to learn this game i wanna

percent my fav series that series made me want to get rainbow six bro due the final mission in mw3 plz bro pleaseee keep this series going go with hass trevor theyre an american team so i could work in your favor american team plus an american driver trevor put a camera on your wheel so we can see the wheel like so he can see go with red bull my favourite team by far red bull i think u should choose red bull pick red bull theres a drs detection point just before the drs zone usually just before the proceeding corner thats where you need to be within 1 seconds if you overtake after you can still use the drs in the drs zone go red bull mclaren for sportsmanship where is mlb the show do red bull and drink it on camera aston martin red bull ferrari you most likely gonna win their cars are fast if you are going to do only 1 season sign with ferrari but if you plan to continue with the serie i think you should sign with alfa romeo red bull bro i love red bull and i see you as a red bull guy too plus its your last name go with aston martin redbull make sure you set the difficulty right for the team if you dont choose mercedes red bull or ferrari off the bat make sure you have the difficulty set so your midfield car is in the midfield please go with haas aston martin red bull racing ashton martin red bull the aston martin was made for you your last name is martin so show them what you can do the martin mobile right mclaren or haas is the move 1 50 race distance 2 you absolutely need to figure out all the tools in your car when your racing 3 herky jerky with your steering input will slow you down 4 how committed are you to this this is not really a game for casuals its extremely involved and complex 5 difficulty needs to go way up happy medium is getting beat by the better teams and beating the slower teams 6 f1 is all about consistency and technique 7 please do not attempt to halfass this itd be disrespectful 8 the challenge with these games is taking a smaller team and growing it into a powerhouse through your progression i thought the new motto was all or nothing should have picked 21 since it was available to rep wellington d tmartn2 try red bull that may be a solid option to race against mercedes and ferrari if your looking for a challenge in the game wheres the mlb vids mclaren please if you like racing and like exciting racing look up dirt track racing choose williams and work your way up rip etika commenting until trevor hearts my comment you should drive for mclaren with lando norris go with mclaren personally i would go with aston martin just because your a a martin you should pick a middle to low tier team because if you win a bunch of races you will be the star of the team and build the team from the ground up aston martin redbull awesome waiting for a long time 1 youtube gamer please choose red bull it is a great team despite their engine power but it will improve throughout the season please do full season full races and choose red bull yo treaver i on right now bro i think you should pick aston martin redbull cuz it has martin on it aston martin do ferrari please red bull red bull please continue this series for at least a full season one of my favorite games and my favorite youtuber torro rosso for sure the are the talent team for red bull racing 1st one the red house u should make a series out of this ok now this is content nice one trev and team mclaren start with haas or alfa romeo haas for the usa please maybe you should try to find out the good level of ia first because when its like this its not exciting i mean its look like theyre slowing down on purpose to let you pass and as you said take a middle field team renaultalfa romeomclaren to show an improvement in your career mode with rd stuff good luck mate love your videos trevor likes to ride that jenna foxs ass like a cod champion hey i was wanting to know if u could give me a shoutout i would really appreciate it and i love ur vids i like every video and i subscribed and i turned notifications on do red bull you should choose ferrari or aston martin red bull go with haas i had no clue what this game was until i started watching this video go for a team thats right in the middle so you can experience battles and actually have to race the other drivers go with aston martin joining mercedes wont guarantee you a win just because they have the best car at the start it doesnt mean that you are gonna win every race ferrari gets a major headstart on mercedes in rd so joining mercedes isnt a guaranteed win in my opinion you should join haas they have a great chassis and a ferrari engine choose either red bull racing or haas your call trev 1 i hope you do the entire season and maybe 9 more 2 wheel i think is the best way to go 3 naaah put the ai at 110 choose mclaren a historic team that isnt doing too well right now bring them back to the top red bull also only do highlights of each race you should make a wheel cam as well for the racing vids i like this u should go to mclaren tiametmarduk aarava tom97hd noble 2909 have joined the chat mclaren is alfa romeo just cuz how beautiful their cars are go with ferrari red bull go for haas f1 team do a wheel cam also i would go with haas choose haas they are the only american team and it keeps you associated with ferrari full seasons and do full episodes show the whole race tmartn you should keep playing this game because i feel that you will get good at it you need to pay attention to the interview questions and complete the practice challenge for r d points to maximize how much you can upgrade your car during a race also dont pick teams with only one team pick the ferrari red bull or mercedes driver academy and always improve your aero first on mid field teams also go to the mercedes driver academy go aston martin bro aston martin red bull aston martin red bull go with red bull drive with max aston martin redbull red bull this is painful to watch again the driving is do the full race where are coop and koda reply if u know alfa romeo thats my vote go with red bull or haas boiiiii my grannys camera is better than yours xd red bull keep it up bro your the man hopefully you can do the full season that would be great haasssssss replace grosjean please haas all the way go with mclaren or renault go with aston martin and red bull then also you should livestream the series then upload highlights the entire race on highlights haas is the only american team but if you want a midfield team ill choose racing point or mclaren if you want to race against the top teams go with redbull go with mclaren go with haas they are an american team and they are part of ferrari academy so u will get better contract what happened to crash team racing and metro series id like to see you drive a red bull car up the difficulty to 80 dont go above 90 because the ai gets real aggressive above that do aston martin because it has your name in it pick haas they got good potential but are worthless and theyre american bruh he needs to stop hesitates to much if you see a chance go for it i say go with mcl seems like a good team for now reno great overall team and a mid range car performance wise renault is solid team go for them go with ferrari i think you should go for ferrari if your going for a cool fun young teamm haas f1 team go with ferrari join ferrari or haas use the cockpit camera the coach got so triggerd you should show us the full race for me you should chose ferrari team this is so fun keep doing it i would say red bullaston martin mate red bull one of the red bull teams go with ferrari sign with haas go america 2 more years and f1 will be the most epic autosports as promised haas please do haas it is an american team and a whole series on this game you should do 25 or 50 races well done trevor your smashing it already in my opinion red bull red bull all the way bro go with mclaren do 25 races not 2 long or 2 short im hoping u do at least a fullseason play through this year btw dont pick mclaren as they might copyright strike you ferrari or aston martin when you can choose f1 team try go for red bull team mates with verstappen it will pay off later i personally would love you to join haas since youre in the ferrari academy and haas with alfa romeo are the farm teams for ferrari red bull would be a good move my votes for alfa aston martin or mclaren trevor please choose ferrari haas or red bull this is the best series youve done little better than r6 honestly id love to see you race in alfa romeo such a good looking car too go with toro rosso haas for sure have to go with the american team this is gonna be my favorite series go for a midfield team like mclarenhaas or toro rosso and work the way up you should choose red bull it is a high middle team play lanoire trev is great do mclaren or red bull dont pick ferrari cos vettle is a dirty driver and makes too many mistakes full race please you should pick mclaren red bull this game looks super dope might have to cop i think you should drive for hass because they are a good midfield team that wants to score points with two drivers who already has a spicy personality redbull teammates with max pls dont directly go to a big team like ferrarimercedes or red bull but to a smaller team like renauld alfa romea racing point pls do this it will be a lot more fun go with redbull drive naugty and beat the big two the most talented drivers drive or drove for redbull verstappenvettel red bull 1 race per episode not as long as you would think red bull i watch and play f1 too you have to match the angle of the corner with the wheels t will grip better that way red bull ferrari would be the best definetly ferrari but if not then redbull full season pls aston martin redbull trev you need to do a series on this pls do it pls also pls do red bull i love them and verstappen you you should pick aston martin id go with red bull for your contract cant wait for part 2 nice vid trev tho whats with the facecam defo pick mclaren red bull think about shotgunning a red bull after you win that championship at 1804 you got drs because you were behind him at the drs detection zone for that straight be easier and smoother on your turning inputs the car will slideunder steer more as it will wear the tyres out quicker and unsettle the car for the first time ever the part 1 isnt called the beginning id go with haas your really good at it go with mclaren do more please keep this series going aston martin yesssssss i was wondering if you would so this racing game do 50 percent race it gives a great balance stewarthaas is also nascar go haas ferrari or aston martin your not allowed driver number 7 kimi would be angry aston martin i think you should choose ferrari you should do mclaren i think that alfa romeo is one of my my favorite formula 1 cars and they are not half bad sign with toro rosso great start up team and good platform to climb to f1 ladder ps so excited for this series finally i am so glad you started that series the hype is real my favourite team would be renault or red bull renault or mclaren would be great aston you should go with renault more alfa romeo is back in the f1 after 60 years since last year and now they are a force to be reckon with in the midfield my advice trevor playing f1 games since 2014 start with a low team like alfa romeo and take it to the top and win a chip with then and then haas and at the end ferrari the satisfaction of getting a chip with a team that you have to build every part from the beginning is amazing you will love it you should choose haas the only american based team renault is the perfect team daniel ricciardo as teammate bro i will be on my ps4 tonight at 8 if u want showmanship go to red bull go with mclaren and keep up the great work first ps great video keep up the good work red bull racing point red bull racing red bull red bull red bull go with ferari ive been waiting for this you should pick a midfield team like toro rosso mclaren alfa romeo and renault and make your way up in f1 you beauty i love f1 do red bull racing go to red bull or toro rosso i would enjoy to see races where you do pit stops i feel it be more enjoyable over all thanks and keep up the good work show the racing wheel id go mclaren solid in between but still some beutiful cars renault good midfield car which has pace and can sometimes get a podium oh baby its a new upload ferarri mercedes is cheesy take haas if you dont wanna be in the best car but wanna stick to the ferrari academy yessss thank you i like this alot more than i thought i would and please make more vids of this if you dont know spa or belgium than you are not a true f1 fan go with mclaren who else was typing mercedes when he said choose my team then stopped when he said dont do mercedes race 1 catalunya race 2 the red bull ring in austria race 3 yas marina does anyone else think in the thumbnail it kinda looks like chills start off with a lower team like alfa romeo or toro rosso and work your way up to a top team ferrari are the best team on there tmartn you need to race the best as you can before i know basic thing yesssss the wheeeeeel 1804 there is a zone that scans how many seconds ur behind the one thats less than 1 second behind in that zone gets drs enough is enough love the vid trev make the race 25 or 50 so you can experience the pit stops and how they drastically determine the race pick red bull actually ferrari is almost half a second slower than mercedesso it would be cool seeing you in the red car im british actually english cmon lewis hey trevor what ride does chelsea work at at disney because im currently at disney and i want to know lets hope it lasts more than 3 episodes

hamilton still in front of me in the standings the fight is on when you do lets make this driver world champion what do you do it on grand prix mode and you chose to do the whole season or championship mode what a race should be at least podium its amazing whatch your races send a hello to yours brazilians subscribers dont you feel pain in your hands after drive during so long time beatdown racing did you hear that kubica will be a reserve driver for alfa romeo even before starting the video i feel a p1 for you today because its raining why is rain tcam and racing line are you still trying to learn the game he is so stupid if you want to play learn the game in more depth who is that 542 trevor you should join an online league its a group of drivers that tend to do fun competitive racing and its a much better experience compared to unranked lobbies if youd want to join my american league hit me up on twitter vanbeats and shoot me a dm please play f1 season 2 at 106 he talks about being in one of the better cars yet it says at the bottom that the performance is equal its the back tires dude like press whichever button you have to on it to get the side menu open to see all the statistics fuel level and everything in there theres one in which they show you tire temps you gotta drive it carefully on the corners till those turn green from red again if you crash and go offtrack it goes to red because of the wheel spin and everything and the tire temp is distributed this man has automatic shifting and abs enabled he is so slow the place you chosed for your camera is not the best man you should place it up above or down center yes some more online plz drs turns on lap 3 you sit way to close to the wheel you buy that wheel and you use automatic btw if you do manual gears you will be much faster so american can you please turn off abs and traktionkontroll switch to manual i take it when youre playing online youre not using your setups like you would in career mode please bring back a f1 career and go for the drivers championship btw when you spin your wheels get really hot and that means your car is just gonna keep spinning god he is on a wheel and using traction control he needs to turn that off online career if you can or change from haas to red bull memories memories memories the first race wreck in carrer mode remember ummmm you arnt even using the manual gears just use a controller id you are just gunna be playing like that whats the best steering wheel to get great video mate keep it up i just want to make a question about the steering wheel where can i find one for my ps4 and buy you should try turning the assists off itll make the experience much more realistic and fun and your lap times will improve massively the reason you were spinning in australia was because you were getting to much curb and being to aggressiv on the throttle on the curbs when going 3 wide into a corner 1 person has weild and the situation in austria you shouldve so it was your fault just to say did u return and get a new wheel 633 yes tmartn you got a penalty thats how f1 online works you drive clean and safe and all the idiots hit you and you get the time penalty wasntt sure what to expect from the video but i was definitely entertained great video and take a subscribe computer or ps bcs thr is almost 0 on pc that play this game why dont you shift manual its much easier to do with a wheel like this this is hard to watch you look like corey talor you woulda thought he shouldve picked vettel instead is he using automatic more f1 online bro youre naturally quite good at it you could easily get a few wins trevor when are you doing a season 2 for fomla one 2019 career mode i can tell you have traction control on your tires were way too hot thats why you kept spinning out because you were loosing grip has no grip at the back and then says it is his front wing and he has cold tyres this basically describes why i never play multiplayer racing games the lags are too real haha this f1 online is fun pls do more you did a good job use manual gears and medium traction way more pace but needs patience he is so stupid find a clean lobby next thats some driving position you got there didnt know you were into f1 is he serious about practicing the laps the only thing he does is brake and he has the racing line so its not that difficult honestly he has all assists turned on if you want to practice more you can do some time trails and find what is a good set up for each track why is this guy driving automatic your tires got overheated in australia you have to be really conservative to cool them down after you spun you said maybe your tires are cold you were almost rightbwhen you spin you cook the tires overheating them which makes them like ice skates move your chair back turn off anti lock brakes wtf your soo bad and you already got the wheel multiplayer i think is fun to watch and funny also when stuff like they trolling you in this video 422 impressive 623 what was that im surprised you didnt get jumpscare here lmao its like a train in your face out of no where and penalty on you also l0l 841 i cant believe that hahahaahahha its like they trolling you when you repeat it its so funny that red bull one its his mistake and hes to blame plz play career mode you werent playing with damage on why are you so stiff on the wheel are you going to do a nascar heat 4 career tmartn2 you should do another season of career but switch to mclaren new season go on like this mate only try manual gears next time automatic is pretty slow this funny as hell online f1 is the best yes another season for career mode and can u plz do it at red bull you didnt lose your front wing i guess you were in a lobby where car damage was turned off you were spinning because your tyres were way too hot and because the were dirty and just a question have you tried playing with less or no assists please lower your seat it will help you so much try moving your seat back get your arms more extended for a more comfortable feel as well and more control over your steering great video keep it up more of online please is your force feedback on and why do you leave it in automatic when you a very good wheel yeah some people in f1 online are arseholes and think f1 is banger racing more of this more multiplayer you were breaking too hard and early yeah this game is sick he is trying to block you you definitely need to try some iracing its an actual simulator game and you have a decent enough setup to compete and they are starting to air nascar races on live tv 100000 in prizes at the end of this year in f1 online all the cars have the same performance hey trevor do another episode of multiplayer and another career series with mercedes join f1 esports more f1 the multiplayer series should be you playing ever driver in the game online and all the tracks as well multiplayer was fun do more welcome to f1

started please bring us the f1 season 2 bro you should try wreckfest more career mode please this time with red bull so you have a faster car like so trevor sees who else thinks trev should play until dawn its similar to the erica game he played i was playing online with you that day kind of made you my marker for success haha great video and ok racing when you spin your tires overheat which is why you lose grip you should play nascar heat 4 when it come out this is not good mate try better if people think they are good in this game restart the game without any assists and try again try to lower traction control to medium no horsey and no aliens newf1youtuber10 definitely much more fun to play against other players the human factor makes it interesting keep it up what happened to world at war anyone feel tmartn is too too close to the wheel can u make a league where ussubscribers who can play against u you should try manual gearing its so much more fun yes we want multiplayer season 2 with red bull think hes making online seem worse than it is f1 season 2 plz had exactly the same experience playing online such a nightmare welcome to f1 multiplayer trev i like to see more wreckfest also occasionaly u can do crazy videos of online gameplay personaly i would love to see u playing a second season of singleplayer but in a morw competitive team like redbull or mclaren so u have chances of winning more races online stuff looks cool frustrating at times i guess but thats all part of the fun hey thank you did i miss you finish the season i would love to see a second season of f1 but in another team redbull or ferrari would be nice d but as already mentioned it would be more interesting if you turned on the safety car and put the lenght of the races up to 50 it will be more strategic with the pit stops during longer races damage was off trevor you think this is badforza horizon is a whole different story i love your videos about cooper yehes finally back please do a second season and do it with red bull tmartn is the best youtuber ever more this plz best battle royal game of the year d play this more and play nascar heat 4 is this game worth it and where can u get a wheel from

watch icontrast or rythms youll learn alot about online im gonna play it a little conservative here me no such thing as conservative when it comes to online racing online racing is so much fun than normal racing guys i just got into f1 and i really wanan play this game i love the online racing keep it up have you got brake assist on all i can give you is 7 words of advice trev leave now before it goes to hell season 2 for boy tmartn2 before i watch i already know its gonna be crazy thats the reason i usually never play racing games online you havent lived until you have experienced turn 1 monza on an f1 game awsome stuff man ur actually really good on online especially compared to those idiots loving the f1 gameplay can anybody tell me what steering wheel setup he has u were spinning because ur tyres were way too hot u need to keep an eye on ur tyre temps ur tyres can overheat if u spin out once u spin out u need to check ur tyre temps and if they are too high u need to take corners a lot slower until they cool down also u have a decent wheel and should think about turning some assists off or at least use manual u have way more control of the car and be way faster ive never clicked quicker than this continue the career with haas and play some more multiplayer love the vids now trev i set 105 on astria its bc ur on xbox lol he doesnt even know car performance is equal new season switch to a better team no online racing is as bad as gta world at war keep playing online its funny asf guys give a like if he should do a remastered version of gta iv online in this game is completely broken and not in a good way more of this this is amazing all the mp cars have the same stats so chasing the team is only for athetics hey trev i know a racing league with a good american tier if you wanted to try league racing its called octane online racing thats the website and on there you can sign up for the tier if your keen go play wreckfest you can laugh with that btw in the first session the damage was off if you wanted it on in your races another season of story f1 online veterans should remember f1wreckingball that guy was a pain in the ass 410 you were spinning all over the place because either your tyres were very hot or lost a lot of rubber tyre percentages not because your front wing was broken because damage was turned off what is drs trev u cant come i to my racing line like that me welcome to f1 online pease do a single player season 2 should play the new need for speed i dont like the camera view trev pls go back to the normal we love online and some of us been asking since horizon 2 lol play blair witch when it comes out i like try and do betterit dont look easy though hey tmartn since you got into f1 do you plan to play nascar heat 4 when it releases trevor please play ace combat again i recommend playing ace combat 5 which comes with preordering ace combat 7 it got in gameinformers top 300 games of all time and it tells a story of a war 9 years prior to the events ace combat 7 i recommend playing it before continuing 7 because it tells some of the history of osea and some references of ac5 are made in ac7 viewers leave a like if you think he should play ace combat 5 as well as continue ace combat 7 i love this game maybe rotate single player and multiplayer episodes each day learn to use your fuel mixture at the start of a race it helps quite a lot the guy at first in the alfa is deffo using keyboard cant drive straight love this trevor can i ask as you are now an f1 fan who is your favourite team and driver season 2 of career mode will do finally i almost forgot about f1 but i am excited for this more career mode plz but switch up teams to like merc me patiently waiting for episode 6 of world at war oh no he didnt i love f1 and im glad youve become a fan of the sport if you havent you should whatch a docu series on netflix about the last season its called drive to survive like this so trev can see it god these people suck lol can u please play assassins creed rogue remastered i think its about time you came back for it love u 3 did you stop playing world at war you should do both a new season and more multiplayer my favourite game you play atm quick heads up people with the wifi symbol next to their name have bad ping so its best to be more conservative when youre wheel to wheel multiplayer in racing games are pretty much battle royale with cars career mode with a few mods especially with a helmet i was hoping this was career mode season 2 but still a great video nonetheless you kept spinning out because you were overheating your tires bro this game lit with the steering wheel yeah its back career mode also trev the reason why you kept spinning in australia was because your tire temperatures were through the roof after your first spin so you had no grip your front wing was ok because damage was turned off in that session more online yes please trevordo a whole series bro f1 2019 online is carnage good luck finally more f1 love this series yes nice vid love f1 also instead of playing regular online races play leagues and start a series with that im waiting for the dirty drivers lol use the mfd to see your overall damage and wings and tires how was tahiti more online plz there should be a battle royale in the game online is pure chaos watching this made my day you need to play 25 races the people there do not drive as stupid as the guys in the 5 lap races wow f1s back baby i wouldnt recommend playing online with randoms as finding a clean lobby is almost impossible create lobbies to play with subs on stream or just stick to carrer mode hey trev if you are into f1 you might really like motogp last couple races have come down to the last corner and the games arent to bad either oh there goes kimi what also welcome to f1 online horrible drivers dumbass penalties and the occasional respectable human being also aliens lots of aliens more my reaction when i saw the title you dead yo im in this down to race with u again if u want drop a like if you miss f1 tmartn you should do an episode with the sound on a speaker with cooper and koda also switch to red bull aston martin please you should try nascar heat online its crazy keep doing this once in a while 627 thought he was going to say what the fck dude ssup trev can u do a full gameplay of the whole nba demo anyway u the best and an inspirationroad to 4mill i feel bad for him if he was towards the front he would not have to deal with the people that cant drive i should know i was in that lobby i dominated you should do something like what the big f1 youtubers did in 2016 do an online championship where you and some friends and if you can f1 youtubers like tiametmarduk or intothebarrier do a full season of f1 each sunday just racing each other with some good banter between seriously though watch the f1 youtuber championships preferably the monaco 2nd half its hilarious btw kerbs arent as grippy as the track thats why you were spinning out season 2 of f1 trev the reason that you were spinning on melbourne after your crash in turn 1 is because the tires were overheated from spinning around great video you gotta play this like a gta race dunno wtf gonna happen your tires might have been too hot lmao the wait is over the problem is that i dont think a lot of people are actually playing with a wheel im pretty sure theyre using a controller the collisions are terrible driving is from the meh steering with a controller pls do season 2 of f1 career mode havent seen but i want more smorc would like to race against you spins out 20 million times idk if its bc my tires are cold um in multiplayer all cars are equal doesnt matter if you are in a mercedes or a williams your car is equal please keep this series 407 its the opposite because you keep flooring it when trying to spin back to the right direction youve made your rear tires so hot that you basically have no grip you have to be so careful or youll spin out over and over again and no btw youre front wing was fine plz like so trevor can see it are you planning to do season 2 in the career mode the reason you kept spinning out was because your tyres were to hot after you spun the first time your tyres were very hot and this causes you to lose grip and spin out easily want to race with me tmartn my name is liam080907320g and my league name is liam07 and i am not dirty just so much fun i have not watched you in a long time do you still do cooper vids anymore if you are a fan what was

holiday wheres life is strange early oh boy chaos i knew it been a long time yes more f1 please continue playing this game its my favorite plz upload more career mode 7th comment earlyyy yeet get my yeet to the top who else clicked fast asf but im bbg to vryon who k and b to me first give me a like if you love ferrari can someone tell me start 10400rpm we wait and when the lights off do we press the accelerate suddenly full you play on xbox one x or s nice game i ever play and watch can you chose cars from before the bullshit v6 rule change there is nothing like the sound of a screaming v10 or v12 at 18000 rpm i watched it 2 minutes before i started to realise its a computer game hamilton is better and the sound sucks can you tell me the tv pod offset camera options i really like your gameplay are you drving with a wheel f1 2010 graphics at ultra settings is better than f1 2019 f1 2010 graphics is best the graphics are incredibly realistici felt like i was watching an f1 race at eurosport thanks 4k sounds like the original pole position too old for you millennials good play what dificulte have this game i will never undestand why people use that shitty camera fov the game is bullshit but at least play from the cockpit view my ferrari 599x evolution goes 284mph on forza horizon 4 i raced on this track on forza motorsports 6 what is your assists and difficulty ill be cock eyed by the time i finish the race that halo the fact that leclerc won monza 2019 irl haha vettel over hamilton this game is not so realistic but the game looks like quite nice i would have not listened to the prick and stayed racing for the full 13 laps because hamilton and vettel would eventually go in and you can then make some ground on them i like to play the game risky not safe pure driving like james hunt mixed with senna push the car passed its limits at the opportune moment monday after 2019 italian gp charles win vettel you spin me right round baby what kind of race do you ever see yo corro a 56 race in manual tire textures suck they should be dynamic all the time shiny what ferrari lost here hard to achieve is this on pc or console cool game i thought you were good gasly qualified 2nd in the toro rosso i dont watch f1 i watch this good clean racing how do you turn on the subtitles podium celebrating should be more realistic than that in 2019 then the game will become awesome i dont understand how they get away with selling these games for 60 to 70 dollars every single year every game is like an expansion on the last you get a few new cars slightly improved graphics and an altered story am i crazy i must be missing something i bought f1 2017 back in 2017 then i bought 2018 because i assumed there would be more there now f1 2019 is out and its 5999 on steam and it looks exactly the same as f1 2018 with some added volumetric fog i dont know why they dont do better with sound design developers used to be better at sound design 8 years ago for some reason all of the new car games have cars that sound like weed trimmers theyre like high pass filtered and too clean sounding theres no bottom end i have a pair of adam a7xs and i dont think the woofer is even recognizing a signal i put my hand on the speaker and its almost as if its just turned off everything is coming out of the tweeter i think i know whats happening too cars sound rubbish compared to the old cars the tyres look to thick like monster car verstappen it was fair racing what about no cutting the curves each times anyone annoyed by the shiny tyres as well too much light reflection and no graining for what i did see so far good script in monza this year lec p1 ham p2 vet p3 haha sound in f1 2019 is so shit u run with too much downforce i think amateur driver u drive that car like my grandma idiot kubica in 12th o my godpeople spend money for thisahahahahamy assetto corsa with a lot of mods is more more betterphysics too you always miss the first brakezone literally every damn time d it annoys me that the car isnt central on the screen you know its a game when gasly starts p2 1440 why the hell entering pit stop is so freaking unnatural still this game in some terms is still not a single step further than f1 2010 really that is embarassing we have 2019 not 1999 gasly 2 hahahah the car is too stable like flying over surface no bumps on the tarmac no shaking on high speed unlike the real world it also sounds crazy but graphics look a bit too bright and glossy unlike what were used to see on tv and even in the real world these are only two major things making me sceptic about this beautiful new game why the fuck does his ferrarri look orange omg same fucking animations every yearand that steering wheel in pit wtf codemasters trash engines sound like vacuum cleaners waiting for fitgirl repack halo blocking the view into corners in cockpit mode awful it aint no gt sportlooks fucking amazing for surewill be buying this 1 2019 ferraris sound is weaker than the 2018 one dont like the sound ferrari winning a race vettel overtaking hamilton and without spinning you should have fantasy mode on is it normal in carrier that i only have 3 tiers soft hard and supersoft even on monaco meanwhile my copy of the game got lost in the mail l im liking the looks of this especially on triple screen i hope there are mods to bring the field tighter unlike real life watching will be good unlike rl that pit was amazingly real life cool awesome driving too this is way more exciting than the real f1 2110 5 seconds penalty to vettel he overtook hamilton is there a mod where i can change the hybrid sound with a v10 one guys want only one thing and its fucking disgusting ferrari 12 finish very bad corner why did the steering wheel or wheels themselves not turn when you went in the pit just as a heads up you can hold the button you use for mfd to make it dissapear 5 second penalties for overtaking hamilton when he is having a mechanical problems that is one gorgeous looking game great fight between charles and lewis for the lead 2112 vettel overtakes hamilton in monza without spinning not realistic at all at least vettels grid spot is accurate not color reel ferrari is red not orange why is there crap all over the track before the lesmos in the intro bro watch for the 5 second penalty from fia you drive to fast on formation lap lol if an xbox one x can do these graphicswhat can a gaming pc do whats the point if u play with all the assists on gasly starting 2nd nice joke he would be lucky if he finished ahead of any ferrari mercedes drivers or verstappen this season in any race gas starts from p2 but it is just never say never maybe fake mercedes isnt 12 but you have assists on omg the camera is on side i cant watch it sorry no mission winnow is every assist on except racing line i see full brake and throttle without locking up or wheel spin finally someone else that races on tv pod offset i thought i was the only one doing it idk why but it just feels like you can see more at a time and it feels more natural because ur in the same position as shown on tv have you enabled the hdr i do not get anything same at 4k what controller are you using 2110 vettels overtake on the gras in 2011 all over again what are your camera settings 1440 look at the steering wheel codies f1 games are good enough for 16 years old babies for everyone else committed in serious simracing there are way better options i wont pay 1 euro for that crap crowd and other cars sound are way too high dont know how can people play in this shit take care of the car all the way in lmao malaysia 2017 post race reference i prefer with no commentary because i can hear cars thank you since youre the only youtuber i found who did no commentary sounds just like the real thing my boy norris qualified p7 amazing race mate would love more f1 2019it certainly increases your viewership by a landslide thank god finally some good driving with the right camera view and without racing line finally a decent camera view why is noone using the cockpit camera was it removed from the game f1 2016 is more beauty and less blurry proof httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvllpeyzw6chst51s wet dreams of ferrari i cant tell if its a game or real life graphics are insane race with redbull pls how are the classic cars are their performance more authentic or do they still balance the performance with cars of the same category and era the upshift sound its more weaker than 2018 version do you have some mod for the ers you have it on hotlapovertake almost all the time and never run out of charge why 5 lights isnt there 10 red light if you out this video at 05x speed it sounds like hes high this feels like the 2012 season all over again if he never spin in q3 he would be on pole man i love watching guys playing mario kart what a recovery drive aarava great race keep it up just trying to figure out how that was leclercs fault i just bought f1 2019 a nice early christmas present do maxed out renault are you driving with controller or steeringwheel leclerc did not spin you at all it was 999999999 your fault for being so close to leclerc day 8 of asking aarava to show his settings the engineers pierre gasly time changed please giv me ur camera settings hahha if youre going to do a last to challenge just write it in the title did anyone notice that in q3 pierre gasly set a 107 and went quickest but at the end of quily he ended up p10 with a 109 how did he go slower nothing i could have done well you could have reacted easily in that scenario braking to avoid contact you twat p1 weber too op p2 hamilton loves conquers all p3 verstappen codemasters underrate him p4 prez its ridiculous to be at mclaren again p5 leclerc p6 aarava wait wtf is going on with gasly 1123 you definitely couldve released the accelerator we want road to glory whens the next road to glory episode coming out that is like the only spot you should not try to overyake on hockenheim it looks like there is a gap but the door will always be slammed shut drama at hockenheim thats never happened before 28 june 11 december 2019 and no safety car fix still how did piere gasly drop from p1 with 107 to p10 with 109 in q3 gasly at the start of q3 had time 107844 but at the end of q3 he had time 109133 how hang on so gasly set a 1078 at the start of q3 and ended on 1091 what is happening here codemasters i mean if u read this will it really hurt u to like it i mean is it really that hard to get 1k likes and a heart from aarava lets beat the odds please aardvark are u using a wheel or console well you were much involved in crashes this season though thats unfortunate youre looking for 1122 the rarest event for me is when a girl kisses me 350k subs by christmas i hope everyone subscribe youre missing out on great content from a consistent youtuber this place has the best fans starting to sound like hamilton now never give up third but great video nice and early this time first first codemaster f1 is expensive it is full of errors and the company does not fix anything enters the forum and nobody serves you bad company to get the rights to formula 1 it would have to be a big company not a mobile gaming company f1 2019 i regret buying it sometimes i wish the f1 drivers an online esports series with the f1 games for the winter break is this the only camera view nobody ricciardo the long straight kills the front tyres codemasters did a reaaly good job this game is really good where is the demo hi what steering wheel is used in the video and is it a available for purchase with hindsight unbelievable why they only placed the heads of hamilton and vettel on the cover like the season is all about these 2 so far its only about hamilton bottas and verstappen as they are the only race winners so far they should gone for a huge mercedes logo as cover picture that would be enough and realistic straight that isnt straight avocado 2k19 what garbage not that immersive without vr support hardly any difference between 2018 model why not for switch its a pity he didnt learn that in the real cars under race conditions you have to stay on the track then he has the nerve to blame the stewards i would give him the penalty for the 4 wheels off the track stunt but i would add a position penalty at the next race for swearing about the stewards that has to be bad sportsmanship how much does a steering wheel cost what set up are they using for the sim looks nice when pewdiepie has meme review f1 has race review what have we taken from this paul ricard hard on the fronts those are some clicky shifters that good looking guy from australia at least he managed to stay on the track though the pit entry ffs would love to see the full uncut session and dans times its official daniel riccardo is the coolest f1 driver in the late 10s just incredible graphics and sounds well done codies anyone know which racing wheel hes using 105 his thoughts during the last lap of the actual race haha where is the 10 sec penalty ricchi talks about tyres like they have feelings the honey badger himself daniel rickyairdo need be simuletor cause is game arquede coodmaster use tecnol of aceto corsa sorry my englis peace player 109 danny boy cut the chicane and nearly shunted lando norris first of two 5 second penalties pretty good dont cut it for a game thats 70 bucks more exciting than the actual grand prix would you like russian commentators alexey popov will be added i hope you have added the new pitlane in paul riccard this guy going backward he has his fans world champ never and his tream no were best been and gone what is tbe force feedback used for f1 cars codemasters please extend the f2 career please how did i get a faster lap time in game they actually turned the game into an actual sport amazing what gaming can do its not even him driving during the hotlap lol the tires are gonna look shiny the whole race arent they youtubers playing free the game and we pay for waiting sorrymore respect with the players i wanna buy the game just to see if i can beat daniels time codemasters the paul ricard curcuit has got a new pit entry for 2019 please update it wrong pit enter and exit daniel you sound a bit down why do i feel like gasly or grojean would be a better fit for this oh yeah cause they are french this track guide is way better than f1 officials one with romain looking forward to this game codemaster the pitbox entry from french is not right its before the last corner watch f1 fp2 now more fun to make it all straight oh yeah and make it more boring for the spectators more than whats already daniel can become egamer f1 2019 will arrive for xbox game pass you got straight that isnt straight daniel ricciardo 2019 hope those shiney tyres will go away in de race i just got word from a youtuber that you cant play the full f2 season which of course means you cant play all fp q fr and sr why is that codemasters got this pre ordered cant wait i want this background music in the main menu pleeaaaase at the end he says track accuracy im not gonna lie but its pretty good i wonder what they cut out before the but yellow and black just doesnt fit right on ric red bull needs him back quick pro tip daniel keep driving that car it seems more reliable than your real one so thats a 1421 when are they going to stop putting the shift indicator lights on 8th gear what am i gonna do shift into 9th yo codies i really hope you change that spot in the middle of the tiresi mean what were you thinking its a pure slick tire and you put this small ring on it and this outwashed texture around it looks so stupid for meand it looks like you have 3 tire textures on it outsidemiddle and insidecome on codies you can do better than that and i also hope that we are able to drive with the 2019 helmets and not the 2018 ones if these 2 things arent outfixed when the game gets released i dont want to buy this game then the front wing vibrates on the kerbs man could have got a rig that didnt move so much i mean its only a csl base how is the ffb now compared to 2018 every time one of these guys is asked about the track accuracy they cant answer with a straight face come on codies give us scanned tracks already its unfair how big youtubers get to play the career mode a week before the general public can it ruins the hype im not sure if i want to buy this game at all then you got this kind of straight that isnt straight daniel ricciardo 2019 straight that isnt straight danny ric are you trying to come out of the closet that last sentence was definelty cutted together especially after what lando said about how bad canada actually is in the game where is new pit entry i like riccardo and iam hypet from the game lets get out of this goddamn hellhole you got the best guy to do it as well 100 upvotes and ill buy f1 2019 you cant hate this man ricciardo hope you to recover in the whole season with renault 110 we hear you ricc summarizing everyones feelings there what monitor was that i love the music in this game this year i know hes a f1 driver but would the steering wheel really help meive been trying to decide if to buy 1 then if i do which 1 do i getim not rich so cant be some 300 thingguess a stand b useful toany ideashints or tips b gratefully received do this intro with all the rest no more oh who do i pick vettel nah hamilton nah riccardo yes i am curious to know whose plan it was to paint the track like that i mean sometimes i feel hypnotized its disgusting i am curious to know whose plan it was to paint the track like that i mean sometimes i feel hypnotized its disgusting can the ai crash randomly gran turismo and these guys need to join up very nice game indeed roight aarava is playing your game tomorrow at 9am shifting is not ok the gameplay isnt from ricciardo but i still liked the video cuz i like the commentary you have a straight which isnt straight daniel ricciardo 036 onwards fia should make virtual hot lap in the f1 games again meanwhile lando says the games version of canada is atrocious buyers beware the straight that isnt straight daniel ricciardo 2019 who edited that video stick with the in cockpit view please this made me want a track learning mode with a codriver like dirt tbh reaaaally tight hairpin right dont cut can we have daniel as a codriver in dirt haha the new pit entry csl elite wheel base cant wait for the fitgirl repack will they update the new pitlane entry its pretty good rushes for pre order lol wait for f1 2020 when zandvoort and hanoi slots into the calendar getting pumped if the top three teams didnt show up on any weekend wed see f1 racing its so tight between drivers 7 and 13 i showed this to my sister and she thought it was real danny rick why you play with this camera i dont recall you sit on top of the hallo while driving d i wish you to become world champion with reno like nando why show game disc no one buys discs anymore can we save online replays you would put hamilton on the cover fags pit entry is new this year so k hope youve changed it remember the last message of our fallen brothers n o p r e o r d e r s roll on tuesday for my copy of the game better book the day off work dont try to flex on all these camera positions again it is nothing special every racing game since 1990 has it and switching around completely ruins the viewing experience of the video i just wanted an option to fully remove the halo in the cockpit view that is all that is why im still with my f1 2017 the pit entry and exit needs to be changed man makes me a lil disappointed the amount of times danny ric mentioned tires degrading kinda sucks that it seems to be the main focus for drivers in this era did you have daniel do it because part of the track is called ricard alfa romeo aling side kimi will be my chosen team assetto corsa better than f1 2019 10 second penalty for playing the game doesnt have the new pitlane i fuckin love this guy instant like pick a camera angle and stick with it switching angles every couple seconds is awful for mental continuity ricciardo is a very good driver he deserves a championship title leclerc and verstappen too is a coop championship in f1 2019 game you guys should make ricciardo smile in the select screen every corner kills the front tyres finally the turn number marker sponsor boards braking markers bollards etc are modeled exactly identical to the real ones my time is better d haha rather than a track preview i wanted to hear the rest of it his review of the game straight that isnt straight that feeling when you beat daniel ricciardo lap time in game i really really love the new interface and just how everything looks ive pre ordered it but are my 1050 ti and fx 8530 going to handle the game race review lol it actually looks real i just love this game 0 corners were named in this video track accuracy go try spa pit entry change it now the new pit entry has been there since novemeber 2018 irl no reason to not have it in the game camera edit done by a musicclip director this circuit must be renamed paul ricciardo things i learnt from this vid front tyres degradation is high it shouldve been better if we have 1 looong straight baisically rip front tires the tyres look unrealistic i see ricciardo i watch cant wait to pick this up 202 is this a joke have you seen any other tracks than france but i dont get it for a pro driver like u its a shame u didnt drive like in real in cockpit view they just had to find a way to show off that reno again daniel you would select ferraris drivers academy or mclarens i know he was in red bull driver academy same game boring every year same thingpfff this is a lot better than the hotlaps from the official f1 channel sometimes i really wanna be a steering wheel cool game but its far from a sim physics suck how can he make a track preview this funny d love it the best driver in the world kkkkkkk so daniel with a renault power unit is asking for a longer straight haha fantastic daniel you win the french gp the famous isnt straight i have one doubt with the early access of the legens edition that means that there will be this edition in the real stores 3 days before the official launch or only in the online stores just so you guys know hes not gonna lie give us manual pit lane control already ffs hey codemasters with a future patch will you change the pit entry of the circuit because fia changed it for this weekend nevertheless great graphics and a great video game good job did you guys show the on board of the ai avocado drift city get it gurl what a lad i like this game cant wait i allredy pre ordered it ricardo shows a turn its better to overtake here 125 but daniel you know how to overtake anywere the game is finished release it early plz go daniel for another top 6 finish straight that is not straight still old pit entry wow will the box entry be changed i am hyped to see how slow is the williams that would be realistic and a great job of codemasters it looks like its an ai gameplay is ricciardo an ai its great to use this as a track guide rather than the old f1 2018 ah hell yeah mate this track has a new pit entry this year will there be an update for it he looked hyped so so so hyped for this game i have the worst luck here so want win this race and cant get through lap 2 727 doesnt that sound like marcus ericssons laugh aarav speaks as if he has everytime in his mouth and we almost saw ben vs tom ah well maybe next time great to see more of these hilarious open lobbies still and i was almost fooled by the title of the video xd f1 car fade factory new ben bloody hell ron drone harry potter bloody hell what are bens fov settings 254 is hilarious the only thing rarer then seeing a unicorn is getting a good start in f1 2019 im sorry but thats trash content if thats your cleanest racing at monaco i dread to think what the dirty stuff is like d memes to watch when there is no f1 races httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqmshmx0jjwt150s i was doing career mode and the ai decided to create a 5 lap traffic jam on the hairpin so wish i could have a good wet races setup and fast drys u need an intro matt can ben win will he bottled it youtuber championship returning this the only view where the mirrors are usable seems no youtubers use the reg cockpit view this is the sidemen of f1 gaming im disappointed no matty he needs to take some time off wtf1 and have some fun with you guys wheres mattyg he may not be the quickest bring back x m a t t y g tom im used to my maxed out car from career mode ben yeah me too cries in toro rosso veloce esports and tiametmarduk ben yo ben when career mode tom i find it unbelievable that you have zero shame in cutting corners if we cant have f1 youtuber championship then this will have to do that said still very high quality content do more of these i knew that title was bait im not disappointed lots of leclerc and vettel racing jd should have been in it aaravs performance in baku is the equivalent to his alfa romeo esports team dude called himself rwaggy and hes wondering why people ask him what rwaggy means like theyre supposed to know thats what he thinks scoobie doo says scoobie doo does not say rwaggy its just raggy what a fucking twat meanwhile with aarav i have a feeling the title is sarcastic full power of f1 esports drivers shown can tell damage is off by the first corner me looks at the title of the video also me impossible who is rwaggy video challenge idea 11 downforce in monaco drop career mode or be gay waiting is too long where is matt more of this plz we need a veloce championship youtuber championship why rwaggy sounds like grosjean why does one sound like romain a bit is this f1 youtuber championship looks like aarava still doesnt know how to drive why is that fool even playing this game lol that was so much fun clearly you are the better ben i have to concede despite your multiple attempts to do me dirty 3 why did u have ur own helmet scooby dooby doo the classics never go outta style this was a lotta fun to watch guys thanks plz do more of this its so funny 544 for the most epic switchback im not touching my wheel my wheel is braking veloce squad member 2019 ben please do youtubers championchip the cards at the end for the other videos werent working for me 534 did ben brake early or the dude in the white as incredible car control to slow that down aarava showing his true skill dddd aarava is so shit at this game guy is so irrelevant that he tries so hard to be funny to be relevant sees monaco slowly backs away still crashes 1030 norris has entered the chat tom my wheel is not calibrated aarava my pad is not calibrated ben my brake pedal is not calibrated aaravas camera angle always makes me nauseous aarav is the best f1 player ever if he was in the f1 esports he would win every race by 1 lap i already saw this on veloce esports no heroics into saintdevote please thai is in the veloce channel 69th comment monaco has such good history and the is famous for being hard to overtake but only the best drivers get it hellooo everyoneen welcome back to another lets kill everyone grand prix around the monaco grand prix aarava is in the lobby monaco and clean overtake dont go together legend has it that if you are early ben replies this is not ben first i started with manual and i just got a wheel and its not hard and i dont have suggested gear how does he throttle lots of over revving but thats okay took me a while to get used to manual shifting even on a controller but it feels so much better than automatic gears when you get used to it really helps you get into the flow of the track and you can shortshift to make up for a lack of traction control and it also saves you some fuel i bet you loose time in automatic shift in the wet isnt it weird how you got a new wheel on my birthday is this the tx racing wheel leather edition having trouble playing f1 with it any tips would be welcome link for the wheel hey trev how did you setup your wheel i have the same wheel i need help i love the way 2019 feels for f1 the game feels more dialed in i know some may not notice it but it seems like you can make your lines tighter corners that were harder last year arent as bad meaning you cna actually push it now the game isnt easier and people go around the tracks in f1 and think oh its easy it isnt try getting top times its not you really have to know your lines and be confident around corners and also get those shifts at 12k rpm i dont go higher anything above 12 125k your actually losing power peopme dont know that and the best players in the works will tell tky to shift then it helps but man its awesome love the way the game feels this year keep in mind your playing in manual just not manual with clutch also keep in mind its ok to play that way even some pros do believe it or not and some setups only have 2 pedals you need to stop redlining the revs change gear quicker 1544 lmfao says lets se how many people we can pass and crashes instantly and passes 0 and loses the race you play on pc i want to beat you a girl are the paddle shifters like that in real life or are they more curvy and less blocky fanatecpretty much the same price 100x better quality anytime you buy thrustmaster you run a big risk of getting a broken oneplastic garbage toysee dials that dont actually work for tms realism cant play the game no offence but americans are hilarious when theyre talking about f1 also charles is 21 i have it you should put some f1 gloves so you dont get hurt the clicking makes it a lot more realistic i like it a lot also wear racing gloves stick to the yous raceline bro theres a reason why that line is there and you barely ever consistently follow it you are always on the side of it and that slows you down because thats where track is dirty stick to the raceline bro the reason they dont work is because its meant to increase realism if it didnt have them it would t be an f1 wheel also its not good to have your arms straight its good to have an angle i think your doing very well your lines are pretty clean unless you edit out wrecks but it doesnt look like it but i wreck at least once or so a race hit my nose on stuff even if those buttons did work i can assure you they wouldnt do anything in the game those kinds of wheels are for sim racing games and codemasters games are far from that cool looking wheel though dont worryabout the manual bro not even worth it where did you buy the steering wheel f1 is not a sim racer hes doing pretty good with the new wheel 1 suggestion you can buy rubber covers for the shifting pedals that would stop your fingers from hurting as much yeah trev the clicking is right next to the mic its ok tho i like what you said trev start a new one after this season and go manual you probably the most american guy ive ever met on yt try modifying the max turn in your wheel so it matches the wheel being turned in the game will help you not need to flip your wheel upside down and will make it easier to turn bro finish the season then make a new driver in a new team on manual only its more content wait for manual when you are shifting manually you should for all reason use the first person view so that you can sew ur revs without taking eyes off the road try to do an episode where you do multiple races and then do another season where you focus on being as realistic as possible you should play monster jam steel titans you can change where the speedgears and others things are eg top right corner can u also put a wheel cam so we can see ur view and ur hands trev get racing gloves next season when you do manuel pls never stop this series i love it i say wait until after the first season then continue as the current person but maybe change teams get gloves for the manual season so the paddle isnt digging into your finger yes do another season trev you should buy some racing gloves shouldnt have any assists on ngl but thats just me push yourself to have it like they do in real life then youll get the best experience when u start doing well its so satisfying and rewarding tmartn why people dont do live com when recording episodes is because its hard to speak and shift at the same time do this do voice overs and use the replay system to show your battles in another angles i say wait until the next season to do manual whatever you do dont start a new career continue the one that you already have no forge feedback you should make a new season on manual shifting and join the ferrari team since you have that steering wheel you should do manual and suggested gear thats super fun but also easy hey trevor im trying to figure out what kind of wheel to get for f1 but dont want to spend that much could you recommend one for ps4 the clicking is anyuing please switch back like is you think so too sorry for spelling ingles is my 2 language i think you should wait i think you should start manual shifting now for career use the practice sessions to learn it for each track youll know it then for the tracks after belgium for next year do a new career in manual and finish your current career id say finish the season in automatic then change teams and do the second season in manual but with the same driver when shifting you need to listen to the engine youll notice that at higher revs and a higher pitch in the engine noise youll need to change up a gear and when you brake only then should you look down to look at the rev limiter to see when you need to shift down a gear that being said you should still glance at the speedo and revmeter to check your rpms and speed maybe change the loud clicking gloves maybe wear gloves fastest lap gasly if only at the beginning its hard to know which gear to drop to but raising yhe gear is easy because you have to listen to the engine as soon as you hear it getting high pitched raise the gear the gear maybe you could find some like rubber thing that you could put it around managing the ers and fuel mix will speed you up considerably but make it much harder hey trev i was wondering what wheel stand and pedals you have cuz i need a wheel stand and pedals also with the wheel you have you will need gloves so it stops your fingers hurting play euro truck sim with that wheel try putting some padding on the shifter and really like the paddle shifters sound i think u should use the manual now but off camera practice a lil more to get used to it with manual u can wear down the engine and gearbox more faster if u dont get the switching threw gears f1 2019 asmr think you should also try first person might also make it easier to switch since the indicator is on the steering wheel too you really should do another season with manual and preferably as a part of mercedes or ferrari this time f1 2019 isnt a sim racer sound of shifters and the engine soundwhat makes me a fan of racing did u change ur team next season i like sound of clicking keep on solo runs with your manual once you see that your speed is good and your times improve you can switch back to career mode yea do one more season new carrer alfa or torro rosso manuel difficulity 8090 you gonna love the feeling when you do good champ awesome vids awesome personality keep going strong best regards you seem to have adjusted well enough to the manual gearbox but i would recommend you to stay in auto for the rest of this season and practice in between weekends to learn more on when to shift this might be a little too much for some but you could also buy some racing gloves out of motorsport brands such as sparco just to avoid some of the soreness of shifting over long periods of time the first thing you should do is to learn breaking points on the tracks and free youreself from the dynamic racing line before you start doing manual paddleshifting each track takes a lot of practise you need to know all breaking points and know how far to drop gears in each corner then i will respect you get og that baby driving line yo martin you should look at fanatec wheels they are very good please do go pro cam because the wheel is great hey tmartn i think you should try to play with traction off leclerc is not 19 he is 21 we now have asmr with the clicking wear a glove i wish i had a wheel and pedals but theyre all so expensive you are so much better now than you were when you started also your steering wheel should be sitting a little higher yes trev i would love the new season with the new team change the title to f1 2019 since now its not just career mode any more keep your season as it is next season you should do full manual no guidelines everything simulation dont make another driver for the next season just continue with the current one you can do 10 seasons with 1 driver just transfer to another team for the new season in fact everytime theres a contract negotiation you can choose to negotiate with another teams do you even shift bro good move switching to manual gears still pains me to see that abs is still on though totally down for second season on manual hopefully that replacement wheel comes quick you need racing gloves u should practise with manual gears and use the automatic for this career season then dont make a new driver but start season 2 so its interesting with much driver transfers and you can try manual another vote to stick with auto then go manual next season gives you the chance to develop muscle memory with this wheel buttons as well as stretch this series of vids out cheers for sharing dude nice steering wheel and nice overtakes mate a couple tricks to help you finger not hurt is to either put some rubber pads on the back where your fingers are hitting the shifters which you can buy at walmart or buying some racing gloves which will give you protection and racing gloves will help preserve the wheel grips from degrading next year f1 are adding some new tracks zandvoort in holland and a street circuit in vietnam so some tracks in the game will not be on the calendar next year great vid trev cant wait to see you progress in the game you should have got the fanatec wheel its 10x better you can change your force feedback do you can feel the bumps and the track its in the settings menu get some gloves and youll be fine what damage setting is he on reduced simulation you should buy yourself some racing gloves after 2 seasons there are driver transfers wait till thats available and then switch teams etc do manual for the next season the klick sounds good to me its make like real race wait till next season you should try playing on cockpit camera because it makes the simulation much more real kubica shouldnt be that fast trevor you should get racing gloves make sure ers is automatic i think you should move to a faster car as your character but should have to use manual as his challenge while in it do an online race im a top 10 player on ps4 hey trev would u be down to do a time trail shoot out he is only youtuber who does commentary and racing at the same time every other f1 youtuber i watch always does the commentary after the racing what do u guys think of the new tracks in 2019 traction control medium is so much faster just some advice love ur vids trev ive been playin since 2009 and i still cant really use manual ok ive been playing f1 since f1 2010 recommendations would be if you do manual shifting you need custom car setups to compete with the ai and compensate with sliding in corners you will have power advantage and more traction i can always help you with race setups as i do compete in league races does the wheel freak out when you spin out id say wait and do another season with the manual i would be down for that use the 8th gear in the straights please the bumps are called rumble strips you should watch aarava on youtube hes a pretty good player so you can learn a lot you should check out fanatech steering wheel i low key forgot that you were a thing everyone try to get me to 100 subscribers has fast has we can i have 81 if you do this i will subscribe to your youtube channels i really dont want this series to end you should do the first person view so you can see the little monitor to change your gear manuel next season same racer different brand definitely used manual thought you were gonna learn more about the menu in this episode making a new episode with manual gearbox is a good idea looking forward for it you should make the driving line corners only and turn on manual now hold off on turning traction control totally off for now because traction is very tricky in 2019 man im really loving this serie you made discover f1 world and its awesome trev buy some racing gloves you should get a f1 next playseat stick to auto for this season practice in manual when your not recording and i love the satisfying clicking of the shifters start a new with manual for the next season love this series stay in auto for this season keep up the good work man use racing gloves please dont hurt yourself lol i started using manual on my 5th race on f1 2017 on a pad turn off anti lock brakes hey martin you like dirt racing there is a thing called iracing and it is a real racing simulator and it is sooooo fun test it out they have all cars and real tracks who watches these really tmartn on the grind again your a legend keep the videos coming mate if its hard to manually shift u should wear gloves hey trev instead of shipping the broken wheel back what about you ship it to me just switch to manual next season with the same driver of wait till next season if you do another season choose one of the weaker cars like mclaren racing point alfa romeo or toro rosso when using the f1 wheel use only your index fingers to shift between gears that way its more comfortable thats my wheel one tip is to switch it to the cockpit view then you can look at the the shift lights on the steering wheel instead of the bottom right corner you should have a camera focusing on your hands and the wheel get a fanatec racing wheel listen to the noise of the car so u dont have to look at the bottom right and when the noise of the car changes change gear wait til next season yeah i think you should finish this season off strong and then go into another season with manual and a new team also the clicking wasnt bad and i even think it sounds nice i am loving this series trevor waiting for the new episode every day i think the natural progression for next season would be to move to mclaren in real life theyre making real strides towards getting back to the top its a really historic and well respected f1 team if you had a successful season you could then realistically progress to ferrarimercedes i very much hope this season continues that you continue to enjoy this game yo tmart my advice would to be push it more after a corner you take a corner then slowly put your foot on the gas when you take a corner try gassing it a little bit earlier not saying smash the gas but try to slowly gas it sooner love the vids bro ive gone and bought a full racing setup as a result of watching this series ive very much enjoyed it thus far f1 really is a unique and special sport do it next season you should buy a fanatec wheel wheel cam trev send it in the corners more than what you are doing you should do a foot camps keep up the good work on the vids you should do a livestream of a full race weekend 3 practice sessions all 3 qualifying sessions followed by a full length race by doing this you will really learn how to perfect how to race with no assists on manual hell yeah do that with a working wheel and a upper class tier and like 85 i stopped playing pubg for this trev can you finish the ace combat series please hey trev youre reving the engine too high dont go past 12000 rpm it damages the engine and wastes fuel you also lose power if you do that last and most importantly its absolutely killing me hearing that engine rev so high would love to see you do another version after this current season huge fan keep it up mate i think that you should stick to auto for the season and then do the next season with manual you should wear some gloves while using your wheel thats what most of the best f1 esports drivers do so it doesnt hurt your hands youll get used to manual shifting real quick i started shifting at the start of f1 2017 and i got the hang of it after just a few days once you get used to it you dont even need to look at the rev counter just listen to the sound of the engine higher pitch means its time to shift please do a s2 and s3 where martin is going to new teams and new challengws i beg you please first use racing gloves to protect your fingers and for you to have better grip to your wheel second use two fingers to upshift and to downshift finish this career on auto and than make a new career only with manual not career mode when are you doing a super cooper sunday trev whatever makes you more comfortable go for it join ferrari next year for better starts do the hot lap before the race it warms up your tires and lets you start quicker go to the us grand prix wait till the second series if you really wanted to really get used to stuff like the gamethe upgradingersfuel mix and setupsyou would its really not that hard bro make 2 episodes a day and in the 1st you do practice with all the programs and short qualifying atleast then later the day you upload the race bro this will give you far more time to really get used to things and just change setups based on races brolike where you feel there is alot straights go with more top speed setups etc love the series bro when u are shifting u dont have to put on the brakes because the gears limit your speed get used to the shifting because youll have gearbox issues in career mode of manual this season for sure makes it more realistic loving this f1 series a lot ive been watching f1 for years in my opinion you should stick to automatic this season and then make a new career with manual gearing after this current one yo trev maybe you should try some of the classic f1 cars just a suggestion thats all i thik u should wait till next season to try manual more episodes why would you put career mode episode 15 in the titleclickbaite literally the worst youtuber you should try iracing wear racing gloves for that wheel finish this season first once you start shifting after a while you get so used to it with like timing and what gear you should be in that you wont need the box in the corner another thing you can do is go in the cockpit view trev you gotta shift up earlier if you exceed 12000 rpm your engine will start to overheat quick which is really bad especially in career mode how come you dont show the standings after each race attempt manual with a good wheel u can still use ur older one for manual you can see what tyre the other drivers are on if you look to the left of their name great video as always d pls go into cockpit pov maybe try wearing racing gloves youre shifting too late shift when the lights just switch to purple revving the gears wears your engine you cud continue this season and change the assist to manual next season trev the wheel was a great choice u can turn faster and ur driving a whole lot better i lobe this series cod please play minecraft not sute if anyone noticed but i think you should try full or at least short qualifying instead of oneshot thats when things actually get interesting finish your current season in automatic and then do another in manual but for now turn off the guidelines on the track use the manual shift you will be more faster i like the idea of finished this career mode and starting a new one with the steering wheel wait for next season to use manual you just need to upshift a little quicker totally down for a second season and possibly more of this series you need to up shift a little earlier my man like a second youre always in the rpm ref limiter but manual is a must just work yourself up again to a high ki lvl next season or as soon as the wheel is ready i wouldnt say this game is a sim racer its in between a sim game and an arcade game so this game is a simcade i have a suggestion when turning corners if at all possible tap the accelerate pedal while turning if you dont already ive noticed with racing games if you do that you dont loose a lot of speed so maybe that might work to keep you from being passed it looks like he flips off every time he shift up you should get gloves so you dont hurt your finger it might be your setting that you have on it how about you try some classic cars for a second i thought you got the fanatec wheel lol ha nice i have the same one for some reason i was excited for tmartn to get this wheel then maybe he was you could wear racing gloves i am going to start my f1 career mode with no gear assists medium traction control corners only and 100ai on saturday morning as i am home from tenerife tomorrow hey trev the ers is kinda like a turbo system or an engine setting that can be put to high or overtake use it to catch up to other opponents kinda like drs but u can use it as long as u want i think for the first time using that wheel you are doing very well but some corners you need to break harder or earlier what upppppp you should change your speedometer to mph trever in the f1 cars the seats are more slanted or slouched than usual so on my wheel i am very slanted in the chair but stay how you are because it is better for your body trev what i do is use suggested gear for practice and learn the gears and turn it to manual for quali and the race i think you should wait and not use it in career mode in 1982 the championship winner keke rosberg only won 1 of the 16 races as prostlauda arnouxtambay alberoto de angeliswatson pironi patrese and piquet all won at least a race but two drivers giles villeneuve and riccardo paletti were killed in accident then pironi and jochen mass the two men who caused the previous crashes mass hit villeneuve and pironi stalled and paletti hit him mass had a accident at france and pironi at germany pironi despite racing in only 11 races lost the championship by 5 points and was tied with watson and ferrari won from mclaren renault and rosbergs williams team who won 1980 f1 im sooo early thank u for the content yes the wheel finally im never late for a f1 upload really like this series trev make the button blue if your always early props for giving manual a go even with the broken paddle you could wear like a racing gloves to make your fingers feel better short people problems i think u should stick to auto for this season then start new with some other company and retry manual great videos keep it up man thanks i think you should turn the line off before a race go to your set up and move your fuel load to full if you do this you can race in rich mix the whole race charles is 21 keep the manual shifting trev eventually youll be able to just judge when you need to shift seeing the indicator out of the corner of your eye and eventually after that youll be able to just play it by ear but the steering wheel looks great maybe you should make sure your next team after haas matches the wheel d charles leclerc is 21 my dad has that wheel for his pc yes yes yes do a 2nd season full manual gear shifts pls trev loving the series tip you can alter the ers in the same menu as fuel mixture i love this series the clicking of the paddles is a bit loud its like all the fortnite sweats smashing their keyboards but if it cant be fixed i still would rather watch you shift manual with the noise than automatic imagine trevor with a beard i would love a second season trev this is my favorite series trev please do a walktrough on battlefield 3 and 4 campaign ive seen youve played some of the older cods recently so it could be interesting to see trevor did you try out the classic cars disable anti lock brakes its more realistic early finally love ya trev btw if anyone subs to me ill sub back i really enjoy this series so when u upload races can you do 2 races per episode who else wants trevor to like you comment once you get used to the shifting you wont need the indicator in the bottom right but saying that youve adjusted to it pretty well you should eventually enter f1 esports trev love the vids bro been playing arching everything even the 2017 videos please start doing online as well as career mode you should turn off the guide lines makes the game a lot more fun you should put the camera where we can see the wheel would it be possible to do more than one season in this series guys im doing a lets play of reddeadonline will you guys subscribe im trying to hit

ever 31 minutes long 2 weeks of recording constantly 20 hours to edit and my first video of 2020 its finally here guys my 2019 german gp recreation i hope you are all doing well and i hope you enjoy the video if me i almost played for almost 1 hour it was 54 mins or 59 idk porcoddio che bel video big up from italy insane how do you make that loved every second of it man great job what took you so long to recreate this race why didnt you do it in july 2019 after the german grand prix i love watching your videos you should carrying on you should give a behind the scenes how did u manage this this is so good omg this is just insane wow how did you do this when i watchded this race i peed 7 times there were 23 errors they dont get back on the podium there is no simon lazenby the podium doesnt look like this nor the trophies there is no results screen you showed vettel during verstappen team radio and vettels team radio overlapped verstappens lance stroll didnt win there should be no cheering there should be a team radio only they only show the garage clapping scene when you win a race you shouldve just shown the pitlane cheering scene right the first scene right after you win albon and gasly cars switched gaslys car doesnt jump after crash albons movement should have been more sudden gasly does not lose his entire front wing it is lodged under his wheels vettel did not tap stroll when overtaking and there were no sparks on lap 62 use matt amys f1tv graphics you didnt show the replay of valtteris crash the mercedes livery is not accurate at the top of the halo in the splash screen before the replays it shows regular helmets and teammates it should just be like the f1tv graphic could have been recorded and used the overtake on stroll by kyvat was not correct the commentary should have been kyvat sails past everytime there is a pitstop williams is writing the pitboard gasly is in red bull not toro rosso all the jacks go through the nose the f1 race graphics are low quality you should use the f1tv halo hud mod goddamn that verstappen spin though nico hulkenberg should be facing vertical to the barrier there is no charles leclerc in the back when lewis crashes the second time why is one of the scenes 1433 without special mercedes livery that intro is sooooo good wow its amazing who like wet races how are you making these recreation races in f1 2019 30 years ago nekrews51 told us im working on my german gp recreation 30 years later the german gp recreation its finally here hamilton finished this 9th this race why wasnt this in youtube rewind one of the best content on the planet i was there accualy and we where sitting in the final corner 2339 gaslys 10 on the toro rosso get yourself some friends man youre wasting your life on what is already exists in real life pay respect to williams pit wall guy changing the numbers on the pit board non stop 2 hours long race 428 youtube needs to stop mispronouncing antonio giovinazzis name as nazi its

did it well pretty amazing you have to get a like from everyone watching the intro scene was not right albon and gasly still didnt swap team yet that is one of the best vids i have watched just look for a recreation of germanys grand prix and just greetings from mexico plot twist kubica and russel finish with a williams 12 that would be nice oh man it was fantastic yeah thank you fucking finally the very long pit stop for hamilton was very well made this is basically 30 minutes of pitting 2143 they said nico rosberg instead of hulkenberg 2905 albons wheel i was there at turn 16 masterclass how did you make the scene with hamilton in the pits fantastic work as always and great video this is the best recreation i see in my life 2900 i saw albon 23 on gaslys wheel nice helmet edit though finally had been waiting for this one when i started watching f1 in 2016 i thought nico hulkenberg and nico rosberg were brothers it is really sad that we will have have no german next season hi newcrews lovley video just wondering i really want to make a video like this an i want to ask how do you make these sorry i could not watch it live but love the vid keep up the good work finally germany even though i am a mercedes fan omg its here im going up and down side to side like a rollercoaster classicnorrisaustinjoke a visor full of god knows what u mean the thing coming out da back btw im updating this comment at every funny commentating i though crofty would say carlos sainz is out he isnt though it looks like he was another thing is sliks sounds soo weird i thing drys or whatever they could be called not sliks thats just a weird name max says soft but he really needs to learn his own sport its mediums not softs max crofty said charles leclerc coming round the corand he has crashed corand is cor and and together its sad hamilton crashed because he made himself get a penalty stewards need to improve the rules crofty said nico rosberg instead of hulkenberg but he was talking to nico rosberg a proud fifth comment this is going to be the most enjoyable 30 minutes of my life fourth third second 631welcome to belgium airport ive only flipped a car once how does he flip it so much why are they not so aggressive in my game it will be red flap 053 leclerc i am stupid i am stupid i switch off everything whats your video options 612 f l y b e t t e r 911 this guy would of definitely die in real life this looks so deadly 400 2017 flashback xd imagine having a race where a crash takes out all 6 cars of the top 3 teams battle of the midfielders you really hate ferrari 637 that williams bounce tho 950 mercedes when max get his first win but with a red bull finally a good vid no shtty music just regular sounds and great crashes too thanks for this i once lost control at eau rouge in career and ended up cartwheeling out of raidillon might be an unpopular comment but i think career mode in these games should allow you to get injured and miss races yo my game is coming in tomorrow could you help me 631 emitrates fly better 130 hes hanging there like a cow 734 that is insane hello im a boy and like your viedos becaus i see voll crashes still no wings damage fck codemaster 355 literally noone absolutely nobody nobody at all driver imma crash clearly someone hit the haas when it crashed these are fun to watch keep going who in their right mind thinkq of going to the inside in the castle section in azerbeizijan great video just wondering if you used an extreme damage mod whats your camera settings giovinazzi crashes is reality leclerc edition 650 same as ver in 2015 nice one 020 screw physics turns helicopter at a 90 degree angle 030 156 246 thats why the halo is in formula 1 formula 2 128 poor performance dropped by rich energy 020 rip helicopter 20192019 748 like erricsons crash last year ricciardo just got a flyer really i m surprised its not grosjean that made these mega crashes your videos are amazing but what would make them even better is commentary like this comment for commentary guys how there are called that blue tyres of first clip at 020 there the helicopter is turning unrealistic 610th person here haha giovinazzi crashing on the last corner of china classic meme 402 alexander albon sees crash hehe that reminds me of so has flashbacks why f2 are in the video yessss mega carnage first what an idiot reminds me of scotts yt championship start at bahrain i have to say since the last time that i saw one of scotts videos your editing is great w e l l d o n e 309 he speaks for himself d itb 45 lights and here we go anohhh my ggod no way it cant be can we get this man to 100k pls you shouldnt have been stroll lesson learned you were always going to be shed if you were him 143 thats what you get for using a controller with a racing game casual noobs that drive in tcam hate simulation damage simulation damage is on scott why do i hear boss music 110 never finishes canada twice 232 does this crash look like spa when alonso was in the ferrari or is it me oh get in there bin lewis all i can think of is no controllers available from matt at monaco 256 and this is why i literally do not even attempt to play this game online anymore every race its the same shit and even when you make it through the first 3 corners as soon as you overtake someone down the straight cause you got more speed they pit spin you i mean why even play a game like this if thats how youre going to race baffles me thats so funny bro theres no controllers available that last crash reminded me of alonso in spa 2018 i am watching this from inside my bin get in the bin also loved the comment and that noncensical person behind me haha simulation damage is going to be a thing of the past yet you won in monaco with it on get in the bin for who ever put canada 2011 as the second best race of the 2010s final first corner i hate on the f1 games how when i go to smash someone off my wheel just pops off but when they do it to me they keep their car intact and mine is wrecked yep everybody lives once and every single driver dies at turn one or before turn one in the case of bahrain give this man 100k scott names youtube channel intothebarrier also scott titles video why i hate simulation damage me surprised piakchu meme looks like my moment in grotesque germany has become so popular that other people have started to laugh at scotts misery d get in the bin lewis 043 only an alien would chalk alien activity up as lagging 304 sgt kamarov being harassed by scott 238 intothebarrier becomes romain grosjean for 3 seconds on a serious note ive loved this channel for the longest time the way you talk about races is so appealing to me i was happy to be involved in this it was a lot of fun this tbh though we need spain to be uploaded that that was mental 130 oh my god theres no controllers available theres no controllers available fck anyone hear time to watch dora the explorer at the end that racing line can get in the bin the sheer levels of bad luck here remind me of the good ol days bono get in there lewis itb get in the nearest bin 023 alien indicator for sack stroll17 really good lobby really enjoyed it 131 thers no controllers avaiable it wont let ne sign in nonce i mean nonsensical driver next time provide your live reactions as well i wanna hear the insanity ha hah ha haaaaa the guy behind must have been the torpedo 238 its an open wheel car which is very fragile yet people seem to like hitting each other in to the bin we must go dont every stop doing these 3 get in the bin most of our races at the last race were in the bin also i found it weird scott taking photos of himself after he retired form that last race me trying to live my life involved in it is in the game o you have front wing damage i love simulation damage what do you mean scott uploaded twice in a week hell mustve frozen over get in the bin thats why i gave up on this in 2012 am i the only one that uses the simulation damage always even in monaco and the multiplayer 131 cries in xmattyg 043 althrough is not a good condition to race at least is a good condition to enjoy destruction derby with aliens get in the bin yay im in the video sackstroll17 at the start what do you hate more scott simulation damage or f1s race of the decade poll results when you see intothebarrier upload and the vid is on 3mins oh no woah this dude is still alive shocker whats this scott uploading two times in one week w0w scott made a video d drinking game drink when you hear carnage pirouette a weekend without formula one is like playing football without a ball 2 uploads in about a week scott is deffinatly kidnapped by aliens these videos are great how do i get hd jeff lmao im on ps4 and i aint never heard such a beautiful ginger voice before wow the darth vader guy is fucking annoying is it to much to ask to have at least a decent mic next time mute people with a crappy mic i was expecting germany gp disappointing ben disappointing httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplhayfrcut351mjpkqgcpp5l6c3fipher this is great online racing on f1 2019 too enjoy can i ask where you get the radio messages you sometimes use in your videos am i the only one who noticed that a williams actually won this race wet weather driving in f1 2019 is difficult at any circuit you did your best keeping the car on the track in this race you can see its just so hard to see do a road to a licence on iracing or at least do more vids on iracing u should remove the driver names and then drive it rains far too often in this game fck i am not get in anyone ur lobby i just crash lol you guys make me look good translation im shite but you are shitter im surprised u arnt doing xbox racers if you race in cockpit view its a little easier to see do heavy rain around monoco with sim damage well i crash in any condition so that person in the lobby doing all that heavy breathing really triggered me carrer mode exists ben no i dont think i will i like this kind of video ben where the conditions are just nightmare but there is one thing that its quite disturbing today is the exhale of rcjdollard ben morrowind lets play confirmed wow how gay are

ive been to silverstone in the classic british rain enough times to say god damn that is the closest ive seen to realistic 330 eurobeat intensify cant drive in the rain cant see how do u go into these lobbys the morrowind cut was epic nice run out of the asses i dont know why but i play on ps4 too and my jeff sounds just like the one on xbox and pc instead of the hd one could it have something to do with you having it come out of the pad speakers instead of a headset or something i came to watch a race not hear some crispy breathing asmr that ad timing exactly when like a crash happened whos mic is on as they play at the epicenter for a hurricane david cage left the chat was this the same day as the monaco online race ive never seen such a clean start online in such poor conditions well done lads shit game iracing better youre finally awake morrowind edition turn off name tags 56th to comment idc but noice loved the vid just make graphics ultra low lel you cant see track limits

u found out why rip my connection at 1310 what a coincidence isnt in my screen i just disconnected after the straight ai went crazy ben you need to do more ps4 races they are a lot cleaner and better quality racing in general in time trials there is no tire wear and the tires dont overheat god youve come so far ben i remember the first video i watched from you was on f1 2012 the race around singapore with 6 penalties and crashed out most of the ai keep it up do a live race when i do quick race i always set it on heavy rain because i love rain i thought in heavy rain you have to find the origami killer didnt know you can race in it nice hey do you have a racing league on ps4 for formula 1 im looking for a racing league d jeff sounds husky and beautiful in ps4 sorry could not watch more then 5 min due to the dude breathing in hes mic 333 this is the best pirate i have ever seen ben having a dig at us saying that he prefers racing us because we make him look good well thenalrighty i love these when watching ben there are two givens corner cutting king will keep his crown he will mess up the corner names at silverstone ohhe lagged i gotta stop commenting in the middle of vids i h a t e heavy rain and online german gp flashbacks intensifies love this video rugbymadfan i once did a reverse grid heavy rain race against the ai they struggled to overtake and it was a williams 12 that breathing sound gave me anxiety you should do more classic car races first wet lobby exists rcjdollard heavy breathing hilast time i was this early bens brake pedal still wasnt calibrated if senna can race in the rain than ben can race in the rain hello tiametmard uk cool stuff bro first our first night race of f1 2019 and look at those new lighting effects you should use a wheel it makes the game 10 times more enjoyable trust me set up please is it standard ps4 or ps4 pro i thought its real what the fk wow and vettel truly won tonights race just here in singapore leclerc got 2nd and verstappen 3rd pretty easy to gain position when your opponents all make a pit stop and you dont lol isnt that illegal or cheating that would never happen in a real race singapore is my least fav circuit great race my friend againkeep up your awesome job whats your camera settings bro whats the day 1 patch like you get it wrong in corner 2230 is that a play station pc or your team radio edits are a really nice touch how old are you i love your driving style its very smooth and quick at the same time im a bit more agressive and the career mode of f1 2018 with albon ferrari the season win the first race what is your controller settings sir absolutely loving the daily f1 2019 content so far the best f1 game ever made maybe before i did not like night racing but now i can change my concept haha do you used the joystick or the wheel now that f2 season is in f1 2019 i hope that fe will be in f1 2020 the pit stops look even worse than f1 2018 its actual trash lol quick race i love this guy is it just me or the engine sound is worse than 2018 are you doing the f2 100 race season like with f1 good race whats your best country to race in bros nice video on which platform do you play first i love the graphics and the sound and everything but robert hasnt got his bad arm in the game and that was whatt made watch it in the first place lol they could just saw that he is driving with only one hand edit btw i want to inform you a one fault wich i made i apologize for that kubica was driving in 2017 with one hand now most of the time he is driving with both of hand but not all of the time kubica keep it up sorry again williams too fast you can start on 1st with that williams if you do quali this grid line up was weirdly accurate for spa 2019 you need more practice at shifting and curving great intro sound f1 love it vacum cleaner game still no changing 2012 looks good but im not tired of 2017 yet why with a gp2 car this game looks awesome very nice and mature driving why are the ai rd upgrades so much better than me this is bullshit realy somebody that can help me or explain what i do wrong kubica finish 13 hey what the fuck is this williams kimi that first half of the first lap god that crap hallo is distracting its like ur driving ur house around xbox one x or ps4 pro i cant decide what platform to get it on ferrari 12 and williams not last so unrealistic who is able to buy a racing game with this bad handmade spa the gearing seems off holy fuck great graphics whats your camera settings is there a way to remove the white and red arrow when someone is behind you is this exclusive gameplay from the f2 2019 dlc his right hand is unable to click buttons so why he changes gears and clicks buttons with right hand shame codemasters shame i wonder what people would say if you took this video back to the days of f1 2000 best track spa this is fantasy lol at least in game kubica has as fast car as russell this graphics i cant stop laughing about the fact that you get the achievement competitor when you sign for williams a williams being able to compete with other cars this game isnt realistic i will wait for f1 2020 with the two new tracks the game isnt realistic its impossible for anyone to be able to overtake any car in this williams shit fantastic finally a video without those shitty name tags above well done mate u get it i like how codemaster put the pirelli advertising on the tarmac at turn 7 im gonna do burnouts on it when i get the game robert still got skill but he dont have a car sorry 4 my englishbrawo robert communication with the team in williams team hahaha and seriously robert is poor he wanted to return to formula 1 and they gave him a gokart why is his right hand normal damaging the front wing now it really feels like driving williams kubica finishes p13 in williams croft who weshyo driver of the day ant ant it has to go to george russell they repaired his hand are you polish animation afterpre race looks like fifa 2016 p1213 on finish so probably its not only car problem for williams when i first knew that robert is back i was wondering if they will add this difference in 2019 game i mean differend right hand physic gear paddle only on the left side in case of robert only etc think it would be a nice detail but i see there is no such thing in the gameplay anyway i mus admit that it still looks nicely done by cm why did they even bother taking robert back in he hasnt won anything remotely to a points score as of now but he did good some years back is it just to have someone you know there so the seat isnt empty but then again one would think that theres alot of other takers for his seat these games are getting more realistic by the day it really feels like im watching tv finaly spa in gran turismo sportoh wait how can you play earlier the game michael come on motogames make dem williams great again the opponent sound like a group of bees plot twist motogamestv is actually run by robert kubica engine sound needs to be sharper it is too muffled it is worth to spend 70 on this game i really like the graphics and the physics seems good the lap was a 133158 if anyone here wanted to beat it what logitech wheel is he using for everyone who thinks that you can drive the real thing as easily after the simulator well yeah maybe after a year or two at the gym and a few hundred hours driving to get used to the physical requirements logitech dogshit wheel only 19 and already an f1 driver competitive sportsracing age just keeps getting younger we have 17 year olds competing in xgames this is astonishing to me mainly because im 21 and could only imagine how long these people have been practicing as he said 4 years old casey introduced me to lando i just wantes to know his time why would an f1 driver still only have a logitech great lando in game soft tyres en real life hard tyres in the long left he could break a bit later he sitts in a prosimrig but uses a g920 at the 1st chicane you can drop the car down into 4th gear to get the rear sliding out and then throw the car into the 2nd part of the chicane and get a faster and better exit im in love with lando who the frick can hook me up w him anyone know the song that starts at 040 wow this is so cool seeing them sidetoside the game looks so real they even got the signs and the trees right i hope to see him in the mercedes when lewis goes to ferrari have a look at the tires hes actually quicker irl you know whats weird 67 years ago i played gran turismo 3 on my ps2 and thought it was amazing now everyone plays f1 2019 and takes the great graphics and physics for granted the world has changed gran turismo 3 is also the reason i now have a wheel attatched to a desk at 33 years old lol was a dream as a kid i finally realised just casually wearing that watch why do they compare super soft to hard tyres hi especially in sim racing its really about those very tiny details and its important to collect as many details as possible for each racetrack and each car but where to put them write them down i think its way easier to put all of these notes into an app and got it with you all the time so if you got any ideas later in bed it would be easy to add them to the notes you can share all of your notes with your teammates that means everyone can write down important notes for each corner and everyone will get these notes and learn from them as well so you can expect that everyone out of your team is on the same knowledge level and should be able to go for the same pace and push each other maybe someone has a good advice for that corner which makes him fast and another one got another corner which makes him fast so put them together and be faster together furthermore you can watch and add onboard videos to the app in your private diary to take notes while watching lando your the best got a link to the force feedback and calibration settings you used codemasters kindly gave me the pre release why wouldnt they hes in the game gran turismo 3 on ps2 a man of culture lol he does not use a logitech wheel hahaha he would use a direct drive wheel ect hahah this is bollicks f1 2019 is ok the f1 physics and tyre model is improving all the time but assetto corsa automoblista rf2 and iracing are miles ahead lorris went wider on f1 2019 lando during races focus lando after races sushi didnt realize un until now that his real f1 car is equipped with a logicool steering wheel not fair one is soft one is hard tyres is that a richard mille holy which steering wheel ist that can you make a video witch is about who lando norris normal day look its crazy that even the shift lights on both the game and real lap were almost perfectly in sync they just zoomed on his richard mille i think it costs 270000 hes not used drs very similar in game on softs irl hards its official the virtual world looks better than real life when i started playing the game i always down shifted too often and too early but its interesting how the cars have so much power that they take a hairpin in 3rd gear it would be glorious to see him handle a race with f1 2019 at maximum difficulty it doesnt need to be the whole thing obviously but 1316 laps just to get an idea on real track he is probably faster becouse he has soft tires is game and white one in real norris as far back as i could remember ive always in my head wanted to be in a firm i could remember when i first met well it is interesting that he made a very similar time in f1 2019 but with super softs while in real life he achieved that time with hard tires soft tyre with medium tyre why u not try with you best qualifying time any info on the cockpitrig used note lando was on softs ingame and on hards irl did he notice that the car performance was the 2018 cars not the 2019 cars lol casually wearing a richard mille take him in rfactor2 or assetto corsa with a vr headset codemasters f1 is only a arcade game im surprised he stayed in third coming out of turning three i always find that i have to go down to second the get the car rotated thats crazy to see how accurate the game is with speed and time on a lap wow i want that chair you should have compared his simulator time with one of his real lap times this is simulator that orange richard mille is so fuckin litt its not vr if theres no headset zzz a simulator is not the same as real life its simulated do you feel the g force on corners or straights soo if your really good on sim racing are you just as good in real life im sorry i see an alien on landos shirt as in alien workshop for those who dont know its a good skate company i notice he uses one finger to shift gear i notice i use a few does this make any kind of difference obviously when your parents give you a steering wheel you basically become a future competitive driver nice watch that watch is over 300 thousand dollars barrichello uses a logitech g29 he could buy any brand but he uses logitech and states that the difference is irrelevant for players so stop flaming logitech and worshipping expensive brands since you will never sit your fat asses on an actual f1 professionally note how he is slightly faster irl on hards then softs ingame ps2 at the age of 4 my guess future kids will soon go karting at the age of 3 listen if yall dont fucking take out that chicane we gonna have problems hes using the logitech g29 what is the song at 140 anyone know what watch brandmodel lando is wearing in this video orange one midfield team the real footage lap was during practice if youre able to wear a richard mille at his age you know youre doing something right i have a similar logitech g29 steering wheel and let me tell youthe feedback and accuracy is simply excellent worth getting it with the stick too in game hes using softs but in real life he had hard tires so thats why he could keep up with himself richard millie on the landos wrist this is awesome its funny logitech is a sponsor but at his house he uses the equipment that costs like 10k racing on iracing me yay my first formula 1 game lando norris hold my english tea cant he go make youtube videos when hes done with racing omg i want the f1 2019 game i have the same steering wheel yey lando off track norris f1 is as scripted as a videogame now anyway real life less sterling input f1 2019 game is more realistic than real f1 2019 nice watch what is simracing seat and cockpit he is using thats one cheapest private driving sim setup for an really f1 driver i mean that setup not gonna improve his driving so much since it have common steering wheel and common leg position its my opinion anyway its the small corrections in real car that he does seem to be different he got be chuck norris son lando drives better gaming than on the actual track beaches road a car during a one lap demo with johnny herbert at silverstone who else got here from ar12 should try it with oculus what made formula 1 so special to me was shier sound ever since they switched the engines they sound like race cars but not a formula car it really takes away from the joy we used to have hmmm i wonder if his dad iswas fan of a certain space fantasy opera my thoughts on landos driving fucking awesome does lando have his on channel for streaming his racing sims the watch is like 750000 i have that wheel and play it for forza too bad fh4 has stuffed up the wheel settings but in horizon 2 and 3 its next to perfect i want to know the times funny i asked him on his stream how the sim is compared to the real experience and he told me that its not that close at all to be honest its crazy how close the lap was to the real one gg codemasters rep he uses the same wheel as i do for sim racing what fbbsetup are usedfeels realitic for g920 on xboxx i laughed a little when i heard them call f1 2019 a sim dont be fooled kids lando uses iracing at home wow using a g920 a f1 team should have enough to get a direct drive wheel and be which would probably help a lot more with practice my laptop is only capable of playing the f1 2018 i highly doubt that itll play the new one flawlessly i think without the g forces sim racing must feel like a joke to lando or at least 50 less stress and mental use u let them drive with a logitech wheel nice idea 19 years old and wearing a richard mille watch kids got class f1 2019 interfered with my force feedbackthrusmaster sparco on other sims project cars2 so iuninstalled f1 2019easy choice the feeling physics and handling in f1 2018 was not at all realistic compared to dedicated sim games it feels toylike lando uses xbox xbox players we still have a purpose in this world driving f1 on a logitech is about as far away from reality as you can possibly get this is paid shill bullshit by logitech anyone else realise that he is worse on the game because in the game he was using the super soft tyres and irl he basically matched the game time with the hard tyres the power of the milk thats insane i understand not posting a laptime but maybe a setup that the boys are using good be helpful if they did a track guide like this for every track at least it might give us an idea of what the real drivers think the in game setting should be to mirror reality also i would love to know landos wheel settings and ingame ffb setting for fanatec csl elite with clubsport f1 wheel again to give us an idea of what the real drivers think the feeling should be on our wheels at home i know this is a specific request but im sure doable id love to be in an f1 team sponsored by richard mille haha the bad thing is the the pit entry bruhh you give him that wheel to test it bad so hes been simracing for how long my guess would be like forever difference is when you hit a wall at 150mph you press restart they die a painfull death but with a smile the simulator is more realistic than in real life you see at least the simulator has a steering wheel and in real life there was none for mclaren at indy must be nice to have a way to do f1 as a young kid parents must have money what setting does he use i remember thinking wow im almost old enough to be an f1 racer now im twice the age of these kids norris verstappen leclerc to name a few have more training hours sim included than most f1 drivers on the grid nowadays hence why they are so extremely talented and fast hey i have the same wheel lol norris is cheating his ers is set to hotlap and it isnt budging from 100 through the whole lap xd should of showed us the lap times in australia i got a photo with lando norris and i got his signature on my hat i hope he remembers me heh yeah its not a sim stfu mclarencodemasters put the a lap in real with the red tyre then we will see the real difference oh ffs give us the lap times why does a profi play the worst f1 game on the market codemasters is arcade sh at least max verstappen knows whats good with iracing even assetto corsa mods are better than that can we stop calling f12019 a sim its a dumbed down console based game and the cars drive like hovercrafts in gale force winds why do people think this is a sim its not even a simcade its all arcade soft tyres in codemasters vs hard tyres in real life medium tiers in the game vs hard in reality for those wondering he did a 129418 in qualifying at the french gp and a 133158 in the game his closest time that weekend was his fp1 time of 134110 a shark dies if it stops swimming now how would anyone know whether it died because it stopped swimming or if it stopped swimming because it died soyboys grandprix 4 is the best official f1 game the difference is uncanny driving racing school f1 2019 is nowhere near simulation this dude has cool parents who named him after lando from star wars at least i assume his laps had very different racing lines the new f1 2019 videogame from codemasters definitely not sponsored make the set up available please 029 as far back as i can remember i always to be a gangster he can be really happy he is in the f1 and also in the f2 in f1 2019 the game looks better than the reality this was terrible i can do this lap 4 seconds faster with default setup where was he faster though really cool to watch this knowing i use the same gearing and breaking points as the real driver is a cool feeling love his streams and honestly one of my favourite drivers i have the exact same socks all you simelitist whiners need to go outside and get some exercise i was told that he would comment on this game vs realitythis is not that video thumbs down 326 emirates in real lifefanatec in f1 2019 335343 emirates irldhl and f1 logos in f1 2019 345 f1 logo irlpirelli in f1 2019 347 pirelli instead of liqui moly in f1 2019 351 f1 tv and fanatec instead of liqui moly in f1 2019 elsewhere the trackside and overpassing adboards match the reallife to the full extent he is trying to learn verstappenn styl lolzzz why is lando wearing a 300000 dollar watch richard mill rm 1103 mclaren first workthan show off the game looks like its really hard to tell what the car is doing all i got is that lando is cute i just noticed the tyres in the game are huge compared to real life and after codemasters have released nine f1 games in as many years they still lack features that geoff crammonds grand prix 4 had 17 years ago hes only going to get better hes already improved his starts his race craft is good his pace is good the car is constantly getting better so hell have time to show his talents lando dont like this arcade game he prefer iracing lando chooses soft red in f1 2019 sim but hard tires white in his real life lap the line between sim and reality is pretty thin are u sure lando is pretty obvious about the f1 2019 game he already stated all what he thinks about it on his twich channel why he drives with logitech g29 cant he affoed a decent direct drive wheel or is it coz they his sponsors on the left he is riding on soft in real he is riding hard come to redbull you and max not realistic at all no snap oversteer no understeer under braking no corrections mid corner nothing lots of work to do codies same rehashed game every year even the sound could be better feel old i was playing gran turismo 3 when i was 4 ergh does he wear a richard mille there only a 133158 next season put me in that mclaren what a handsome big fan of norris lmfao a g29 budget cuts do pedals from say logitech have proportional pressure change so that for example if you press 50 down and then 80 down the force required is more at 80 so you can feel the force difference not only the actualy distance that the pedal travelled this is the drawback i experience with a console controller the force difference between either lt or rt is the same whatever the level pressed this is the reason i love sim racing pro drivers can be easily filmed and explain exactly what they are doing as they are doing it why is this called f1 2019 vs reality when the content of the video isnt that i personally think that you should get the best to teach maybe less skilled players tricks and some sort of training just 50 comments about what wheel he uses sad what steering wheel he used playing house wouldnt be any more ridiculous they gave him an arcade game and a logitech wheel hes probably not happy the frenchgp is populair im french my english is not good sorry i really like norris love from holland the difference is that in real life hes driving on hard tires and in simulator on softs how much is it id love to have such simulator so strange lando and i started simracing at the same age under the exact same circumstances and on the exact same game oo if you want to become a racing driver in any area i highly recommend a racing simulator to sharpen your blade training begins at home shouldve used soft tyres for the real life footage wonder if its weird without the g forces of real life funny this because i saw his twitch stream and he basically slated it for what it is but the game and reality are in diffrent compound joke his watch costs more than most peoples houseswow richard mille nice watch logitech wheel top in theory a driver should always be able to drive the sim faster theres no gforces no fear of crashing so you can brake later and you can take risks you wouldnt in the real car shows just how good vid games are now just need vr to be this good fourth fourth richard mille tasteless trash theyve made the real racing more like the game not the other way around and yet codemasters still treats the official f1 title as just an arcade game step it up add some vr support this kid plays iracing not this bull sht my dad did the same i just play for fun these days i want lando to take out hamilton at the start of austria tomorrow and tell lulu he thought he was still racing in the sim look lando is using g29 not a lame and overpriced garbage from fanatec where he says u start to work on your weaker parts well b4 u go out on the track in an f1 car reason y 1618 yr olds r racing nowadays rather in the early days where rookies were 25 years old i dunno that rm1103 though what a beauty i hope he gets to keep it haha hes a pro nothing to add is lando norris professional racing driver for one of the most iconic f1 teams future race winner or even world champion uses logitech g29 if its good enough for him its good enough for me thats the same wheel i have great to see a current f1 driver into sim racing like lando hmm i wonder why they used footage on hard tires while he was on soft in game can we know the wheel config settings in game thanks no vr no money new to sim racing how much does a rig like that cost next wrld champno cap the game is trash thats why he only had bad things to say about it on stream as far back as i remember so 2004 itt lots of elitists complaining about f1 2019 and logitech steering wheels cant believe you didnt show his real life lap time compared to the game time it mustve been significantly different for you not to show it all i saw was that richard mille cant believe he started with gt3 too i remember playing it some sort of summer camp after grinding it at home and constantly destroying everyone on trial mountain fun times that was simply incredible future champ its funny because its that good he never plays the f1 games hes always streaming iracing and you do realise thats the cheapestworst ffb wheel on the market terrible sim wheel landos watch costs 250k amazing how good games look these days getting to the point its hard to tell which is the game and which is real life footage at a glance i like lando he seems pretty level headedbut his dad is worth 200 million and mates with zak brown he just proves that basically if you have the money and the contacts pretty much any one of us could be driving an f1 car its too easy and safe imo these days if lando wasnt born into riches for examplewed never of seen his talent and his talent is from the money spent karting etched actually just be sat at home on a sim rig imagining it this right here is the best f1 sim experience of them all httpsyoutubewnsn1p4vsmk notice the tyre difference codemaster good boy take my money hmmm notice how down force actually works properly with the car sliding around under load and at high speed along with its slippery plastic wheels compared to the unrealistic driving of the other car which seems to have properly working down force and tyres that seem to be made out of some sticky material called rubber that rm that lando is wearing is worth more than an aventador 720s or 488 great quali from lando this weekend austria easily outdoing sainz the difference between virtual and real is the pit lane how does someone that young even get scouted to drive f1 the thing on his hand looks fast i have the same exact steering wheel clearly the best sim racing game this year fantastic sync between the game and reality nice work plis bring us charles leclerc any idea where i could get this similar type of simulator for home use if youre wondering what his true thoughts on the game are he pretty much thinks its terribly unrealistic httpsyoutubexlzztgds0y4 lol he has the same socks as i do how can he drive with the front protection haha funny that he uses our meagre g29 instead of one of his ultrarealistic dd wheels totally not because logitech is a mclaren sponsor nice lap considering he probably only felt like 20 of what he feels in real life landos one of us you should youtube this guys crib he has 2 hand built simulators the game and the reality are completly diferent the game has arcade phisics the sense of speed and g force of a real car would break any new comer to racing that steering controller isnt reality u need a direct drive wheel you cant get podium in reality armchair racers in the comments comparing a kids game to real life ok whatever he was cutting corners hey this was pretty cool please formula 1 fans we need a good formula 1 logitech steering wheel from the mclaren f1 team and that also has a color screen for the next generation of video game consoles i hope that this driving wheel has a good price greetings from chile im quickest no question well lando you are one of the fastest sim racing drivers ofc you are fastest lol logitech g29 really i noticed the game driving isnt as realistic as the actual driving especially when he hits the raised edges of the track its much more jarring in reality the car moves around more than on the game in the real life video on the left the colours red and green are set to bright carlos sainz to be in next video he is even rocking a richard mille mclaren edition more than half a million ah but life is on hard and game was on soft so its not comparable come on why do they use a crappy wheel my guess is esports need cheap wheels that can be thrown away without worry nice watch why dont you use mclaren gt3 wheel wasnt he bashing the game on that one stream poor lando with a g29 and an arcade game it blows my mind how real the new f1 game is god those physics look unrealistic i feel somewhat happy that all these videos i see they use not all videos the g2927 makes me feel bad now that i cant drive with my g29 lol real life faster than the game and norris was on hard tyres irl while soft types for the game turn in on the sim looks softer based in difference of his movements in the little window and the real in car looks understeery lol he doesnt even like how the game playshe didnt like it at all on his twitch stream this is a load of bs if you saw lando norris stream this game a couple days ago you would know that this isnt him racing on the left screen he expressed his disinterest about the game regarding braking inputs and was locking up every corner there is a video floating about where he is quite critical of the game feel bad for all the esports drivers who are forced to use logitech wheels is it possible to buy the shirt that lando is wearing what was his lap time the difference between virtual and real gets further blurred when you realize the real life mclaren f1 car also uses a logitech steering wheel id love to see the championships that the shadow drivers are involved with such as league racing iracingrfactor 2 enduros f1 esports igors fia gran turismo title defense as well as more of his efforts in real life racing be as unfiltered as possible also you could show us all the hardware utilised in partnership with the providers too please show us anything and everything about the world of esports you could teach us the starters step by step how to driver properly how to break how to turn how to steer counter steer tail brake these leassons breakdown from the very start to the now you can go and train to be at the maclaren shadow project incredible i thought that he would point the crowd when the mercedes where battling in silverstone the gasly hamilton one was spot on music is horrible man hats off mate you are a legend i love this battles no vettle vs himself pff rubish vid nice vid man loved all your recreations this year hope you keep up the quality content this season too first comment cuz these video are awesome and i clicked on this video straight away and newcrews is the best youtuber ever and i love it this video is awesome great video newcrews you always make my day better and put a smile on my face for people wondering why a few clips are from the 2018 game this is because i have already recreated them previously last year in my 2019 race recreation series i could have done the clips again but it is a lot of effort to do one thing again once you have spent a lot of time trying to do it once i have not played any f1 games to date and wanted to get into one i could get 2018 one for half the price than the 2019 and wanted to know if the changes and upgrades are significant to get 2019 i know he talks a lot about similarities so i was not sure about what might be better i do seem to like the lighting more in 2019 also i am more of an arcade person and enjoy forza horizon 3 and 4 not the motorsport series no mention of the night time graphics okay has this dude even watched the real thing hows the framrate on ps4 how louds the fan get pls reply who is here after the release on ps now to see if the game deserve it got this game 5 minutes ago 234 what is robert duvall doing in the pits lifting tires its on sale for black friday should i get it yay or nay okay i just got the senna vs prost edition for 25 happy with purchase on medium difficulty its giving me a challenge in a renault for sure led zeppelin reference anybody honestly i dont want to watch reviews so is this game worth so does this mean williams finally achieves a podium finish haha interesting ive avoided buying these f1 games since 2016 as i feel the changes from year to year arent enough i just bought f1 2019 in a sale the changes from the 2016 game are for me a great improvement and im loving the career mode for me this is a 92 score great game and ive played alot over the years code masters nailed it cheers guys it would be nice if an actual fan did the review someone hasnt been watching f1 lately since when has the heat effect behind the car been missing i own both games f1 2018 and f1 2019 and i must say it is valid that lots of stuff from 2018 do repeat 2019 is still better with lots of improved ways ai drivers drive and not to mention some graphical improvements while i personally am not a bit a fan of career modes in this kind of games and i did played it only a bit of f2 parts where i find interviews really irritating i prefer to make my own championship and play as one of famous drivers but that is my personal preference in general game offers lots ways to play one of most interesting ones i find in time trial mode where you can drive against your own ghost on the track best time ofc but also against players ghost online who had best time above you in the ladder that makes it much more interesting imo in general game is well worth the price especially if you do not own 2018 f1 game and wanna try f1 game and also because settings can be set in million ways you can even redesign your hud all in all great game with imo b any option to turn off the flipflop does this guy play on a game pad f1 2019 is a great game glad i bought it and please keep on with this gaming format or even better for f1 2020 we need codemasters on indycar and nascar projects now thatd be awesome best game is actually f1 2006 world championship career mode is broken ai upgrade ridiculously fast in r and d its impossible to keep up do you need ps plus i wish they had the feature where you could make your helmet from scratch but it would look like theyre copying motogp and grand turismo can you build your own team from scratch wait 4 steam sale got it f1 2019 must have commentators anyone agree with my opinion this actually got a 90 on metacritic for xbox one im excited excuse me wtf the interviews have improved if you put it on the easiest difficulty it makes you feel like lewis hamilton nobody not a single soul lukas weber ingmtpnewteammatef2ant02teammate 135 claire you and devon butler have some history whats it like being teammates weber lngmtpnewteammatef2ant02teammate sums up codemasters well question do hoy race in a team someone played on the slim and noticed some lag or drastic frame drops is this playable on a basic ps4 lets hope its more exciting than the real thing great review if you have f1 2018 is it worth buying f1 2019 ok but can we talk about how the driver number is 69 more rewarding than real life yeah it doesnt break your neck at high speed corners or you dont have life threat f1 is a game and marketing tool for a selected few car companies with the intent of racking up millions but 22 f1 drivers are actually the ones having some exciting fun f1 2019 is a videogame product with the intent of racking up millions but where anyone can have some fun with anyone else on the planet 60 for f1 2019 is worth it imo 60 for watching an f1 event in situ not so much at least not with the current state of things microprose grand prix only 4 sequels games impressed much more and revolutionized each game with many real important details than these 10 clone games of codemasters with no oponent games yes not so far away there was opponent companys on f1 games formula 1 and formula 1 97 psx were 2 games of wight quality and details for the consoles think again when you make these reviews with 10 sequels of an company the engine game is an update from 2014 game something is wrong today calling this kind of games the best you right motogp games suffers the same sorted follow my usual method get f1 2019 once they announce release date for f12020 f1 2019 is more for wheel base player rather then controller user disappointing that codemaster focus this f1 2019 more for players with wheel any motion control controls for ps4 controllers 200 shes irish i never really liked f1 until i got my wheel and picked up 2016 for a bargain this series is actually really really nice this is the career mode assetto corsa competizione needs the opening statement alone tells me that i can trust this review hehe man i wish someone would do an authentic wec super season game gadle someone who knew about f1 doing a review on f1 2019 game tire wear is broken during practice and qualifying if you do a 25 or 50 race if tire wear rate is 4x during qualifying on a 25 race that only works if qualifying is 25 too hint its not makes me wonder about some of the more complex physics if they cant properly model tire deg for 1 outlap 1 hot lap 1 in lap is this game playable with joystick curious about replays any info can you replay and entire race or just watch a few highlights thanks lando norris said the game is trash my first f1 game its new for me and i like it when a game is more interesting than the sport i wish i could say that about motogp 108 hats off to ya luke i couldnt even keep up with that oh its like madden but for racing boring 5 years 2014 bahrain a titanic duel between the rosberg and hamilton 2016 going down to the wire leading to rosberg win the championship 2017 vettel challenges hamilton to stop him achieving 4 titles 2018 a battle for five titles between the legends of the modern era 2019 boring till austria because mercs finally flopped and honda didnt flop this game is incredible i cant put it down the night lighting looks incredible the camera shake stuttering is unbearable its lights out and away we go the rd system was actually changed a bit for this game so the upgrade tree for the engine aero and chassis varies from team to team depending on their weakest areas dont you tell me that the theme song dosent pump you up because youd be lying great intro script haha i do enjoy the game more than watching the actual one 2 out of 10 to many tires in the game do the ai cars break traction in the rain or still only just me if you dont watch f1 stop throwing cheap jokes lots of damaged front wings in this video the game look amazing you just couldnt use a wheel you had to trigger all of us that intro mercedes has only dominated because vettel has messed it up 2 years in a row its just f12017 game engine touched up for a second time virtual safety car again get the australia lads to do more reviews ign lets see its ign so theil only give it about 98 put of 10 or something like that spiritsucking mercedes dominance you could not have put it any better than that worse game ever in f1 hate the real thing love the game 3 i find playing this game more intresting than watching it on telly less u wanna fallasleep quick how long does it take to develop a car lets say you use a renault how long will it take to be the best car i remember 2017 too like 4 full seasons by that time i was bored of the game i wish codies took the approach used here to make a new toca game rather than grid i dont know any sports game that really changes that much from one year to the next this game is for f1 fans if u dont like f1 that much then youll probably feel the same way about the game i like it but wheres forza need more forza squeeze inffs theres an empty continent out there 257 gasly to mercedes formula 1 the most boring motorsport on the planet love the review spot on apart from the handling its barely changed me an lots of other feel that were driving through glue an very detached from the car on both controller an majority wheels didnt you find the f2 career cinematics with devon butler highly uncomfortable to play through perhaps we should have the option to play through the campaign without driving i really dont care about ray tracing but i think that racing games could benefit a lot from it this video is the living proof of that p ign f1 2018 8510 f1 2019 best f1 game till date gets 8510 wut logic is this just like last years review best f1 game ever given lower score than f1 17 clearly this review was done before the austrian gp its 85 my dad loves racing games thats why i but this game i would love this on psvr even if it was many less cars onscreen this game really should have been called f1 2018 formula 2 expansion pack and been priced at 30 more thrilling than watching than real thing what do you guys at ign smoke the f1 series is kinda knocking out of the park over the last few years thanks for the review i think rockstar games should launch gta 6 at least on ps4 pro hit like button on this comment if you are in support on this 1 not be able to play the full f2 in career mode just a few dull glances wishing to be fifas journey style 17 to 19 2 senna vs prost instead of simulating epic races between them nothey put on races without time thanks overtaking for me it deserves a rating 610 what else do you expect from a f1 game hundreds of race tracks arent made every year is it doesnt came out on playstation store yet die hard f1 fan here you are the best reviewer ign has also currently driving my partner nuts with the theme tune every time i boot it up im not into f1 i know im not going to buy this game i just really like watching this guys reviews meh been there done that the day i stop watching ign is when they said the new modern warfere game is uncomfortable to play yes its still a decent game and it probably deserves a score of 85 but i feel these yearly released sports titles should get points deducted if it doesnt fix the problems in the previous years version because the multiplayer is still a horrible mess and theres very minimal improvement gameplay wise absolutely not worth the money to upgrade from f1 2018 who prefers the f2 cars and is really hoping for a f2 career mode no vragainin 2019 please make a moto gp game codemaster do a cobra kai review they should use some old classic circuits too loved old hockeinheim with huge straights i wish there was a career mode like this in gt sport when i can play f1 online with others without there car glitching all over the place ill buy it great game 910 for me if codemasters asked there fans what they want to see in the game than it wont feel like a repolished version of the last with a few new tweaks here and there just bought it i agree with everything you said here theyre improving the game every year but only by a small margin once you get the ball rolling in career mode its almost the same as last year i think the f1 series would really benefit from something like the journey in fifa start with karts and work your way up to f1 increasing your reputation wealth etc along the way best reviewer ign has by far just by not being a monotone talking sleeping pill and actually daring to have a personality still one of the best reviewers on ign vettel didnt deserve the penalty why are the f1 games same year but all other games are for the year coming f1 19 comes out this year and fifa 20 will be out in a couple months i think its weird and makes the game seem prematurely old reviewer says introductions and animations of the tracks are the samewell actuallyit isnt and there is plenty of new stuff dont play racing games and not rlly interested but this was a fantastic review we need more guys like this on ign this is the best ign reviewer ever better than forza 415 lol ur car number is 69 404 the red car stuttering like an old mix tape my first f1 game since the 360 generation and im loving it really fun racer great review they did not admit this poor click bait watch worth a buys review of the game for an honest review xmas sale it is then 85 who dont want to watch the whole thing cars3 drive to win im a joke to u i came for luke reilly i stayed for luke reilly should i buy believing this 85 rate wont be better than forza tho f1 2019 is the best f1 to date he literally said the exact same thing last year with f12018 better than the real thing on tv yes none of that irritating commentator im waiting for f1 racer plays f1 2019 did this guy even watch the last race jim jeffries doing ign reviews now you go faster in this game than any of the sonic games if there was an aussie in the mercedes instead of a brit you wouldnt complain 85 thank me later the day i stop watching ign is the day they sack luke from doing racing game reviews 137 such a great answer to the first question i think ill just stick to gta racing then wish they would have added all cars from one season 1999 2001 2003 2004 2009 all the tracks teams and drivers that would be sick i swear i love when this aussie reviews stuff hes normally the best i dont give a damn about your reviews ign i just watch the gameplay luke reilly you rock only if it had 2player splitscreen again still sticking with f1 2014 and xbox one backwards compatibility for my f1 racing they gave it an 85 youre welcome rfactor2 with shader mode f1 2019 mod track and car it would be 1110 i give it 1010 my opinion 85 too fast always the same animations someone didnt watch the austrian gp i cant play for 100 laps sorry this looks great however i think i prefer games with more variety no battle royale mode hard pass for me love your work and vids ign i do reviews also my life is brilliant my life is brilliant my love is pure i saw an angel of that im sure she smiled at me on the subway she was with another man but i wont lose no sleep on that cause ive got a plan youre beautiful youre beautiful youre beautiful its true i saw your face in a crowded place and i dont know what to do cause ill never be with you yes she caught my eye as we walked on by she could see from my face that i was flyin high and i dont think that ill see her again but we shared a moment that will last till the end youre beautiful youre beautiful youre beautiful its true i saw your face in a crowded place and i dont know what to do cause ill never be with you lalalala lalalala lalalala la youre beautiful youre beautiful youre beautiful its true there must be an angel with a smile on her face when she thought up that i should be with you but its time to face the truth i will never be with you so is this game really worth buying this should be on xbox game pass that brian tyler theme soundtrack pumps me up every single time such a consistently awesome series favorite in the genre second the first commenter stinks we got the same birthday toothpaste ikea desk lololol top gear love it only in aaravs videos we can see as exciting races how are your brakes so good and your tire

last time i was this early aarava had just started mydriver first how do you get all those ressource points my thoughts at 617 be like why is putin in japan how did you get that helmet who else is watching just to avoid thinking about the new war what is the blue boxes at th end on the result menu can you make a video about pitting during a formation lap i know doesnt let you but is there another way around aarava could u do video a f1 video but there will be no pit stop f1 2001 gameplay please in f1 2020 they should let us drive in the pit lane manually where the hell is motorsport manager if i hear this man say good start initially but then bogging down in gears two and three im gonna flip my shit should i get f1 2019 or 2018 f1 2018 is half the price of 2019 rather watch manager career thanks anyone know his field of view settings does anyone feel that when driving in suzuka that they want to fall asleep 2 laps in if hamilton dindt have those dnf issues he would be in the lead of the championship at 1740 it shows gasly finished higher than him in the rivalry screen but he didnt if hamilton didnt have all those failures he would be in the championship fight right now finally ive waited for this so long yesss i love those why you playing a game from last decade 1732 what is up with that gasly didnt get a podium i had tuition you know what i didi told my teacher aarava is more important than you why does gasly get the podium finish target at 1732 no confidence in terms of driving in this episode how much they pay you yours is now a job for f1 2020 we should have the chance of getting a engine failure like hamilton has with his curse i honestly wish he had this curse irl so others like seb had a chance of winning again f1 classic playing games 1455 youre welcome 1355 thank me later not mild race wondering if he would upload again the red bulls both did the same lap time in q1 do you think codemasters will bring out f1 20 1830 thanks me later hamilton would be leading by about 30 points by now if it wouldnt be for that absolute curse he has hamilton deserved this championship 6 likes and 1 view youtube is drunk again first he is uploading a decade to late monday is the worst day ever for f1 2020 they need player mechanical failures aarava be playing f1 till the draft letter comes this is a joke first make this comment over 100 likes for no reason first here hope everyone reading this has a good day so is that brakechecking first first finally first did you guys hear the tragedy of darth aarava the punctured how are u doing the game so

said it got blowed by behind xd survive australia 2019 me sees video also me drops my pan of eggs and starts watching this why dont you just wait for the cars to ghost and sit still instead of moving forward slowly this video proves that pirelli tires are no longer reliable how about survive belgium had a shit day at work got home watched this pissed myself laughing you sir have made my day cheers 1400 seb i have a puncture what the hell is he doing mein gott muss da sein so ein bockmist auber auch 322 there were actually 18 cars only the ferraris made it through you are so cursed on this circuit 246 aarava come on guys how much shopping do you need to do everyone else the market market is having a sale 50 off everything is it me or you just put the music from the simpsons hit run videogame dont be so fucking impatient when there is a pileup 1355 welp when lemons give you life that was brilliant im happy that i chose to watch this today you know its good because is more than 15 minutes my man had 5 punctures what about you do a survive on the wheel and see if its easier 723 macintosh plus plays pray for me i want to see facecams lmao do this track backwards pls do survive italy or japan love this series so much thank you will you do the next episode in first person aarava celebrating and ending the video lewis nam man pls f2 pls f2 in italy why no more top gear in road to glory all punctures 412 rr 808 fr 1034 rl 1057 rl 1243 rr 1355 fr and rr 7 total punctures again asking for face cams in survive videos if he does this over the winter break i will be entertained do a survive baku backwards no heroics into sa wait no nvm ericsson punctured your tyres is it just me or is it painfully obvious hes crashing and messing up on purpose to make the video long tries a 200iq move by playing as kvyat to avoid being eliminated by him kvyat eliminates himself there is no escaping the torpedo aarava i got nowhere to go also aarava keeps driving forward you know the inside could work if you had a wee bit of patience who else noticed at the end there was only 5 cars left in the race we are baku for more woo this might have the funniest first attempt ever man i love this series so much 1057 where the heck did that puncture come from attempts 16 me at 1357 time for another rage filled video 2009 game punctures just can from nowhere i wish i got punctures for running over front wings in f1 2019 17 minutes of aarav anger sweet do australia shit havent watched but 17 min this is gonna be great aarava could you do an f1 experiment with no downforce in monaco now backwards even though its abu dhabi no heroics into san de vote why do you keep going forward even though you know you cant go through are you sure you arent doing that on purpose so if you have nowhere to go 201 why you send it in racing point car can you do survive bahrain 5 finishers and hulk still didnt get a podium f more more more aaravs friends what did you do today araav aarav shortening my life by years like usual puncture off the lights me intothebarrier pirelli montage intensifies better than the actual azerbaijan gp aarava relases survive video keyboard aw shit here we go again just wait for them to ghost u dont have to move 720 mate u just said string theory actually thats alternative universe which is based on string theory which supports 11 dimensions which exists and infinite number of universe exists and theres possibly what u said will be true every time he crashed was because kvyat wanted to buy some vodka at tesco 17 minutes of gold me gets a notification from aarava also me yes an episode where he gets angry your tires are made out of paper valtteris rear right tire has entered the chat do bahrain survive u have survive brasil instead of baku on the hastags i was watching the veloce open lobbies video that got uploaded before and as aarava span off in belgium i got the notification for this and as soon as i saw baku i knew this was gonna be good these survive videos make me howl can you try and do it in rain at baku during night time what if his drs fails please do backwards survive please please 1058 orgasm warning 720 big brain move and the episode that hulkenburg survies he still cant get a podium do a tbt video and do survie f1 2013 and 2014 those mods were the best 1057 now thats a new level of bs pllay roblox f1 games for maximum meme and yes they exist theres literally market building on the outside of turn 2 so thats where everyone is going after thier parking aarava are you boiling tea from your mouth arrava annoys me so much you know what is going to happen so wait like when he was on the inside multiple times just fucking wait some crazy uploading aarava why dont you upload this video on pornhub early aarav you happy with the result today here we go again with aarvas rage and frustration i think i have seen this last week hope you do a survive series with the nascar mod installed lol i just finished watching survive canada 2019 you need to do hockenheim because why not and do it in the heavy rain this happens when danil the torpedo blyat joins f1 1 view 9 likes good job youtube i want to see it with the f2 cars oh nothing is ur fault no way who says that is ballistic grabs popcorn nearly first comment this isnt gonna go well at all first if you all red my last community post i told you guys we where gonna have a bit of fun after hitting 21k subscribers so i decided to make an insane crash compilation and tbh the video is due anyway as if you have noticed i only do this video once a year and ngl all of them so far have done extremely well which is mad considering i dont really do much of these videos aha also in the video do not expect some of the crashes to be realistic as the video is just for fun because i know what people can be like 429 that is the best thing i have ever seen on f1 2019 what damage mod is this the toro rosso at 0434 when it black friday how you made that halo cam 409 needs some hardbass only daniil the torpedo kvyat himself is capeble of that move kudos great video ok seb box wrong setup what do you mean i think the front wing is upside down man i think we must stop with drugs i see flying ferraris copy lewis awesome video nekrews love the crashes hope youre well f1 2020 needs to change the way how you retire from races after you wreck either have it wait longer so you can see the full wreck or wait till the car is at a complete stop before you retire from the race im hanging in there like a cow awesome stuff d no one absolutely no 1 f1 2019 theyll be grand without a safety car lads what do ye think it would be awesome if we had damage model that does more than front tyres and front wing its a yes from me they need to make it so the game doesnt cut to the flashback so soon after the retirement they added mission winnow logo the driver face cam shots are really cool how do you get them though a vid showing how to do it would be coo this is fine how do you made the helmet cam that maclaren took a good ride this is some good editing man good job nekrews 51 you goin to motogp and football vettel should retire a very good vdeo im enjoiying all the time that start of the video didnt set so well 816 the engine in the game is similar to reality hopefully he doesnt have a spin this video jinxed him you actually jinxed him he did it again wow he actually ended up last and spun aarava im about to ruin this mans career any chance you can somehow drive as vettel in real life too this was actually before the race next time to a last to with hamilton or bottas pleaze i told you you needed to stop from last tot last challenge wait the spin never came p vettle p what is this shyte you freakin geeks recording yourselves playing games listen to you yapping away taking yourself so damn seriously smh well i guess you cursed vettel then i hope i dont jinx sebastian vettel doing a spin or something like last year hopefuly he doesnt have a spin 109 i hope he doesnt have a spin like he did in 2018 this aged well just came here to say in a way you basically jinxed vettel you and alfa have inside info how did you know he would drop to last well that aged well you jinxed it again he had a spin seb kinda started from last indeed 108 i hope vettel doesnt spin meanwhile in the racevettel its mission spinnow shit you nail itat least the beginning it got too real predict lol wtf vettel had a spin in the race once again you jinxed it xd leclerc win the race predicted again lol im sad for vettels race today very accurate indeed aarava knew something about vettel doing a last to first how did you predict that vettel spind in the real race you jinxed it my prediction is lecler gets over taken by the two mercs because they have a tow you should do a last to challenge but in a backmarcker car or in a car in the midfield ahh should have done it with verstappen there are lots of jokers in here not cool i dont think there is enough turns for the arrows to take advantage over the horsemen could have used his monza helmet mod i think hamilton will win but i really want leclerc to win did you just weave at the end of the race omg bro you are talking toooooo muchd let me think of a joke q3 the fia must set the q3 clock on 90 seconds everywhere on all tracks this would be really hilarious what camera settings are you running i think you shouldve done a first to last with verstappen my prediction for the race tomorrow 1st leclerc 2nd hamitom 3rd vettel 4th bottas and 5th verstappen i hope that my prediction is right lec ham vet outside chance for ver if the rain clouds come thanks for an interesting challenge all four wheels off track limits in almost every lap at last turn charl ruined sebs lap imagine if 810 happens on the last lap on sunday the absolute scenes i think leclerc 1st hamilton 2nd vettel 3rd what is your favourite f1 team lec ham vet bot max verstappen be watching this since hes doing it tomorrow i think charles wins the race 2nd is lewis an 3rd is sebastian you should have gone with max q3 was a shamelewis will make it i predict or i hope so at least let me tell you a joke gasly is still in red bull shouldve done it with max since he has the penalties leclerc win dont tell us who got pole in the future dumass charles will win but russell will be 10th q3 like what was that but halmilton leclea last 2mins of qualy nigga said q3 was a yoke last to the qualify challenge i took my lunch break early to watch q3 and didnt even get to see my boy albon put up a time thats what i get for being american who needs circus when f1 is so full of clowns i love this video would also love a like on the comment x the last qualifying was a yoke a yoke i think its gonna be leclerc pulling before drs so hes gonna get 1st and then vettel then lewis i dont have sky f1 so i am going to ask wtf happened in quali to make everyone talk about it drivers but letters in there name are switched hewis lamilton vax mersatppan pergio serez vettel should winhe had the pacei believe in him sainz engineer is probably smarter then bono and james leclerc is little seb helped him to win in belgium and now that what the f leclerc wins a yoke the q3 what a yoke you wanted say verstappen last to first challenge verstappen will finish 4th hamilton 5th bottas 3rd leclerc 2nd and seb will win end of q3 was pissperiodend of story getting through the traffic looked easier than trying to get through q3 galley didnt help kvyat much why didnt you do it with vestappen he qualified last for engine change hamilton win to anyone who watched qualifying that was just embarrassing for every team none of them had balls to be ahead all should get penalties except kimi as he crashed out let me think of a joke the last 2 minutes of qualifying yo how fast were the renaults q3 what a yoke that q3 was a yoke fourth first leclerc second win in a row first strollhe came back to circuit like an idiot strolls engineercopy that strollcopied 147 it was gasly that got hit by ricaardo get in there lewis yes i am crying lol sebastian vettel i have concentred in 2020 and have destroyed at mercedes in australia bahrain vietnam and china why was there a flag of finland at charles position at canada please more from this its very funny lets talk about me alex albon number 23 try and stop me

thank you so much for making this definitely deserves this like i liked the meme surprise mother fker 038 the ferrari had a williams cockpit come on charles i am a five second yoke stupid good video keep up until 2021 or that was a bruh moment for me to see ferrari with a willams steerling well kimi what hell bowah i have 2 questions how did recreated the races how did you put the 2019 grid in f1 2018 531 the best fucking thing ive ever heard in my life well done mate to another year off f1 hope next season will have another world champion 99 of the video get in there lewis how do u have those ferraris in my f1 2019 i got the old ferraris wtf ur name hurt me when i tried to pronounce it this must have taken forever it was so amazing and so funny i suppose that untasfasfled doesnt like lewis hamilton every single driver tries to avoid contact to the maximum daniil blyat for mother russia huuuurraaaaaaa get in there lewis g e t i n t h e r e l e w i s are you crying hahaha aahwnn i think im crying can you do if kvyat plays f1 2019 waitat 259 is a finnish flag over had of leclerc crash without driving the car the worst is grosjean will probably find a way of doing this critics daniil kvyat dont deserves an f1 seat kvyat finishes 3rd in germany critics suka blyat 252 since when did charles leclerc come from finland can you do a video about what if hamilton played f1 games hahah sainz not getting screen time isnt this the 2019 f1 2018 mod because the letter font is different editfor half of it nobody everyone with russel thats sad that he got no points everyone with kubica you donkey only 1 point he is the worst f1 driver of 2019 hahaha great video mate german gp best race of the year liberty media hippity hoppity get the fuck off my propety everyone put an f on the chat for alonso a yoke fernando alonso why have the ferraris a williams steering wheel 044 by far the best part of the video 451 hahaahahahahahaah thanks for making these nutshell videos man hope we see more in 2020 see easybwoah awesome content keep them coming is the ferrari steering wheel in bahrain right it looks like the williams but i thought ferrari used the screen on the wheel itself five seconds is a yoke a yoke that had me dying honestly great video 044 wait wtf ferrari with a williams steering wheel wtf is hamiltons attack over lmaooo how did you act out the races in the game yes you are stupid torpedo killed 3 drivers in that season how many he killed in next its lights out and away we go bahrain was such a joke merc acting like they did a lot of work u just stole first 1st because leclerc had an engine issue can we take a moment to appreciate how well the situations are recreated utterly brilliant very precise edite wow why is this the fking 2018 game and not the 2019 game lol i think we all know that you used f1 2018 but nice work at least bottas got to lead the championship for two races even if it was only because he got fastest lap in the opening race while hamilton didnt get it in his first win the race after vtec kicks in honda 12 finishes at 256 i thought leclerc was from monaco not finland i can see on the top right crash when not even driving the car kubica pushed the shit out of that volkswagen polo wut is up with the ferrari steering wheel 933 is that really seb who says that in finnish where did you get this gem from in canada leclerc has the finland flag above like if saw totally in bahrain not the williams f1 2018 car disguised as a ferrari so i wasnt the only one who thought charles radio rants read like emails hamilton is such an idiot from where do you taking the uncut uncensored radios f1 tv sebastian vettel i have concentrate in this year 2020 and have now we can fight and have now destroyed at mercedes in australia bahrain vietnam and chinese in march what happened with graphics in bahrein this video made me laugh so much lmfao good job i thought it was gonna be shitty f1 2019 footage but it was good nice vid best way to watch the f1 season imo fast sweet succinct and you get to see all the drama of the season in 10 minutes 252 finnish charles 101 how is ferraris wheel like that in russia ferrari was not the blame of the strategy this time they was unlucky this had to be the worst season in history soi like how you used the 2018 game and changed the liveries of the cars for some of them xd for bahrain that ferrari is so clearly a williams and the night race graphics arent as good as 2019 xd the raikkonen escape tho you know vettel a great guy and has heart when hes pissed over the penalty loss and yet hamilton who i hate and is his rival he then says to the crowd to not boo him why ferrari has williams car look at the steering wheel at bahrain the entire decade in a nutshell your placement of strolls car was wrong he was more on the apex hence why he had to move especially after the events 1 week earlier dont worry grosjean ive done that more times than i would like to admit right in australia was the fuck you gate get in there lewis sounds funny i likr how you implemented some 2018 memes as well i was angry when i hear that alfas get penalty after race on germany and too when verstappen crashed on rikknen on spa best compilation ive seen in some time the bahrain ferrari stering whell is so cool get in there lewis 947 vtec xdddddd laugh hard why does this ferrari and merc seem weird you know were all really desperate when in under a day this has 85k views that was a smooth operator smooth operation nanana landos team radio at spa will never get boring leclerc was on pole in austria rob sniped that 1 point like a champ lets talk about me alex albon number 23 try to stop me getting past thats ok i overtake you on the grass lewis was really crying this season happy new year everyone 615618 what did this man say how did the ferraris have the steering wheeldisplay fitted separately from the wheel in bahrain la williams as always an excellent recreation of real lifesituations nevertheless i love the rosberg memes did you get the uncensored version of bottas to whom it may concern f ya salutation sir hats off 045 why does the ferrari cockpit look like a williams the vetch had me dead why we are so slow just sucks that f1 has a long fatty for hamilton from russia you missed that thing rovert irs paul we need retire to safe parts you are a fucking genius anyone from 2020 is it only me who gets annoyed because of the ferrari wheel wich looks like a williams one its hilarious how salty the uploader is about hamilton 944 vtec kicked in yo lol those emails so good that fart noise when vettel spun in bahrain got me aeu was not boring we even had intersting laps without drs 434 you forgot perez and bottas anyone here from 2020 oh man you should add lewis being worried about the tires in mexico what vettel said at 932 can any finn translate this earrape at 215 verstappen is riding hamiltons donkey as per subtitles i thought it was a red bull magnessen is and will always be stupid charles leclerc 2018 suzuka sees sainz on the podium with everyone else me perfectly balanced as all things should be who noticed that bahrain gp is on f1 2018 mate in austria leclerc was on pole not hami or bottas genious why does the bahrain ferrari have a williams wheel i laughed so much your videos are better than the most of meme on the market dude could have saved yourself 1026 by just putting a 5 second video and putting he wins again yes him yawn if maldonado played f1 games untasfasfled how did you get the replays so close to what exactly happened in real life great job love ferrari meme in the box vtec was best is the abu dhabi gp over 859 i commented this line 7 months ago on the video if bottas would play f1 games 0033 i finally hear the uncensored version this was nicely put together this was so accurate to reality that is more than just a gold that is pure platinum lol brilliant great video singapore 2019 exists kimi bwoah kvyat heres some revenge for the winter war im guessing 2 second penalties got wiped from formula 1 dude why are you using an older f1 game for bahrain looks like shite aha my favourite video this year bleep out the swearing or i will report you for rude language i have a brother 3yrs younger than me wagching this so bleep it memes to watch when there is no f1 races httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqmshmx0jjw this is the best video of the world french gp boring fiaok boomer well return magny cours f1 fans n a n i rosberg is hhf gonna return 036 why tf is that a ferrari livery on a williams chassi wtd is this what a car the ferrari 2019 in one sentence ferrari its james stolen lmao i got a fish ad halfway through the video i love how savage bottas can be he is such a cool guy kubica in sauber one victory is a succes kubica in williams one point is a succes thanos need 6 infinity stones grosjean need 6 infinity crashes nice f1 2018 i love the ferrari pit crew as clowns with the squeaky noice still love them is vettle jump start was a joke for you p16 car 16 charles leclerc how ironic also231 926 lewis i cant look after these tyres anymore theyre dead press x to doubt 711 the moment that everyones waiting formula 1 except the curse words shows what the hell this was great well done again i noticed in bahrain ferrari was the williams anyways happy new year everyone the williams is in a ferrari livery 934 just plugged the finnish into google translate it came back as no satan ass fuck friday liked before watch how did u get the mercedes livery from germany never heard lando swearing so aggressively leclerc gets p4 with an engine problem vettel spins out and falls behind with no mechanical problems whatsoever this is why ferrari needs to drop vettel and bring back kimi or find some new talent you playin on a ps4 i can tell cause the cars look hideous some of your best work here love it fucking brilliant as a ferrari fan this season is one of the most worst one not sure if its because its 4am and i am stupid tired but i laughed so much at this the ferrari clowns got me every time ilike your sense of humour 300 leclerc with the finland flag i made it in without a gp2 engine love how you bring vtec to gaslys part observations from this video halo cam from merc in australia makes me think its the formula e car ferrari continuously shoot themselves in the foot and hinder leclerc lewis hamilton goes faster when he states his tyres are dead kvyat has a torpedo system in his car does the strategists email actually work i like how its wacky mod of 2019 i 2018 game at bahrain yes finally if charles leclerc played f1 games 450 old man shows em how its done f1 2019 in nutshell still plays f1 2018 lol spain and france were most accurate for all the german word bockmist means goatshit why spending money on the official f1 season review when you can watch this gem for free you forgot romain kevins fight in barcelona after 50 seconds i realised this is not real recording im waiting for 2020 season mainly to see grosjean crashing without car or not driving i think we should make new list for grosjean ideas its an interesting tactic to keep pole position hm yes the qualifying here is made out of qualifying crash while not even driving the car 331 can we all take a moment please for a the loss of antoine hubert who tragically lost his life at spa in the f2 championship alwayswithmeah19 and b that williams scored a point sooner than that vettel got his 1st and only win of the season the second race looked like it as filmed in the 2018 game the ending was the best part french gp doesnt have any footage lol love it still better than the real 2019 season i see what you did there with the ferraris long time waiting for this video very accurate thumbs up 814 oblivion love conquers all including tyre wear 252 why the hell there is finland flag 253 why is a finnish flag over leclerc 252 leclerc is third on the podium but he has finland s flag get in there lewis 725 that feeling is undescribable thats awesomefucking finally explosion is this video over i think im crying come on charles noooooooooooooo 940 is great this really made me laugh thanks that was just brilliant the video i didnt know i needed please do if daniel kvyat played f1 games that grosjean crash checklist was too funny xd how is mercedes special livery in the game record if kvyat played f1 games please do if magnussen played f1 games if kvyat played f1 games if sainz played f1 games why did ferrari have williams chassis in bahrain 552 jesus christ never thought id hear lando swear like that if lando played f1 games why the ferrari cars have william wheel and dashboard brilliant haha smoooooth operatoooor what a great ets 2 cameo i am inevitable i am iron man i am speed i am stupid other than alonso haunting the seasons races hearing the uncensored radio is pretty good too 910 i think norris is closer to saying its bwoken its bwoken f1 2018 intensifies with ferrari 2nd clip xd at 331 crash while not even driving the car i bet grosjean can do it bring back the fucking v is vettels career over this is your video from your game when you realize that charles car was a williams in bahrain fbi open up what a such an awesome video get in there lewis i think ericsson hit us get in there lewis that was fucking awesome bro leclerc and vettel are two kids fighting for victory and ferrari is to stupid to handle this anyone from 2020 the vtec got me xdd you forgot kvyat torpedo at usa 1007 carlos actually getting the podium celebration he deserved wipes tear finally i hear the original uncensored sound version p more videos like this during this break easily the best f1 winter

thanks for the video i was waiting for this and 1st charles before i start my question i have to remind you of five races i read it quickly no doubt you have more good races than that once but if we stick to the less good races misshaps such as baku where the ferrari hit the barrier in bahrain where u lost the lead due to engine problem in austria where were you catched by max in monaco your first home race was very disappointing with last place and probably lowpoint in hockenheim it was a mistake by a driver and last and proceeded to finish after your hard battle with your teammate now my question to the popstar of formula one what was your best race among your worst aces can you give us please a ranking regarding your five not so good races starting with your worst i am a polite plur person or man please excuse this question but i still hope an answer thank you where are the component retirements its my birthday on 19 november peeee five now we hate stroll for a whole different reason in the end he nearly reacted like gasly just nearly alternate title survive lance stroll and carlos sainz dont underestimate the honda power unit you are not learning from mistakes ahhh now we know what charles and seb had 403 hes still mad about the recent races in road to glory how about survive belgium as a canadian i personally apologize for strolls behavior impressive on a keyboard m8 2150 the laugh of someome who has gone mad with power front wing f1 2020 ideas vid stroll will end you challenge alternative title 23 and and a half minutes of v6 shopping trolleys alternate title doing what the ferraris couldnt this is a really nice mod to train on just trying not to do contact with others do survive bahrain the relief in your voice when u saw that massive pile up who ranged most ararava on survive brazil 2019 like markiplier on get over it comment would it count if i used simulation can you do a turtorial on how and where to download this mod we want the career with the keyboard watch out for estaban too 300 my man grosjeans got it why you not try survive 2 laps or 3 laps if you can v 23 minutes of ararava hitting his desk when he crashes survive brazil backwards aarava i laughed so hard when you got scared now we know who 5 drivers in f1 aarava hates now survive backwarda 2152 best voicecrack of all time is that stroll do survive bahrain what a poetic ending 1920 if he couldnt out drag gasly he definitely couldnt out drag a redbull u jinxed charles leclerc with ur last to first video that race was da best a reason why u didnt beat albon is coz u rode the curb and went on the grass u could of got p10 but love your vids aarav my fav series this is maybe brazil in backward i think he should have to do all 3 laps i am brazilian and a like your videos no heroics into curva 1 please the happiness when they crashed was unreal that was a smooth operation this is the 2nd best survive ever the best is the 2014 2015 wet monsoon weather usa survive no doubt unbeatable next video survive brazil backwards you should let yourself do more laps and make it so that you have to survive for as long as you reach p10 where you download the mod just me that got raged watching this you should to a last to challenge with a midfield car and try to be best of the rest 23 minutes of aarava going mad nice way to end my tuesday the hardest will be suzuka this reminds me a lot of the good older survive series the frustration felt a lot more genuine than showy your luck that stroll is in the racing point and not ocon this is madness probably the longest survive episode in history i missed this series makes me laugh every time great job aarav me aarav hey whats up guys aarava here me 143 jeff has said it so many times and you still mess it up 23mins i cant wait raging is waiting to happen and can you do more backward survives the ferraris made me laugh at first and cry at second as they really need to somehow solve the inside rivarly issue what is your favourite f1 team yesssss finally i was already waiting was this the mod that was used by vettel and leclerc irl 2055 ahhhhh shit here we go again so hard with the keyboard aarav loses a bit of his sanity every survive episode he records 2147 watch this at 025x the broken physics are not because of the mod clicked faster than the red bull pit stop at brazil why keyboard not a steering wheel can you do a full 25 race in the merc at monaco or a full quali session at monaco where and both you have to get to the top 5 imagine doing a survive brazil in the wet im pretty sure this is your longest survive episode ever there was a mclaren in p4 hi how did u get the mod i would love to see a livestream of this sometime love the vids if i get 100 likes arrava has to do a survive career we need keyboard career more like if you want it too aaravs greatest rival in this video stroll why do you say sennar s instead of senna s i bet you hate stroll as much as i hate vettel rn lol just here because you hyped it up on twitter usually ignore these videos because it gets old quick for me how to play survive plz do a survive championship its be great if u showed a replay of what called that pile up on the last try rage entertainment didnt see that coming 23 minutes of aaravas pain perfect hamilton couldnt outdrag gasly people cant survive the normal gp let alone this really enjoyed these 23 minutes of survive kimi watching this video drunk bwoah this looks like the 2019 brazil gp you should just do it without the p10 nonsense who even suggested it anyways 2323 perfection sainz is the new ericsson imagine if he was hitted by leclerc to do podium i think well do it in the next 2 attempts takes aarava like 50 more attemps editwow 9 likes mate i am really a big fan of uits a long video i guess filled with goodies i love the wat aarava comentasts on the video i wish there was a face cam 23 minutes of survive is absolute gold that was not your smoothest operater my man this video is so pure surviving was harder in the wet ill tell you that petition for him to play fortnite albon and leclerc could not survive multi time champions i edited this comment so nobody

of videos hello my fellow people when its 23 minutes long you know its gonna be good love the survive videos can you make more first ben marry me emma they arent coming around to that proposal lets try something else tiamwtmarduk nearly 400 points off verstappen in the red bull red bull fuck it well sign him anyways interesting to see how every team that ben touched are rock bottom now ferrari renault toro rosso bye bye red bull gonna be a damp squib here but disappointed to see career mode take a serious backseat i was down to see a final video for the season but 25 races bit of a copout career mode is 90 of why i enjoy this channel dont let it slide into obscurity please missing the league racing as well p4 being the the best in this season is bad nico hulkenburg fucking finally season 5 ready for season 5 lets get it you is the best f1 youtuber in english youtube such a shame you try to destroy this game ruining career mode the best part of the game doing lame ass short part of it now and that while you do upload some lame racing stuff from aseta corsa and such and online random stuff which is far from career mode also whining for having great race like that is where racing is about lol who cares if it is about podium aarava won a championship in a toro rosso good video i can see why you wanted to make a video with all of the last few races in this season because even though its been a great season for you its also been frustrating good luck for season 5 2952 as a dutch f1 fan i long for the day we can see that sight irl please begin your next video with hello there from the obi wan meme youd make my day if you check out and subscribe to my channel should of went with racing point or mclaren it would of been more interesting next season looks highly interesting also love how max did his doughnuts where him and ocon collided in 2018 teeing up to finish f1 career mode on episode 100 i like your style are u doing another season or this is it 259 4 seasons driven but not learn how to drive i see litteraly steering in on hamilton look at stroll up on the podium in brazil i love suzuka for all the crazy crashes there i hope codemasters never fix it i think you shall create a new career almost everything is maxed and you cant gain anymore somebody please tell me the name of the song he plays as an outro ive searched the lyrics nothing comes up ben i can tell you lukas will be a though teammate to beat he destoyed me when he was my teammate in toro rosso i only beat him 5 times after u have finished with career mode can u do a montage of the best moments 128 another grosjean how you switch career mode settings why you did all in one video in before lukas is displaced and ben is teammates with max wow the only f1 title verstappen will ever get v you gonna do another season it took me 7 seasons to finally win the title with all the upgrades but it made for a more fun game for me now i can finally go for the constructors tooooo can u pleas continue with this serie love that the suzuka t1 ai crash bug has survived like 16 or so major patches lukas weber is basically like felipe massa always in a competitive car always in the title hunt never gonna win youve only driven 3441 laps could your camber and toe angles be the cause for the tyre over heating problem aor classic have a nice season ben was the first manor season in f1 2016 not worse than this season lets not forget that this whole season of career mode happened because of magnussens subminute lap at interlagos muffled suck my balls mate noises in the distance ricciardo swaps teams to not get any more reliability issues ricciardos car its rewind time been loving you vids keep up the fantastic work as ricciardo would say lets get out of this god damn hell hole perfect video for someone to see how inconsistent this game is i almost thought you bottled the first race at the finish line shame that this is the only reason series i watch on this channel most entertaining and brilliant to watch hopefully theres a season 5 hamiltons name looks so wrong above a ferrari lets hope he stays a silver arrow lando on the podium in suzuka d a m n when will season 5 come out got home from work tuned up youtube and i see bens going to finish the season and i am like did i miss something somewhere and then i started the video and it all came clear to me ben moves to red bull to race with lucas but lucas thinks otherwise and joins ferrari and still beats ben you are paid to sponsor the game you have the tricks watching this instead of studying for tomorrows exam thanks for making me wait ben nice work ben also sorry for the fire coming out in your country hards at russia wtf with ricciardo retiring in your career mode its kind of weird cos he keeps retiring in mine hate to say it but this seems like a lazy video i actually laughed out load at the gasly scream when they accepted your contract well done bet there will be rule change red bull will be midfield team when will ben start league racing cant wait mery orthodox christmas did anybody else notice that this is part 79 so hes gonna finish with 100 ben you should chose mercedes or mclaren and put finally max difficulty there is no interest in watching you racing a topic car and only the first one putting a max difficulty honestly even though you struggled and even because you struggled i think this was one of the greatest seasons of tiametmarduk career mode and this was one of my favorite episodes ever i think that being said i cant wait for season 5 lets get this ben half assed the rest of the season so i half assed watched this video 2932 that actually happened once before in season 3 of your f1 2016 career mode gasly scared the living shit out of me ngl i just finished binge watching your whole f1 2019 career mode 3422 sidebyside with sainz you were sidebyside with the memelord not the chili wheres part 78 i wasnt able to team up with lukas when i moved to his team which sucked because i wanted lukas and not daniel ricciardo dannys still pretty cool though and we won the cc plz go 2 haas or racing point going to laugh if verstappen ends up in torro rosso i was laughing so hard when you said i think i did a happy wee im still laughing im crying plot twist kvyat partners daly at red bull i know that youre hyped up on getting more subs ben and i dont blame you really wish i could make videos but anyways i just want to say that maybe you need to step back a little look at your goals and look at your community we understand that career mode wont get your the 5 billion subs marker or anything but it would really be a shame to let it go off entirely until the new game comes out im just asking for the community for a weekly career mode video daily was great but it did become monotonous a vid a week would be fine it would give us some suspense crash verstappen wins season 4 damn he never crashed right to be honest id much rather have a bit longer breaks between career mode videos one a week maybe at least than for you to get sick and tired of it and cancel the series f1 2020 is still a long way away or maybe you can try career modes from other games could work too red bull got on average nearly 40 points every weekend the maximum possible is 44 thats really scary your setup for cota is probably a reason why your tires overheat time trial setups are for time trials please go to my channel i have started now and i need subs was excited to have career mode back then saw 40 minutes and got more excited then saw like 2 minutes devoted to each race and left pretty disappointed miss the old videos with almost the entirety of a 50 percent race in it imagine if he had displaced weber and not verstappen breaking news red bull have signed benjamin daly for next season nico rosberg youtube is webers red bull career over more breaking news lukas weber has announced that following his contract with red bull being terminated he has decided to retire from formula 1 with immediate effect does he use simulation damage or full do a whole season in1 vdo respect that you managed to get 5 races in a video while not making the video boring to watch i greet for the multiple time as well benethen nice sendoff 9 yr olds plz do more i need the moneyyyyyy everyone else including me i cant wait for ur gt sport and other things thanks dude i love your carrer mode videos its so good and u so fast like how can u race on ulitmae mode its so hard maybe in s5 do some 100 distance races for special events tracks like monaco spa monza etc should have gone to racing point get rid of stroll one and for all imagine the year bein 2028 and ben plays this gamen again telling how bad it in comparement with 2028 why ben why not try mclaren with lando or carlos not a fanboy just passionate verstappen and weber are the toro rosso drivers in my career and theyre owning it man i couldnt wait for a career mode vid but four all together hype god i missed this outro ben shafted so much into this video it should be on brazzers news aaaaand in the end daly was promoted to red bull after an astonoshing podiumless season not bad for a championship winning driver ben cries in gastly plot twist verstappen is still at red bull it really sucks that ben wants to end something that basically started his channel please do carrer mode more often please that would be depressing if i would only have finished p4 in 4 seasons cries in hulkenberg i was hoping for the gasly earrape you didnt let me down red bull wanted max to win so bad they screwed weber so much especially singapore ben what is this outro song started the race with hard tyres havent seen career mode in a year ben that would be depressing if id only finished 4th in 4 seasons nico hulkenberg f2 please come back ok i wish you the best of luck every fan of career mode sees the title and realizes that ben was 5 race before abu dhabi and its impossibile to make a 5 races episode ben im gonna end this fan whole career i love your videos tiametmarduk the f1 2019 career mode videos that you made is what made me interested in code masters f1 games its been a great season to watch with toro rosso but i cant wait to see you and lucas racing together in the best car more f1 career mode i love it its so fun to watch i like that you put the 4 races in one video is this the end of career mode ben youve finally done career mode this decade 2943 hulkenberg is crying right now if ben doesnt team up with lukas im writing a complaint a few perfectly good videos crammed into one if you uploaded these seperatlyyou wouldnt have to complain that your so busy team up with lucas finally a new part of the career mode why is the end of the

mod can you beat hamilton thou go to every team and max them out then see who is the fastest first time ive heard of gaming on coke how is it possible that you have so much im gonna take a stab in the dark here and assume you have adhd can you do a 100 race with these cars would be interesting to see how many times you can lap others try the maxed out mclaren please skip to 930 for actual content you should be an announcer for f1 jesus this guy talks as quick as the f1 cars drive your commentary is wonderful vid actually starts at 932 how can you actually do this i thought the mclaren had the most potential this guy should be a commentator why whenever i see the phrase to max out the car i think about that car completely destroyed by verstappen how to fix it guys you can adjust down force level so how do upgrades to down force affect that if you run 6 for front and rear down force does 6 produce more down force with the upgrades that would mean more drag why not just crank the down force to the max right from the get go to get the same affect your should try mclaren why are you so good in playing f1 please make tutorial videos in order to guarantee that i got the best contracts early on as well as to both get some practice and observe the gradual improvements in my vehicle id actually race the races how do you get the 1000000 rnd points is it a mod or something max out the mclaren its pretty good too race start at 1000 timestamp how can we get all those r and d points aarava how do you get the 1 million rd points race starts at 1000 this is like watching the grass grow how you have 300ksubs is beyond me try mclaren team legit takes 10 min for the video to start 927 matt doing interviews aarava in 05x speed sounds very drunk lol basically the 2014 season i got pole in baku got simulated down to 20 never simulating again racing point is better maxed out how you get the 1000000 points how to you got 1 million r and d points idea max out every car and then do a full season skip to 1030 to see the race not bullshit to make video longer what is the name of the song played in the background at 820 racing point are 1021 in mine think the max differs from save to save could you take all the maxed out cars to a single track for a laptime comparison aarava howd you get the 1m rd points and now breathe can you do the 1 minute challenge with the mercs in austria try to max out the mclaren car next please why not include an austria lap only thing were bothered about so we can actually compare would love to see a maxed out mclaren against the top three teams 352 you added a clip of the redbull video hey does anyone know what the music playing in the background at the start is please help next time start with the f2 intro that way you can get better perks on the first f1 contract this is how the webers car improve during my career i think it would be cool to see what the max level for each team is give every team 1million rd whats the background music maxed out haas make austria under 60 seconds with this beast how to earn so much rd points you should do it for every team go to austria with hamilton and see if you can go under 60 seconds how can you get so many points cheat engine if you can explain will be cool do every team try the merc in austria and compare the times with the maxed out red bull test out how fast you can go at monza suprisingly the racing point is 1020 points 924 did that guy spit on the safety car do this with racing point im european so its really annoying for me to see mph instead of kmph do you actually see the aesthetics on the car change when you purchase aero upgrades i pretty much maxed out an alfa romeo on the aero side and couldnt tell im inseason 5 and all cars are maxed out you know whats nextlap under 1 minute in austria 400 um red bull all 3 top cars cap at the same rnd in the game which i believe is 1045 try beat the 1min lap time in austria 50 more hp and downforce i think the mclaren goes to 1020 the background song is vibesss hey aarava you should completely max out every teams rd tree and then do a race i think it be interesting imo please do it with everyone you should be in the guiness record books for talking in a 17 minute video without taking a breath racing point on my game gets up to 1020 i wonder if you could go flat through cops in that car ive had every car maxed and red bull is the fastest please do it with racing point you should put a v12 engine in the current f1 car wouldve liked to see qualify lap at australia then season 2 max out qualify lap australia being able to see the time difference is important do it wuth every car haha 2014 season in a nutshell the racing point goes to 1020 in my career can you do a max upgrades chart of all teams please or you could try what happens if you dont do anything about the rd reset and wait for everything to get reset could you try a season with all the cars maxed out for a better comparison on witch car is faster youll need to drive all of the maxed cars on the same track then youll se witch car is fastest on paper and around a certain track for instance spa or monza hes driving the 2016 merc germany 20 this week 357 why you are upgrading the red bull should do a whole career with a maxed out car with the drivers name being max dout racing point also has very high potential i love this mod sub 1 minute here we come i have 1022 on the top of the rd chart but racing point is the highest with i guess 1005 so i dont think the numbers on the top of the chart tell you what the maximum is racing point has the highest celling its got 1020 celling f1 2016 season colorized dont try to trick me i recognise f1 2016 when i see it can you pleas drive the car on the austrian gp austria under 60 seconds how do you do that with the 1000000 rd points 005 thats strange whatever team you choose its this same guy every time i start to suspect that this is all a con that not surprising its just the 2014 season with 2019 cars is it a mod ur using and if so could u link it 1 mil horsepower 1 mil drag game experiment idea give every single team 1 million rd points and see what happens mclaren now please u pulled from verstapen like ur in a sls amg and hes in a prius just max out every car believe it or not racing point has the best maxed out aero can you make a video where you tell us how you got your resource points now time for austria can you do it with mclaren too try it in austria 356 why are you in red bull imagine kvyat in that car is it better than a redbull it does peak out were the red bull does in performance why even bother aarava how did he install that mod i dont know if this can be possible but it would be really cool to see a race or even a dull season with all of the cars max out first sick video aarav keep up the good work love it when your on your phone and see a aarava video pop up you are an idiot you had it in the classic ha ha ha 913 seriously dont you love it how long it takes for this to work like actually he fakes crashes why dont you just buy a wheel instead of using keybores 628 i think ericsson hit us wait you play on mouse and keyboard i thought you played on a steering wheel dont play on keyboard 10 minute video 7 minutes overreacted come on 2 minutes replays 1 minute racing can you do survive malaysiansepang circuit plissss this video should be called survive albon why do you do this evey single episode you make of this you find out a way to take ur self out if you get passed the start 626 is a prime example the tesco of singapore is ntuc when he drove straight into a wall though lol learn some breaking broand turning arava you silly person why you do that you drive with keybord you are the lion of singapore can you be car number 63 in abudubi i mean you always make mistakes on purpose to stretch it on 10 minutes you crashed a 633 on purpose to get a 10 minute video max did this in 2017 survive rainbow road when you fail so hard that even your game crashes survive italy seriously aarav learn to do the starts you keep getting wheelspin and lose places youre overrevving it so bad a tip hold ur clutch til race start itll save u almost half a second it annoys me how bad he drives and just randomly accelerates when there is a car park in front of him would like to see survive austria i reckon that turns 1 and 3 could both be disasters you should survive monza cause the shacanes would be very hard the bane of aarav keyboard manuel survive australia that probably will be a pile up this is how many times he restarted the race making the video 10 min challenge 113 and 623 albon is new riccardo for 2019 survive cota possibly sector 1 would be insane glad to see that you still need anger management medication boots is happy try suzuka next might have some crazy crashes in the esses survive japan so much chaos through the ses show me camera setting 641 ericsson crashed in to u i think ericsson hit us 640 aarav jumping from 2017 singapore to 2018 germany survive suzuka the al can go side by side at the first tearn try survive spain survive austria backwards do australia next or spa backwards do the next time hungary for the survive series chinese gp turn 1 arav wheres road to glory oh you did this on purpose you know there is a magic trick called editing the controls that would make this much easier the last time you did america was ob your 2014 modded game you should do america next do a survive with the f2 cars at abu dhabi you sucks at driving you should do hungary i dont think youve done it before survive japan theres no way youre getting through those esses unharmed crashing into the wall to get the 10 mins video lol baku backwards heavy rain the tesco equivalent in singapore is fairprice xtra survive monaco with heavy rain while on dry tyres when will you stream on twice arava can you show camera settings germany heavy rain would be hell into turn 1 do this with facecam pls

australia i burst out laughing at 633 survive yas marina and then do another of this but backwards australia or hungary survive belgium in classic cars formula nascar combined with survive italy now its a party how about a singapore backwards did anyone notice how he spelt singapore singpore in the title i love how whenever aarava does survive he completely shoves people off then blames them what about turning the controller on and making it a season so that way you wanna be top in the points every race do a survive championship who thinks he should stay in cock pit camera do the japanese gp im being assaulted from behind why havent you done survive japan yet do spafrancorchamps reversr please do japan in rain can you do belgium backwards becuase you will probably fly at eau rouge he didnt change it to manual to get those 10 minutes austria in the rain turn 1 and 3 could be interesting do survive japan 634 pretty sure that was on purpose so that the video can be extended to 10 mins feels like the car is made of potato chips do survive with f2 cars please do survive italy new singpore track is nutsi wish you did it in singapore though aarava easy p10 but my video isnt 10 min yet wall how do u get the mod i like how 4min of this video is aarav screaming at albon for hitting him on the straight in the point but the video does not last 10 minutes 632 no heroics into sainte devote please do a survive brazil you have never done it before imagine the cars crashing into turn 1 and also sector 2 albon the torpedo 20 wow your video are so beautifull i recommend hungary that would be rage inducing but entertaining for us how about survive belgium how about survive brazil i think brazil would be quite interesting to attempt you should do germany too early comment hi

backwards aswell i really enjoy the backward ones 60th when i watching these videos i want to know what happenes if you go with full speed into a car aarava tired of sainte devote thats why he changed the challenge to singapore survive japan cuz u have never done japan on survive before australia turn 1 nuff said singapore backwards do a survive backwards at belgium eau rouge is so hard as sometimes the car feels like its floating due to the gs continue the nascar championship do survive spain backwards play roblox f1 games as a meme i want to see you make survive japan in first person lmfao what a fuckin coincidence i was watching your old survives then the notification came when u uploaded this the italian survive series survive japan b or germany backwards do survive with formula

took out russel in my game u said his name and his engine failed russians are here change mph to kph i remember this they couldnt survive the straights 300 i love the scream roses are red violets are blue valtteri its james let lewis through monaco backwards in the dark with no assists im going with others suggestion here face cam would be great in these survive videos also please consider doing spa lots of places for huge crashes there shock wave physics are the funniest this should be in the swetty palms subreddit i dunno about survive but please do a race in indiaplease do survive italy survive brazil backwards in multiplayer you should do this with f2 how about survive brasil how about survive belgium aarava is just purposely crashing out try survive insert track but in the f2 series i honestly think he could do this dead easy but crashes on simple occasions on purpose im so happy you are doing survive again magnussens had an issue love it how about to do it with f2 cars is it not they cykamarket instead of tesco trying to survive and playing on keyboard nonsense missed a perfect opportunity to be daniil kvyat smh theyve added f2 2019 why does this feel like your not trying just to make a long video you should have driven here with the torpedo what are the settings love everything you do dunno what else to say how about austin rear wing you should be able to lose ur front wing survive is actually the greatest series in the history of youtube 854 when aarav becomes janice from friends try survive in the rain survive singapore backwards please do survive every race weekend at the track there racing at 914 oh magnussen had an issue as magnussen is about to die survive in monza first turn carnage i bet you wont like my comment 1235 you even got a puncture from that broken front wing can u do a survive series on tracks that are not on the calender now like istanbul india korea nuburgring that screen freeze at 513 was so bad i thought my uni wifi was taking a dump on me i feel like the more he mods changes things on his game the more screen freezes he gets like if u agree so he can see and possibly fix it remember no heroics into sainte devote love the vids keep up the good work could you do a video on getting good starts at the beginning of a race please i like how he just crashes into the barriers at last i think the next survive game has gotta be in suzuka 630 lets say lenta auchan okey it depends on region but the three ive mentioned above could me a kind of tesco in moscow or petersburg i have nearly gotten into the video im only at the beginning for the talking then i notice oh i remember 2017 very well this will not be good i used to have tons of screen freezes but after i turned on vsync and set the thing to 2 i never get them anymore its hard to explain when you dont know the names of the settings hope you can figure out what i mean and i hope it works if you see this and try whats with all the freezing are you using shadowplay or something else to record your game do survive japan on the keyboard aarava pleas do this at monaco on f1 2000 where are the race podcasts congrats on getting on to the bbc i was watching it 755 i think ericsson hit us no heroics into turn 2 please can t remember the last time a new vid like this came out that puncture at 1235 tho aarava what did you run over at 1234 your wheel broke without hitting anything norris broke that very bollard that took part of your front wing off on the final attempt yet nothing happened to his car 1010 for codemasters ps i remember this video last year with a car on its side and everything please do spa with the car on minimum downforce u should do a whole race oh and magnussen has had an issue turn 3 must be absolute hell on the keyboard not even playing as the local hero aka daniil the torpedo kvyat 854 sounds like janice from friends every collision he has is ericssons fault 755 i think ericsson hit us 1233 look at the right front wheel cool that he had a puncture when driving over debris we want video with screen freez compilation survive singapore with the racing point and try to finish top 8 do backwards singapore with the torpedo i cant wait for survive vietnam and survive the netherlands maybe you need to make a clean reinstall of the game to get rid of screen freezes directly before he drove into thr wall at the end he run over some debri and got a puncture like bottas last year in baku 754 i think ericsson hit us when he said dont tell me it i was like ah shiz here we go again please try survive brazil araava please make more of these more often its so entertaining pleeeeeeeeeeease you take like 3weeks please for reasons that will uh soon be apparent haas banter aw sht here we go again why didnt you choose torpedo mix this w the nascar mod like so he can see try to survive the azerbaijan grond prock ok lets see if it compares to the madness of turn 1 in f1 2018 i now another thing that needs to be fixed for f1 2020 you need to be able to doublestack in a race when your teammate is for example 5sec in front of you with the current game you lose a lot of time if you do that for the next vid i think its starting to freeze due to the intense modding of the game because mine is all fine and i havent changed anything just a theory dont quote me on that survive is how i found aarava and i still love it after 2 years edit thanks for the likes susuka that will be so good kvyat crashed russians cyka blyat vettelfinally f1 drivers we r safe xd can you make a survive aserbaidschan pretty sure youve had the top 10 thing since f1 2014 god that was so long ago the mother of all survives returns omg so excited the danil kyvat simulator is looking good i was just searching for aarava challengesmods and then i saw that this video came out 5 minutes ago lol hi aarav i love your videos please give me a shoutout in your next video i would love it i couldnt wait for this to come out seeing what happened in the 2018 version aarav hey how you are so pro this is crazy someone got first by a 10th of a second well done p1 yes son no heroics into sande vote dkeodifjdifkfkdkd finally roses are red i am bad with names lewis is pitting valtteri its james not first first first am i first finally im qualifying about 1 2 seconds back of my teammate in a toro rosso and im pretty happy with that ive only been doing this for a year or two but the 110 ai is a really good challenge im wonderring if i upgrade the car before they do if i can win some races by the later seasons so it seems they are more well behaved on 110 i play with ai on 98 and the fuckas constantly rear end me and spin me out when im defending they are very aggressive in my opinion and their actions definitely differ from track to track i raced f1 2002 online for long years gonna restart with f1 2019 youve got a new subscriber im absolute fan of f1 and virtual f1 racing this is not how you drive a f1 simulation sorry im having huge troubles keeping in touch with ai on 110 in fact in australia with the perfect qualifier setup of the mercedes or ferrari cars i cant go below 123s and 110 ai in qualifiers is like 2 seconds faster than me no way i could go 2 seconds faster and i believe im not that slow im driving full realistic simulation mode with all aids disabled elite cockpit view g29 force wheel which settings you play on wish you could try full sim mode cockpit view so i figure out if im just that slow or theres something else to it love when you hit every corner keep doing what your doing the ai are being to aggresive for position they dont keep a good racing line 110 isnt that hard bc of that your ultimate ai must be different to mine 913 in the top right hand corner your fastest lap is a 1336 i just raced the same track and my ai is doing lap times of 1287 so after a 5 lap race you would be 25 seconds behind in last placehmmm great video what setup do you recommend i purchase to race on a serious level and not just casual racing i have the logitech setup g920 but i dont have the shifter yet thrust master allows for so many different adaptations like different steering wheels so i wonder if that would be better what do you recommend friend thanks a bunch race on should of used someone else cos u took away the fastest guy on the game what is a good difficulty setting for a relative newbie to an f1 game but a decent driving game player in general ok what i learned when the ai is trying to overtake you just ramming them from the street good tactic in my career i drive in a torro rosso in 115 and i get between place 7 and 12 often change to cockpit camera and you can go faster the reason why they seem easy to defend from is because youre racing like online you leave them absolutely nowhere to go they were going for moves and instead of leaving space like you should you just constantly pushed the ai off of the circuit hence no overtakes bruh my guy is diving and cuting the corners and wayy too agressive bruh u are blocking tf out of the ai no shit they cant pass u brothers ur driving a mercedes trl limitless you seem very selective with the challenges you except httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvthmmrfwhtoo how fast are you in cockpit with no proximinty arrows no visaul adis ie blank screen in f1 2019 against a full grid of ai full damage on strict rules youve been challened you need to get some sunshine why dont you use the 8th gear that is soooooooo frustrating well you are playing as lewis hamilton no one wants to pass him or theyll be given a 5 second penalty i really hope that the next gen games will be a big jump in terms of innovative gameplay and graphical fidelity perhaps a more appropriate showing of ai difficulty would be realized if you were driving a midfield car youre in hamiltons car you should be faster than the rest of the field have codemasters seriously not added in the new france pit entry you need to start switching to 8th gear about 12000rpm hi what steering wheel do you use im a rookie and f1 2019 will be my first racing game with a gaming steering wheel any recommendations from what ive got before release they said ai is the thing that gets worked on till the last day really hope they get patched too on day one this is just 2018 ai again the circuit in france is extremely boring and feels so forced even in the game hamilton didnt get penalty im joking it s great to see the wheel got the same amount of understeer that the controller got in f1 2018 will you be starting a setup series when the game fully releases which racing setup do you have so wich steering weel and playseat dude hits every car off track that barely shows up and talks about how they are on the same level as last year well stop using the todler cam and use the cockpit cam instead day 1 patch prediction change to the french gp pit entry must make engine higher because it doesnt sound right unless you do what trl limitless did change other little things your 7th gear must love you can u compare controller to wheel pls you drive like verstappen you go left and right on the straightvery sad seems like the ai is fast but not good 1100 rnd players car overtooken by a 300 rnd haas on straight that was the widest mercedes ever aggressively shuts the door on the ai the ai dont seem to be very aggressive hmm the understeer sounds promising like more of a sim than simcade so at lower speeds and when slowing down the front looses a lot of bite like it should at least the ai doesnt just drive into you like it does on ac lol the car speeds are still the 2018 speeds go on career and look at their performance levels compared to last gear identical day 1 patch will change hello thanks for video but why you dont play on cockpit view for more real good blocking the ai was just saving ers and fuel behind and wasnt required to push thats why they had lots of ers as far as i know they run auto manage ers correct me if im wrong i like it they even have done the shitty tyres limitless corner cutting hey jd i actually bought t3pas do you use the brake mod you damnnnnnnnn tou bro savage the joke about jo but yeah he always exceeds track limits 813 still the same trash ai lol they will slow down as usual instead of fighting for the racing line they havent changed anything damn hes frustratingly underaggressive attack man attack the ai to me look about as quick as last year hes running standard setup and not used to the game give it a couple of weeks all these youtubers and esports lads will be way quicker than 110 ai this still has the old pit entry and exit the amount of moving across when defending the line into a corner is a joke left then right should be 1 move not 2 and stop using noob cam you got a seat a wheel still use over helmet cam cant believe they allow that in league racing get in the cockpit view they are faster than top e sports drivers i wont stand a chance tr limiss is a good driver how is it possible to play this game yet anyone else really disappointed in a new game i expected a lot more they made the graphics a lot better and thats it you brake by slamming it into lower gears that would blow the engine up im sorry but this video must be at least half irrelevant the game hasnt came out properly yet there is definitely a day one patch which will both adjust ai and teams performances so lets not deduce too much only on this video video about setup will be interesting wthout ballast they didnt change the pit entrance of the french gp nerf gasly pls there fast but the ai are terrible at racing as usual how can codemasters keep getting it wrong the most annoying thing it keep repeating to me in f1 2018 carrer is that ai cars always pushes and bumps you at 300kph they just take you off the track i hope they will fix this in f1 2019 is annoying as fuck cant wait to get my hands on this game i love understeery cars i race at 85 with a pad you already know id be losing 5 secs a lap you usually played f1 2018 with kph now you are using mph will you revert it they seem to be quicker than you tbh they just dont force overtakes and you defended pretty harshly to stay ahead disappointing you can still bully them into giving up their line plenty of situations that would have been easy overtakes if they were human can you do a f2 race please would like to see you qulifying against the 110 ai ai cant quite catch me ai gain 2 sec in 2 sectors little tip for future league race videos if you could remove or move to the top left corner the donation box as it gets in the way of info like fastest lap trl limitless why dont you do a last to first challenge around all your strongest tracks or tracks you prefer and test the ai in every area great to see your videos coming quickly are you going to participate in any more league races this year cant wait for why 8th gear needs to be removed from f1 2019 its not the game that just have understeer its real life cars aswell for me the interesting thing would be how good the ai is in bahrain compared to austria in this game as they seemed extremely op in bahrain and really bad at austria last year they look hard enough as it is remember your in the best car on the grid they should have not been able to catch you so easily now if you was winning in a force india then theres an argument how fast are you in cockpit with no proximinty arrows in f1 2019 against a full grid of ai full damage on strict rules ferrari 1st and second just like the real life any info on wheter or not they are going to add the new pit entry for paul ricard good pace but when it comes to overtaking they strugglin again are you planning to do some setup guides for this game pretty op do you use any force feedback doesnt look like it nice video the game has been released the omgitsjoe stopper i think the main reason you didnt get to fight the ai properly is that you never left them any space you just forced them off track bottas and leclerc kept switching positions because you forced one off the track and then the other would overtake they need to change the pit entrance do a vid of pad v wheel pls from what it looked like to me the ai was actually better programmed at defending than attacking and generally looked better than in previous years when defending the ai doesnt leave the space anymore if you dive bomb them which was so exploitable in past titles if you dont catch up to them before the braking zone and just manage to put your nose in just before the apex a real driver would shut the door and probably still try to avoid a collision but either way its the following cars fault in that situation and the ai is expecting you to behave like a real driver or be taught by a collision if the game goes towards simulation then it should also expect you to drive against ai like a reasonable person or at least teach you that might also improve online racing a lot but in the attack the ai seemed to lack advanced tactics like doing a switchback or trying to squeeze through the inside line on the mistral straight for example and instead act really calculable on the they give up on overtaking soon as they are to close to you same as 2018a person would never do thati would hope on 110 they are more aggressive the ai dont seem too good stays in 5th the whole time i wonder when they will update to it entry and exit in the game since it recently got changed gotta love the omg its jo reference the ai looks really good they wont let you just crazy divebomb them like the years before harder to overtake for noobs like me now poggers also they seem to find some speed finally obv we have to see how they do when we run setups but i think overall they look really good the only little problem for me is it seems like they still have unlimited ers and they are even faster now thats going to be really frustrating when you try to play 100 races maybe but lets see about that 1340 you cant be mad i think its actually good that they close the door because you were absolutely nowhere just like vettel in 2018 suzuka on max verstappen stupid and unrealistic dive bomb no one would do this in real life i feel like the driver and car ai is based on winter testing performance you complain about understeer the game is a bit more understerry but your over rotating the car which will create extra understeer trllimitless even though youre making 23 and even 4 moves to defend theyre still not aggressive enough they still move out the way for a player how fast is 0 ai on f1 2019 the state of this circuit though makes my eyes bleed it is just awful 730 why does it say on the top right that your sector 3 wasnt a personal best when you were 12 seconds down afrer sector 2 and 9 tenths down on your personal best after sector 3 the sector system is broken the ai is fine if its stronger some youtubers wont be able to put legend ai on their titles and win races d the loading screens seem to be a lot faster is it just me or looking at these many f1 2019 vids popping up and surprising so few drivers use cockpit view im wondering if the feeling of under steer is because they removed the ballast also the pitlane needs changing i think they removed those useless reflects on the track niiiice shame to see the old pit entry is still there why no setup i think they are faster than me its too fast did a 100 race yesterday in france quali was dry and ai was 15 seconds faster but in rain they are slow af will you make a video on setups for every race speed to kph lmao the omg its joe reference at 315 haha is it the same driving with a controller in f1 2019 as was in f1 2018 somebody to answer me amazing game and amazing videos by you trl never clicked on a vid this fast is it a mustbuy game nice content thanks if youre wondering why ive apparently donated to myself at the top of the screen its just a test for streaming purposes i didnt donate anything d hi tiametmarduk i would like to try your wheel settings can you send the wheel settings for me to try thank you in advance why do the cornering response is slower im new to this game tho thx so much for this guide its helped me get a lot faster how do you do a lap without crashing bahrain is my best track and favourite to race on same one can help me i dont know how to change the setup in careet mode its in de mfd what if i dont know how to drive manual i play with a keyboard theres no way to be fast with a keyboard but dammit i try ill get the game today and with it im gonna get a joystick because i am really tired of playing f1 and not being able to extract all i can do although i do have some times in the top 500 just got a copy with a racing wheel this helped thx does this setup go for every track step 1 should be mod traction control so it actually works i legit spin everytime i try a dive bomb even without contact sorry in general i like your videos a lot but this one is a clear thumbs down when you title a video like that you should not spend more than 80 of the time on talking about a bahrain setup before using the last 90s to say cut corners and shift manually i definitely expected more this video is like a baby teaching me how to breath its all banter i love ben like a banana loves to split if i keep taking stuff with a pinch of salt im gonna get a kidney stone i just literally got this game today and i keep crashing at corners how is best to go round a corner i try to go slow into the corner but i find it hard to turn the car and inevitably end up crashing i tried to look for tutorials on how to take corners but cany find any and cannot find a practice grid in the game your upshifts physically hurt me really not helpful in the slightest one setup on one track with the fastest car and some vague info so generalized it might as well be useless youre a quick driver but youre bad at explaining why can someone help me with races i dont get why even beginner and very easy settings still makes ai go faster than you its so hard cuz u cant chase them down im not sure in ready to switch to manual gears yet i use manual in other racers but 8 gears is a lot just controlling the rpm with my feet is enough for me if i mapped gear changes i would lose my look leftright which is just a preference of mine pod why bother reeeeeeeeeee play cockpit mode is this or is there a there a setup thats a great all rounder for all maps kind of like a starting or foundation setup for beginners im new to f1 games so please excuse my ignorance any advice would be appreciated totally butchered bahrain lol step 1dont be an f1 noob dont drive in tcam with a controller with assists on only then can you start to become a good driver step 2practice practice practicethats it end of lessonnow make haste i know that manual gears is super beneficial but using it on gamepad is so damn hard im pretty comfortable driving fast but i always crash mostly when im trying to go around corners or while trying to overtake someone guys any chance to configure the car drive with the arrows left and right on the ps4 command instead with joystick would love to see an update to your thoughts on setups similar to the 2018 version how many here plays on xbox controler mercedes cars are so tight in this game man its unreal driving them feels leaps and bounds ahead of the competition if thats anything like in real like combined with hamilton explains a lot i know this is just for fun but i feel like they translated that performance discrepancy really well i have an issue with manual starts i release the clutch and i have to manually shift into 1st gear even though the clutch start should do this for me does anyone know how to fix this is the second video how to drive like a noob tcam edition realy stupic of codemasters that every corner cut is penalty realy frustading and not real pleace update codemasters im actually not that bad of a driver i got pretty quick on spa in a farrari gt car but f1 was just so different than what i was used to so ive been playing f1 for quite a while now and id say im pretty good especially since ive started using better custom setups which after using them im so much faster and i cant believe ive just started using them however i was wandering why on 2018 did you make the rear wing aero larger than the front wing aero by usually 2 numbers but on 2019 the front is larger than the rear also im aware this will change track to track any advice would be greatly appreciated so for someone that hasnt had a racing game in a long long time you think starting in everyone in manual would be the best i figure there would be tons of testing that way before say playing career mode or even going on line why dont you use the proper view and use the mirrors and read info on the steering wheel thhanks mannn for the videooo thank you well because the mercedes has to be made the best because mafia im more of a high down force guy what i dont understand is why we cant modify brake duct size for different tracks i cannot run without antilock on tracks like baku monaco or montreal with sections that are not much time between braking zones they heat up unrealistically fast if there was a way to change brake duct size for different tracks that would be great why he is shifting like an idiot and triying to teach people something d i mean its coming from ben so number 1 advice corner cut cut corners httpsyoutuberwsmpaaqzba sorry f1 2019 but the real sound is here interesting video can you also please go into the strategy of fuel mix and ers etc this title is just false call it what it is i didnt click on this video for a bahrain setup i was in a second hand games shop and i saw grid autosport on the ps3 so i bought it and i thought its a really good game lots of f1 tracks some in reverse like sepang and some of the dirtiest ai cars ever why cant they put an arcade mode on the f1 games as well as simulation its a bit linear can we play a 2 player mode if anyone genuinely wants to know how to be the best driver they can be set the best times theyre capable of for a start dont listen to any video created by someone who doesnt go into detail about setting up the whole car anyone who says they leave the suspension the same for all races or doesnt consider this as important as every other possible adjustment isnt worth wasting your time with if youre serious about improving your ability to not only drive but to drive to your absolute best you have to be serious about tuning and that takes time patience and unlike demonstrated here being methodical organised and intelligent with the process the only advice i see worthwhile here which should have been stated at the beginning and thats to turn off all driver assists and aids ultimately you can tune a virtual car to fit your exact style of racing to be consistent and reliable and not need that stuff turn off all the hud screen crap too none of that is hey ive got some guy in my radio saying his name is james and is asking me to slow down coming from f1 2018 ive changed the abs setting in the brakes to have it so the brakes lock up and im really struggling to cope with the change any tips should traction control be off this game is so hard can you do set ups which will work in career mode for beginners please do a tutorial on getting away from the lights fast after 40 laps the best i could do was 1312 is it because i was using renault i thought in time trail all cars r equal i need you to talk about the hud at bottom right of screen how do i turn that on and use it choose the merc put all assists on and make the ai rubbish what are youre setting gor youre steering wheel the force feedback and al i use a controllerpad on ps4 and i cant drive using manual gears i find it difficult to change gears going in and out of corners whilst tryna concentrate on racing lines managing fuel mixers etc my brain cant handle it again with codemasters they have made this game best for steering wheels controller of the overhead its crap can you put your vids on bitchute pleasei hate youtube first rule cockpit camera is the only acceptable camera tv pod players should have their nipples burned with hot wax i dont need to be faster i need the game ps i probably need more then this guide cuz im slow af can we have a hot lap and setup of every track it will be nice this helps me so much ok but how do you keep the car going in a straight line is this a general setup to use or just baraihan please do videos on f1 mobile racing too how many gamers use a wheel 1 settings tutorial for keyboard users when ben doing your setup with the pad dosnt work at all for me cant take any fast handers flat and i dont have turnin at all how to be faster in keyboard please really nice vid cheers why are the tyres still half shiny after one lap in real they are not like that half a lap and it is gone what rotation setting for degrees do you use great advice ben not sure if i agree with using the outside kerbs though since they seem more brutal than 2018 its not out yet yeah but the thing is ferrari was faster in bahrain charles leclerc took pole and almost won came 3rd due to engine issues so thanks for the upload mate just cut the corner why is abs off faster than abs on look at those shiny tyres ben the rd from the cars are the same as next year getting really excited jeez tom97hddid you sleep on the track to be or to being fast so your guide for being fast was a setup that you didnt explain and you didnt show in its entirety and then some old racing line tips at the end of the video all on one track which you didnt explain how to go about a lap around really poor quality content i expected a structured video explaining differences in f1 18 to 19 at least a brief summary of the setup what the setup is chassis tuning aero tuning what the numbers mean 60 brake bias to the front for example and showing symptoms of poor setup you did this when you ramped the aero up and down and explained how the low aero car was fast in the straight shocker and poor in corner entry and exit shocker i didnt understand why you kept exclaiming your surprised about this and then finish the episode on rigorous and proven racing line tips and tricks and demonstrations not just use all the track brake late this was not a beginners guide to being fast setup is not the beginning of being fast prop the way the tyres have those accidental characteristics lol will the camber be more noticeable and whats the difference without ballast these days the tires look like some sort of shiny asscrack how to be fast in f1 2019 step one wait for the game to release you lucky bugger real drivers dont sit above the halo looking down why do sim drivers please do this for all tracks please i need help lol so are they going to patch the performance like merc would be 1 and ferrari 2 wow last years setup video had actual information lazy and not useful step 1 straight line every corner who gives a fuck about track limits step 2 absolutely punterino your opponents into the wall step 3 youre ready for public lobbies jeez that shiny tire bothers me a great deal more than it should tyres arent this shiny i play with a controller and i still smash it it should show if you play with steering wheel or controller because it make a massive difference for control of the car another tcam pussy beginners guide hahaha thats ironic considering you took a drive in rss f hybrid in ac which proves you aint a clever driver when driving in a sim with real car physics so in reality youre a beginner ha no ballast wut i just want to be faster then the other people online but you have to teach them why bevor you shift down break and wait a little bit and then shift down dont drive in tv cam you noobs its the first assist you should turn off mercedes sound is terrible in this game whatever you tell us ban we will try to run the lowest downforce setup on every track just to be as fast as in the 2018 game what is up ben this a good guide great work im still waiting for trl limitless to get my preferred setups most of his work for me but not all can someone tell me why there are there lines on the tyres there isnt anything like that in f1 2018 and cant see them in real life not break bias change the differential thatll kinda lunch your car forward after breaking the more percentage your wheels kinda be locked a lil after releasing your break can play with the worst setup for a video ben playing the game before its released i am the greatest botanist on this planet youtuber championship still looks way too floaty drifty and just weird on exit if someone is in front of u just move them with a bump and run opponent has a run on u just block leader trying to lap u just race defensive to keep them back bahrain corner 1 braking point is later than last year a setup guide series would be nice i dont know how to use manual in terms of when to shift and what not any tips im on pad btw and havent used manual can someone tell me how these youtubers get access to the game before it is released great can you make your 2018 and 19 setups available on steam workshop please better get whole career in rokit williams f1 team if you are that good 639 wtf is with those tires 00 you better score more than one point in barhain if you figure out the set up step 1 turn on abs and any other assist how does manual work on a controller look its f1 2018 the new lighting in bahrain in 2019 looks absolutely gorgeous makes it look like the game runs in the unity or unreal engine jesus that mercedes is hot where is the controller no assists fam at hey ben im a big fan of f1 and watching f1 content like yours but im pretty much a complete novice when it comes to the games would love a video on basic tips for how to be fast like the stuff you were talking about at the end even basics like knowing what gears to go through corners in judging braking distances and how to race well against the ai i know youre a busy man but a video on tips like that would be very helpful cheers the tyres look nothing like the real shit dont get that groove ben thanks for the video mate even though i know that you use a wheel i just wanted to ask if you could make a video about running no abs on a pad ive been playing f1 games since 2017 and i feel like thats been the thing thats been holding me back the most i cant seem to know how to trail brake on a pad thanks again mate hey ben can you do a tutorial on how to get enough money to buy a pc that can run this game thanks step one stop playing on controler buy a stering wheel xd sry for my english yeah that suspension is not the one no front toe another great upload awesome job ben can you do a setup guide explaining what each one does and how we could adjust each slider to make it affective for the individual that stuttery intro man how do we know how fast were gonna be when the average folks dont see the game for another week performance from the cars are still not like in rl and the season is already underway for 3 months now bad job nr1 the tire textures are looking horrible and this ring in the middle of the tiresdamnit codemasters they are pure slicks bad job nr2 and even ough im not a mercedes fanbut the engine sounds bad and i would say kinda like the real vacuum cleaner we had in f1 2014 bad job nr3 codemasters really have some serious work to do thats why i didnt preorder the game so sad ben theres a ghost chasing u run 744 can you make a video on how to shift efficiently i find it really tough to play in manual gears as i just end up blowing my gearbox i am kind of ok with other assists set to off but manual shifting grinds my gears p sounds like death to pad racers ive been waiting for this since f1 2010 nice that they included the red mercedes logo on the car in tribute to niki lauda please can you do video about short shifting when to usein f1 2019 im useless at setting cars up its the reason i cant get into f1 massive respect to codys for putting the red mercedes logo on the engine cover of the merc the guy that got cock slapped in his career mode wants to give people tips on how to be fast just joking ben love you looking forward to episode 3 4 vids in one day dayyyuummm ben going crazy i love it isnt it always the fastest to put brake pressure on 100 and use the antilock assist doesnt the game that way brake as hard as possible without locking the brakes or in other words always brake perfectly in terms of brake pressure or am i missing something i might believe that the game in some way rewards you for turning the assist off because i notice a lot that when i put an assist off my times dont drop and after a few laps they improve which is weird because i have to multitask more than i did with the assist on rip gearbox while downshifting do higher diff values make the car faster in the 2019 game you have the best f1 vids in the world tiametmarduk do your flag lights work on your wheel in this game why does bahrein look so foggy yes your world record will last for maybe 23 days maximum before it is demolished really cant wait to get my hands on this gonna try beat my personal best on australia step 1 dont choose williams step 2 choose mercedes step 3 wait for 5 second rival time penalty mercedes does actually have the red star for niki lauda on the engine cover and the sign as well wow codies is there a replay mode outside of the actual race now day one update should get ferrari a better engine and worse aerodynamic i hope it will can you watch replays after online races ben doesnt know how to be fast so 457 shoutout to toms 145 laptime i play all games manual apart from f1 on a pad with mfd and shifting its just too much need a wheel why did you use more frontwing than rearwing mate can you do a good 50 race setup for each track yes pleas more setups i wont have steam workshop because i gonna play on ps4 so yes pls mooooooooooore setups ben sounds on the cars are actually very nice ngl how to win a race use corner cutting and push the ai of track like ben does showing you how not to drive in f1 2019 can you make a video on how to have a good start on a race or how to decrease wheel spin at the start dont cut every 2nd corner if you wanna win your f2 championship a beginners guid to being fast by ben daly thats like a tutorial on how not to kill someone by oj simpson ben when he went to codemasters avoid the curbs at all costs they are dangerous ben two weeks later use the entire kerb some tips on starting to use manual gears have a lot of struggles with manual gears while racing how to make you faster 1 drive a mercedes 2 watch

over again f1 2019 a beginners guide to cornercutting wait i just realized that that full camber is visible in the tire wear o it niggles me that the tyre graphics show half the tyre shiny like its fresh from the mold excited for this build still feels a bit like a dlc big booty thumbnail does this game have force feedback thats always something i struggle with in finding what im comfortable with what ffb do you use if any same game as f1 2018 step 1 use wheel or atleast pad more setups are nice to have ben tiametmarduk is this video for aarav dont listen to him he is corner cutter is this now playable its not ben daly its ben daily d can i use time trail setup for racing another one i most likely wont buy f1 2019 because i bougt f1 2018 on boxing day 2018 and i havent played it

is on fire appreciate and love all the content that youre doing man im biting at the bit for this game to come out here in the us ok its too much to handle in 1 day what is the best approach to manual gears on the pad i feel like i cant do everything from accelerating and braking to control the fuel and ers i dont have enough fingers help please well done but ferrari halo looks off and merc looks kinda cheap in t cam if im honest 4 vids in a day is there no ballast is this why youre running a higher front this year where last year was a higher rear wing three f1 videos in one day you really are treating us ben 1st step calibrate the brakes do more setups plz i had a lot of problems with freeze lags and stutters in f1 2018 any tips to solve it or is it gone in f1 2019 i have a computer

any of their strategic blunders as usual where are rhe name tags its mod o god leclerc pole i dont feel so well about it how have you done this is f1 2019 updated or uhhhh that looks awfully like gaslys helmet pooooooleeeeeee position for leclerc if albon doesnt work out for rb they should get you in that seat next to max in 2020 is this albon a mod or an update do ocon at melbourne because hes going to renault i hope hamilton has an engine failure looking at what happened to kubica and prez if leclerc doenst win the race tomorrowhe is the new alesi is it belgium or belgiun i still dont know to this day charles to get first pole 1201 pause it right there that is not albons number you liar this is pierre gasly last to edit keep pausing and resuming and youll see number 10 weregonnamakeamassivedivetothe inside yes this is the moment weve all been waiting for ferrari 12 feels good to be a ferrari fan hope they get away from the mercs at the start itself the pole lap was 3s faster than what the game expected leclerc vettel raikkonen mercedes engine will explode in hambot and russell cars verstappen puncture in first corner retire i dont want to get my hopes up yet for ferrari we all know what happened last time they had a front row lockout who else knew hes using max si he can jinx him and albon wins the grand prix 14 th qualified so sort of similar is this a mod charles on pole my prediction is that vettel will win and a big crash is going to happen on turn 1 and grosjean is going to be involved is it a mod ferrari 12 yessss forza ferrari hopefully tomorrow will be the day when charles will get his first win finally a 12 for ferrari god dammit you did this with gasly ferrari was awesome in q1 q2 and q3 amazing lap by leclerc hope he wins the dwc one day ferrari front row lockout i thought i was the first person to watch this video 1158 aarav celebrating in the garage make this blue if you love aarava v where r the name tags i predict leclerc hamilton vettel verstappen bottas albon and so on what i thought ferrari is super quick predictions for poduim lec vet ver get in there lewis wait a second come on charles what a weekend for now lets go grab the win who wouldve guessed it actually happened in real life all the memes with ferrari on pole are now useless leclerc pole i am a vettel fan but a front row lockout aint so bad i swear to god the real f1 is scripted based on these videos do a last to at bahrain short 5 laps what are your predictions for the race its very unfortunate that we cant change the names they updated the roster or is

temperatures its also the only thing you can change after quali ferrari or red bull pla ferrari or red bull you should go to cheaty raging point i think we should stay at mclaren the best video was the one where he flew past one of the ferraris in the straight go ferrari next season nick i am wondering what wheel do you use for your gameplay my name is nick as well nice race btw go hass and become batman go to williams what racing wheel do you use stick with mclaren to the end too see how big of a difference there will be between the you and the other teams why dont you join williams i mean they are good but with the advantage of mclaren it would be tough to really win as well as it would spice the whole thing up because youve transferred to the biggest rival which difficulty are you driving on move williams if you can go with the red bullnot the torro rosso one go with williams go to red bull i think you should join mercedes or mclearn you should move to williams you should join a better team nick someone ban me from your server i think just for the giggles go to torro rosso stay at mclaren go to sauber or haas you should try ferrari or mercedesbenz go with torro rosso

new and you have a fast car from the start you sound really sick at the moment i say go to the mercs hi nick congrats go to redbull next season does anyone know what assists he uses u should switch to

red bull every qualifying short straight to the line scuderia ferrari is the way to go sign a contract with haas very coooooooool vids and funny i think you should go with haas or toro rosso ps i was sweating the entire time while i was watching this video congrats maybe haas nick as you still would be in contention for race wins you should go with the williams stay as a mclaren racer i think you should go to alfa romeo team go racing point they have the fastest max upgraded car maybe y should join an ugly team like ur face or join charles leclers team he won the gp nick dont fast forward qualifying because then the ai will set some really fast laps so just wait out qualifying stay with mclaren sets 2 red sectors nick my race pace is amazing go redbull next season please nick i would love to see you in a redbull ferrari or mercedes for the upcoming season nick you wanna play some forza with me sometime my gamer tag is mrdinosaur317 join williams get mercedes or a redbull i would recommend a 2d racing line go with a honda team and try to build them up what do you mean by f1 2019 career mode its now called f1 2020 career mode join the mercedes amg petronas stick mclaren i think haas is a good option or renault maybe ferrari red bullferrari mercedes 900 nice car never seen it before im dead yo team up with hamilton on mercedes amg petronas love that little mclaren move with hamilton i think haas would be interesting they seems fast thats a team you havent driven for either anyone realize that he looks like sherlock holmes you should switch so you should have a different teammate go with racing point for the next season nice job nick love your f1 2019 videos keep it up in my opinion you should go to haas or ferrari anyway your choice cant want for season 3 nick u should go to ferrari renault though there cool join redbull according to performance points the racing point is the fastest car so maybe switching to them would be good and you would be back in the midpack and building the team up starting the decade with a win season 3 move to red bull stay with mclaren when everyone else is considered a backmarker to andrew i say its time for a new rivalry among team mates no racing point force india nick you battled with with vettle in the mclaren and to be honest you struggled but now its time to take on hamilton at mercedes that is if he is still there i dont remember lol be with haas move to williams join ferrari you have never driven for them as far as i know 250 a normal webcaaaaaaaam maybe you should go to the williams boys go to scam energy racing go to haas or mercedes go to an other team nick the fucking race track is in abu dahbi its a fucking desert i beg you to join red bullplsplsplsplsplsplspls i want u to stick with the

stick with mclaren of course you should go to ferrari go to red bull plz 610 i dont know what it is about this circuit but our tires are getting so hot how about the fact that its an f1 car in the middle of the desert you should definatelly go alongside kimi in williams go for mercedes next season guys we have to make him stay at mclaren haas are looking good for next season and you have never driven with haas in a career mode before y do u sound like raymond in 50 of the vid please go with mercedes and have hamilton as your teammate go for the merc stay with mclaren please nick you should swich to ferrari traction control intensifies its in nick if you have a ferrari or mercedes contract take either so long as its for second driver then beat their first driver makes the game feel more rewarding can you go to red bull nick can you shave your hair go to racing point they have the best upgrade ability if the 2019 season went down exactly like it did in this series i think it would have been one of the best f1 seasons in history go to ferrari they are the dream contract you have raced for all of the midtier teams red bull f1 2017 renault f1 2018 racing point f1 2018 and mclaren currently if you were on ferrari you could probably even max out your car you could beat vettel every single race if you can win with mclaren youll be micheal shuemacher at ferrari go to red bull nick they have the fastest car when maxed out i did science also bring back the forza science vids go with williams go to ferrari they are the dream contract you have raced for all of the midtier teams red bull f1 2017 renault f1 2018 racing point f1 2018 and mclaren currently if you were on ferrari you could probably even max out your car you could beat vettel every single race when f1 2019 is too old cuz its 2020 now switch to mercedes leave them i think you should go with a scam energy you should go with ferrari for 2020 you havent driven for them yet you could also go for haas sauber or merc if

want some more teammate on teammate action that was a smoooooth operator i think you should go away from mclaren maybe go to a mid pack team so you can have closer battles go join a midfield team go to red bull if you were to switch i would switch to williams or haas the last time u played was a year ago stay with them for one more season keep on top of upgrades claim another championship hopefully and then start thinking about branching out to other teams you can have more fun with mclaren dont let it end prematurely you should move to ferrari edit nice vid nick yo neet to try to get

belgium your rpm are is way to hige for a good start video goes quiet and out of the blue sainz lmao i feel ur doing on purpose to die everytime what is this joke the amount of cow memes haha why do you always purposely run into the pile of cars just go around even go off the track but dont purposely run into them its just frustrating to watch why do you just crush into them its make no sense next year for the f1 season you should do it like a championship where you count points for the drivers and do a season with it i think you should do the survive series on motogp19 this is how many restarts you did aarav runs into a parked car also aarav what are you doing normally its really easyyoure just bad im hanging in here like a cow last to first as botas what a mental guy 510 at least u went without getting hit by ericsson every time i see a survive video appear i know a lot of amusement is coming absolutely love this series instead of top 10 try finishing in the top 50 of finishers so if 10 people finish you have to get 5th if hed have driven as anyone but nico id have flipped hehe tables i watch the video while skippin every 10sek cause you look too much to your replay 1246 aarava he completely shunted into my car you saidlance whybut it was carlos sainz i felt his pain in my soul smoooooth operatoooor this guy is crashing on purpose to lengthen the video how are you doing it when you are recording career you can turn off this mod or you should make a survive season im hanging here like a cow mclaren sauber who even thought about it his blood pressure ocon of the day sainz 646 albon got his revenge on hamilton from brazil i think it is hamilton play more real racing 3 using steering wheel and manual acceleration and brakes would a grand prix in dubai be boring we definitely need a facecam for this what a lovely video it would be really cool if the extreme damage mod is in career like on 5 lap races anyone notice that abu dabi is the 21st race of the season and it has 21 turns a piece of information on bottas they have a serious car issue looks like they retiring whats long and dangerous a torpedo he could literally go around them so many times when a survive video is 17 minutes long you know this is gonna be good maybe not for aatavs health but anyways thats the dumbest driving i have ever seen mclaren sauber just like the old survive series we need facecams for this videos pls like so that aarava can see nobody arrava what is this voodoo magic 1402 hanging here like a cow you should do a extremesimulation hybrid carrier mode he had so many opportunities to avoid the crashes he didnt take feels forced to showcase alot of attempts 1402 gasly im hanging here like a cow 408 its called a stoppie my stomach hurts ohhh theres many crashings true knowledge of stupidity can only be gained by watching aaravas survive series i loved some of the crashes on this one and its good to see the broken physics back in action again gets hit from behind and his front wing breaks off i kinda look for that in this series tbh you had a puncture in survive spain 2018 the video where i said max verstappens season was a joke it was at that point but he turned it around fair play 1306 warning headphone users attempts 23 some information on bottas they have a serious car issue it looks like theyre retiringjeff 619 ya naw shit sherlock imagine this series but with all the damage that we wish for in the game ideas videos floor diffuser rear wing side pod endplates so many more things that can break please do a face cam with this legit only 1 of the crashes wasnt your fault hmm 2 ferraris dnf in brazil now two red bulls good as it is nearby survive bahrein im hanging here like a cow honestly you should just do survive every race weekend in real life so you do survive on the same track as what is happening in real life i hope that makes sense if you want you could do a pole lap challenge that you try to beat the real pole laps of this season aarav 2019 e tu pierre e tu aarav legend fans gentlemen a short view back to the past literally everyone goes back to 2018 abu dhabi survive episode heads up its at 550 of that video xd we need to see your face in this type of videos can u possibly do survive america plz 542 because he has no front wing 1630 aarava sounds like a 4 year year old who had just got an iphone 3 i remember last year how the ai crashed in a straight line aarava can you do a survive austin backwards challenge love your videos mate nohomo a anti wheelie is actually called a stoppie gasly and sainz vs arav survive f2 imagine if this was in reverse the last time i remember you having a puncture from debris was survive spain 2018 aarav about to start survive abu dabhi on the grid engineer no heroics into sainte devote please pls webcam aaraava 3rd attempt and ive already gotten an airborne car hulkenburg laughs hold my cow no heroics into sainte devote its fcking chasing me in my head 508 or 510 could have easily taken the right side exit like for aarav to do survive monaco but looking backwards carlos is only crashing you put in the hopes the camera man put him on tv the next track is monza when i saw this i thought it was last years survive episode i didnt know that aarav had a pet owl 746 i am sure that he is having a seazure in that contact with stroll does anyone eles get the impression bottas like it up the ars can you do the survive backwards challenge a bit more too please would have appreciated headphone users warning at 1304 when you watch a video of aarava no heroics into sainte devote please you can change the keyboard button mapping to make it easier on yourself but love this series jakdk if anyone can figure this out i will give you my jordan 1 off white chicago nico will be hanging like a cow for real this time waiting for an f1 seat press f to pay cows to nico mmm yes i get to enjoy 17 minutes of screaming aarava its like nico from last year but worse last episode of abu dhabi i laughed so much that i literally end in the hospital last years seemed a lot harder keep it up good work its sad that hulkenberg probably wont have a seat for 2020 a podium would be a great sendoff for an experienced f1 veteran like him basically the episodes of survive f12019 are a transition for aarava from man to women why do i watch videos of a grown man screaming sainz sainz sainz rare clips of an exciting abu dhabi gp even though it abu dhabi no heroics into san de vote this about 69x more interesting than the abu dhabi track actually is survive the raging camels bruh lets make bruh the comment with the most likes yes another vid fourth first before it goes viral hi early crowd first so in a total of 52 hrs from monday to friday of recording 46 clips and editing my 2019 brazilian gp recreation is now out i hope you are all enjoy it because imo it is my best recreation i have done yet hope you are all doing well they yused drs in turn 1 yeah yeah the right podium yeah you dont bleep bockmist 1010 hahahahah well i want to listens the team radio of leclerc hahahaha vettel was crazy with the overtake of leclerc safety car in f1 2019 impossible kkkkk nice job man it is truly unbelievable amazing work does the suspension failure happen in the game i love how kubica almost rammed ricciardo but ricciardo got the penalty 2019 gasly screaming on the radio a short view back to the past 1991 how did you recreate the entire qualifying the amount of effort needed to recreate something like this on the game is insane mad respect perfect sainz in podium like it should have been in the brazilian gp this is genuinely perfect great job nice to see sainz on the actual podium as well jeez i do follow some recreations on yt but this was by far the hardest ive ever seen anyone do and the most complete congrats i will certainly be following the next one by the way justice for sainz this is awesome very nice touch with carlos on the podium at the end this is great btw will there be a german gp recreation did he put the extreme damage mod on for the ferrari accident i dont need a fom nice job good video korrekt nachgestaltet einfach nur man sieht in dem video deutlich wie erst leclerc rechts in seb rein zieht und danach seb in leclerc rein fhrt und genauso war es auch das ganze mal fr die die kein deutsch knnen the whole time for those who can not speak german english correctly reshaping just you can clearly see in the video how leclerc moves into seb on the right and then seb drives in leclerc and thats exactly how it was 1356 1400 thats correct first leclerc pushed seb than seb hits leclerc 5050 massive respect to you cannot be any better perfect very good video it was unfogettable race how is it possible genius perfect magnificient for a moment i actually almost forgot that it wasnt the real race highlights great work man i dont see any sense of doing recreations like this rly where are you download the mission winnow livery this is how codemasters have to make games more realistic more sensation in crotfy the postrace radios celebrations into car i dont know why they dont put this little details like croftys voice at the lights more reactions at crashes not that black screen bruh bad the dasboard at the halo what an amazing video and edition well done mate it was a great work it looks like youve taken real clips and put on the games graphics very good job how this is one of the best things i have ever seen mega job imagine having commentary this realistic actually in the game when gasly is in the podium with toro rosso gasly makes the team radio earrape shouting because of happy one misstake ive noticed is hamilton overtakes albon instead of verstappen in ur vid but well done anyway its instand edit the commentary was just false xd better than the original race highlights how did you reproduce amazing 106 bruhh leclerc was slower than hlkenberg and kubica how do you custom make the

career with mclaren hamilton crashes aarava almost hits hamiltons car i got f1 2019 they literally had random failures for the player in f1 2009 yeah totally agree with that random failures thing idk

bobs your uncle mean youre cursed then sort out ya blooming durability first here when was posted 23 seconds ago first first viewer of the day first second and third first first gasly and albon switched their seats the top three was correct max has some kind of reverse jinx or something else that we dont know about whal your settings of cmera predicts the podium omg hamilton verstappen and vettel just like in the real race podium predicted once again is the same podium lol the top 3 is the same like the real race anyone have any tips im trying to play without anti lock brakes and im struggling its actually the real end of the race 1 lewis 2 max 3 sebastian crazy the podium was the same how did he guess the position shocked pikachu face that was the finishing order as well can you overtake without hitting cars just asking shouldve done the last to challenge on bottas he ended up last after a couple of laps the exact top 3 predicted the podium how tf had he predicted the exact podium you got the top three right lol he predicted the podium are you using assists difficult level 0 aarava you are an absolute master class with the podium the top 3 is the same to the real race aarava working his sunday podium crystal ball great vid keep it up man 1st hamilton 2nd verstappen 3rd vettel where is motorsport manager aarava please do some when you predict the podium for the race well you got the podium bang on you predicted the race correctly top three at least this game or you a fortune teller because the podium is the same in the game and in real wow the game predicted the top 3 today vettel in germany no time set verstappen in hungary pole both 2nd this means vettel has outscored everyone except max in the past 2 races he predicted the real life top three top 3 exactly the same as in the race how did you know he would get 2nd he jinxed the pit stop time you got it perfectly on point xdd you jinx the positions of hamilton and verstappen this last to challenge is aaravs prediction of maxs place in main race predicted the podium hes a wizard harry the exactly pole from the race omg aaravs done it again 1 ham 2 ver 3 seb at the end of the season bottas might be sacked max p1 hamilton p2 leclerc p3 are you playing whit streering whel max is on pole bottas verstappen leclerc is my top 3 lets hope this is the result tomorrow sainz is faster than you try revving below the cap during the startit might help you to start faster now you did the exact opposite prediction verstappen leclerc and bottas max is on pole position great choice my top 3 1 lewis hamilton 2 max verstappen 3 valterri bottas last to you mean first to race prediction verstappen 1st hamilton 2nd leclerc 3rd whatching it while im getting f1 2019 downloaded i think verstappen will get a good start and lead but hamilton will jump him in the pits i was watching it live at the circuit and o boy what was it nerve wrecking as a dutchie bold prediction pierre gasly doesnt score points 1 leclerc 2 verstappen 3 hamilton race prediction first to challenge this will be the irl podium sensational lap by verstappen scenes heir to hamiltons throne surely this series makes no sence you need to drive the car who is last not who is first aarava youre completely lucky boy what a choice again these need to be 50 races please plz make a career video again its the bests videos ever on yt like if you mean the same make a career video plz people talking about max being impervious for aaravs curse now hes just gonna bottle his start again and then go on to win max pole not 20th if max spins in the race can you show camera settings for this video please my prediction is max 2nd and bottas will take the p1 max will do pole to first challenge tomorrow the ferraris are gonna bin it on the start aarav is a wizard surely max might be quite handy at this hungarian grand prix on pole if someone can calculate hoe many words he says per minutte i will give you 100 dollar verstappen bottles the start then he wins given his recent starts it may still happen all that happend is i was playing f1 2019 then this poped up on my phone when i was on my pc then i was lik lets watch it i love f1 now you will jinx max to finish last can you please do this with norris would love to see him on pole last to challenge works on vettel but not verstappen should be a 1 to aarav why now his engine is gonna blow up last to challenge with max verstappen while hes on pole max getting his first pole ever then aarava does the last to first challenge like aarava you choosing the right drivers for this challenge you better not jinx this guess hell have another bad start then opposite of jinx interesting your choices for who to play are on point every race seems like the aarava curse doesnt work on max this time haha once again aarav haha this time the reverse jinx wow so many people devoted to being first the reverse jinx who is here after he got pole predicted max pole what a quali yeah get in there max great prediction mate brilliant pole from max today first first why is he called the engineer my son got f1 when will you continue career move to mclaren next season do you want some rd points i have 11k why can you get knocked out of qualifying youll still be in the race im a bit new to f1 whats your favourite gp i once finished a race in p7 good and clean race no issues no penalties i somehow managed to get to p19 lol gg codies your putting to much steering lock on you car thats why the understeer in qualifying and thats why your tyres overheat start your fault how embarrassing like for the helmet off white never see that move to mclaren or renault what are your camera settings not to bad what steering wheel do you drive you had a very good car you shouldnt have attacked the renault at the start of the race you would have finished on the podium i think it was your fault for pushing too hard on attacking vestappen keep going love the videos we need road to glory cmon aarav we need to get this man to 1m subs he deserves it jesus that was so staged wheres f1 2001 your driving style is beautiful is it just me or is there an echo can u put subtitles in your videos v some people are watching this and they dont speak english where is road to glory series at the point of you crashing i would be straight at the restart button lol if lewis didnt have all these mechanical issues he would be in the championship fight with you and gasly spoilers in the title as well noice im starting to see a theme in these titles i didnt know f1 2019 was a horror game until i saw that overtake on vettel that was scary close my favorite youtuber great video as always gasly in red bull about to win a world championship this is too spooky even for a game what console u on why was it raining in the menu its said overcast and then sun did you restart probably i think i should move teams for season 5 cos of all your reliability problems youve had all seaon what are the camera settings the start was your fault sergio its james aarava im sorry for being late to your videos i watch you every day man youve ruined hamilton season by not doing asingle upgrade on reliability next season make alpha romeo great again wow that was close 858 get in there lewis i want road to glory that start collision reminded me of singapore 2017 stop spoiling the episode always here love the content please stop the spoilers in the title can we get a william road to glory tho why are you not upgrading reliability youre acting surprised hamilton is having all these issues but its obvious why mclaren havnt upgraded the hole season haha your accutually the best please reply like just realized mclaren havent upgraded in the whole season road to glory please ive not had a regution change since season 2 im now in season 7 is anyone else having problems with regulation changes when toto wolff turns out to be from new zealand thats bad luck first first sympathisch

this is what he is i need this helmet another thing i would like to see in f1 2020 is different race schedule im tired of doing the same races in a row every year do you play with force feedback active how about pro players for a man that talks about weber constantly i do wish he would pronounce the name properly its not wayber man 400 hamilton p4 hes p5 whats your fov settings motorsports manager game idea try doing the race strategy program it will get you better strategies 2427 subscribe for weekly fortnite content these series are the best keep it up many times not really a real titel happy to see hulk on the podium an off white helmet you absolute hype beast who still has f1 2013 love all the vids you deserve more subs what is your camera settings how do you just floor it out of 3rd gear great video brake bias mentioned game shows renault coincidence i think not the car its for fighting championships but that fight with those cars lose you a lot of time english cook sucker hamilton squeezing people hmm nothing new hulk on the podium two renault engine cars on the podium did you not see the glich anthony davidson brake bias screen shows renault dd the title made me laugh xd btw an idea for an ideas vid overweightunderweight characters can result in dsq you have choices to do fitness but have a counter choice that will do good as well extra resource points and also maybe you could try to put an illegal part on with a chance of being faster new video at last these videos are grest finally career mode video the wait is over its squishy time sounds like something hamilton would do in a real race lol why is verstappen at renault great video aarav if you do a new video for ideas for the next game of codemasters my idea is that over seasons the race weekends chance hope you like this idea posted 54 seconds ago btw arav i love your content and i wish the best for your future these are so good aarava you do a good job of making this humorous and not bland first kubica with an f1 car it really is a shame that the team that ruled f1 in the early to mid 90s is a punchline these days ai ghosting wtf just play time attack then should see how much slower the williams is at 100 ai cough cough wha what whenever i race monaco i have to use 0 in quali cuz im useless at the hairpin so the ai on real racing 3 is this eleven then i thought i was good imagine seeing a williams overtake a mercedes you realize this is the first williams since 1997 stooooopod cheapskate claire williams needs to get off her fat ass and spend some to build a winner kubica is champion still faster than williams i am crying right now because im from poland anyone know the music that starts at 315 the way he finished had me dead why you look like driving faster than the williams 048 matt is that you you should do 0 ai but you can only overtake in one sector the whole race he wouldnt be able to raise the trophy like that with his left arm you shouldve done it as hamilton and see how many laps down p2 would be hey bro what is this song at 327 still kubica scored more than russell to answer the title i was gonna say still faster than a williams but then i realized williams was faster somebody needs to put 0 ai to restore f1s fallen giants mclaren williams etc who needs 0 when you drive for williams edit ohhh everyone else was on 0 hahaha you shouldve at least disabled ghosting and enabled simulation damage try the high downforce setup but you have to drive your front wing off vs 0 ai i did the same in a hass and approached backmarkers by lap 4 i am a hard core williams fan and they will win a race at least by 2021 get the mercedes and do a 15 race with 0 ai and drive in austria this is the level i play at as im shite oh thats why williams is so slow its missing the front wing it all makes sence now not really a challenge 0 ai still faster than rl williams and c on a monaco track title how slow is 0 ai in f1 2019 puts williams car in the thumbnail still quicker than monza q3 this is the dream of williams 1 want to make fun of the 0 ai 2 crash in the barrier 13 seconds after the start at 202 moral of the story try without frontwing nice battle 20 ai vs 0 ai that how kubica will drive when he have good car do the same thing with red bull while doing 2 pit stops better known as the 2019 monza q3 ai level how can kubica win a gp in 2019 kubica is actually 1st this is how the race is for mercedes look like till lecler i got about 24 seconds ahead of p2 by the end of the chinese gp in f1 2018 on 80 difficulty so i stopped right in front of the finish and did some donuts before crossing the line lmao edit i was in a redbull as well so i wasnt even in the fastest car on the grid 0 ai and they still get better traction on the start quite telling that the williams doesnt have a front wing in the thumbnail right driver on right position i bet senna felt like he was in zero percent ai mode all the time whats the background songs would it erm be possible for kubica to hold the trophy like that still faster than williams in real life theres a win for kubica slams into the barrier me theres a crash for kubica williams comes back 226 magnussen is ghosting because he drank too much rich energy and now his car is high 808 thats how williams win they need to put the front wing in the garbage next challenge can your mum beat 0 ai so happy to see kubica on the 1st place even here can you beat 50 ai at monza without a front wing as you can see kubica is the best 226 what is going on with magnussen who remembers when williams used to get top 6 and podiums copping from foxydude98 he did this way before u ben 320 ben says he never saw an overtake at that chicane f1 2017 career mode ben am i a joke to you well that explains why the williams is so slow theres no front wing on the car in the thumbnail kubica wins 2008 bmw ok 2010 renault sorry 2019 williams wtf bro try and win the race in a mercedes but you have to take two stops could you do the 0 ai challenge using all 5 tire compounds like you did in the past i really loved that meh seems like cheating pitting for the last lap because you had 25 laps of clear air the harder challenge is to stop on lap 1 or 2 like aeterno did may as well not pitted at all if you pit at the end of lap 4 great video i wish you can do this again but in canada like kubicas win will the game change gasly and albon mate i literally made and posted a very similar video concept on the same day i compared 0 ai to 110 on the same track o see the time difference and see hoe codemasters slow down the ai for low settings reality is not freaking calibrated 325 ive never seen a pass through the swimming pool chicane and ive never seen a green flag pass anywhere outside the pits ever at monaco why is there music playing in the background goon has hit a new level of stupid kubica has won only one race before this ben the type of guy who has worse starts than 0 ai what an excellent win for williams said no one ever league racing interesting challenge very easy ben can u upload the wtf1 karting u did if you vlogged give rk88 a good car and he will even beat ben in this challenge in real life next time can we beat 0 ai without a calibrated brake pedal do the all tyre compounds challenge but this time do it in the rain how about a pit stop every lap challenge a 6 year old cant i think you should do this again with a 1 on the front wing for the added challenge the 110 ai is no joke the 0 ai is a yoke a yoke to answer your question on 904 yes that would be me my wife cant beat 0 ai she asks me before how to put the indicators on to turn a corner in an f1 game you should try a 0 ai challenge but in the first corner you break off your front wing and see how you do without a front wing it would be interesting to see how much not having a front wing can really affect you 224 what the hell we already know what next video is you changed to ferrari for season 3 lol 225 ricciardo seems to be actually sucking magnussens balls hes had some tough times me has his pet died or what was tough with his pc and f1 2019 oh ben your so good that even when your on 110 difficulty it looks like your on 0 destroyed the front wing so fia cant notice the cheating design whats the name of the song at the start of the video why dont you drive the tracks backwards great video and yeah aeterno veloce does some fantastic content hopefully hell be able to solve his pc issues and make a proper return this looks like the difficulty aarava plays on you shouldve qualified and pitten every lap eg try to build a pitstop gap per lap you should drive with one hand on f1 2019 0 ai still sucked at take off love you 3 why do the cars look so plasticky i mean the halo looks like a toy not real life like at all interesting challenge there although i think the 0 ai are slightly faster than 2018s maybe in the future you could try this challenge at other circuits if possible crashing into every single car that youre overtaking i guess the challenge would be more interesting if u had to do only clean overtakes and not just pushing everybody out of your way ben are you active on ps4 or xbox only f1 career mode please benjamin daly lol the lance stroll in f1 2019 is finally realistic that wanker is nothing but a mobile chicane with a rich father maybe you can do full wets on dry track vs 20 ai wow gasly was p6 they really made this years game very realistic at least gasly was fired whats your thoughts on gasly being dropped for albon 048 matt wouldnt be able to keep it that cool being around danny ric you can tell this is a video game because driver of the day would go to max irl thats all folks hahaha got here faster than pierre gaslys fastest lap do a 0 ai race with a broken front wing challenge 5 laps what a wuss i was expecting 2 but as lewis instead any chance of seeing this u should try driving with one hand like kubica and make a video out of it d do a challenge with your mum driving 0 ai around spa in williams with damage with 0 ai maybe ben can finally not bottle the launch he still did149 albon is going to be faster than gasly what about a full length race 0 ai but you have to pit every 3 laps gasley in 6th place thats unrealistic what is the music called it was kubica if he had the same car as george how about medium ai vs you without a front wing i thought you would do a schumacher at silverstone ben when do you start league racing again you should try it again with a red front wing to make it more interesting you know the starts are still bad on this game when ben gets pulled by 0 ai massive helicopter glitch at 325 now try to damage your front wing and win a race without a pitstop ai on 0 ben still struggles with the start dear ben i have another idea for a 0 ai challenge but it needs to be a season maybe you feel it coming but try a season with 0 ai and then try to be champion as soon as possible no handicaps just if it is possible try to be champion as soon as possible career mode pls not this bs no front wings vs 0ai how did you able to pit with softs again i thought it was mandated to use two different tyre every race say 0 ai and show a williams well time to use albon at red bull oh wait thanks for the publicity ben do the challengein heavy rain next time not sure about williams winning the race anytime soon but if kubica will finally have f1 car not this garbage where even mirrors are not want to be a part of this vehicle its more likely i was hoping youd do the thumbnail and try to beat 0 ai with no front wing lol that was almost fail in the line xd 910 my sister was 14th with 0ai at monza a remake of hungarian gp hamilton and verstappen against ferraris happy eid to everyone when williams take their sandbags off will f1 2019 have a update bcus albon is red bull for rest of season or no next time when u do a similar challenge u should still be p20 after the first lap ben to make up for the weak ai code in the first lap 0 ai challenge but only can use 1st till 6th gear williams 1st place f1 2019 is not calibrated this is where gasly is at home 0 ai 0 ai is basically scott plz bring back youtuber championship do a 100 race against 0 ai and see how many times you can lap them best with short curcuits mexico brasil austria 740 its like you retire the session for a destroyed wheel just before crossing the finish line you should race the 0 ai with no front wing actually nobody comments about the video its all about gasly and albon its faster than me thats for sure have you heard about the albongasly swap its insane ah the ar12 difficulty i think there as slow as gasly ah shit 720p too late done gasly dirty wait if you manage to crash out just after you cross the line how will the car look like in parc ferme kubicas right hand looks glitched man note chill out its a joke i have respect for the man red bull is gonna destroy albon williams speed in 0 ist like 80 lul it would be good if you could do a back to front race at monaco last starts pole and first starts last i click faster than pitstop ricciardo at monaco tbh nice video ben your videos are beautiful in every aspect by the way can you tell me the name of the song at the start of the video thx mate the ers usage is painful challenge for you ben make an ai flip at spa its been coming for a while this one what an excellent win for williams williams would be absolutely shitting themselves if they actually won a race whats the point you already play at 20 ai how about mercedes car wet tyresdry track say monza 0 ai wing settings 911 me wait thats a car not a plane i wonder if you could beat a maxed out car with 0ai robert kubica and his williams going faster than theyll ever go in real life here after the f1 red bull driver change news ben why do increase the suspense soo much to answer the title question yes title question how slow is 0 ai on f1 2019 how slow is 0 ai on f1 2019 yes do it without ghosting if kubica wins in monaco in a williams i think the engineer would be a lot happier than jeff d hello f1 community fun video nice work who thought he was going to say i know that pretty much at this point everyone knows about gasly 325 did anyone else see the fast af helicopter already answered thishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqno9n7a2ye4 you know its gonna be slow when the thumbnail implies theyre slower than a williams without the front wing just pisses me off to see you cruise the the streets of monaco effortlessly and still be two seconds better than my best time even with 0 ai it doesnt prevent me from hitting the barriers 0 ai and the ai still get a better start lmao tiametmarduk take the slowest team in season 3 and play it on 110 hard even the qualifies that would be interesting heald up one of the toro rossos you meant gasly werent you why not u do this same challenge but on a keyboardsimulation damage and idk maybe on wet tyres this is kubica if he had a mercedes seat thank you for answering the title to the question beni was dying to know bring back f1 under 60 seconds you should have done it with wet tires try doing the challenge with a broken front wing career mode please i bet you would be faster with a mercedes using every assist use the extreme damage mod on 0 ai what happens if you crash just before the line final lap so the wheel has come off but you cross the line in bens career the last one i saw the team name say ferrari ps ben love the vids do a reverse lap with damage simulation again please world talking about gasly and albon ben fk it see this challenge ben my bell stopped ringing so i put my sister stand near my computer and refresh until a new video comes lol 332 he thought he was already driving the toro rosso do it for race stars too ben heheh legend keep it up hope you got donation in last final race you streamed loving the channel as always f1 bo albon goes to redbull and finish kubica style albion is going to red bull love your vids albon moving and gasly moving was a surprise like if u think so ben is the best f1 albon to red bull ben how fast is 0 ai about as fast as it takes for redbull to put albon in for gasly just a friendly reminder that ben even bottled the suspense on the career mode episode and spoiler incoming he chose ferrari wait williams isnt last thats not right nobody 99 of comments still faster than gasly i hope they dont forget to connect the drink in your new ferrari in career mode spoiler alert its the slowest ai notificationsquad 200 views opinion about gasly to toro rosso and albon to rb ah ben is back with another challenge type video williams is a 1 of mercedes power car still faster than gasly ben what do you think about albon to red bull probably faster than pierre gasly earrape alert still faster than williams dark side just because we cant avoid expensive ass pcs and racing wheels now that you have a ps4 you need

the town to 10 miles i had jaques villeneuve autographe in a practice session he is a former champions i dont know what he is up to but im sure he have fun he just 42 after all canada is where legends achieve their maiden wins hell yes brother i fist pumped for you haha no drs for a few laps max verstappen is out of the session aarava im not sure were verstappen is when the game races are better then the real life ones gg thats some mad racing that final lap thats real f1 i dunno about you if i was playing straight rewind for me but arava holy st you recovered from that like a master absolute masterclass of a drive i slamed my table like toto when aarav almost bottled it great job love the videos commentary and mental explosions please keep up the great work thank you begin this series until you win championship do never ever scare me like this again on a end race how did you get new balance sponsor on the car wait so he kept his cool on the last lap ey farrari screwed leclerc over by putting him on the hards on the last stint in s3 i got vettel as my teammate awesome race mate nice to see only on aaravas car there are sparks if this is reallife then it will be alfa romeos 1st race win since 1951 aarava not using ers again to make it look close in the end my heart was racing the whole of the last lap and i wasnt even driving undeserved win bumping and barging ham all through the race last lap gave me a freakin heart attack you nearly did a vettel therehahaa can you make list or upload of your car setup for every circuit thanks before grate race congrats on ur first win 1405 rewind around 25 sec to find out where verstappen is xd get in there i wouldve probably made a dogs dinner of that final overtake in the chicane well done on a similar note i had a friend go to the canadian gp this year and he really enjoyed himself there and even got to do some laps on the sim rigs they had there think his best time was somewhere in the 113s but again he had a blast he seems to have a custom camera angle could you maybe show your car set ups for each track at the start the car has had quite a lot of pace for a couple of races aarav get in there aarav questioncan you be teammates with butler or weber are you ever going to invest in some reliability your first lap time is literally my qualifying time at the canadian gp i have some work to do dambrosio style last grasp victory there thats why your their esports captain started 2nd number of stops 2 224 44r4v4 strikes again what the hell happend with hamilton at the starting lol edit what the hell was happening with hamilton for the entire race 1704 that was on purpose how does giovenazzi still have a seat how congratulations on your first win and a fastest lap to boot so predictable you was gonna do that anyone eles hate it when hes miles ahead of his teammate or just me ahhhh a classic aarav get in there actually bottas didnt try undercut he just had an issue i would watch ur new videos before i go to school and u made my day f1 is the best alfa romeo and aarava on steroids in this season how do you get such a good start and always good traction off corners because i never can why is it showing 2nd in baku in the development chart i think it was 3rd who remembers the similar first win that happened last year with haas in season 2 episods were longer and more exciting while you were fighting in midfield yooo can anthony davidson stop being negative like come on that was buzzing who still plays with a keyboard change team bruv 1142 you pushed hamilton on the grass that was the reason that he turns to the left i knew it would come together you and this team go together like tea and biscuits im just so glad you stuck with alfa i think you wouldve regretted it if you didnt great vid as always great drive mate finally that so well deserved p1 lets goooo as some spaniard would say now we can fight just out of curiousity what are your fastest laps in france question to everyone had a horrible day you winning this first race of many made my day that little bit better thanks i have at season 2 lukas weber at alfa romeo winning the championship at usa hamilton was playing bumper cars today was he not congrats on the win and im loving f1 being from the us i dont know much about it but i love watching your vidskeep up the good work and cheers as you would say you showed realy good pace and congrats for that someone will be celebrating on crescent street tonight what are your camera settings yay 1st win congratulations aarava on your first win on the f1 2019 game you deserved that i expect many more wins in the future would you mind the incidents after the race in the race director what a race entertaining as hell wow what a race i love canada thats my favorite circuit who the heck put a thumbs down and what are they on awesome videos aarava a masterpiece of a race very nice race bots cant defend themselves codmasters cant you fix this we can fight now you need to upgrade chassis me and my mate met you in budapest last night mate in szimpla it was sick to meet you keep up the good work mate your smashing it like if aarava should move to mclaren for a challenge lap 5 3s just fighting ham 24th and i love your vids if those willams cars get to the top of the performance chart i will go insane spoilers congrats on p1 aarav awsome mate i wanna see a win by hockenheim 14th comment 62nd like 430th view and i clicked as soon as i got the notification please stop spoiling the race in the title can you do monaco backwardsin heavy rainon dry tyresand of course on a keyboard you need to get your engine to optimal rpm for your 5 red light starts seriously youre over revving your engine by a quite big margin and it is why you get bad starts and wheel spins more often then good starts seriously look at the bottom right the ui literally tells you to reach optimal rpm 4th baby another why the alfa has got the new balance sponsor first that was really jarno opmeer he is a really good one for real the reason people on pc are better is because people on console generally use a controller whereas more people on pc generally use a wheel youre copping aarav return to ps4 when 232 the f2004 has traction control you cannot turn it of singapore is harder to survive than you think i have a blast on this track but i cant for the life of me win at monaco 155 i see you are a man of culture as well could u make the cars all have crazy amounts of slipstream so the cars r like nascars and race in like monza 310 its james may ladies and gentlemen no one gonna talk about the f1 2016 music 337 that the worst race suithelm combo ive ever seen lmao surely this is the hardest game mode off all online games whats wrong with you with true honesty you ran into evo but great vid 439 he just came back on the circuit like an idoit it toke time but you finally got a podium 508 i like how no one noticed the vettel reference or talked about

is it just me or does kvyat look good in an alfa great video my favorite is number 6 220 wtf was that move what i do is on practice i do it but only 1 or 2 laps and then speed up time i know we are talking about the fastest car racing stuff and all but i dont think talking so fast will make you drive faster calm down i always have ers and fuel mix at rich and hotlap on straights but in the corners i have it in lean and none it actually really works ive started my career maxing out all or the resource reduction upgrades figured it would save me a tonne in the future is it accurate to assume that my career i drive a red bull and the engine is maxed out while my chassis is crap wowww i did not know you could sim the practice programmes thanks man this is awesome can someone help me out i have a visual problem with my game its almost like some parts of the car are ghosting out of the car itself almost like double vision and idk how to fix it when u say sim do you mean speed up time or siming to the end i have bin playing f1 game sens 2010 and there is somethings that i didnt notice thanks arav you the best what a fantastic video 241 the mechanic actually dabs lolllll my goodness please dont talk so fast breathe im new on f1 games so i am wondering how you can simulate the practice programs anyone can help im just interested to know how you have your logo on the helmets and red bull car 103 to avoid the pointless waffling i had like a 1783 sec pitstop with red bull i was shocked lol nice this helps a lot a casual player like me thanks what happens with your twitch chanel no heroics into sainte devote please 230 be like that move tho hey mate are are are you ok because you are startering a a a bit using a ton of rich mix overheats and destroys your engine way faster lol in my last contract negotiation i was so hell bent on getting level three everything that i but quali and race expectations at 11 is aarav cumming in his pants at this game i did 8 seasons in 2018 and never got that qualifying glitch i wouldnt believe it existed if i hadnt seen it on youtube so much number 7 doesnt affect me because i always set my quali laps at the end of the session you cant really run in rich the whole time because your engine will overheat after 23 laps 850 no no i dont think i will this will be my third f1 game i think the durability is most important because a engine powerfull is not a engine powerfull if the engine broke every weekend spit it out sim time glitches arent on ps4 from what i have donefound might just be a pc thing pitstop speed is the most unrealisic thing why should the team not try to do its best on its own this vid helped ima noob aarava you ok there bud 016 adapt is that you what about optional length of your career and being fired number 7 8 it so sad codemasters is not able to fix these problems i race with red bull and my car has a slower engine but im always top 10 in speed trap this actually are problems that codemasters cant get fixed point 3 engine power ers drag the rest doesnt matter 516 kind of true but keep in mind rich mix overheats your engine quick and when it reaches above 125 degrees c it starts to wear out quicker and it loses performence good video thx i will be implementing these tricks into my f1 2019 career aarav really having difficulties with his words lol how to get likes put 017 in your comment you can still simulate the qualifying just dont simulate the last 3 minutes when they do their last hot lap 456 for the 3rd time is this suppose to be a blooper video horrible sense of english language honestly lay off the drugs and alcohol 9 definitely no heroics at sainte devote does your rd points carry over when you move to a new team was this video not edited or something ok give me a code for the game and i will do all these 018 get in there arrava 020 the stutter 1 get fired from red bull i want the weigh bridge added in 5personally i only simulate the practice sesions when the car is maxed out cuz there is no point on doing that i only make the track acclimatization race and qualy simulation to warm up for the qualy and race 8 only on rain sesions cuz u know they are like god tier when the track is wet 434 oooh so thats why i catch them on the last laps or on the second half of the race so basically they are bad at managing the fuel and ers to have a more consistent race pace me a f1 since the 2009 f1 wii game sees a casual video uploaded by aarava watching it because i am social and i like this guy even he got a strange laugh first thing i wanted to do when i got the game get rid of jeff this surely helped me oh wow im early for once first my favourite notification first x first i wonder if aarava puts an intro and outro thatll be cool look at leclerc at the podium seeing this after brazilian episode wow i cant beleive how this looks a detuned version of 2015 ouch the tracks are sad reminds me of gtr game from 2012 kimi kimi loves this track 113 races lets hope for luck for kimi wet track slicksdry tyres therainmaster1 joins the race michael schumacher wants to know your locations why my tires never smoke while breaking so basically you used this glitch for securing the championship instead of being fair and restarting the race 1754 what was that weber best thing is aaravs on the pitwall at the end of the race play the video at x2 speed awesome race mate nice to see you being congratulated by franz on the pit wall for your awesome strategy calls too aarava after 1 full sesion i get finaly a saftycar but it was very strange becauce there was no crach of somthinge like that was very strange going to texas soon lets go maybe you have to start in wet tyres and you win a lot of places merc worst team on rd 4 row quali this is america but its on wet f1 track i hate that my right trigger stops working luckiest school ever i literally had the exact same situation yesterday haas still doesnt have points the outplays very subtle no spoilers from the title totally i had a whole race like this in season two round 1 how to manage ers btw i have calculated that leclerc now an average position of 38 needs to win the championship and if he scores anything lower then 9th he isnt able to win anymore also if you want to win the cron at brazil the onley thing you need to do is to make sure he is only able to win two points more then you because 292 27 and you win me who played some f1 2016 for nostalgia what do you mean softs those are supersofts 1815 turns out aarava can be in 2 places at once aarav is the race engineer and mechanics for himself even in the game that perez tap on you was very similar to vettel and verstappen contact in china last year this happened to me but quite the opposite its was rarely raining and people had wets or inters drop a like if you are form usa watching aarava so we aint going to talk about how the description says driving for red bull honda no aight fine by me can you maybe show us your camera settings find your right just can not get it with me greetings from germany btw can you do experiment like v12v10v8 in red bull this is gonna be hella interesting does he constantly have a blocked nose i just restart the session this happened to me at baku i thought i was slick rick qualifying q2 on mediums only to realize we had to start on the slicks shades of 2007 european grand prix about time the f1 by codemasters are broke heres why im playing f1 its wet weather everyone on slicks wth wet track dry tires senna wants your location i had the same at cota on my career i found the inters much better once id pitted on to them but then again i am woeful at the game what is the next team for the carrere good performance aarav do nfs heat walkthrough please when you learn tyre management mm game yess 1 im playing f1 2019 right now third dry tyres wet track this is big brain time im actually playing f1 2019 now ffs get rid of the fucking crowed screaming its a noise and doesnt sound real and its overpowering everything else set your ai difficulty level so that you consistently finish p3p6 with red bull if you are winning alot with red bull its too easy if youre finishing p6p10 with red bull its too difficult good luck i need to addim sorry but its kind of you youtubers faults that the games are the sameas you guys say things like cant wait to see what they do next yearguys they need to hold off and work on the game for at least 23 yearsnot bring it out evey yearand this one was less than a yearits a friken joke wow the negitivies are massive game breakers for me 1 inconsitant ai timing 2 cant beet ai from start 3 no safty carwow i stoped theresame problems evey yearglad i dident get itthanks how about adding all the cars from the past 9 games and doing a whole decade of career mode optional they already did the car models in those respective games theyd have to port them into the nice new updated engine but i think itd work and would make more sense for career mode instead of just repeating the same years again and again id quite like a cool down lap and maybe take a leaf out of fifas books with loads of different celebrities if you make the podium also team orders is a big one what i did not like is that you can just choose every single team when going to f1 even the f2 champion wouldnt be able to do that and same with a new contract negotiation it is just random and all teams will be pleased anyway no matter your performance kinda close to that also that the driver transfers seem random and no f2 drivers make promotions also retirements are almost non existent storyline could indeed have been longer stopped right with the f2 part perhaps they just tried it out a bit but that was sad i agree that the length of it was ok perhaps starting in f2 to earn f1 spot in future would also be a nice option penalty for collisions are odd like almost all warnings go to you as a player even if the ai just rams you gives you a pit no penalty applied and you get the warning i get so annoyed when doing a good race and then bam from the back someone gives me a pit and i just go off and the ai gets nothing and just drives on also kinda weird that no p i honestly hope codemasters let to be the only one to make f1 game for the next generation we are stuck in one developer idea graphics design enough they should add really classic cars as well im talking about the stuff driven by fangio and tracks as well when you complete a race you should be able to drive the cooldown lap rather than have a cutscene we have the same request of f1 2019 yay the 2012 theme hyping everything up beyond comprehension whats your pc specs its better now than two months ago i dont really like the randomness of the career mode i mean like you cant expect vettel to leave and come back to red bull like 3 times or torro rosso or alfa to be become on of the best team for a whole season there should be something like a maximum potential or probability in terms of building a new car and session development for every team im not saying that williams cannot build a great car but their session development shouldnt be as good as for example ferrari mercedes or redbull or it might be as good but only for a short period bring indianapolis as a classic track and be able to run any car love the f1 2011 soundtrack 9 out of 10 with some many negatives codemasters will never improve there game with recommendations like that really enjoyed your review because you pointed out the so many bad and also many good things about the game never worth 9 out of 10 though in a million years its a 7 at absolute best but ultimately a 6 out of 10 from me seems like youve got some type of issue with codemasters in all honestly if thats how you feel dont play any more ive had far less game issues and cant help but think youve not got a huge interest in the game also do classic versions of current 2019 tracks like they do in project cars 2 with the classic le mans circuit another major problem with f1 2019 is that even in time trial and have the fastest time or having a 100 upgraded mercedes your always not only a few seconds slower then last years game but is also around 7 to 10 seconds slower then in real life who else is irritated by this i remember playing f1 97 on ps1 and i had to win the last 4 races to be champion i won 2 and 3 laps from the end of race 3 i was way out in front when my engine blew i was guttedbut it also felt 100 genuine and organic it created a bittersweet moment that real racing throws up all the time this is what the modern games are missing that and any sense of actually being in a championship with real human beings why doesnt hamilton approach me after we collide and have a go at me how come vettel doesnt come up to me and wish me luck when i join ferrari this is the official game of f1 for fuck sake are you telling me they cant get hamilton to record a few lines it would add such an authentic atmosphere to have those drivers interact with you both positively and negatively how interesting would it be to be on the grid premonaco and have jackie stewart walk up say hello and walk off its these little touches these little things that build a worl community livery editor for the helmets and race suits like on gran tourism sport be nice nothings off limits optimized for pc hell no it gets worse and worse each year frame pacing is terrible a lot of freezes even in dx12 its like you have to boot up the game and do a couple of laps to get a playable stable framerate in my case at least it sucks to wait for a couple of weeks for a patch after launch to get a respectable performance also f1 2018 2017 are far better performance wise i wish when drivers transfer to different teams the design of their helmet stays the same but at least the sponsors switch according to the team like it doesnt make sense for vettel to have a ferrari helmet at red bull something else i noticed is that when ricciardo joined me in alfa his championship points remained as they were in renault so i hope thats changed is f1 worth buying for the ps4 if im using a controller they should add e formula or do some type of start from the bottom and work yourself up to a f1 license and build up a rival that is more random everytime i play lewis hamilton dnf its like game is like nope we only can have one lewis on the track goodbye hamilton bu is it just me or is emma a chastising btch u should watch intothebarrior there are missing many league options and leagues crash when no one attends a single race ngl favourite f1 game 2017 by a country mile last two not really enjoyed as much why is it spscore racing pointits like why isnt sportpesa see one see them all whats point having classic cars without classic tracks buying this game sunday for ps4 hope its better than f1 2018 which is amazing game have they nerfed ai in wets yet or not car museum was greate i think so in short too many balance issues not weird since this game is released within a year after the previous f1 game earning money is always more important than delivering quality anyone who says this is a good game safety cars no balanced ai no longevity no yeah lets put teamorders in for 1 race lets make f2 for not even 3 full races senna v prost was the biggest joke i ever saw the lack of testing u mean they didnt test cause how can u go from 25sec to 25 sec 2018 was better they just went back to shit sound files of 2017 and downgraded a bunch of textures fuck this game i pay every day and i can play ranked with my friend it can suck my balls how about they remove that stupid scripted pitlane crap on ranked if someone does not brake into turn 1 at the start ghost them please i end up losing safety rating because other people hit me or park at an blind apex etc so frustrating i would have bought this game if it wasnt for the f1 car sounds f2 sounds are great but i cant stand the sound of any of the f1 cars if the sounds were better i would buy it other than that great game so i have a ryzen 5 3600x gigiabyte geforce rtx 2080 msi mpg x570 gaming edge wifi mobo and windows 10 the entire rig including the os is less than two months old and the game will still not run in dx12 not run it wont even start can anyone help with some suggestions please the os fully up todate clean install on brand new hardware drivers all up todate on a clean install that will happen gearbox were an engine blowups to the player when come the version for the vr that would be very nice d i would like when its contact time for a popup of this team is interested in you so if your in an academy with f2 being introduced and say hass that if your performing well maybe ferrari could offer you a better contract more real life im sure ai need to be a bit more aggressive mid battle and when squeezing like a last lap battle the ai are too passive i agree with everything i would hate to move away from classic cars the old f1 cars are really cool the ability to have realistic cars in online leagues would be nice or bring back how 2018 online championships with friends was 500 its fun to see than you use the 2011 game intro best f1 song ever i think they should add tracks like nurburgring or istanbul and then throughout the career mode there can be a few small changes in the calendar wich edition do you use please giveaway f1 2019 pleaseeeeeee i have just got this game is it possible to be competitive with ai on 105 on the controller or do you need the whole steering wheel set up when is the career mode new season vettel goes to red bull with a ferrari helmet lmao i have so much safety car in career 140 vettel having the ferrari icon on his helmet at red bull in my opinion codemasters are too obsessed with invitational events and challenges let us do an actual full season of f2 in career mode and then progress to f1 and let us do the actual 1990 season to a certain degrees depending on what is possible rather than having even more pointless challenges better late than never mate hey ben i was wondering if you were getting this glitch where you make your setup and then going into the race it becomes random i went from 3 5 wings to 2 2 wings and had a crap race hopefully you can help me out and youre happy with the same dull practice programme grind i definitely want more random engine failure but you have to turn that option on and more levels of assist cuz im new to a wheel so going from medium tc to none is a bit of a jump so i think the reason you dont get safety cars is because your such a clean driver me in the other hand am not so ill notice on replay they are following close to me but because of my erratic driving they lose the car causing a yellow flag its usually has to do with a car around me not all the time but mostly i think pleasemore career mode soon has anyone else noticed that in the opening scene when the f1 theme song plays you start up the game the mercedes car is the mercedes livery is on the ferrari car honestly i just want them to bring back a coop career mode where you and your mate could drive for different teams even and it has the full rd programs still it would be possible to do and would add a fun competitive edge between you and a mate classic tracks will never happen again they happened in 2013 and theyre the reason the game is permanently delisted from every store not a future i want to go down i enjoy the classic cars but we need the full spectrum from farinas 1950 alfa romeo they keep talking about to pastor maldonados 2012 williams to the 6 wheeled tyrell to the brabham fan car in any case theres no harm in keeping the classic cars theyve got already because some people like me enjoy driving them and i only started watching f1 last year abu dhabi i miss tyre punctures for the ai so far ive had more issues than they have when are you going to do how long does it take to get fired from f1 im calling ben goes to mercedes you didnt talk about the qualifying glitch personally it feels stupid to just fade to black as you cross the line when the clock has run out it should keep running until all the cars have crossed the line also claire and those stupid webber questions which you meme so gloriously do you have a game option to get rid of those interviews a really bad flat spot on tyres should make the screen vibrate badly so you have to pit wind direction should be added also to the game my biggest concern is the penalty system in online racing its completely pointless i ran a 5lap race today where i was spun intentionally two times by two different cars and neither of them got a penalty after i spun i was driven into by two other drivers whilst i was standing still and i get two times 3 sec penalties there is literally no reason for the penalty system to exist in its current state i skipped the f2 races but it really didnt feel like i missed much well lets be honestthis could be just a huge patch for f1 2018 almost all the problems from 2018 are present here beter late than never mate this isnt late its 100 on time the issue is people thinking independent promos are reviews you need a good month min of gameplay before you can truly do any sort of meaningful review 147 vettel in red bull with the ferrari logo on his helmet i actually really enjoy the invitational events they need to be fleshed out a lot more maybe you have to race in the modern classic cars and compete much much more with more drivers in these cars i won the championship in f2 and got the winning cut scene unlike what happened to you so i think that once youve won it thats it do your career mode i want to see if you changed team ai are wayyyyy too overpowered in wet weather hope codies fix this we could use the classics car for a scenario mode for historical events that happened during the history of formula 1 like brazil 2008 like you drive lewis hamiltons tolerate mclaren and you have to catch block within a lap i may be as you do the task the commentators will do the famous commentaries like is that glock like if agree f2 is kinda pointless and way too short microtransactions career mode is actually really disappointing i want the cutscenes from f1 2017 and 2016 back there was a lot more immersion and life in the game when chris would talk to you about car upgrades and performance and emma would talk to you about your performance in terms of results i would prefer the characters to have the balls to talk to your character facetoface rather than hiding behind emails are you league racing this year if feel like with the classic cars they could put them into categories and create a wec kind of race that would be very very cool eg lmp1 current cars lmp2 2004 06 0913 then other categories would probably be made up of the classic classic cars the safety car has no driver i swear i had the no safety car problem in last years game to me its fine this year and im really happy with it in 2018 i only got 1 safety car after two and a half season in career mode in 2019 i get a safety car almost every race in career mode i think it would be amazing to be able to choose the driver changes yourself with a max of like 10 a season so you can make it realistic or just put your favorite driver in the best car there should be an option to make it randomly done by the game how cool could it be to create your own characters for devon butler and lukas weber so you can sort of drive against your mates in career mode classic cars on games are fun to drive exept codemasters physics are bad you litteraly made this the day i got the game lmao i dont like rating things but ill give it a 9 alright max the safety car never coming out is the thing that angers me the most i could literally smash someone out and cause a massive pile up and it still wont come out its shit the story line doesnt even impact ur seasonlike u an aarava kept telling people it has no impact an the after the f2 races its just f1 2018 over again f1 2011 theme song what about building your own team in careermode choose an custom livery choos a teammate from f2 and an engiensuplier then start off as a small team and build up to a chapionship winning team this would be so awesome to have oh i have to run 105 ai because its too difficult you became world champion in a flipping renault up it to 110 ffs there are plenty of things i like about this game the ai aggression is brilliant ive had some of my best ever career mode races on this game and its very satisfying when you beat the ai rd is much better because the ai keep pace with you but i do think some teams develop way too quickly following the patch where they improved car performance the cars are now very satisfying to drive driver transfers are a game changer they ensure that everyone has a different career mode experience and they keep the game feeling fresh the addition of f2 is a good step when the f2 2019 cars are released i definitely plan to do a full season in championship mode the improvements in customisation are good i hope it will reach forzagt sport levels in a couple of years however the small problems often detract from the experience and make the game very frustrating at times ai inconsistencies why am i about 05 seconds faster than my teammate at tracks like silverstone and spa how about retired tracks from modern f1 in the next game eg india was a great track and would like to drive that in say a single gp ben you didnt have to fight your way to f1 i literally retired from all the f2 races and still got offers from all the f1 teams nrburgring would be cool to have as a classic track personally i would like to go back and see the result of old raceses and simulated qualifyingpracticerace times and so on i think slight differences in the ai lines would make the game more realistic and would allow you to blend in more with the pack also i think we should see big mistakes from driver ai that potential ends their race particularly in practice i mean in real life we pretty much see at least 1 car crash out from a practice session the ai of the racing is fine but the ai of strategy and racecraft is still very poor the player can gain so much on that department at least the dangerous pitstop release got better classic tracks would be great but there propably is some sort of licencing issue although there most likely would be some that wouldnt be much of a problem same goes with drivers and teams the chance of damaging the floor when you ride those yellowbananabread things or even break a wing or the rear suspension i had a safety car glitch around hungary were the safety car came out every two laps i am going to be completely honest i would like to see in career mode where in practice and qualifying the ai can make mistakes for example they could crash on a hotlap or maybe some engine failures devon was fired from toro rosso and replaced by russel after season 1 for me funny but its frustrating even without the cut scenes i still want to destroy him nearly done with s2 so ill see what happens the rd from 2017 till now sucks ive lapped a fucking ferrari they need to focus on stronger rd for mercedes ferrari red bull renault and mclaren i think personally invitational events should be scrapped and we should go back to 2013 days with scenario mode i think that shouldve been the dlc for the senna and prost ai traction ruined the game for me what is the point doing quali if i always drop 25 places ai upgrades are crazy half of s2 and williams from dead last to best team with 5000 rd points left to spend ai in wet nearly impossible to beat horribly unbalanced game in the gameplay aspect rest is ok they talk about esports so much but they dont put much focus on it during development if they want to make f1 esports legit and attract simracers then they should work on proper matchmaking like iracing has they might add korea gp india turkey malaisia and all the other old ones the tracks are never updated bringing f2 drivers up into f1 in career mode career mode a race strategy screen before qualifying would help with which tyres to qualifying on if a medium strategy is viable unrealistic to pick your race strat on the grid lol spoiler alert we already know the new career mode team the f1 games need to have random player engine failures even when you put on a new part it could fail immediately like what weve seen in the rl f1 classic tracks would be amazing to have as well such as imola jerez istanbul nurburgring gp adelaide and maybe some older versions of current tracks such as monaco spa hockenhiem paul ricard without the massive run offs etc somehow this sounded like a video from someone who had to remake it several times and submit to the game developer for aproval that would also be the reason as to why it came 2 months late and why mentions 3 or 4 positives and 10 or 12 negatives and ends saying the positives ouweigh the few negatives codemasters continue to ruin the game with every new patch they put in the ai are more broken than ever the ai are too overpowered in the wet the snap oversteer the car occasionally gets really pisses me off it feels like codemasters are really taking away the balance in the game and catering more towards the esports players ive had to really slow down the ai when its a wet qualifying session and race after season 5 im retiring from the career mode and doing whats left for achievements in the game then im going back to iracing i rarely played more than a handful of races in season two because of the fact that without mods the drivers stayed the same now i feel like it will keep me playing far longer into the seasons in this game than any other one little detail thats still missing the safety car itself is supposed to be a mercedes amg gtrthe same one raced in gt3gtd its been used since 2017 but for some reason its still an amg gt s small and practically cosmetic but still bothers me a lot ben is youtuber championship back on or strat to glory thats all youve got to say about muiltplayer your kidding how about there is zero server selection us aussies are always match matching against people on the other side of the world also when you back out of a server because of dirty drivers the game keeps pushing you to the same server over and over again best way to avoid licensing issues with the helmet sponsors do what moto gp 2019 did add an editor and allow the community to do up custom helmets i feel the helmets in motogp has worked well you should have stayed with the same team congratulations on winning the championship now lets talk about weber as a cockpit cam player i really need a virtual mirror youd have to sit unrealistically far back to be able to see the side mirrors in 2017 i was able to find that seating position but in 2019 youd have to be in the engine to see the side mirrors at 139 vettel can go back to red bull but he will keep wearing the helmet with the ferrari logo if they had an overwatch style system for ranked where you can report people during the race and then the video is judged and offenders banned or dealt with in general online is a joke spoiler alert doesnt wait at all i have changed teams in career mode 202 agressive that is straight up being crazyand i love it btw is it randomized which drivers appear on the start screen how f2 was one of the thing they did right lol it was way short and had nothing about it once you started your f1 career completly useless it could have been so much more for my career kimi is back in ferrari multiplayer aliens i agree with the invitational events at classic tracks this is a must have is it a reagion specific for which drivers appear on the pressstart menue cause i have stroll vettel and hamilton on mine and ive not seen any other people having them on youtube how do you get that red and white gloves you thought the driver transfers and ai development rate in career mode are cool you are crazy it seems to me that you wont criticize because you are one of codemasters favorites unfortunately codies only listens to you guys and not the real player community can someone please tell me why monaco is so difficult sure on all the previous f1s it was hard but this is rediculous i took ai difficulty right down but still cant beat their lap times so i had to simulate the race this game is good but its still far away from being perfect so it looks like it has a bright future it will get better every year new features after new features looking forward for the future of f1 game ps you cant let down classic cars thats the blood of our sport but of course youve gotta make this game mode useful sure it will happen 1st off u called your final season 2 vid live it was not liveit was prerecorded and the fact you guys edit the videos and post them when you do wellyou restart and use rewind when you do bad things on the trackits all about the views and likes your just like the rest so adios and unsubbed and no one cares about a review of a game theyve been playing the same as you for they know the issues with the game already the same as you come on be more creative and just play the game thats what people want to see not you talking about a game you get for free with your 1500 wheel that youtube subscribers paid for do your fuking job httpsyoutube65bsfs9amrg dirtydriver on f1 2019 2 months in vergin mega store in ksa doesnt have and f1 2018 at full price would have been good if you could have done a bit on how they work league racing at the moment you could talk too about them fixing the kerbs designsbecause on some tracks they look so far away from real tracks you mention we often forget to talk about all the good and you forgot to talk about all the good they have kept on doing just taking in the new broke senna v prost challenges woke senna v prost with 18 other drivers bespoke classic race scenarios from different f1 eras god being able to start career mode from any season from 1950 to 2019 with all real life drivers and teams oo also include test drivers in career mode you might get ocon or alonso pressuring you for your seat on my 6th season now and still no safety car i started career mode done 5 races leclerc has retired from 3 from having his engine blow up sadly theyve removed the option to save your online nonrankedlobby standings so you need to do your own charts but exept that the best f1 game ever you moved to toro rosso the game should be able to say the driver name you put in instead of choosing from a list love the vids ben keep up the good work 3 best code masters game ever made dirt rally 20 am i a joke to you im still in my first season of career mode and ive had the safety 4 times i hate how you say this review is late even though its perfectly timed people who review games with less than a week of experience with a pre release version of the game are idiots just looking for views to accurately review a game you have to have played the game extensively and install the patches and appreciate whats changed this simply cannot be done in a week even if you play all week long so thanks for the accurate review i would love to see a full grid of classic cars from one specific year maybe 2010 or 2012 or perhaps even older great idea with classic tracks hockenheim maintain new style add old style spa former layouts a1 ring austria nurburgring san marino malaysia turkey south africa portugal valencia or jerez indianapolis old silverstone just to name a few agree on classic tracks driving a v10 era car around sochi is absolutely barbaric ranked is kinda dead cos people cant play with friends online and everyone is going to unranked theres no lobbies no one good to race with casually like on 2018 why did they remove playing with friends on ranked wasted game mode mate you literally play in easy mode second year title in renault your review doesnt count lmao care to elaborate which tracks do yo ufeel harder on career mode ai i think that in career mode certain upgrades wont actually improve the car but decrease its performance like haas this year and i think that upgrades can be swapped around so a ultimate area upgrade can be swapped with a previous one within the team we cant demand anything more they get 1 full year and just make absolutely minor changes and additions and literally waste the whole product by copying the whole thing from previous year i still commend them for for 2012 to 2013 transformation but since then they have not been good at all forgot about post race interview with claire they need to make her questions better and current to the race you just did i think we should be able to add stickers on our helmet depending on the team you join to make it look cool i like how further on in the career mode the ai gets harder because it gives me the arcade feel i hope they fix the starts maybe its kinda off but since you have to manage your contract it would be cool to have the option of buying stuff like a house or a car etc it would make the game more immersive for me i would love old tracks too ill be waiting on 2020 or 2021 tbh i just cant support the yearly release games now a days i would like first person view is this possible can you change the view interesting that you mention traction as i think that is one of the key problems with the codemasters f1 games the traction or the lack thereof it is quite ironic that it can be much easier to drive an f1 car even older ones like the early 90s ones in racing sims far more realistic than the codemasters f1 games given that the latter are supposed to be easier due to being focused on a more casual crowd the main difference between racing sims like r3e raceroom racing experience rfactor 2 assetto corsa and project cars 2 is that you can lean on the tire much harder than in the codemasters f1 game its most appearant in braking where you can quite often stomp the pedal quite hard compared to the f1 games as long as you have downforce but you need to bleed it off as you loose it by comparison you cant really touch the brakes in codemasters f1 games its also appearant on acceleration but not quite as much except for the race starts especially in for me f2 is very disappointed i wanna do 2019 season championship with mick schumacher funny to see ferrari logo on vettel helmet when he drive for red bull racing team ahahaha when will they get vr lol i beat the ai on 110ai starts even at monaco without traction control hes stalling what f1 2020 needs optional f2 complete season consistent ai more history with butler and weber change in classic cars method for example 2010s season all cars and drivers and not three teams f2 transfers to f1 for example latifi to williams i know is difficult improve in safety car system red flag random mechanical failure preseason testing free practice driver contract increase of weeks from hungary to spa and from abu dhabi to australia for upgrades more custimization just helmet and suit its not that much noo classic cars are my favourite we need to take the time loss between steering wheel and pad out of the game and to replace the gap make the rewards online and gaining esports qualification harder to get in order to get the casual player happy and our casual going competitive to know that they need to buy a steering wheel winter testing would be a good way to include off season upgrades rd bonuses should be tied to the amount of data you collect during testing make all 5 dry compounds available to test during day long sessions 10 laps on each compound could give 1000 rd points 25 laps 2500 pts 50 laps 5000pts they could put a multiplier based on last seasons constructor standings so bottom teams get a boost and have a chance next season oh by the way ben joined the big red team for season three an idea i had for the preseason testing thing was that you there could be different paths for development that you can choose from basically how it would work is that every season your rd tree would reset and the more programs you do in preseason testing will unlock different concepts for you car that you can choose eg low drag high downforce the path you pick will determine the kind of rd tree you get so if you pick the low drag option more of your upgrades for aero your car will start the season with a low drag setup and your upgrades will all be based around that which could possibly limit your downforce development basically what ferrari have done irl this season but gives you more opportunities to reduce drag to increase top speed hopefully that makes sense and it would be complicated to add but i think it could be a fun idea if done correctly i was really annoyed with the first five minutes of the video but the rest i agree with classic career mode is an f1 idea of mine that ive had for ages the story bullshit ruined it for me and the ai still take you out when they pull over to retire what a shame imagine they did pit crew career and added salarys into the game finally a review of this game that mentions everything from career mode to online by someone who knows what they are talking about d most other reviews ive seen of this game dont mention enough aspects of the game or are reviewed by someone that doesnt even understand it and are just paid to do it also seems like you have moved teams for season 3 of career mode so i now need to alter my driver transfer predictions someone needs to replace you at renault alongside ricciardo if thats the case if you go to ferrari vettel should be your teammate as he finished above leclerc at the end of last season by a few points so it would mean charles would move teams probably to take your seat at renault perhaps if you go to red bull verstappen andor butler would move teams and that could get interesting im only guessing at the moment but im looking forward to season 3 to see what is in store slow down rd progress by the end of season 3 you have fully upgraded the car i think we got the message 5 minutes in that you think parts of the game is a let down does anybody else feel like codemasters have gone down the same path as every other yearly sports gamethey update the graphics and driversadd a few features that dont really make a difference and copy paste the rest of game from previous games and then just slaps a full aaa price tag to milk as much money from people as possible from sales for what is pretty much just a big dlc 1345 i do league racing and the netcode is god awful its basically impossible to not lose connection to steam you have to invite people 5 times for them just to receive one formation laps are bugged and some people cant load into the races its really not that great what if we could create our own team and car i started my career at mclaren they were too slow on the straights but my results were very ok when i moved to red bull mclaren had an imperious power boost i think the whole career mode and where it develops is choked together by pure coincidence which gives each player a different experience what makes the game very good in my eyes my game crashes every time i go into career mode for azerbaijan ive restarted my career and it still happens can someone help me player engine failures flat spots if you lock up custom gloves for career mode pit animation to work on more please like the little hint towards your career mode team for the next season but is your break pedal calibrated yet 2018 with 2019 liveries and crappy damage model best to play woth modded damage model and as williams team do not approach if you expect full simulation could do with updating the practice programmes they are good but theyve pretty much not changed for a few years game needs a patch so the safety car can actually be used its really strange since in 2018 the saftey car happened maybe a bit too often now its the other extreme i have done 27 races in career mode no safety car to be seen there is definitely a problem in the balance of the ai i agree with everything you said make more career mode my biggest problem is realism and small details ae when you drive into the pitlane your car steering is so weird and doesnt make sense also i wish you could finish your lap after the race and your engineer was a bit more enthusiastic after a good result just the small litlle detail could make a game unfortunately they never focus on that the multiplayer experience is trash it needs so much work the rest of the game is awesome and really enjoyable the cars could be faster like in real life the graphics are really great and it runs smoothly on pc bloody hell u used f1 2011 music ik that music anywhere ive played that for sooo many hours on my 2ds also there should be an option for a full or short f2 same f1 codies games as always they put f2 2018 not 2019 fake drivers driver transfers and then all the same from past games yo guys i personally race on 103 ai and i can get better starts then the ai easy both on reaction time and traction i use medium traction control i tried full traction control and then i had the same problem as everyone like so tiametmarduk can see this i think there needs to be a beta before the game comes out because if there was most of these bugs and problems could be out of the game if we had a beta i cant stand how no matter what you do on career mode the shitty teams get good because your f2 rivals are on them and your teammate always underperforms im on red bull and spcore and williams are the top two teams and verstappen only has 10 points through 7 races hopefully next years game gp3 winter testing and new characters keep butler and weber dude you didnt buy a single efficiency upgrade and youre saying the ai upgrade too fast sorry but ive seen good starts you should try to improve yours i wish if teams would make there next season driver line ups mid season for example mclaren have lando and carlos for 2020 910 is seriously waaay too muchthere is so much more potential and so much more things that need to be fixedadded to make it a 910 i want design for the helmet better nate than lever f1 2011 background music and great review makes an amazing video when is season 3 of career mode coming out ben do you guys know of any good leagues on playstation on f1 2019 im talking like a serious pro level league i wish i could change the engine sound of my multiplayer car the ferrari engine sound is nice but my least favorite and i never played this game coz my laptop is potato on my game it got rid of the mclaren and ferrari for 2010 i would love classic tracks old hockenhiem circuit mangy cours adelaide street circuit imola buenos aires silverstone old layout brands hatch donnington nurburgring jerez and more that im probaly forgetting gasly moves sad torro rosso sounds searching for aliens is a part of reviewing multiplayer they should get rid of the efficiency and quality control bonuses that you can buy and instead make you do some preseason testing and maybe presummerbreak testing so that you can purchase an overall quality control or resource efficiency bump in a whole department that stays active for the rest of the season then resets at season end with the sennaprost bits they sh4 have done a full season like it was in that era so the tracks cars characters drivers background etc etc so everything looked like it did and as it was back then including murray walker and the original f1 tune the chain by fleetwood mac hopefully codemasters are listening 2020 definitely needs a few tweaks to the driver transfer system have older drivers and consistently underperforming drivers as per current transfer rules ingame leave the grid permanently with the best will in the world were being asked to believe that kimi could still be on the grid at 49 in season 10 of career mode or that hamilton would leave mercedes for three seasons fighting for p17 in a williams and why not have f2 drivers from the story mode who havent made the transfer to f1 come in to replace them the higher their f2 championship position the higher the likelihood of graduation into f1 plus there are only a handful of kimis who would theoretically leave according to these parameters so theres no chance of an unrealistic raghunathaninamercedes scenario oh and while were doing this sort of thing code in current hosting deals with tracks so that we might get a bit of rotation on the season calendar here and there nothing drastic but could add some colou if the game would just stop crashing every other hour it would be really nice please codies many people have issues mod the game not buying an f1 game until they add vr support how is the game in terms of graphics on the standard xbox one the f1 games are too much similar to each other they need to add something ground breaking for it to be fun after 1 or 2 seasons paddock easter eggs and cutscenes with an indepth career mode and of course a killer soundtrack from ian livingstone this is the worst f1 since 2017 edition yes in terms of contents is the best so far but in terms of car handling is absolutely crap cm did not make the game more realistic they just made it wrong cars do no steer in slow corners no its not just the ai that is too good the cars have an awful suspension physics driving at monaco or baku is a nightmare bad game stick to previous versions ngl the f2 seems like a tagged on gimmick cant do a full f2 season also you should be able to remove butler and weber as personally i would prefer realism over a non existent rivarly as soon as u move to f1 we getting league racing back soon career mode is a joke kimi keeps on driving for 10 years till he is 49 an idea for the custom helmets and suits maybe have it like the forza games where you can earn new helmets and suits and also be able to add your own sponsors and designs on the cars 451 that music tho i would race classic cars if they had a full year with all the drivers of that year added wanna race as damon hill 1996 how do you join ur xbox club ive been waiting ages add the 6 wheel tyrrell car but first you need to look at crashes i got a full course safety car by literally sliding slightly ben you are just bad at starts i can actually beat 100 ai on starts quite reliably retirement option on the mfd like you say to jeff that you want to retired and your team also calling you in for retirement if theres a problem place the car in a safe zone not instant stop the game pre season testing like you said random engine failure drive without mguk like riccardo if it fails contract offer from other teams if their interest in you same system that we use but you can sign with the team thats intrest in you or choose another to negotiate red flags like 2018 if you pass over some lose parts you tire suffers a puncher starting grip more equal team orders i think its everything i want d hello all and welcome to my very serious f1 2019 review classic tracks please codemasters at 1214 it says the garage space is for vettel but charles car is there when you are starting a race on the right down corner you have reach optimal rpm i think you should take a look on that are you stealing intothebarriers idea maybe you need to turn your difficulty down because they cars are quicker than yours how do you have ricciardo on your home screen the fact your performance in f2 makes no real difference is disappointing you shouldnt be able to choose whatever team you want in f1 it should be performance based also i agree about the story theres really no point to starting in f2 because once you get to f1 theres no more story theyre just two more ai drivers the senna and pros stuff should have been scenarios it was pretty pointless the way they set it up majorly deceiving give us classic tracks there have been some races axed from the calendar since codemasters produced the game id gladly pay for the dlc to get turkey korea and valencia just baught it last weekend and first needed to search a good force feedback setup before playing the kampagne and restarting it because i couldnt change die difficulties during the kampagne bro we dont need anything else rather than career mode you get it he does his review now because he has experience and he can really tell whats wrong and its the period where codie is working on the 2020 game so now they can modify it thats all my positives me checks time 15 minutes remaining insert intothebarrier oh no tracks would be great i feel like them allowing driver transfers was a great step forward in f1 loosening up with the license so maybe tracks could make a comeback in some form in the future im sad that you arent adding facecam anymore we miss you ben more facecam please ferrari livery is wrong they released a patch earlier today to add the 90 years logo classic tracks could be used in career to switch out with other tracks every season or two for me their patch to rain is too much the ai is taking 23 seconds a lap out of me when we go from dry to inters for classic cars they should add replica liveries for them so we can have a 20 car grid of 2010 cars for example i enjoy using the classic cars for hotlaping but thats about it tiametmarduk what setup are you using ben gpu and cpu at least i have a 1080 should i be running dx12 all the time if the handling is good and realisticwhy has every f1 driver thats played the game said its bad and unrealistic hmmm i find f1 2019 awful they need to fix the interviews u pass a lot of cars but emma just asks about weber and butler i dont like the f2 handling too much they are lacking grip compared to the real dealhope they rework the f2 cars for a more extensive f2 career next year why did this reupload today he moved to racing point theatre mode sometimes doesnt work for me 800 kubica is moving to williams replacing chungus i love it team switch confirmed oh yeah in my opinion is th ai good but i think they should behave like real humans more mistakes diffrent starts for diffrent driver more personality more interactions i havent bought f1 2019 yet because i thought it was too similar to 2018 and was not worth my money should i purchase it or not im still waiting on the 50s and 60s classic cars eg maserati 250f vanwall and the lotus 49 since when did it rain in bahrain whoever said video games dont make people violent never played f1 2019 i want to smash my pc regularly but i cant stop playing it leauge system in f1 2019 is so broken in the game we had ro swich back to the old lobbys i think codemasters cant make more progress in a year its pretty hard to update it to current real life stats also if they would have made some cutscenes they wouldve gotten pretty repetetive and boring ben opens up youtube sees limitless do a preview comment section nice creativity changing the order of the calander in the future would be great so theres even more variety between seasons i would like options to practice starts and pit stops claire is needs to be reworked thank you ben legend update for xbox one soon too i believe you have some very good suggestions for what codemasterd should do with the franchise and i totally agree with them and you also have accurate pros and cons about the game lets hope that codemasters will listen to you and us all the interviews are one thing but id like to have press conferences where you could have jabs at other drivers and get a better sense of what is happening with other drivers itbs review is waaaay better and more serious will you do competitive league racing on this game 2 things i would like to see added more safety cars ability to create a helmet design from scratch like in motogp19 graphic lewis hamilton10 handling max verstappan10 post race interview pierre gasly10 realism williams f110 career story development scottsitbs driving skills out of ten f1 2020 needs a full f2 season to get to f1 and you need to win the f2 championship to advance to f1 like it is irl when you get to f1 needs to have cut scenes with all drivers inc team mates and artificial drivers as well ik its a licence issue but that would be amazonc who noticed big chungus at 756 ben ahhhh stop blue balling us we need to see season 3 5 minutes of good things 14 minutes of bad things keep up the great videos next game i hope in career the teams get sponsor and engine changes tad bite late ben eh calendar not calibrated last time i was this early bens brake pedal still wasnt calibrated reviewing it while youve been playing it for months nice vid though ben can you not use the same expressions every video every day every 5 minutes i dont have any issues with the start how did he not go off at 325 next time ben please say spolier alert when you said you won the championship in career modei was saving all episodes to watch all in one go but nope you had to spoil it scotts was better ai overpowered in the wet rd ai development speed insane to the point where you cant catch up after season 3 with f2 i think u should be able to get a choice like short season then f1 or full season then f1 f2 is a joke because you dont get the option to do the full f2 season if you win the f2 championship it doesnt feel earned cause you didnt do much at least give the player the option to do a full f2 season or a f2 shorter scanerio mode 330 not realistic he should have gone straight on refresh it if ur on 360p 240p gang where are you at 144 yeah it makes perfect sense to have the ferrari logo on a red bull driver ill be back when its hd not late at all so pointless everyone reviewing the game only a week after its come out in the video v103 right now v108 hmmm great review though 2 months late but its ok ben fix the video 360p 510 unrealistic gasly too fast mclaren too slow wait why is he on 103 my ps4 is on 107 i cannot wait for f1 2020 where the brighten the lights at bahrain in the trailer and make us spend 100 when u see a tiametmarduk video but its a 2 month late review ben gonna get his serious glasses on now not first last time i was this early gasly was driving a red bull can you please tell codemasters to put f1 2019 demo please we want career mode f1 2010f1 2019 still no accurate depiction of lewis hamiltons stupid earrings claps game review i feel like your doing everything to avoid doing more career mode 360p gang where u at whats up with the vid quality 360 p gang where you at the games on sale right now for ps4 hope to get it soon at the 103 version crashed redbull as the thumbnail 2 views with 27 likes good job youtube ben still chilling on 103 hello all and welcome to my very serious f1 2019 review first im at racing point in my career and i am only a few upgrades away from maxing if out now its head and shoulders above the haas is higher than that its like 1024 i have a suggestion do a giveaway of f1 2019 cause i really need it how can you get so many rd point how do you get so many r and d points how did you get so much rd points how did you get 1 million rp into the game just curious change mph to kph mclaran can max out at 1020 in my career get in the slipstream of another car with drs in bakumonzamexico to get the top speed are you going to try all teams you can try to do a race with all maxed out cars no matter what happens hamilton will still be in the overpowered winning car in my experience racing point is the fastest of all ive maxed them all 1 racing point 2 haas 3 mclaren try mclaren now do it with haas f1 mobileexe has started working hamilton in game seems always transfer to strongest team in my save i built renault to the best car in the season and boom he came dont the rule change upgrades change the amount of points the car gets austria challenge do the austria challenge its official this game favours racing point does anyone know whats the best maxed out car in f1 2018 wish it was the same irl racingpoint ftw can you test the top speed on aero 1 1 in italy anyone else hear the chainsmokers in the background do the austria challenge please test it out lewis in austria the best is the renault i swear how do youget much point is it possible to swap the upgrade trees themselves so as to give a car the best possible amount of upgrades you should try alfa romeo alfa will be the best 1031 if possible can you please make a championship with all the cars maxed out like so aarav can see yes please i think this can break the 1min 1 second mark for austria please make a video on how you can change the r d points please even i would like to do this try mclaren do the austria challenge please do it with all teams anyone tryna buy me f12019 do the austria challenge plz aarav how do you get the 1000000 rd points im trying to figure out what each car is like at their best yes do hamilton at a1 hey aarava can you make tutorial video how make this 1 000 000 rd points do maxed out car vs stock car speed test do a whole season and try to beat your teamate will you eventually do every maxed out car in f1 2019 id like to see mclaren do the austria challenge try 1000000 mclaren try with this car to make a time under the 1 minute in austria u should try maxing out all the cars can we talk about how weird hamilton looks in racing point colours do a race where all of the cars are maxed out do the chalenge racing point be like too much vtec too much vtec do austria wonder what mclarens maximum rd score is this some f1 mobile racing level of op maybe in this car austrian gp lap under 1 minute the renault rnd tree is ridiculous i think i could go higher do the sub 1 minute lap yes make the austria challenge please sub 60 seconds in austria i think the car gets faster after it resets the upgrades and you purchase them again next season what is gonna happen if you maxed chassis and areo but nothing in engine yes please we want to see that video yes please try the 60 second challenge i have a maxed out racing point do haas and see where it ends up because it is the easiest car to upgrade in season 1 please hurry and find the best upgrade im about to finish another season and really wanna move teams that ers harvesting though damnnn 1119 when your so close to being 10 seconds faster than the previous lap do it with hamilton in austria cmmon how many laps are you doing obviously you have to do it on my career the mercs are at 1021 and so are the ferraris yesss plss do the sub 60 sec video you will never have a conclusive answer until you do them all aarav im loving these experiments so keep going and do them all i want austria under 60 secs like at this point everybody is saying every team have the best maxed upgraded car im just gonna guess it is haas cus why not i would like to see maxed maclaren and hass how do you get all the rd points how could you get 1million rd the obvious daddy stroll joke is too obvious to make can you get 1000000 rd points at the ps4 so yes how try mclaren i got higher that is what hamilton usually do please no i have weber on a racing point in my career please take this to austria with lewis i think it can be done we need to see this car at austria how do you get the 1 mil rd points do the austria challenge more dominant than mclaren were in 1988 yes that will be mega let this racing point run rampant at austria go to austria 1039 but lewis hamilton completely yeeted him out wise words by my man aarav how did you cheat in xd drinking game take a shot every time he says side of things mclaren is at 1020 u should have tried the merc around red bull ring to get under 1 min do austria challenge please you magically managed to say racing point for the video try with haas kevin magnussen do the challenge yes i would love the austrian gp speak slower on the outro do the austria experement grasshand side thats new lets do renault or mclaren next time to see who the renault engine work at full speed hamilton really doing the same in the game what about mclaren you should do every team and then drive them to see which is quickest by lap time the alfa romeo car is at 1023 i tested it out im on season 8 of my career waiting for sub 1 min lap in austria also try mclaren max potential i heard its better try the mclaren f1 team i would love to see you race austria roses are red violets are blue the timestamp youre looking for is 902 put this car in austria quali perez is in my career quicker than hamilton hw is always 7th if you play gran prix james valtteri its james let arav through valtteri do not need to so quick james ok let stroll through valtteri he is 5 places behind no james i will tell toto valtteri fine try under 60 sec laptime pls at austria go to red bull ring and do under 60 sec huh would never have thought racing point stroll in mercadies will never happen it going out of corners is like the lmp1 hybrids on boost racing point engineers wait what im confident that this car can break the minute mark at austria also maybe try and check the top speed down the baku main straight could u make some more survive backwards because i luv em should def try haas and mclaren show us the top speed of the maxed out racing point pls do my homecountry challenge as stroll memes always says daddy can i have a better car of course hamilton went to the fastest car for things we want in f1 2020 they should have rule changes like in motorsport manager like refueling or changing the points system someone should tell aarava that 100000 points are enough can u tell me how i can get 1 million please if racing point sees this twitter will explode ah thats y u have s2 racing point lmao first do you modded the helmet thats sick thats raidillon actually you sure youre the championship leader how do you get those custom helmets with offwhite and that stuff i dont understand this youre so aggressive on the

so good in clean air 1917 throwback to malaysia 2016 you should have risked that 7 laps on those medium tyres lewis its james aarav what are your camera settings hamilton could be heard on the radio its bwoken its bwoken antistall its off nooooooooo d wait didnt the same thing happen to ar12 lmao you ruined the end of the race in the title not gonna lie that happens to me all the time i dont know

could hear hamilton saying oh no noo noooo insert malaysia 2016 hamilton radio i would like to see the career stats like wins podiums and stuff like that great why dont you play the motogp game 1917 time for a murrayism now i cannot believe it can you test mclarens maxed car 2040 its a real team win they put together a strong strategy what an ending i got a challenge you can choose whatever track you want but the key is to do zero pitstops and get at least top 5 idea for f1 2020 have races finish under the safety car you and tom97 are llluuuckkkkyy sons of agood job most shithouse win youll ever have that was like the arton sena and alan prost monoco race let me guess you beat verstappen cause his tyres went off the cliff should have continued on the meds i found this episode really

aarava 2019 waiting for this hope it will be a good race no 50th damm had to watch my favourite youtuber before i end it all oh no im not first like if ok boomer is a shit meme great vid dam i was the 21 to watch yeet edit when u clicked so fast that youtube notification are slower than you i know you didnt have much time in this cartrack config but man u apex so early and brake so early it hurts my soul lol 130r is full speed no need to shift down in the dry when your driving what set up do you have like regarding settings imagine controlling this car with one hand while shifting gears lol when boost kicks in the car goes insane everytime i want to drive this car serious i start to overthink all my life decisions 649 yes rush ost now imagine stroll on this jesus crist you are talking alot i love driving these historical cars and the sounds of the engines are real iconic stuff accidentally binning it but it turns out fine because you start on pole in the next race outstanding move and in the bin it goes on lap 9 who was here when it was called my first league race 1640 climb up his wing and push him off the track you could have faded left youre way too dirty you couldve let off the throttle instead of running into the back into him to me the hardest of the classic cars that i have tried so far is the 79 ferrari that thing just feels so unpredictable ito handling turbo kicks in kinda like having double the horsepower um yeah quadruple that in a literal sense you can turn the turbo down in ac 927 yeah never heard that from ben before hoping the weather changes soon before his old tires blow kinda felt bad about pushing flash off track so i let him pass so i could do it again its flipping possible change the titles ur so shit at driving why tf are you ever famous honestly fuck off u bald ginger fat prick do the next races are going to be in the classic cars your maclaren had v6 i heard the sound oof tough race but you didnt give up despite the amount of times you struggled with the turbo of the 1988 mclaren turn the diff down that was the op strat how ben said x l r 8 rather than accelerate really triggered me idk why pushes flash wide feels guilty and lets him by immediately spins him out lmfao thats defiantly not the best opening result for your first league race ha ha anyway another awesome vid dude keep it up with the content that mp44 is my favourite mclaren f1 car rugbymadfan i thought i was the only one strongly with the mclaren 1646 how to murder a lad twice congrats on 400k subs are you still in aor or in an european league why dont you use first person view it might be harder but would be really immersive great video what an interesting concept i like it so youve barely driven this car but felt no need to practice brilliant strategy 910 career mode is now crying in the shower fucking finally link of songs used love your content seriously mate the career mode is the best content you produce by an incredibly long way you need to get it up to at least 2 career episodes a week turn ur diff down in the rain ben u get more traction 1646 flash reported you to stewards oof you binned flash then binned it a few laps later please go back to aor those were my favourite type of videos in f1 2017 and 2018 i was wondering are you going to do a video driving the classic f1 cars with a manual transmission with clutch im going to do some soon my voice made it into a tiametmarduk video ive accomplished everything in life now i love your videos but i really do think youre out of your depth in the online leagues after the league we need career mode ben coming the next race ill be starting on pole position crowd cheers in sadness dont have the game did they really remove the 95 ferrari 412 t2 dont see it on the selection screen im looking for a good fun league to join any recommendations the real drive to survive this car is a handful cringed so hard at my spin too hahahah karma hits your hard bro thats how a v6 turbo should sound btw that car in suzuka tritonleman and velocehyperz 3 your skills and commentary are the reason i subscribed on friday this moment when the safety carl is faster than f1 x l r 8 ben thats pronounced like accelerate excellent as always ben you mean the turbo threshold and not turbo lag turbo threshold is the time it takes for the engine to get up to revs to spin the turbo turbo lag is when you are already in the turbo operating range and then have a delay in boost after applying throttle can be eliminated in real life with left foot braking why walter rohrl did it in the s1 do not know if it works in this game and how f1 cars were designed in that year the mgu is basiclly an antilag system in 2019 cars so not necessary fairest driver of the day xlr8iceman 1644 tbf you had enough time to go off the throttle there and even when you pushed him off you didnt hesitate with it at any moment i think you should have waited for him there at least after that to make up for it imagine not watching it live on aor pit crew you have wing damage pit now ben why dont we continue it a bit more for a second i thought i was watching german gp replay ya better bring aor bacc you racing tonight ben great vid career mode brings more subscribers but league racing is what holds them would you race for the actually f1 2019 lr season maybe ayrton was so quick in this car in the wet because he could perfectly control the turbo does anyone want to get the ps4 trophy you got one add my psn martijn27aug yes its back what version was this i was casting the 2nd division race for this event for pc havent watched you in six months and of course when i start watching you again you do some league racing its been a while damn these yt bots are hella fast yes ben back at it again with aor first i have to study for exams i was wanking off watching my pillow but i stopped cus i got them notificationzzzzz twitter notification gang hoho content great to see you into league racing again ben first 1001 front straight with enjoyable look into turn 1 you have terrible front end and very bad traction out of the corners its the first video ive seen from you and your driving is very good not gonna lie but i see a problem you are too greedy only go for the dive if you are 100 sure that you can take his positon get like really close to him first under pressure he might push himself out but diving without gaining a position losing 1 round with a potential overtake is even worse i hope you read this 2 trailer park girls go 1024 bens f1 knowledge is absolutely 0 how did you not know there was a gp in 06 you did a series on it miracles how i got p2 in this race lmao hi everyone im kc and this is my new petrolhead channel about everything with an engine and wheels come and check out the braking point maybe youll enjoy my videos but who knows unless you watch a few i welcome your feedback and video suggestions enjoy it annoys me how little you know about f1 many very many alonzo 148 of course it existed the first bahrain grand prix was held in 2004 it was only skipped in 2011 lmao i thought that was my steam notification at the beginning good troll hi ben which do you prefer f1 or gt sport just starting playing gt sport and love it but find it hard to mix both as it takes a while to adjust good race to end the aor christmas cup maybe you should do a 0 ai you can set any difficulty if it seems too eays jenson button challange you need to drive in a 2010 mclaren in canada 50 or 100 light rain then heavy rain then heavy clouds you have to change your front wing once you have to serve a drive through penalty you have to do 4 or more more passes through the pits you can only take the lead on the last lap every video no practice playing this type of games for years but no practice every time 001 who else checked their steam the classic cars are so good the fine print got me good is there a reason that youre not a pro bahrain 2006 is a brilliant race damn you f1 youtubers who didnt watch f1 before 2010 can you add me on ps4 im pretty fast i think 2004 was the first bahrain gp lol whos gonna tell ben that there definitely was a 2006 bahrain grand prix bad setup could go better im so stupidi forgot to change the setup before the race i love your onlineleague videos you seem to have so much fun to race in these conditions if ben ever gets into esports i will mail him whatever he wants whens gt sport ive gotten into f1 after watching your videos that over take though 1008 1030 like of your the 100 liker and love tiametmarduk 1127 wow youve broken the drs which didnt even exist back then impressive i am not going to use this as an excuse buuuuuuuuuut cmon ben if you want to complain about something just do it and dont act like you are above it 1009 that was almost a carbon copy of the move hamilton made on vettel last year you do know every video is a brand new video right we need more league racing on this channel again more online league race 608 thats because these cars had tc do you not remember the championship edition career mode yall took the bait so easy how could i not forget f1 championship edition d opens video checks steam for message 155 considering it was never raced well actually httpsenwikipediaorgwiki2006bahraingrandprix that message notification confused me i even replayed it and thought i had friends why do i feel like this title is a lie havent watched the vid yet edit wow i expected absolute carnage d yo 2006 bahrain gp not a race that ever was in existence me it was as you did a f1 championship edition career mode and bahrain was the first race you absolute schmuck first im quick boi 11 seconds they updated jeff i think meshut up jeff jeffcopy that 1 minute later jeffgood job me triggered when claire asks about the lack of grip or something bec i hit the wall im always like when i actually dont know or remember went from dead last to 4th in a 5 lap race my target was 3rd so my rep went down a truck load how do you get those costom helmets pit now for intergalactic tires vettel rolls and lands in the middle of the track safety car eh that wasnt bad enough stop hating on 09 ya idiot i hate when you ask for a weather update and get info about tyres just remeber no heroics into saint devote please no heroic actions at sound of vott please shut up jeff im going 160 mph into a tire barrier in real life you would go straight in and get stuck but in the game you just bounce off nothing about situations that cause a vsc or sc the reporter with me is always saying that was a close battle between you and your rival when i am 20 seconds away from everybody pretty much the whole race the was there engineer bloody screams in my ear with my headset too i hate him me leading the race jeff your in the top ten thanks for the info jeff me shut up jeff jeff received 2 minutes later jeff your teammate is on the pits meahhhggg freaks out the steering wheel during the pit stops ect really irritate me its like randomly turning not when the wheels are turned weber dnf in turn 1 claire good race for lukas weber today me they are ultimately op in the wetwas in a renault 3rd car and i got overtaken by a fucking mclaren i was on p1 and jef says nice job you are in top 10 me finishes monaco in 1st place claire did yu looz greep me jeff box this lap jeff y e s jeff 5 seconds later you need to box this lap me i hate it when im on 25 tire wear and he says tires are falling i go on till there on 60 70 tire wear lol i got veteran at seson 3 race 3 safteu car either you have like a bajillion or none ex ar12 nick his 1 and a half seasons hasnt had a single safety car here is a summary of my race last night leclerc 45 secs behind me for 1516 of the race claire you had a great race today with your rival leclerc no heroics into zandevorte please we need a phrase from fernando alonso no more radio for the rest of the race god how i hope codemasters is listening to this entire videobecause we know f1 2020 will be exactly like 2019 and 2018 and 2017 etc same voices same phrases lazy as f coding by the so called masters ok you are in the top ten hey what happened to your f1 2005 and 2006 game videos still not as good as the geoff crammond series why there are no subtitles they should have a kimi answering button for claire just nos and mwaahhhs how about we skip all of the street tracks and replace them with some proper tracks sod the monaco race i encountered a safety car during qualifying today anyone else theres no perfect game ummmmm u heard of minecraft good video but try and run the qualifying sim program before the end of fp3 practice 3 glorious sunshine practice 2 glorious sunshine practice 1 glorious sunshine qualifying glorious sunshine race glorious sunshine jeff were expecting rain in 510 minutes ok jeff whatever you say mate literally just happened looks like you have no idea how coding works and picking on things like jeff and claire its just trivial the mechanics of the game the driving the feel dont talk about those those things dont matter to real driving enthusiasts i mean cmon i agree with this video seen the same things that you discussed in the video if you ever want to do a video interview me about what you discuss an get another player with the same option hope they makes these changes in the f12020 lmaothis is hilarious but true jeff rain in 5 minutes jeff 5 minutes later rain in 10 minutes my main gripe with engineer he is awful at helping with strategy we need a way of asking such things as who is the leading car on soft tyres or whatever compound you ask for how old are hamiltons tyres what is our net position also our race rivals are different to our championship rivals jeff sort it out is it worth it to upgrade from f1 2018 when a car crashes into you has nothing but your car can no longer continue me runs a perfect race on a track with no walls in sight claire you graced the wall a few times there me finishes 3rd place and qualifies within the 6th place contract next week me pole position win the race claire you must be pretty happy with this result after how badly last race went me i want my manual inout lap in practicequalifyingrace pit stop i find it anoying that you cant drive the f1 cars your self thro the pit there is a perfect game red dead redemption 2 i got pole in monaco similated race and got 18 have you thought it possible that you just arent very good in the wet when you over lap weber 2 times and claire says you ended up preeeety close engineer trys to tell me something right as i enter the tunnel at monaco every damn time you need to thanks heres the problem with f1 games they all suck and always have for real what helmet design is that me goes from p19 to p3 lukas goes from p9 to p9 in a redbull claire that was a pretty good race for lukas what do you think about it yes the race simulation is a real disappointment claire how was lukas webers race today me if ya wanna know go ask him and if you love him so much just bloody marry him albon has already done more than gasly did all year redbull 100 made the right decision not sure what the contract manageragent name is but i had my engine explode on track had to retire from the race and she gives me what the hell was that this is f1 not bumper cars claire need to be replaced by jack plooij 8th most stupidest thing in f1 2019 is aarava refusing to change mph to kph this makes me sad like you criticize the game because some bugs and things that repeat but you dont see how hard is that game to do and how hard is fix bugs in game like this or make this things better 8 completing a season without ever seeing a safety car intergalactic tires lol i actually would like it if they made the weberbutler stuff optional its cool in the first season but it gets old really fast i prefer racing against real names when im racing in monaco and jeff tell me every single lap into the tunel that we can try another strategy me racing 39 laps at monaco in a bloody monsoon claire were you struggling for grip i had this where jeff said you are in the top10 now but i was there the whole race i have some 1why in every team u go u have number 1 2why every time have bad start wtf with this gamei buy it 50euros to see this thingsomg i hope f1 2020 will be the greatest f1 ever if not then go fck ur self i dont have f1 2019 yet stuck with f1 2018 but when i qualified 16th with a renualt high up the rd chart claire congratulated me and asked me about a rival i hadnt even chose yet where is my banana me in 2018 jeffbest battle is vandorre and leclerc me lec 13 and van 15 hey what are your t cam settings for f1 intergalactic tyres 143you shouldve dubbed prez that 09 game is the best f1 game ever what are your camera settings i would love a feature where i could move drivers around to different teams before you start a career im glad i didnt buy this game when it came out f1 2018 was a shambles for bugs and they are all still present in this game first game ive skipped since 2010 good job codies if jeff is an example of artificial intelligence then claire is the example of artificial stupidity you become a veteran and get absolutely nothing another frustrating thing isthat we need to download the setup over and over againwhy the last used setup for a certain track isnt there by default ahahahaha ive just watched the first 3 minutes and i cant stop laughing xd so true i also became a veteran in a season aarava hit the nail on the head i got home from school had qualified on pole at singapore and couldnt be bothered doing a wet race cos i lose like 2 seconds a lap in the wet at marina bay so i decided to simulate the race for the first time in my career 14th place like i wasnt expecting a race win but wtf if only codemasters listened to people ideas the next game could be the witcher 3 of racing games hey aarava great video by the way really enjoy watching these type of videos and your career series just would like to know do you play on the standard edition of f1 2019 or do you play on the legends edition or even just have the extra pack with the classic cars have you heard the irl engineers they talk all the time no herorics into sandoval please when he says great overtake you overtake some people in the pit vettel had a puncture in my career the engineer jeff told me at the austrian grand prix verstappen has just made a move for the lead i was in p2 an verstappen was at least 5 seconds up the road does the rookieveteran bar even have any impact on anything never noticed it tbh 1007 want red shells play the f1 2018 killer in the corners if you can go at 10kmh and enybody is going to overtake you how about they put all the engineers voices of all the teams from real life in the game and then depending on what team you join you can choose between for example hamiltons engineer and bottas engineer lets be patient going into turn 1 we want to be in a good position for the rest of the race good luck this guy aint never done complaining about this game and he is so right is it weird that weber is my team mate are there safety cara yet i first thought that monaco turn 1 was sandevoc when you get knocked out in q1 and they all always start on the mediums the most annoying thing is the weber effect goes from 20th to 7th carl thats a bad weekend we need to do better what about the ais pace when you fast forward time in qualifying no heroics into saint divot i fear no man but that thing no heroics into sainte devote please it scares me the speed of team progression is insane how can mclaren be 1 after 1 year shut up jeff ok understood my number 1 stupidist thing is that i cant even play the game cuz its broken i hit the wall and car a total right off out of the race and emma says fantastic result we couldnt have asked for more me top ten all race jeff your in the top ten now me oh well done aarav what are you camera settings you should collaborate with intothebarrier on those xd hey you know leclerc is such a veteran of f1 anyone else who had a glitch in quali i got beaten by my team mate with 3 seconds also the topteams were beaten by 25 and my team is 5th best no heroics into saint devote please a race i win the championchip and claire tell me thats was a bad race today in my career and everyones me from p20 to p4 in baku claire how was lukas race today theres indeed some laziness to some of the aspects of the game i dont know if it is because of the annual release which causes them to not really have the time to make the most of an idea or a situation but its a mess sometimes nonetheless about the saint devote thing i think thats as simple as what youve just said ask the voice actor to say it again with another tone because yes it would make sense that wed hear that again and again over the years but certainly not in the same way whenever i alt tab out if the game whilst not paused it insta crashes also whenever my controller disconnects mid race i have to reselect my control preset as i have changed steering gas and brake sens and remapped a bit its quite annoying you decided to stretch your tyres for some extra laps because tyre wear is not bad and jeff reminding you every single time that pit window is open you have to pit this lap where is my banana all things are simple fixes why must codies be absolute donkeys hopefully they take this onboard 8th stupidest thing your annoying ass voice meracing in nice sunny weather claredid you have problems with the rough weather today mehuh when is the swap albon gasly update 030 theres no perfect game minecraft has entered the chat is claires surname in this game weber by chance or is it butler you just can not imagine what the engineer says in italian language for example when you have to move your car after a pit stop in english language the engineer says release but do you know what he says in italian he says non dare gas which means literally do not accelerate how am i supposed to move from my box without accelerating true story in f1 2019 simulated monaco cuz i hate the track like singapore and silverstone but guess what i get pole by 04 seconds but then finish 18th so i am like wtf but ok maybe i crashed or something i go into race director nothing lucas weber is a god and sooooooo op jeff out the announcers havent changed since 201615 put in some new fricking voiceovers need a full season of f2 before you go over to f1 ive had jeff tell me on the last lap of nearly every race that the tank is empty when ive got over 03 left no heroics into saint devote please me wins a race claire that was a close race with devon brub i didnt even see devon what i hate about jeff is that when i ask about the vehicle condition he would just tell me about my tyre status gearbox fails no we dont like you no more the safety car is non existent leading the race for the past 15 laps then engineer goes like nice you are in the top 10 now if this came id be pissed can anybody match hamilton your videos are getting funnier and funnier every day good work by that logic you can be worse than mahaveer raghunathan and still get into f1 the war on jeff has begun pole on china i simulated it and got 18th claire it was more like dodgems than formula 1 today wasnt it me maybe you were watching dodgems instead of f1 cars is there any info on when codemasters will bring the 2019 formula 2 championship into the f1 2019 game also mechanic is like useless for weather me give weather information please mechanic intermediates look like best tire for now im sorry but weve got to talk about codemasters removing the ability to join friends in ranked lobbies why another are mostrar stuppieds things in the game the safety car doesnt have pilot or is on vacations i simulated a race and i qualified 7th in monaco and came 17th in a 4th best car of mclaren just tell jeff to be quiet please jeff aaravas worst nightmare especially in road to glory intergalactic tyres haha i burst out laughing at that point i drove my alpha romero tyres to 87 and got blacked flagged bc i didnt pit twice like wtf firstname lastname was last year dont know if just me but what ever f1 team you pick devon goes in the team ahead of you in rd and lukas joins the team behind in rd no heroics into san devote please basically it was dry to wet in race and i pitted 5 laps later for some reason and im actually good at tire wear and they did have no tire wear its pathetic that after a decade the game has still so many bugs unacceptable jeff the track conditions are out of this world jeff pit for intergalactic tyresplease f1 2009 was great 440 wheres lastname butler became my team mate in season 1 and claire just asked me about him every race just go ask him you dumb bint perfect lap without touching anything claire you scraped the walls a few times were you struggling for grip thats why f1 2019 is broken codemasters really need to listen to us fans to make f1 2020 good not to sound misogynist but id rather have a male manager than a female manager just speaking red pill truth me in 1 place racing a friend jeff great you are in the top ten there is 2 cars on the track you know whats really sad about this listits that apart from the f2 stuffits pretty much the same from f1 2018 and f1 2017meaning that cm failed to fix basics things for the 3rd year in a row claire asking me about me fighting with weber and how his team is so good even tho i am his teammate his team is nuts but mine is all right what fucking cutscenes and commentary is a joke its 2019 pay your guys to say more then the same shit year in year out couple friends have had jeff put them on slicks when its a monsoon outside no heroics into saint devote ia in the wet is so broken in singapure i lost 7 seconds 7 seconds the race in the drys same difficult l was in a pace ia start is also broken f2 drivers should retiring or struggling drivers but nah to hard for code matters i have idea for perhaps future f1 games each team as a different race engineer the filter has me dead no heroics going into sainte dvote please can we get anthoine hubert as the op rival in f1 2020 instead of butler or weber nobody jeff no heroics in to saint devote please no heroics into sainte devote please think claire just fancies lukas weber and devon butler me jeff how long is this rain going to last jeff intermediates are good me thanks jeff surprised you didnt mention the bugs that carried over from last years game that should be completely unacceptable this isnt a bethesda game remind me why do you play the game then oh yeah those yt and codies moneys no heroics into sandavot please were in amongst the pack shut up jeff i swear hes made this video 5 times 209 confirmed jeff is watching f2 f3 ready to replace you for someone else or formula e i dont notice the op drivers in the wet maybe my race pace in the wet is great but i can stay with them if not catch them when every time i win they say it went better than last week when obviously first is better then everything else so theres still hope ragunhathan can into f1 safety car i think some of the lines from the engineer are too long like we should just be able to ask how much am i gaininglosing but hes gives you too much info no heroics into saint devote you simulate the race ofc itll be slower because you dont race its somebody else ordered to drive as you on sunday and maybe paid just a few hundred pounds for it thats why claire said in the same interview that was a great race for you and what a horrible race i love the engineer saying vestappen just got to 1st position even though the guy drove in 1st place all race my personal best from jeff in q3 great lap your in the top 10 yeha jeff thats nice emma getting mad for you seriously underperforming against your team mate when youre 100 points ahead of him my engineer just told me today when i was racing on brazil wehrlein make the move now he is the leader what the worst is when the engineer congratulates you for getting into the top ten halfway through the race when youve been leading the whole race is it just me that gets annoyed by emma your agent wearing an f1 badge when its in the fucking f2 cutscenes im halfway through season 2 in my career mode williams are the 3rd best team on the performance chart and lukes weber won the german gp in a williams the engineer also doesnt change for the f2 mode so he will recommend inters even though f2 doesnt have inters f1 2009 was a fine video game and i wont hear a bad thing about it may just be me but ai turning in on you when you are more than along side you could be alongside maybe a bit behind and the ai will think nobody there i can turn in when in reality there is a car without part of a front wing now how ridiculously difficult it is to get a good start on a controller at least i see a lot of bumper car action but do the ai ever crash like multiple cars taken out at once in the simulations your character takes over and crashes to finish the race in last place claire talks about lukas webber and devon butler me if you are so interested in my f2 season why dont you ask about the 3 other f2 drivers that made it into f1 the manager was not happy when i took my first point in spain while i was almost the hole race in the back of the field in the wet still not happy my favorite thing about our lovely jeff xy has an issue he becomes slower sh i didnt understand which name he said pressing repeat jeff he becomes slower thx they could add injuries in f1 2020 why do i have to always for a hard team goal complete 8 practice programmes in two race weekends what if i want to do 3 per race weekend petition to get jeff to say eyes forward after some overtakes formula e fans will know game itself is solid but my problem with f1 games is that everything else except racing feels kinda monotonous same phrases same interviews and after 23 seasons of grinding you have everything in the rd system it gets very boring and i dont know man they could invest more time on other things to make the game even more compact i was given the introduction about tire temperatures by geoff in the dying moments of practice when i was doing quali moments also i was told inters and wets would be the same speed while the rain went from hard to monsoon tbh i have no struggle in the rain for me its pretty equal to dry for my pace but usually do better in intermediate but full wets absolutely horrendous its the start of the season and were back here at albert park no heroics into what 1129 you couldnt simulate before 2016 1027 ragunathan intensifies ai starts are also stupid i always lose 3 or 4 positions my engineer told me when i was in the formation lap that i needed to look out because i was in someones dirty air something else that downer make sense is if you hit someones tyre with your front wing your front wings goes but there tire is perfectly fine luckily you dont have that crazy turns the ai made like in 2010 i guess hello aarvaa do u agree with this i think in f1 2020 they should add 2 career mode one your normel driving f1 career and then another career mode where ur the f1 manager of the team where you run a team what do you think of this masters of code were pulling your strings win a championship u ar no loaunger an imploye ov tis organization i think the full career mode is dumb in singapore i start in p20 because it was wet teammate on pole and i was 49 seconds off the pace i mean wtf then in the race i made an early pitstop and i made many places then a crash happened involving 6 cars i believeso i was in p4 then the rain came i went to the pit and the stop was just terrible maby 6 secons and in the lap after the pitstop i lost again 4 seconds so the ki in the wet is way to overpowered classic cars without classic circuits more stupid things in f1 2019 1 jeff is only happy with you if you achieve a podium even when you start from last place to get to like 4th he never compliments your perfomanceeven if you had the best race of your life but finished like 5th all you hear is pick up rubber and bring it home the engineer needs to see the overall outcome of the race and the small details that happened in the race if you had a horrible crash and somehow came to points finish you should get atleast a small compliment bring back f1 2010 engineer 2 ridicilous qualifying programmes and teams expectationsbeing in mclaren in 1st season and the qualifying programme wants me to achieve a time for 3rd place in melbourne and that time was still only good for like 7th place in qualifying 3 no matter who is your teammate he pretends like youre in another carblocks you and even if youre in championship position your teammate doesnt give a there is no teamplay in the gameno team ordersyour in a online quali where parc ferme is on jeff tells you that if your car doesnt feel right you can come back to change the setup d makes so much sense why ai can not get a penalty only warning i like it when jeff says well done youre in the top 10 when ive been leading the race for the last 10 laps i agree i mean jeff should stop repeating and when u dont hit the wall she says it and u have so much grip but oh claire says u struggle for grip in my version of the game when i win the world title she said that i didnt have luck like i retired from the race or i had a very bad race and when i actually retire from the race or have a bad race she congrats me like i won the world title and also tell me that my team did not advance improvement side i will understand that if my team didnt have all the fucking upgrades already yes the race simulation is fucking bullshit i qualified pole position with a race winning car i finished p13 just because i simulated the fucking race i dont know if anyone else has noticed this but some driver are more prone to others to move lance stays out or in but carlos keeps jumping every second they removed getting punctures when driving over debris the damage model not career mode related just wow hey i got my rear end hit then the front wing falls off like what is that sorcery aliens confirmed brokenphysics wellthnx anyway the biggest stupid thing is the driver transfer system completely random and gp2 drivers dont get promoted sounds like a rant like xmattyg did in f1 2015 when he found a bunch of glitches make the intergalactic tires right away rain exists the f1 game more speed in my career i ride for alfa to and in wet is like every car is faster then me even the williams 3rd4th gear ai traction is insane slow corners are a pain in the wet it means 2030kpm dif between you and the ai when you take an engine penalty and get scaled for not trying to put the car on pole 1 no heroics into saint devote 2 claire nice race but what about weber and butler 3 im in my rookie season but im a veteran 4 kubica is faster than you in the wet 5 silver bullet tyre 6 when you make it to f1 even being a ragnhunatan 7 realistic but not that realistic simulations what about car performance levels in qualifying when you dont reach q2 or q3 s i didnt have the feeling the ai are too op in the wet in races for me its the transition period from dry to wet or vice versa where theyre unbeatable 100 true all of the points you make the engineer sometimes tells me to get out of his dirty air and overtake the driver in front in the formation lap 1 stupid thing about aarava 7 midrolls in a video sliced bread is very op aarava 2019 me wins in the williams in australia s1 claire things didnt go your way today lets talk about what happened me damn women with their high expectations engineer no heroic in to san devote please me after hearing it for the 500th time opens dmf and shuts up jeff also me modern problems require moderns solutions imagine aarava listening to no heroics into saint devote for 24 hours bens chubby little face popping up everywhere and itb working on your car when he can hardly make a hungarian goulash qualifying is messed up in your career mode finale on your last lap you mention raikkonen setting a lap slower than yours after the chequered flag but for some reason after you finish your lap he is ahead of you we have to appreciate that codemasters have a limited budget and only one year to make and release each game nobody absolutely nobody jeff no heroics into saint devote please jeff from 2018 copy and paste him he pops up in 2019 its like alan smith and martin tyler well at the end of the formation lap at silverstone i was p10 and jeff said youre in his dirty air overtake him and when is asked him for the damage of the car he said that the tyres are in good condition and nothing about the actual state of the car something i hate is the team goals that are set i suck at china in the rain so i qualified 20th and made my way all the way up to 8th my qualifying goal is 10th and race goal is 7th so in my teams eyes i had a bad weekend even though i gained 12 positions in the race you forgot ai starts i hate catalunya dont know why so decided to sim the race toro rosso s1 just came off a p8 in baku and beaten kvyat in all the races qualified something like p1112 finished p19 and two laps down while kvyat finished p9 logic ive just thought of something imagine france in the heavy rain against the ai the ai in sector 3 in france you can drive normally and still lose a second stupidest think not in f1 2019 ininininininininin ai sector times for example one lap vettel did a 35753 and on the other a 37391 how is he without slipstream or some thing else 2 seconds quicker in just one sector something else from the engineer is that he will tell u when ur in the top 10 and ive been there for like 75 percent of the race im saying it again and again f1 2019 might as well be a f1 2018 huge patch almost all of the things we hated about 2018 is still here no heroics into saint devot please can we have an f1 2009 career mode please another stupid thing red flags seem to not exist me won the championship claire that was a bad race for you lets talk about it me excuse me i was early i just forgot to comment about claire lmao i remember winning the championship and also the race bad day today tell me what happened excuse me what the fuck ibe just won the drivers tittle and you ask me about 2 or 3 colisions ibe had on the race do you think that is more important today i returned to career mode after a while im in season 3 in france and claire asked me how i feel about my debut race and what she should expect from my rookie season the engineer always talks to me when your going through a corner only talk to me on a straight ai in wet op how about every ai being fernando alonso off the start intergalactic tyres sound good to med i hope that in the video are questions about lukas and devon i should say the rd from other teams once you put upgrades on the car you driving the other teams are like totally faster at upgrading then you congratulations for winning the championship weber was cutting his way through the field did he learn some of the moves from you weber going from p17 to p12 why cant we get a different engineer for each team too idc if its the same phrases talking of claire i had her talking about how weber transferred to a new team even though hed been dropped from the sport once jeff recommended me a no stop strategy when its dry aarava do you want some video ideas you just seem lazy with these uploads doing youtube for the money not the fun we can see in your videos the worst thing is when he is telling you that someone like russell retired and you are in a battle did i tell you to not do any heroics 115 enjoy this if thats what you like who still playing f1 2009 on the wii just me ok please make a road to glory again they dont have 2014 cars i hate the fact that the ai have so op traction of the starts and the fake characters weber and butler are crap especially weber araava choosing to not mention 2015 good choice except from that it started the longest series from araava my driver hey at least were not opening our emails and seeing can anyone match vettel anymore codemaster f1 2019 comes out aarava waitthats illegal aarava there is no perfect game minecraft are you sure about that just bought 2018 game best 15 ive spent no preseason please just upload other videos we know the complaints but they will or will not fix it your video doesn t help this isnt content sorry my man whahaha nice vid btw all of these are so true oof editfirst lel youre really bad at racing like omg still laughing what if you wanted to go to heaven but god said you are no longer part of this organization 1213 did we suddenly arrive in australia ferrai always has the best strats xd hamilton why always me ferarri is definitely the type of team to take you in basically becoming fernando alonso with mclaren honda 201517 for a video efn hilarious maldonado would be proud emma must be crazy in the bedroom i almost pissed my pants man i laughed my ass out cj you asshole certainly it has something to do with charisma with the f2 2019 cars i can see them doing that where you get demoted to f2 again aarava good at destroying mercs verstappen good at destroying everyone well damn me if verstappen wont be in sf next season at least now we know if you hate your teams car just keep getting yourself fired from the team and at some point you will get a drive on your favorite team as long as you dont torpedo your way into that team everyone wants him because he helps them with the points except his team how do you get that helmet can you not negotiate yourself a contract that the team wont agree to meaning you dont sign for anyone this is basically grojean but he doesnt change teams and fired thats hilarious so we did you the words on you helmet that s impossible to made that into the helmet option anyone else notice the termination contract is written in latin if emma turns out to be grosjeans agent as well that would explain a lot of things leclerc gets yeeted at the beginning of each race 1010 realism this video is so hard to watch haha the helmet must be playing avengers and fighting with the drivers f1 2019 pierre gasly edition you really wouldnt want to be qualifying in the top few places when this guys in the same race as you turn ones deadly 1230 1541 1735 damn your rng is so lucky that youre more lucky than ea lootboxessurprise mechanics lmao you should have increased the things on the contract so it would fail and then you might have glitched the game because u would have no were to go i hoped that emma was overstrained crying the mascara running down her face and taking oxazepam at the end of the video you didnt jump the start shame how did you get that helmet i laughed so hard teacher what are you laughing at maldonado nothing maldonado brain utterly hilarious video aarav very well done i was laughing the whole time 616 how is that a rep decrease thats a compliment to your team 1743 you sound like a 3 year old girl laughing 1213 upside down xd its the same girl your commentary had me literally laughing out loud you can get fired lol i play at 110 and never got fired if i was him i would stay with amg u should just have asked this question to maldonado instead of going thru 21 races maldonado would know for sure i think you can do it better crashing out is a good way to save your engines me makes a little contact with my teammate emma youre fired 1225 were in australia boys anyone has the list of drivers who got wrecked out in each race maldonado the game how you get sponsors on your helmet i think emma needs a fetish outfit for that occasions doing that seriously messed up the competitive order renault and haas were top 2 teams at start of season 2 emma is the real player emma is hot do a what happens when u fail the contract negotiation 3 times video please i still dont get why the marshal has that glitched helmet still get fired than have an unsuccessful negotiation and see what happens why did the screen go upside down how did you get that helmet emma you are no longer a part of this organisation kimi leave me alone i know what im doing emma is a bitch just realized rich energy is in this game hope they have a new patch for that i think someone needs to give emma a pay rise for signing u to about 5 teams a season how do you make your helm it looks so sik can you make a video please well its happened if i could like this video 21 times i would im crying bruv i need a manager like emma always there with backup 12321242 i was dying xd wish the p45 had an easter egg on it ahh shit here we go again emma must be on her knees 247 with the magic contracts she gets out of no where taking hamilton off the track for each dnf best micheal andretti mod ive seen so far 1653 verstappen where is my check can you make a video in which you try to take out every p car and make the longest time to win you should be able to be moved down to f2 1701 got to get them fitbit steps in sorry just my view but you talk to much in the intro just get on with it and have a look at 1212 of video and at that point i think the game is broken there is a alpha romeo logo on the helmet so he is still in alpha romeo in season 2 emma sings the same old song everytime what happens when you get fired and fail the contract negotiations though so this is what kvyat is doing irl aarava get fired emma oh shit here we go again how do you create a helmet like that the answer to the question in the title is 49 i think if mahaveer ragunathan made it to f1 hey maybe can you make a video on how to create your own helmets please do realistic dirtyair experiment this just highlights ferraris strategy prowes aarava how about why dont you make a game experiment about a engine swap ex f1 engine to f2 car or f2 engine to f1 car 21 dnfs to glory wait why do you have traction control on hey guys newbie to f1 here just a question what causes all the sparks to fly out from under the cars i imagine its either metal dragging on the surface or brakes overheating but i see it so often and i assume teams spending millions of dollars on these vehicles would not have random pieces dragging all race long this video is hilarious 1213 when emma is so angry she flipped the entire screen i guess you were still a part of this organisation i want a second episode of this career emma should be happy because every time you get fired she gets her 10 the upside down emma should be an easter egg every time you get fired for the 4th time they need to change emmas tirade every time you get fired that would be hilarious still better than raghunathan aarava makes this video me y u no make f1 career 857 helmut is full aware what youre doing he just thinks youre dan ticktum 422 why is that guy wearing a helmet what if you fail your contract negotiation with every team most funnies content and laugh sound i ever seen next transfer go for top teams bens taking too long for the same video premise 1230 what lol hard rn in what universe does it make any sence 1543 knew it i think you should after being dropped from every team you should be made to replay some placement races in f2 and of you do that enough you are forced to retire and you cant play anymore unless you open a new save that top gear edit has made my day class keep it up lad your interviews with claire is basically the rich energy simulator 526 eeeeekkkk i its the emma volcano erupting in 242 you crashed into vettel making him spin what if emma could be fired how did you get your name and stoffer on your helmet arrav how many times can we get fired in f1 2019 codemasters ah shit here we go again angry emma is best emma dobsecind attempt mayve renault or red bull will show up freakin hilarious youre a genius hahahah this is hilarious that season 2 helmet looks so cool in this years game emma looks like shes had a bad botox injection those vehicle performances tho id like to see a 0 to 100 rep speedrun at some point so its impossible 1230 laugh out loud hilarious superb video hahahaha wellcome to top gear lads i am sooo dead i laughed my freaking arse off xddd im so scared of emmas face when she says youre fired shes so scary i hate her how do you make your own helmets and get it into the game do you need to do it for pc only as a have it on xbox let me know someone thanks aarava for making this video because almost nobody recognizes how much time was put into making this video possible keep up the good work aarava clacksonhammond emma i told you if you dont aarav ah shit here we go again can you do a survive serie at this game please still better than mahaveer raghunathan emma clearly has mattia binottos nudes to get that deal if you notice that ferrarie kicked leclere to sign a rockedship omfg wtf 1231 laughed so hard thx aarava thanks for spoiling the stay with alfa i love the voices you did with emma when you get fired and when you negotiate the new contract what happens if you hit negotiate with a different team 1213 1229 your camera is upside down 78 years later emma you are no longer a part of this organisation me leave me alone i want to dieeeeee stroll goinig in season 2 to ferarri xd hey i love how you put james jeremy and richard from top gear or the new grand tour in here i recognize those laughs from everywhere 1234 the box is the least talented human being on earth aarav hold my beer i been fired today from racing point codemasters need to remove the slow down time after a crash for 1 it stops the ai from potentially crashing and dnfing too that would add more immersion oh if you run into the back of them your car will be fucked but when you retire you will notice in the race director that you are the only one to dnf when in real life both drivers would be out needs more of stuff like that we all know why ferrari want aarava because they want that 1 mill resource points boost after codemasters tweaked them lmao ferrari picked you to keep taking out hamilton emma could be the solution at the worlds unemployment the reason ferrari signed you is because you have taken mercedes out so many times i am guessing until you drove for them they were leading the constructors championship by a nice margin 544 thats valtteri on the background maybe because you kept crashing out one or both of the mercedes cars this is how u bypass the game to play on ferrari red bull or mercedes season 1 this has made my day thanks would have loved to see how messed up that grid lineup ended up being still a great video though no one maldonado chrashtappen mr torpedo himself kvyat aarava be like in 19 hold my beer boiss the ferrari pick make sense they saw how good you were at taking out mercs this is a huge glitch going to williams to ferrari they are all geniuses at ferrari let me explain if you cannot fight your rival mercedes just hire someone who can take them out at every single race and have at least the satisfaction of seeing them dnf and of course aarav proved to be the best in this field im a simple man i see top gear clips in any video i subscribe imagine how news outlets would react every time this bloke changes teams you were just being romain grosean rn do you think there will come a point in career mode where everyone is on the same high performance level lol 1650 stroll in the ferrari lmao playin grosjean simulator best vid of my life your ass would have wound up in nascar midway through season 1 irl 4 fuckups and fired nice algorythm aarava you should see how long it takes to drive for every single team through contract negotiations not getting fired thanks to this new update mercedes ferrari red bull toro rosso mclaren and soon to be renault all championship contenders i mean it is obvious why ferrari want you you are the true logical successor to vettel the guy at 10 looks like jon hamm we will be driving very badly oh so its just your regular driving so i learned that if i ever did my own road to glory series i should just crash my williams and i will see myself in ferrari very soon plot twist emma owns rokit a rammer on the quiet lol this was actually great fun to watch still more overtakes than kubica wheres career mode i didnt subscribe for this but still great content in emmas mind what is this child doing if someone blended andrea de cesaris and pastor maldonado ferrari only wanted you cos you keep taking our mercedes youre their new secret weapon aaravs cheesy guide to become a ferrari driver 1300 you have 0 reputation at every team so the game is just choosing random teams dont even need to watch this to know that its many times bc it doesnt do anything its not very strange that you went to ferrari the 2nd time because they were the 7th worst team in your career mode nah in real f1 career mattia binotto saw your unbelievable talent to eliminate opponents and then hire you to crash into max verstappen in every race because as we know the ferrari has the most problems with him lately xd doing the exact same thing maybe try a few different dnf strategies get black flagged for once mix it up ferrari wanted you because you kept taking out their rival mercedes if sato and maldonado had a baby this would be the result nice one ferrari took you because you were helping them out with hamilton i thought you were got fired just like at ferrari phew it was an experiment where is mydriver emma can challenge eminem when shes angry am i the only one who really wanted a career mode episode today i just really want to see the team lineups for season 2 1238 mewhat oo who got the paddy power ad this was maldonados strategy xd when is season 2 of career coming out this is very funny i laughed so hard george russell after hearing hes lost his job to craashava for the third time excuse me what the fuck 1655 leclerc moved to mercedes find a woman who believes in you like emma believes in aarava ferrari in the game is unbeliably realistic to real f1 you gotta hand it to the bois at codes that they overdo themselves there see my channel i lost it when ferrari showed up lads 1650 yepstroll in a ferrari when you crash that much into hamilton you must get a ferrari contract xd stroll was at ferrari gasly renault leclerc at merc pretty much simulating vettel f1 media members no one is pitilessly stupid enough to sign a driver that is prone to crashing out at the first corner ferrari hold my cappuccino maldonado 2019 presented by aarava i found that you repeatedly crashing onto 44 is quite entertaining torpedo 20 lmao and until you got signed by ferrari the game considered completely broken hahaha i have never laughed so hard at a video in my life mercedes williams toro rosso williams ferrari williams williams ferrari i want to see career and driver transfers can u do a video on how to customize your helmet like you have 1231 press the timestamp for enjoyment purposes your welcome season 2 stroll and bottas in ferrari like the new helmet that you cant get exiled from f1 is obvious the developers cant very well implement a function where the game essentially tells the player hey you suck so bad that none of these teams want you thats how those players dont buy the next years version remember f1 2016 there you literally had the option to retire if you didnt want to accept another contract with a new team if you were fired by your old team that was a useless but funny feature your new helmet looks sick basically this video as of today you are no longer part of this organization this is what we call the ferrari strategy 1441 why the guy have a blue helmet who gets scared of emma in those cutscenes and yet they keep giving you contacts why does emma talk so fast from this video emas words are stuck in my head it wasnt too hard to add a gameover screen companies these days are too afraid of kids crying its really bad that you get fired from williams and ferrari picks you up hahaha wtf man its hilarious aarava good luck in esports 2019 love u so much can u make a tutorial for braking in f1 2019 i think codies know about ferrari just make sure they give you fuel for the race maldonado entered the chat thx for replying on discord how did you get a custom helmet like that lost it when you signed for ferrari 115 what if im lonely i got 2 wins for ferrari and still got fired from ferrari emma is a miracle worker to get all of those teams to sign you how do u get the custom helmets god emma is hot when shes angry love the captain america on the back of the helmet if you get fired in the worst performing team will youre f1 career end due to having no lower teams to go to me sees angry emma in thumbnail also me good video rosberg we partied in the amberlounge for season 2 choose red bull and when is mydriver coming back sara a can you like this my favourite youtuber thought this was career ffs cant wait for the rest of the video been waiting for 8 hours sixth xd first first autofocus is bad

to note the huge difference in his voice since the last video nope you didnt jump the start at all watched in slomo last lap crash yess ive been looking forward to this for a while well you wanna know what i wouldve donemake a repeat of what ferrari did in the race isnt it such a pain after you fend of your over powered team mate for the entire race and then get overtaken on the last lap you sould do the clio v6 you realize if you let him through you could have had the switchback and got drs on the run to turn 4 nick i found a way to make quick credits in fh4 read the repli on how to do it nick how much is your steering wheel such a clickbait definitely the most thrilling f1 series on youtube you should see who can build the best bat mobile for a challenge nick i dont know what your issue is

black to white after than micheal jackson finally a normal face cam wait nope blacked out put the start in 25x playback doesnt even seem fast almost jumped the start i sorta knew when u said last lap crash u got passed and u tried a dodgy pass and crashed into vettel the fact that you dived on the inside of the first corner on the last lap was your idiot mistake you wouldnt have gotten a broken wing wouldve had drs and enough fuel to use nick how you bottled it my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined andrew that should mean pole position for us vettel gets pole position

awesome race my friend from the start unti the last lapsunfortunately that collide didnt let you to take an so amazing win for hamiltonits okyou triedawesome performancekeep up your great work as always stop starting from the back you know this game can you play with renault in next quick race maybe you choose ricciardo or hulkenberg cause im curious with the pace thank you 1 kubica 2 vettel not win because the penalty 3 bottas pleaze quick race in abu dhabi with lando norris vettel will win the gp new performance patch update coming soon everyone get onto codemasters forumtwitter and raise awareness of the awful engine sound for this year a shame you had to pit at the end another heroic performance mate i see the difficulty is raised to 102 is f1 2019 easier or are you just that fast yeay lewis hamilton hooray thank you beatdown why dont you upload your videos in 60fps not bad comeback congratluations ah yes here we go again did lewis had the mercedes logo in his helmet you can see it on the pit stop moment of him but good racing well done one day ferrari will be would champion one day changes everything you have a tough challenge to work with hamilton he retires ben riccairdoed riccardo with that divebomb lewis will move to ferrari in 2021 100 his skin tone the red colour will look great this is cursed cursed image he got leclercd ben is ur nrl team the broncos 1925 beached az little did we know this would be the championship decider and hamilton stopped winning since hes move to ferrari lol it happened shut the fuck up we have just witnesed a moment that will go down the history of this channel 2019 safety car came out to the track i love how crofty mentions the new driver lineup but they only talk about kimi moving to alfa romeo i dont understand why you keep doing upgrades without securing the ones for the next season you always lose so much time while vsc you lost 25 or even more seconds in the vsc if you wouldnt you wouldve been right behind lukas after his stop im a ferrari fan but im racing in haas to work my way to ferrari seat playing f1 2018 im sure i can bring jeff emma and carl over lol woww hamilton in ferrari f1 team is this a nico rosberg video the title looks like it if hummy is on a ferrari then we will often see ferrari 12 on the podium not sure what ben was more exciited about his new team mate or the safety car its a coin flip if you ask me engineer there is a safety car i repeat there is a safety car me illuminati confirmed technically i dont think youre supposed to be allowed to serve time penalties under vsc or sc conditions its funny that helmet designs dont change when people change teams 1713 lewis is in the pits you can clearly see its him from his helmet design and that benjamin its telling us so but his helmet still has the mercedes logo on the front and he is on a ferrari like what this is one of the best episodes ever do they really expect non english speaking people to read all those options in 15 seconds dumbfucks f1 f12k19 fastest lap bug jeff tell you overall 1255 you have 126215 and set the fastest lap d up the raiders lh sets fastest lap promptly retires jeff great were on target for reaching our objective spend points repurchasing upgrades yes the raiders love the content and go raiders you have to win 3 out of 5 races to beat weber better title is finaly safety car i get a safety car in like every other race in my career mode you know the title wasnt the spoiler for this race i almost expected hamiltons move compared to what actually happened who wasnt taken by surprise by the safety car why not just use the title huge driver transfer instead i really hope you stay at ferrari who cares about lewis going to ferrari the safety car is here aarava gave alfa romeo a lot of rd points to have kimi back at his former team codemasters need to fix the unrealistic lack of reliability from your teammates im teammates with kimi at alfa he dnfd 8 times in the last 19 races didnt know you were a raiders supporter ben how to make a safetycar come out just do a maldonado typical of lewis hamilton just like how he jumped to mercedes when they started gathering momentum from mclaren he has always be a good driver on an exceptional car f1 good driver who vet 5 lec 16 ham 44 bot77 alb 23 ver33 thoughts on mclaren becoming mclaren mercedes again whats the point of following the series when the big twist is in the title its a bit like naming the red wedding the one where the freys slaughter the starks you really need to start consolidating upgrades not all teams will be getting a performance impact next season haas and alfa havent made any upgrade in ages all those points are going into consolidating imagine this is in real life you should have pitted on lap 2 benyou would not have suffered any time and would have had 1 lap worth of less tire wear yeah the raiders some of these crazy qualy times could be down to slipstreaming on certain tracks the ai have next level lap times from out of nowhere but i wonder if replays would show this to be true or false how does the transfers work switching between teams if i joined the ferrari since season 1 is that i can never have leclerc as teammates 1845 press f to pay respects and i thought the move was the biggest spoiler possible its like vettel charge in german gp from p20 to p2 you only got the safety car because it was you spun around and stopped if it happens with the ai or they retire you wont get it kimis career alfa sauber ferrari ferrari alfa ferrari alfa ps i know im missing some but i cbf i had hamilton move to renault and ricciardo move to mercedes half way through season 1 so i have no idea what he wants 1747 sainz meh my car is to slow lets retire so they have to be behind a safety car ben i didnt know you were a raiders fan bleed green spin out like vettel hahahahaha what were you doing there the iceman is back at alfa romeo i hope this never happens in real life ben being smug about driving for ferrari he has time to suit up and speak to claire again 648 safety car comes out for the stupidest shit 2 wide at the hotel hairpin at monaco is a sure fire way to bring it out didnt know you were a canberra raiders fan as well been a long 25 year wait lets hope it culminates into a premiership this year i wouldnt have thought ben to be a raiders fan absolutely disgusting 59 races and 1 saftey car up the raiders gotta admit its cool seeing the raiders in the finals but i can see them beating the roosters my guy roosters all day every day im pretty sure that the sparks is not normal from your car ben i think thats the reason that makes slow you down at the start of the races when lights out you never jump any driver when the starts right bens finally using f1 radios again lewis never ever gets a bad car in his career realism 1000000000 wait are you from canberra i am also from there the game was mad we have both our afl and nrl team in the grand final you spoiled it in the title ben 1108 a fellow australian who knows about nrl i go for the tigers but i am going for the raiders against either the storm or roosters hamilton dnf what a view an absolute beauty im sniffing a road to glory with merc next season is the game worth it or should i just wait for 2020 damn ben didnt know you were a canberra raiders supporter raiders will lose to the storm sorry ben didnt realise you were a raiders fan lol have fun at the big dance guys do you guys think ben is happy that lewis is joining ferrari in this video this is like if friends had an episode where chandler shockingly and unexpectadly dies with no warning and advertising it a week before as the one where chandler dies lewis hamilton to ferrari and a safety car 00 such a cursed episode every team lewis has joined in your career mode his helmet has matched it the safety car doesnt come out because you can turn it on and off in the settings what a race one of the most exciting ive seen amazing who here misses league racing videos tiametmarduk damage setting realisticsimulation please 1425 codemasters ummmm lets go for minor front wing damage 1713 lewis has a mercedes helmet i was actually why ben didnt get 19 points instead of 18 since he had that fastest lap what are you talking about on my game kyvat and vettel are in the same team lol epic episode filled with dramafeeling bad for lewis though gut wrenching moment oh no no no i love those real life radio chats you edit in im in season 2 atm and ive had a safety car every race this season and atm im at austria and just had another sc and a vsc up the raiders on my career mode leclerc and hamilton switched seats at the austria grand prix season 1 xd i went into this video constantly switchint between you aarava and toms career modes like whats the big deal tiamet youre in ferrari omg thats right thats so unrealistic to go all the race using 1 set of tyres which are not even hard lmao i keep hearing driver radio on bens vids now is this just him putting it for effects or is this on the game cus if so i cant get it im on ps4 and there is a option to click down on the r3 cus its got a voice or music icon about it so when i do replys i press it and nothing happens if any ps4 players can help me then plz do i wouldve loved to see your live reaction to that bombshell tbh fi game enters parallel universe better than the clown world we live in though ye with that bombshell out of the away kinky aussie attracted to scottish reporter the only way he can win the championship now is if he wins out the rest of the season and weber has to finish 3rd or worse twice has anyone had devon butler demoted out of f1 bens career mode actual 2019 season 33 points difference even if you win the last 4 races and get fastest lap in each one and weber gets second in each race it would still not be enough you now need weber to get low placed results and hamilton to help you do that in order for you to stand a chance of winning the championship u gt over 40 unsafe things left dam gonna prepare also why nt durability 1251 kimi unlucky this game is too realistic i am more surprised with the sc than with hamilton joining ferrari can this happen in real life so a race team with no black people on it is going to select a black driver to be the face of the team ha no way i know you were depressed but i think the game really bailed you out you got a safety car that prevented the leaders from getting away and it erased your 5 second penalty then hamilton hands you second place couldve been a lot worse 1400 everytime i hear that music in the background i think that youre gonna make a mistake or something like that we both treat the interviews serriously ben worries about next years regulation will just swap teams and let others deal with it hamilton has to win the championship doesnt he unsubscribed perhaps lewis car crash is caused of that radio message when jeff told you to target p2 after you let lewis through you should do live comms well screw next season then youll never be able to adapt next years car in time benjamin this is jeffslow down and let cry baby go omg safety car cant believe it d again you lose about 2 seconds under vsc if you had kept to the delta you might have jumped weber finally sc that is some cheese thought you were cursed why tf does lewis always move to the best car dumbest crap everham has been with mercedes since he was 13not going anywhere even after he quits driving up the raiders safety car i go for the rabbitohs but hope raiders win grand final im just here to see lewis in a ferrari 839850full force brain orgasm best race of the season in my opinion what a season amazing stop spoiling the videos its a dream wait raikonin starts his career in alfa romeo moves to ferrari moves back to alfa romeo moves back to ferrari moves back to alfa let me guess he moves back to ferrari 33 point gap with 4 races to go is the same as the real life 2016 season are the ai radio messages part of the game or is that added by ben i cant tell sorry for the doubt lewis its james can you dnf so ben gets his p2 benjamin bottle and lewis halmiton is the team weber is also unbeatable in my career mode too i like that first turn its good to see the ai make actual mistakes imagine a live reaction of ben opening career mode and there is lewis hamilton sitting across from him without any warning that is something i would pay to see xd starting on p5 game says p5 video says p5 ben p6 p6 p6 842 magnussen runs into ben after spinning out fia 5 second penalty to ben cant make this shit up 424 the dials on bens steering wheel reset by themselves does this always happen ingame i mean dont you think that the fact that the safety car finally showed up is bigger news than lewis moving to ferrari you shouldve put that in the title vettel spins me why im not surprised hamilton has been taking notes from kevin durant when it comes to changing teams imagine if you didnt crash into weber in monaco next up ben moves to toyota this title fight is going down to the wire in a classic duel between yourself and weber with hamilton now your teammate youre gonna need all the luck and skill you can get to defeat this alien ai driver i have driven the japanese race yesterday also 50 and i got a sc in the first lap and 7 vsc in the last 13 laps but only one car retired 639 down right corner why did it show it ew ben you go for the raiders arent you from brisbane kinda opposite if thats the case because im from canberra but support the broncos tittle should have been safety car lol if u cant beat them join them 1325 i get so scared every time ben plays that music try more rpm for the start maybe retire after this season and restart so everything works normally including f2 drivers moving to f1 i know this suggestion is kind of controversial there has to be a mod out there that makes the ai dnf as often as the player ben spins vettel wait thats illegal its my thing fia do something fia 5 second time penalty no one safety car after 59 races ight imma head out hamilton cant beat them join em wait did you just say safety car nahh that must be a fault in the scripts who got a lewis hamilton ad you got safety car only because you caused it lewis retires immediately after getting fastest lap i was more surprised about that safety car than the driver transfer xd in my career mode the ai just never does any mistakes or crashes is that normal hamilton moves to ferrari rikknen moves to the safety car d the title shouldve been safety car honestly 704 ben with australian flag if you jump ship now after ruining ferraris next year car you will be an even bigger asshole than devon butler hi ben maybe after f1 2019 career make some kind of ultimate career i mean career from f1 2010 to f1 2019 ive just watched again your series from f1 2010 and 2011 and i think those are masterpieces it was great to watch it and i really want to see how you are playing it again so maybe that ultimate career or just series from f1 2010 or 2011 would be really good since when you can serve a penalty during the safety car period well my teammate is devon butler he moved to haas in season 3 i think i have to leave haas now after winning the title with them i wanna know how the italians feel about this a key driver change and a safety car in the same episode when you first see it equals bruh pause it somewhere spot on on 1430 and youve got a hell of a thumbnail delete this no freakin waynice run rikknen from ferrari to alfa romeo hmmm i am not sure if i have seen that before maybe we get full race video once in a while maybe just thinking tho good job anyways 1713 lewis uses mercedes helmet shades of how hamilton maneuvers the gp scene man the best car wins do your best to beat your main rival ben post race i reckon it a great result buddy 33 points to chase possible reliability issues for the opponent element drive to your ability and most of all have fun fab race mayey ben tell me the song a 1348 please oooh nohe spoiled it in the tittlehe never do that this is only 168th time hamilton would actually look dope in the all red and vettel in all out wait what vettel moves to mercedes with hamilton going to ferrari in austria first season get on my level ben since you always want to get the names right and bernd finally decided to come out and play although its spelled maylnder you pronounce it mylander cheers from germany go to toro rosso in season 4 and begin a mini road to glory please 840 hlkenberg squeezes benji me dont worry you can win this 1109 the sc queue ended benji gains positions lap after lap me inspiration so are you ever gonna play older f1 game career again i have even crazier seb and lewis are in the same team together guess which team williams tiamet pulling up to work after spamming his work emails only to realize this one was the biggest of them all actually quantum mechanics forbids this 2300 and the 1 point extra for the fastest lap ben60 races ago the safety car will never come out ben now dad 845 glad u didnt spoil this race omg ben making his best grosjean impression to bring the safety car out great job mate what am i seen come on its like nico rosberg and lewis lol shook af right now kimi going once again from ferrari to alfa romeo oh boi he did a vettel ferrari picks up on development to become the best car blessed man instantly signs with ferrari even in videogames such a carbabbie career modes are your best videos got a safety car when it really didnt need to come out lmao vettel collides with lewis vettel loses out the realism is unreal i had something like thi happen yesterday leclerc and myself at hass magnussen to ferrari it was 16 points between me hamilton and leclerc this is all in season one on 95 ai get in there benjamin wtf is hamilton and webers ai they always move to the best teams and its just so boring hamilton has become the one thing he swore to destroy also i predict vettel moves to mercedes hey well ferrari may actually win a championship now that lewis is there kiss his feet tifosi to me it happened in season 1 up the raiders typical of hamilton the game gets it lol i noticed before all the patches the safety car only ever appeared if you as the driver were the one responsible for any kind of major incident like that wow didnt expect the sc this race i got hamilton on ferrari after i left bc ofc i got suck with magnussen when i moved from haas benjamin its jeff incoming come on work on keeping those upgrades or are you just gonna leave a sinkinv ship at the end of this season i wonder where hamilton moves to ben tom and aarava released brand new episode at the same time but no one cares about my comment first guy to view this video was really waiting for this you could have named the title a new teammate but no you must spoil everything why the max resolution of the video is 240p 360p nice to see you again just following the career path of the charles next leclerc to williams i guess ferrari has the beta test advantage over alfa yes im this early next up vettel moves to mercedes alguien sabe si puede poner como no visible el halo de seguridad in season 4 k hope the lap times round austria will be under a minute 1225 verstappen comes up my inside i love your videos because they make me so happy are the times on pc different than console since trl limitless drives a 103xxx and he is in the top 10 on the leaderboard 2136 they have inters on so where did it go sideways aarav just wanna say you are my favourite youtuber love your content dont ever stop doing f1 you make the same mistakes every season tho it took you to go off in the gravel to change your tires smh how can you drive with the number 1 i cant how do you do that red bull ring exists aston martin red bull racing has it as home race also red bull racing its free real estate finishes 12 finally you get a taste of your own medicine hamilton wasnt as aggressive as you always are can someone help me i have a major glitch for a long time now the steering wheel in game stays at the same spot and it wont move or turnin when i go left or right with my controller this will be a great season and you must win 1600 you had ti pit for sure this man has an off white helmet true hypeman 2113 aarava looks well chuffed working with the redbulls on the inside could you please upload eralier because im from the germany and its quite late here it uploaded and then you took it down yaaaaay he now has a intro was this video 715 all the time you have to leaveh the space anyone elses number change to 1 after a championship win aarava your a awesome content creator keep it up the upload went sideways finally has sound what the fk happened its cool how the ais are making mistakes as well never expect an ai would go oftrack or crash what seeding wheel do you use try increasing your rear wing angle in the setup it should increase overall car stability other than that great vis i have a complaint about the video it ends this video is incredibal im the 3rd view person yay im in the podium and nice video in my opinion the only thing that they need to improve is just the view from the inside of the car everything else looks awesome sound f1 2018 910 somewhat unrealistic f1 2019 810 great are you sure its not the raytracing the texture quality of the smoke is the deal breaker lmao f1 2019 when u play it on wheel u feel like a god for sure is better the new version of the game formula 1 2019 is better but the only thing that i would change in the game is the sound engine files except from the renault engine with sounds incredibly real the other ones is just sounds silly boring and no real the 2018 honda ferrari and mercedes engines is more realistic is better for listening is better for playing the downshift the upshift the revving limited the sounds of the ferrari the mercedes specifically from honda is much more like real life i love the sound thats is my only deception with f1 2019 the engine sound files apart from renault i like the sound and the night lightning in the 2019s but textures and details are much better on the 2018s they should add a texture pack where u can choose for yourself rfoundthecontrolleruser wow i cant believe how much actually better it looks so realistic f1 2019 have f2 which makes it even better also lets not forget how much better the tires look in 2019 which one was the best on x360 most realistic graphicsnot too colorful fps lightenings and gameplay 2010 or 2011 or 2012 or 2013 appears smootherless glossy those cockpit cameras look pedestrian on both games its like 50 of the detail is lost when you switch to cockpit strange because no other codemasters racing game does this since 2011 the f1 titles look worse and run slower than the griddirt titles dirt has realistic lighting since dirt rally that game came out in 2015 l guess but looks and runs much better than f1 2019 its the same engine and the same studio so i dont get it 722 definitely using a keyboard today i got f1 2019 from ps now 2019 the tyres made by plastic but on pc why downgrade ctrlc then ctrlv and done 2019 tires look better 2019 cockpit view has better lighting i would recommend that the center vertical portion of the halo be visible but transparent in real life we see with two cameras converging at a point in space thus making near objects out of focus or transparent dont believe me hold 1 finger up as you look beyond it what do you see two out of focused fingers i play f1 2018 they need to sell f1 games as 20 update dlcs it takes very little work to produce them very different you and i have very different interpretations of these adjectives lol its the same game new driver line ups n f2 in it thats all most games do copy paste like fifa madden nba nfl mlb all copy paste using dpad to steer complete mad lad 2019 looks like the same game as 2018 but with some downgrades in graphics and sounds those wings are like that as its the regulations only f1 fans will know i wonder if they will ever make the physics better so it doenst feel to much arcade now its just driving with some toys can i run this on my nvidia 9800gt in f1 2019 the shine of the tires does not fade as the tire wears down when running on the asphalt of the track this is a small detail that makes a difference what if they added dirty air in the game goodbye slipstreams am i the only one that feels like 2018 is a little bit better still long way to look like driveclub from 2014 seriously why no one wants make such a beauty so its a lazy cash grab 250 what do you mean 2019 has reduced asphalt quality thats like the only thing i immediately noticed is much better looks much more realistic now without extreme contrast that makes 2018 look bad and gamey just look at any real actual photo and see whats more lifelike as for the tree you mentioned textures are done better in 2019 again they have been smoothed out slightly and have contrast reduced for more realism on purpose not everyone likes high contrasted overly sharp unrealistic textures the smoother lighting in the 2019 vers improves jagged body appearances okayi already bought f1 2012 why so far 2018 looks much better wait what their didnt rework the texture on threes i am sooo pissed embarrasing to see that u play f1 with wasd and not a controller dandelions are the real deal breakers here the red bull livery doesnt have a sheen in real life so the reflection will be muted overall both look good but for the night and rain effects 2019 is superior plus as a game it includes the f2 championship so it is worth an upgrade bearing in mind this is once a year so hardly bank breaking levels of expenditure that amazing carbon fiber wing on the intake now sports a tiny cameralearn your f1 car parts broit was a camera in 2018 too the sound is different because of the engines have been upgraded and better u should have tried doing the sound design test with the classic cars that are in both games only improvement lightning and the sound damn it sounds awesome but it feels like just an update patch i liked 2018 way more from the graphics 101 they added too much trees in the background im living there and it looks more like f1 2018 than f1 2019 hahaha last year red bull engine was different it was reanault while this year is honda so theyre two different sounds the exhaust pipe is more polygonal now that is the reason why i want this game they didnt reduce the amount of details in textures but rather the intensity of the bump maps now the crevices seem to be less deep but to be honest they look more realistic this way at least when it comes to the asphalt i dont care of the lightning is far better which it isnt anyway and nobody really cares i feel like im gettin scammed because this game is all the same just like fifa and pes every year the same full price game for 50 they could just patch it fkin scam 2019 be like lets reduce the texture fidelity and number of polygon and then bump the lighting this video does some times show things that we dont even need to worry about like the trees at 258 nice work honestly though as long as the cars sound like vacuum cleaners instead of v12 beasts i dont think f1 will return to its glory bring back the v10 i just watched an onboard video of the current f1 season its funny im actually kinda old i started with the first need for speed i even bought the thrustmaster steering wheel with pedals for it it was such a chore to set up but the graphics and the gameplay were worth the struggle i kept playing up to part 3 then i was racing here and then but nothing major i saw the development of graphics over the years and when i see this here im actually kinda disappointed especially the copckpit view looks really lazily done the animations the turning this is 2019 man this looks old sorry i have noticed that the heat effect behind the car is no longer there or is it my imagination the differences are minimal this game like almost any other game out there is a dlc for its predecessor sold as a stand alone why do people buy games that are dlc look at the actual red bull f1 cars they have a matted look and dont have a gloss finish this is very accurate i dont get how we are in 2019 and still get light inside the cockpit they pretty much exactly the same so 2018 is way better than 2019 sound is still like a vacuum cleaner i have f1 2017 and i think im fine without lot of talk f1 2010 is the best in the series this game evolves over series hardly admit froza5 is real the camera looks so rigid 101the trees grew fast that year the same game with graphic pack well done good jobthanks for the details i wish thr is thunder when its raining anyway heard pc with graphics getting pushed to max exited the video equal engine a little bit better some textures more money steal for fan boys dry tires are different visually on 2019 2018realistic 2019plastic copy paste game is ready to go is no one gonna talk about how good the tyres look idk why but it was such a bother to me to look at the 2018 tyres lol the tyres look so much better the lighting looks so much better especially at night driver transfers customisable liveries in multiplayer f2 more historic cars updated drivers ai improvements soooo much better handling and so much more one of the best f1 games to date but should u buy it at full price no wait for sale never buy any games at full price 60 for better looking night races no thanks hey im discovering your channel through this video and it is very neat lightning is indeed so much better in f1 2019 and i love how it makes racing with rain or at night way more realistic does the game uses the rtx technology it might also explain the reduction of the resolution of some textures as it can counterbalance a bit the performance hit its 2019 why is there still cornered curves on the cars ive noticed this a lot in different video games the corners or curves arent smooth theyre choppy and cornered i am going to questioned this guys specs because f1 2018 isnt that bad on my machine and my specs are geforce rtx 2080 ti i78700k cpu 32gb ram gskill 3600mhz 3440x1440100hz asus monitor windows 10 64bit my machine handles f1 2018 like a boss and it looks sounds awesome now i am about to buy f1 2019 so i am not sure about the comparisons yet it almost seems like this comparison was played on two different machines to me if this guys machine is almost identical to mine then it should show f1 2018 in much better quality i miss more visible and dense marbles outside the ideal raceline even on 4k you dont see them well or at all on the track in replay a bit also the ideal raceline itself not the assist option could use a better visibility wow the reflections are much better on 2019 like that may be the biggest difference ive ever seen with games that are new form other years way better but i actually feel the 2019 comor seems slightly more washed out in areas the blues greens and red slightly only on the cars tho and the night lights in 2018 are horrible and seems like the lights are making it look liek there is fog all the time you sya realistic that isnt true lights dont spread that aya they do spread but not a fog spread i like the sound in the new one better also much more realistic with the volume of all the cars around you also its great alot of improvements and a few areas that arent the best all in all very solid upgrades lol very fun also and slightly easier to mess up and get wheels spin when hitting apex the wrong way i just want more depth added to the image just slightly i dont like the sound of both didnt liked it last year this year no difference reason why is that they never considered how sounds bounce against walls if i drive my car alongside a building i hear the engine sounds bounce back from it here in monaco for example the sounds do not change when you drive into an open part to a wall or building it sounds so static but i love the lighting though you also gotta take into fact that this game isnt fully finished each update is completing the game visually and gameplay wise lolwut have you seen how glossy the torro rosso is in real life i used nvidia drivers to add color and sharpness and more intense shadows to 2019 without it 2018 looks better and better doesnt mean more realistic i went to take a peek to see how much these were and all the way back to f1 2016 theyre all still 60 bucks a pop what the fu 721 wtf its look like a 10 years old game 747 this also looks like a old game the mist looks good but the rest hadnt changed too much the difference between them is the year 2018 and 2019 very difficult steering with controller on f1 2019 f1 2018 much better with controller that is non acceptable f1 games looks boring asf 112 more polygons did i hear that right i clearly see less polygons and the car is definitely isnt as smooth as it was before on the next pic incredible lighting the night finally a game made for a 2 monitor setup this game sucks gran turismo sport is better the cars are are not the reflective as last season so it is not right to blame the game they have removed the lacquer to lose some weight f1 2018 looks much much better then f1 2019 only thing that does look good in f1 2019 is light they do small updates and sell it as a new game better sound on 2018 version its like ioeidos 2016s hitman compared to the hitman 2 in 2018 is this graphic comparison or new aerodynamics review its a quality game but without steering wheel its impossible garbagestill waiting for someone to make a proper f1 game i think it should only put droplets on the screen in the cockpit view what psycho plays f1 games in third person calm down on the detail analysis its just a game man 2018 looks better then 19 d the 19 has a better sound with the classic cars their both bad games 2018 sound is better reflection of tires is biggest change for me also sound design of 2019 is better now i can hear separate engine sounds of opponents in 2019 getting more realistic well done the sound from cockpit of 2019 game sounds real i think f1 2018 has a better car sound we do have to remember that f1 2019 was an early release game you know how we have ultra high graphic settings in the menu you think in the future it will go even higher than that in my opinion f1 2028 is much much better there are some diffrents but not enough to pay 60 euros i think they lowered some of the textures and removed some of the landscape on purpose it may effect the performance significantly great review great vid well done i love your voice really does sound like kermit keep up the good work william great video once again nick i know that the game came almost 3 years ago and you already have a lot of work in your hands but can you do a detailed comparison between skyrim se and original skyrim continue with the great work 2018 hight 2019 very hight im shocked that 2018s graphics are superior what about the performance that would be very useful too i hate chase views so so much the thumbnail made it look like it was from 2008 vs 2009 very good game i am enjoying this alot shame the safety car does not come out f1 2019 look like the upgraded f1 2016 2018 sound is better main reason to get f12018 is the sale me quality of video games is always progressing f1 2019 well let me tell u very nice video what is the name of this game u should get a new intro its kinda noting after watching a few of ur vids its just super high pitched gran turismo sport has better graphics and physics i have f1 2019 and i dont like it so much you cant feel anything through the steering wheel graphics dont mean anything if the physics arent as good as its competition its the rb fifteen not one five ive owned 2015 20162017 and 2018 seeing the reviews on 2019 really reminds me of the cash grab that 2016 was 2019 is my first f1 game and i was pretty blown away with all the realism 2018 looks like it has some advantages in detail and texture though love the changes in 2019 dont know for sure but its gotta be somewhere in the top 3 or 5 for best night lighting right in a racing game that is anyways i love it ones lighter then another one is darker 2080ti no thank you the lighting is by far the biggest change 2019 looks really fantastic still toy like graphics and sounds even after 10 years of continuous improvements with the poor physics it is the least worth driving game on offer its not that great of a game people i will not buy 2019 because there are no big difference to 2018 now you look at it f1 2018 looks like it cane out in a better approach f1 2019 just looks like a enhanced version of f1 2018 with just better lighting effects and changes too the regulations and tires i do personally think codemasters could fix f1 2019 but in order too rebuild some of it they would have too shut the servers down and not let the public players play it until later august or they could do it in a later patch but too me f1 2019 is far better than 2018 on the ps4s prospective as its the most beautiful f1 game the ps4 has had so far thats my opinion but my favourite f1 game is f1 2018 but all honesty f1 2019 is in early days and isnt actually a finished project so f1 2019 might take my heart someday they ruined f1 cars with this halo its rb15 not rb15 no hate nice comparison but the driving literally just killed a random racing driver somewhere on the planet why tf do u use the view fro the back why not use the tv pod offset like on tv i noticed that when u drive the lotus and lock up the front tires the smoke is coming from the size of a f1 car from nowadays sound is awefull on both they really need to bring back the v10 or at least the v8 engines does it really matter marshal graphics we usually focus on next corner and next car the night in f1 2019 looks amazing other than that f1 2018 looks a bit better for me i really like contrast and colors xd even when its not realistic one thing they added is that u can hear now when ur car is making sparks on long straights u can hear the scratching on the floor like irl how about the visibility in the camera on board in rainy weather is it good enough 250 i dont know if the texture quality is reduced or if its just less noisy but the new one looks better to me the contrast and saturation appear more realistic too i always hated the unrealistic light reflection in this game series my pc cant run it on high settings so who cares haha lighting and sound on 2019 is better than 2018 u cant compare red bulls theyve got different engines 2018 had renault 2019 has honda does anyone else think that for f1 2020 they should add formula e cars and tracks im curious to see other peoples opinion 706 thats actually how it looks like when you have a race during rain so realistic better rain sound in f1 2018 why dont you do a comparison on the game play because as much as the graphics look better in 2019 i think the game play in 2018 was much better im sticking to f1 2018 now and buy 2019 when its on sale why the model and texture downgrades because of the new light reflections meanwhile nascar heat 4 is still using ps2 graphics i really wish 704 games would get it together a funny thing is that the peapole are the exact same as in dirt rally 20 and dirt 4 2019 is the best for sure you sound like kermit the frog bro try minecraft ray tracing mod vs red dead 2 i would love to see that in 2019 the carbon fiber looks like plastic f1 2019 looks terrible compared to 2018 lol keyboard racer seems like the test was done on a keyboard d not worth the upgrade buy an update they call a game every 3 or 4 years if you want to notice a real change seeing bahrain 2018 to 2019 omg looks real love 2019 ok f1 2019 has better sound in rain 2018 is much better playable with controller its a rip off its basically the same game only tweaked and theyll make loads of money for this shit f1 2019 and the lighting was amazing tbh forza horizon 4 has way better graphics than both of these would like to hear the difference of engine sounds of the classic cars yeah f1 2019 is better but kill my laptop too much bloom on 2019 at 320 even that fella has bloom on his hair wtf if ur gonna use bloom use it correctly i think before released the game developers did tried to just using every assets from f1 2018 with lighting and luminescence of f1 2019 and apparently the hardware impact is too big it might still be playable at ultra settings if everyone uses at least rtx 2070 but the developers know thats absurd same thing sold separately every year 218 that spot is really an onboard camera 2018 version looks a lot better in my opinion why do you play in 3rd person oh didnt expect to see this on your channel nick great to see you at least having knowledge over the regulation changes instead of halfassing it awesome dude i prefer the design that is gonna run on my core 2 duo 15gb ram 250gb disk super video for the changes we get each year it should be dlc 2019 is not worth the price 4499 5499 am staying with 2016 for now its an improvement over 2009 game still cant believe people buy one and the same game every year this could make a good science paper those textures look fucking disgusting why would they lower the quality i thought with the lightning and everything they made everything with a higher resolution dont know if ill get this years game this years engine sounds are shocking i wont ever buy a game that releases annual 60 updates i like 2019 because the lighting and textures also raining looks beatiful do a video on cricket 19 i think f1 2019 looks and sounds slightly better but as i already own the 2018 version i dont think theres enough to warrant an upgrade sound 2019 beter dude looked at a tree 2019 light is better everything is worst then 2018 learn from codemasters ea which car has more wider tyres 2018 or 2019 please i want to know did you check textures on other track surfaces because it looks like you were on silverstone and that was resurfaced in real life between 2018 and 2019 lol i swear he read my comment coz i posted on the last direct comparison vid to do the f1 thing coincidence i think not everyone when f1 2019 includes f2omg i will play with f2 for ever everyone when f1 2019 releases literally anyone his playing with them changes to the reflective properties its called matte paint lmao 2 years i did not even look at the graphics when buying 2019 the fact that the sound has massively improved and they added f2 and improved career mode was enough for me the lighting is such an improvement that it hides lower res textures or more distracts from them that you dont notice as much it is a shame the textures were lowered mainly the tarmacasphalt as they looked really good in 2018 exactly the same game 5 brightness 25 more brilliant scam monaco that was the new paddock building which includes a toiletwashroomloo inside the building which the crew would have to cross the street to get the job done before the lighting is better but the graphics on ultra look like 2018 on medium what the hell guys they are toggleable on pc for a reason 2080ti shouldnt need to sacrifice anything to gain somewhere else thats why its called ultra settings let me worry about my framerate at max settings dont lower the quality to save epeen ego for i prefer environmental appeal of 18 which is what i love the most in any game lighting alone is fine but not enough itd like fifa 18 and 19 same game different colour lighting im quite surprised you didnt do a sound comparison between the renault engines we all thought 2018 looked great last year lol in 18 the sound seems more flat and compact while in 19 it fills the atmosphere of the game and enriches the environment more than before so to say engine is better too f1 2019 is much better in lighting but f1 2018 is better in sounding f1 2019 is better overall and sound is really good 2018 better i wish i did not buy 2019 great video thankyou the new lighting model on the environment car an car directly infront of me are what i care about plus the my cars improved engine sounds i dont use outside view because im not a rd so that sound is irrelevant the night races look especially impressive top comparison thanks again its appreciated bruh do u game on a keyboard or something how about to compare stranded deep and green hell the differences are very small what should really change is the career mode the rest seems to be very similar to f1 2018 do the amazing spiderman 2 vs spiderman ps4 when you have time it makes you feel like you are f1 ive just accepted that codemasters cant make a great engine in terms of visuals compared to other studios nowadays but they mastered physics if only they had something like frostbite engine graphics and codemasters physics that would be amazing a comparison of older games driveclub vs gtsport please please do cod modern warfare vs modern warfare remastered the lower texture for objects are probably because of the amount of detail lightning etc edit to make the game run smoother 216 that isnt a wing but a camera pod the sound is pretty much the same in third person in first person however the sound design was much better making it sound like youre actually inside the cockpit with the ambient sound slightly muffled unlike the previous version where the volume was simply increased when you do this please compare the exact same cars eg the classic cars so you can get a direct different as with this videot sounds like your saying the cars are the same but have been improved but they are totally different cars it just didnt really make sense please compare f1 2015 vs f1 2019 in night plz why you love racing games so much tbf a lot of cars look a little flat because theyre painted in matte try shadow of war vs shadow of mordor no hate but your driving is just horrible are you racing on keyboard because that should make sense f1 2019 is feeling like more reverbation and echoes the vehicles from the environmental impact sound the nailed the night visuals better than any racer i find these videos oddly satisfying the cars sound terrible also in the night time cockpit view shot looked like from a ps3 game circuit asset of f1 2019 for me its just completly copy paste from f1 2018 almost or even nothing change in there whats different 2019 to 2018 are just the cars and the graphic honestly 2018 lights look more natural can someone explain to me why at 219 the base of that carbon fiber wing on the right is jagged like its from a 2007 game same shit thats why i dont new games anymore i rather wait for 50 off sales should i be aloud to play tomb raider im 9 which sounds better they both sound equally rubbish really detailed comparison nicely done i like 2019s new tire reflections on the outside looks beefyer the lighting is far better in 2019 than 2018 that night time lighting was beautiful stupid console port always making cuts to run well on consoles fuck this i play on pc and i want the best quality it can offer ps4 users for all of july f1 2018 will be 1499 and i think it is worth it is f1 2019 worth to buy or should i just keep with 2018 how in the hell does the 2018 version look superior in every category wow what a damn shame except from the lighting effects f1 2019 feels like a downgrade compared to last years game pls new retro revival ty 2018 wins in all categories do modern warfare vs modern warfare remastered please these light reflections are stupid developers goes always over the top idk why people buy these sport games that barely change every year new comparison video yes please sleep is overrated anyway me reads title also me oh wait thats illegal please switch to a midfield team if there is one circuit on the calendar where ben always delivers a stunner its monaco d toro rosso a legacy of failure true story thats a noice number of episodes are ben and lucy still together red bull seems to have adapted a blurry style on their racing suits on the podium does anyone else find the ai op at monaco on ps4 im reasonably adept with controller no assists but have to reduce difficulty to 95 from 99 just to stand a chance how do u check your trophies no heroics at saint devote plz i still cant get used to hamilton at ferrari god i hate driving monaco xx really disappointed with p9 after getting p10 at lap 9 would have loved to see you at 5th or 6th ben wishes every round was at monaco move back to ferrari sir 1234 only ben could find a way to exceed track limits at monaco shouldve done a 100 race because of the 69th episode anyone else notice the giant butt plug in the middle of the monaco gp this career mode mercedes will get stronger its obvious those 19 dislikes are from jeff at ur contract signing screen cant you try and sign with red bull todays my mothers birthday make sure to play lost but won by hans zimmer when you watch ben race makes it even more epic great work in the race bottles the outro waffle what an coincidance part 69 get 3 points on the worst car unpopular opinion monaco is a shit track due to lack of overtaking opportunities 1325 with grosjeans voice that was kamikaze every team ben joins and leaves gets destroyed how long before toro rosso become garbage you know its gonna be a good video when its almost 30 minutes long great race ben whens he gonna change that helmet then lol ben pls do the post race montage with that cool song the f1 2016 menu music is the most soothing tune ever no heroics at saint devote lmao what wheres the ambitious but rubbish strat ben unscrubskribeeee 2537 love the simpsons reference my god that use of the result points was delicious title reads heroics in monaco ben gets 9th just shows how dire that toro rosso is right now change your helmet i keep forgetting your profile picture is crazy keith can i get a rip for my parrot ben remember me for silverstone but there was a lot of peeps not gonna lie he probably turned difficulty down 12 year humor here episode 69 lmfao devon butler is thrash compared with weber me sees finally another episode of his career video nice also me sees its the 69th episode ultra nice yes first points btw i have watched every single episode of this career mode series i only came here because it was part 69 and because monaco means jeff mentions the thing that stresses him the most no heroics into st devote plz ai is always shit at monaco this isnt a surprise 105 always this anal plug in monaco hi guys how do i get a good setup in f1 2019 i do not get it how it works hey ben next time you try to take over into the saint devote just leave more space before the poolsection you were so fast in this particular exit that you could have easily place your car in the right position beside your opponent if you werent constantly runing into the gearbox of the car before you leave more space before the pool chicane and you can actually use your speedadvantage instead loosing all your momentum in the rear of anothers car its gonna be a onestop win isnt it cars the slowest kvyat qualifies last thats not good enough boi i got the 1000th like heres some feedback i was super stoked for you to continue the series but ever since you picked toro rosso i havent been able to watch a single video had you picked something more sensible like mclaren which wasnt plum last but at least able to fight that would have been pretty exciting tb to when ben used to have an intro to makr the ground shake ben starts every video like he is in a depression i understand monacos broken ai i got first and my teammate got third in a year one racing point why is the red bull driver suit so badly rendered damn hoping today was going to the day we go into q3 no heroics into st devote pls aarav loses his mind ben yeah fuck off jeff so close to 400k the real question is did benjamin daly win his title with the illegal renault brake bias system monaco should rename sainte devote into jeff curve probably spammed the flashback button to avoid having any damage during his race heroics my ass red bull is the best team and toro rosso is the worst something isnt adding up how do you do that you have a replay of forming lap am i the only ohne wondering about the fov of the t pod cam 002 117 the old 2016 music the nostalgia hit me hard ben but ive gotta say its quite scary how far ahead red bull is in the development race lukas weber enters the chat man you couldve taken leclerc if you couldve stayed off his rear end coming out of the swimming pool on laps 37 and 38 me sees title me nice 69 is just a super lucky number did you justice manowar cuoted brothers of metal the ai is just so so weak at monaco they will just drive all the laps behind eachother in a train getting high up there is easy even for a newbie like myself even on s1 with a williams the torpedo 2 in monaco lovely no one literally no one jeff no heroics into saint devote please i never knew that i would be sweating for bens p9 brilliant drive today part 69 nice imagine williams in p2 ben heroics at monaco jeff am i a joke to you i hope you wont just move to the stronger rb team like another f1 youtuber can ben win

make my previous feelings worse for the better thanks man the name of the song please at 715 now that i have seen this video im never going to play f1 online the people in this video could just play

are a joke 227 those racing lines d why is everyone lagging like that xd dude you laugh when non dort drivers make mistakes shame dude the ee eeeee thing is just stolen from the german youtuber unsympathisch tv eeeeee slammed the like button right there who would win over 1000b of dirty drivers or one clean driving boi fun fact i bought f1 2019 3 days ago for christmas so ive been very addicted to the career mode but i havent gotten into online so this shows me that i should never get into online thank god i saw it on time this looks more like nascar than f1 lmao i swear to god bruh 952 one of the best sebastian vettel spins this would be solved if cars got real damage when crashing either people would chill down or races would last less than a lap dude i break my wheel while watch it how did you manage to play it rip d at 202 that was some prime schumacher pleasse stop with the screaming orgasm sounds my dad thinks im watching porn where can i play the offical f1 cars in mp f1 20 20 second time penalty for getting rammed i just wanna see what multiplayer would look like with more realistic damage such that you cant just rub tire walls indiscriminately because welp dead suspension youre should do f12019exe rhythms is not a dirty driver 350 i was crying these guy think the f in f1 stands for forza 038 well i guess you cant change other online drivers but you can avoid them by playing against those you actually know because they wont crash into you like idiots myb icontrast these idiots are just maldonado 20 me icontrast trust me i have played this game online for 500 hours trust me i know those fucktards in monaco better know what to do after that crash could you please stop cutting in these team radio clips how slow was the first guy that you were lapping him every two laps these salty 12 year old players are giving me headache so happy that i dont have this game d when you play the f1 2019 multiplayer the thumbnail said it all i feel naughty just watching that its like a train wreck you cant turn away from how is that enjoyable to drive though and they said forza was bad lmao still is so i see i contrast is league racing and all but where is another video like this anyone know 020 this is a jojo referance giornos piano with 345 angry muda noices i watch rhythems too and hes very good so good luck i wonder where did you even get that special edition i subscribed for you are you on ps4 or xbox whats the beat called at 834 anyone know sorry but these sound and video effects are just unfunny it makes th video so hard to watch your editing is fucking annoying i cant watch this video for longer than 1 minute what track are we on ahaha i would have said pretty sure singapore if bad grammar dont comment please i wish i could have f1 2019 i only got 2018 keep up the good dirty driver exposure content more incidents than mario kart 845 it is wednesday my dudes here jimmy thats why i dont play online why f1 2019 it s f1 2018 ive fell out with this codedisaster game so i switched to gran turismo and its amazing sub to rhythms and abb formula e its because ps4 players are trash at f1 games sergio isnt overrated v god damn gringos people like exalted should be banned for life hands down the worse multiplayer racing game unless you got a few buddies to race with public lobbies are an absolute joke good thing the ai is pretty fun this year when properly tweaked first 8 seconds i died already miss these videos this video should have 1 million views where my filthy frank fans at not sure if f1 or wreckfest f1 2018 is better then 2019 change my opinion with a like fr this is so cringe sometimes cringe 1138 felipe baby stay cool trainwreck of electro swing at the start i ve been crashed out by some of these people honestly so everyone racing on multiplayer is either a dickhead or crap at driving and the rules done work and everyone glitches everywhere 022 exactly why i dont play multiplayer may i ask for the song 1053 f1 online is the definition of drive to survivexd who is better rythms or icontrast aaaand thats the end of my story jesus you edit like an autistic child every 5 seconds there must be a sound effect for comedic effect wouldnt be surprised if your main demographic was between the ages of 8 to 12 why is the connection always so bad wtf is this f1 or wreckfest im not sure after this video 002 ea sports intro but it was only e they should make it so people like this get banned and can only play against bots lmfao love the music choice to start with train wreck of electroswing from a hat in time by plasma3d thats worse that silvers in csgo kinda shitheads thinking theyre playing bumper cars stupid people 004 nice intro creator unsympathischtv and this is the reason for not buying this shit game again of course its an australian behind this editing i just got f1 2018 today because i couldnt find f1 2019 anywhere how long did it take to make this video why do you still continue playing this game online d man how those dumbasses dont get banned in multiplayer mode its clearly they dont give a fuck about race fuckin hit sound please dont use this so loud stop right there criminal scum i bursted out of laughter when sainz knocked down lando somebody link the sound effect at 033034 do gta ina but shell karma is a bitch aint it dq was probably the most just ive ever seen p rhythmf1 its a f1 youtuber player 1 wants to race everybody else huh i think the fuck not whats wrong with you this is a game of ram forza prepatch yes yes yes yes yes player 1 wants to race everybody else huh i think the fuck not whats wrong with you this is a game of ram forza prepatch yes yes yes yes yes player 1 wants to race everybody else huh i think the fuck not whats wrong with you this is a game of ram forza prepatch yes yes yes yes yes you see i was like nothing is gonna be wrong with the game but you know players i dont even know whats happening in most of this video f1 online looks toxic man wow this why i hate the game at time some people think its ok to bump into some one car i feel like cuz its ea everyone that plays it is playing it cuz they play madden nba or fifa and dont give a damn about f1 they should have the actually f1 drivers play a round online with these players what is the mission from those guys playing forza horizon drifting and then you see a f1 from the distance most of your videos are just bs playing on foreign servers so of course its going to lag people into you 338 i was not expecting a jojo reference but i am pleased this video us pure gold hears jojo music ah i see you are a man of culture as well s u c c what track are we on me i thought americans said they know everything i stopped playing pvp back in f12017 now 19 i just do campaign and time trials that backmarker who kept crashing into you should be banned from the game like wtf is that he tried to ram you on purposed but thank god he was diaqualified what tracks 950 im fast as fuck booiiiii the editing on this video is perfect whenever someone tells me that you cant edit a video too much ill show him this annoying thing sry bro f1 in a meme what is this a collection of dated memes neil cicierega i see you too are a man of culture 1029 like for the king dedede theme xddd aw poor charles hes so hard on himself they should just copy the way fh4 does there ranked races ghost intentional bumps and slowdown people that ram into walls f1 sure it aint bc1 bumper cars 1 thats not how copyright works what this is bumper cars but safety is from a foreign land i got better races out of the old forza horizon 4 multiplayer americans proving that they can only do american motorsport ill have you know im subbed to both you and rhymes that was stresful i get agression attacks watching the ramming assholes playing this game f1 games in a nutshell damn are these players are bunch of cancerous thats why i dont fucking play this fucking game in online i just fucking wanted to overtake blue flag one time when i was on 1st place got pole on qual and this fucker crashed me into the fucking wall i had to end the fucking race i just dont wanna get online experience in racing games anymore you want a race drive the league the lobby is for retards doing bumper cars vs torpedos these races need to be on simulation damage 0206 wow the game is so realistic now this is the thing i hate about all car games or racing games with online lobbies are always full of these type of people that just kill the fun gta 5 online is better and they toxic there too anyone know the song that starts at 747 rhythms and you no way i want to see you on f1 esport ahahahahah i honestly dont see what dirty drivers see fun or amusing in hitting other drivers rather than racing cleanly which provides a more fun experience for everyone f1 online racing is strait up the cousin of forza motorsport online races im subscribed long time ago to rythms and i love his chanel ye no dont play f1 online its cancer what amaze me is that everytime you get hit by someone in online you get a penalty i hate online i dont understand why people who wants to play destruction derby buy f1 2019 a racing simulator its impossible to get good ratings in this game i just want to race like a pro but i cant playing on gaystation what you expect lol get a xbox or a pc upgrade mate this video makes us americans look bad but tbh we totally deserve it first thing a youtuber does in practice mode knock out the front wing and try to race 3 laps without it now this is starting to look more like a new form of cyberbullying except it is tremendously hilarious what do you get if you buy the anniversary or legends edition very simple online interactions there are no abilities to turn off damage that will stop the bullshit funny moments but way to many deadunrelated memes this is what you pay 40 a month for in f1 2019 sr b gts sr m for mariannes void there is no racing game with worse driver than in f1 d muricans knowledge good as always rofl so nothing changed since last game you sound bank is insane dude want it this is exactly why i dont play online like for the use of joseph joestar and overdrive lol whats the point of pole position if people dont even try to brake for turn 1 its so frustrating to watch because this is literally every ranked race what the fuck is wrong with these people 056 that was actually your mistake there was plenty of space on the right the races i play in gt sport are pretty fair if you check my last vid you can see can i make you thumbnails pls have you watched videos of the german channel unsympathischtv lately thats actually true tho this kind of players are a great racing games tumor f1 just not for american americannnnn so fucking true lmao that is ps4 in a nutshell go to pc to play with the real pros love your vids there quality i like all your content thanks for sharing also

did anyone notice that at the bottom of the description the game it said he is playing is 2018 not 2019 020 035 this is fine even forza horizon is better ghosting certainly helped why do fucker like that bother playing go buy a fucking demolition derby game how can i play with you can you make a league with your subs and with rhythms those dirty drivers are dumb autism retardsiam allowed to say that because iam an autism but i can better think than the rest of people like me this sums up career mode races for me to defend i have to bash shits out the race seems like a lot of fun cough isnt all your vids about dirty f1 drivers nutshells for the song at 1053 its carpenter brut roller mobster telling people you better subscribe wont make them subscribe just saying dude i had to laugh so hard great video this is why league races exist legit f1 ceeday intro from unsympathischtv giving you a thumbs down for the shitty sound effects and that shitty self promotion in the middle of the vid do it at the start or the end or dont bother doing it at all in what a fucking server arriva you so many low connections i have crippling wing damage hahahhaahhaah they need to add a thing where it detects rammers not breaking and they become ghosted or some shit samir youre breaking the car the hitting sound effect is very annoying how have they not fixed lapped cars waiting to take you out lapped cars should automatically be ghosted online this exact video is why i dont play f1 online lobbies this game is fucking garbage almost as good as the forza lobbies people buy a racing game also people do this fucking shit tired of that exalted then skip to 322 you are supposed to go slower if its raining otherwise you are cheating 1246 at least this looks like it was your fault in the whole video d whats the name of the last song it sounds very sega genesisy id love to race you they should just make an infinite ghost button because this is ultra worse than last year 603 you know how he says were all peasants well i thought that was only him this one was awesome multiplayer is useless these days not worth playing at all in any game gta online racing is worst but this one is you know a bloke is s man of culture when they use a billy maze meme the online mode is actually unplayable due to players inability to play properly f1 online in a nutshell pile up in turn one 135 is your own fault i hope you read this but youre the reason why i want to do these kind of videos not stealing content or anything but this inspired me to strive for this kind of editing thats why you play with damage on and do 25 people that use voice chat in races are actual pedos thats why i simply switched to play career with expert ai if you ever think your life sucks then go play f1 2019 random lobby on monte carlo i dont understand why people race on public lobbies this is not a f1 race this is a wreckfast race playing against bots are much more fair and fun imo of course they still cant get the fucking ghosting right let this game rot in hell you bounce around and get hit by other drivers yet they are un affected this szenes make a little bit aggressiv i think wich ideot play this game online everyone i hate the online they will never change it me i love that undertale music xdxdxd watching this just makes me triggered and my anxiety levels just increase that guy with the blue flags thats ridiculous can we change the name of formula 1 online to idiots who think f1 is just bumpercars driving i tink everyone should be playing mario kart really 040 anybody know where that sound bit came from its too hilarious xd people in ranked actually try to race clean keep it up i really enjoy these my opinion icontrast is way to underrated rhythmsf1 is back guys sometimes i wish a truck would drive over dirty drivers in real life after pretending to be tiametmarduk for one day icontrast is back and icongratulate you 330 i think ericsson hit us this is why i dont have online mission failed well go next time the intro is from a german youtuber icontrast using undertale and deltarune musics now nice i have crippling w i n g d a m a g e ive been having a much better experience this year than 2018 once i got to golds im consistently racing fast guys who are pretty clean wellas clean as a 5 lap race can be i guess why do you get demonatised love it you used my stupid clip a bit much contact for a nocontact sport dont you think can we hire ghost adventures there ghosting everywhere xd you make really enjoyable content you relly deserved to make a video for tiametmarduk i crashed my computer while watching this i h a v e c r i p p l i n g w i n g d a m a g e well done codemasters on yet again a ridiculously faulty online makes me ashamed to be a beta tester it really does on a brighter note career mode is really good the intro warrants a 5second penalty for making me laugh only a real man can have the confidence to put his own mistakes in the video first punch out now kirby lol lol just play on oceania lmao only about 5 people in each race so minimal chaos love the memes keep it up every race i go in i get taken out in the first corner like people cant drive with people near them maybe ive been really lucky but ive been racing for the past two weeks and i havent had a single race with imbecilic racers everyones been courteous leaving spaces actually braking etc racing incidents have happened but nothing intentional or outside the spectrum of competitive racing it was ericssons fault icontrastgets past rammer rammerbut waittheres more pro tip you cant copyright someone because they recorded you in voice chat in a game thats not just f1 thats literally every racing game online i really didnt want this video to end d to be fair at 058 you should have given him space and kept to the right of the track he was in your blindspot and you were squeezing him against the grass haas in real life 1312 100 the legend of exaltednewzzz timmats the best driver in the world good thing i never bought this game after few years of seeing the same shit hi im goldi thank you for the viedeo 207 vettel complains for 2 laps continuously race engineer copy that thats actually pretty acurate only the keep your head down is missing lol bruh at 826 you should ve done the tank you radio from hulkenberg haha that exalted dude so annoying i really wished the game could banned players who fucked up the races here we go again idiots on the road 2019 worse than 2018 this video is full funny when you accidentally crash into someone who is talking on game chat guess ill die can confirm you get punted in multiplayer faster than star platinums oras when you find a nondirty online lobby dont do that dont give me hope finally icontrast ive been waiting a long time for this bumper cars 2019 one of our racers ytc gaming heinzthe lmao looks like most of the shit drivers migrated to f1 2019 sooner than the good clean drivers thats a lot of damage someone alert the fia yeah well this sums up why i dont like the f1 games absolute shitshow i will stick to my asseto corsa thank you very much 1035 do the grosjean i dont know how to react so ill just say thats a lot of damage i ask me why everybody else has such a bad connection do you connect to other server regions on purpose d wow f1 2019 is the same as 18 great job codemasters yeah i get to watch you race and put tons of memes in there some of my favorite things im not surprised that by searching dirty drivers the first 3 results are f1 gameplays of all the things i cant believe someone is unable to tell between china and russia icontrast what camera settings at 020 the williams please thel it me i hate online f1 races so muchi like gran turismo online more icontrast what camera settings at the williams whats name of song 1100 in a nutshellshit game too many bugs and glitches still gearbox glitch ai way too fast traction zones online sucks cause dirty drivers never getting penalties competition points are bullshit oo icontrast is spoon gwhat the ghell juan2004532 2019 casual grosjean reference at 1038 making backmarkers ghost would solve a whole lotta problems new game old problems i dont agree with you play ranking games if you have s rank there are thinking players somewhere theres a game in this bug i love the guy who sad karma at the end of the video every online ranked lobby austria no friendscuz nobody can join dude your more unlucky than me i didnt know that was even possible damn that blue flag hurts my eyes yoi did what grojeasn should of did in spain some of the worst driving ive ever seen in sim world and in real life and im originally from nyc and now live fl where no one knows how to drive 905 i got that reference lmao man what is the name of the meme at 1146 i searched boom in the search bar and i dont saw this meme missed you this video made me laugh quite badly nobody f1 2019 dirty drivers more dirty ever codemasters never change 338 this is a battle of titans this sounds nice never clicked on anything so quickly i have the gamen since day 2 and i still didnt drive an f1 car yet all im doing is f2 its a shame there isnt f2 online but i need to start online i see the chaos is still there and thats fun dirty drivers everywhere amazing welcome to america ive just started help and support channel bold of you to assume i didnt record those races how do you only have 22k i like it and again appear rhythmsf1 is there a reporting system what are your camera settings and nice vid btw ripturnone such people deserve a painful death thats worse than gta online racing i have 500 hours i know finally youre not a very well multi good player 903 i have crippling wing damage that penalty in the beginning was the right choice of the stewards i mean you cant just drift into someone 1155 i remember seeing that in front p being done with f1 2018 online racing f1 2019 online racing exist aw shit here we go again the first one is a redbull at silverstone after being hit by a german torpedo hes back greetings from poland i really missed you and your videos can you do a video on smooth wheel racing tips im all over the show compared to other ones using a wheel we need more f1 2019 tips videos just by looking at the thumbnail this is going to be hilarious thisll air tomorrow on my birthday welcome back dirty drivers lucasfilm thx and ea ee eeeeee its in the eeeeeee at the beginning ah shit here we go again premiers in 19 hours 053 you are both driver and pit crew in toro rosso talk about cutting costs 1003 almost exactly what kvyat did to perez at austin a toro rosso no less where is part 63 and part 64 good to see the qualifying glitch is less prominent how does a driver do a road to glory when they were literally fighting for the title last season simply kmag is the best underrated f1 driver what is the song at the end kmag is gonna win the championship gaslys performance inversely proportional to his car performance once again 2222 how can kevin have 45 points after 2 races has he got 20 points from australia tf wait never mind he had probebly 2 fastest laps ben i could have chosen mercedes me so you didnt get fired by ferrari really enjoying this road to glory seasons keep it up nice to see you keeping up the last lap fanatics in this season cant wait for the next episode can you take this opportunity to see how many engines you can take during the season see if there is a limit tiametmarduk atleast can you switch to a little faster cars i thought you qualified ahead of grosjean well for 2 races in a row thats a bad strategy call from you ben might be worth actually using the recommended strategy from now on its incredible that one of the few drivers that havent change of team or have been kick of f1 is stroll 230 is that matthew working for renault i just realised that renault a french team has 2 french drivers did anyone else see the double pitstop from toro rosso although you guys sound alike but how are you so much better than aarava seeing ben in toro roso is so depressing the french team renault has 2 french drivers ironic 0950 you are so unsportsmanlike complete joke of a racer 2017 tiametmarduk i dont know what that was 2018 also tiametmarduk but that was a clear brake check 2017 do you know what that was that was a smoothhhh operatoorrr smoothhhh operatoorrr sainz approved idk if this is correct but after watching 3 seasons of career mode at the end of every season the structure of the constructors remains as it was at the very start of season 1 but the teams are re arranged for example toro rosso is a fair way off the pace like williams was but just re arranged whats the song at the end called me whenever i get near ai on project cars last time i was this late you were still at ferrari i wish i was this good but im a bit in this game and we lost our front wing our race is over benjamin daly 2012 we lost our front wingben daly 2019 really didnt changed that much from 7 years ago put more ads in your vids ya shill devon is the goat 903 you shouldve the helmet is dope pls in f1 2020 or 2019 can you go to mercedes you havent gone to mercedes in 3 years that is 540 days 642 how can you say it is cold but your in the desert in bahrain and the temperature is mostly 90 degrees in the desert not if you will start almost last is it practical to put new components in the next 2 or 3 races i think because your pushing for pace being on a softer tyre may not be a strong point for you i think u could of kept with the pack on hards because of drs hi ben can you give me some tips about how to manage your engine parts because i never do practice thinking ill have to get new engines and give my self some penalty world champion2nd in the championshipto then the worst team and the back of the grid realism has left the building russell was like welcome to britain matey carlsberg fosters gday mate mercedes im gonna do whats called a pro gamer move goes to back of the grid williams welcome to the club toto toto iconic desk slam just go back to formula 2 series im annoyed he didnt join mercedes given how hamilton took his team and weber butler are on big teams that helmet is killing my ocd why do you sound so unhappy and unmotivated why dont you start on the medium tyre you can got to the soft tyre at the end of the race then 1920 checks title of the video did i miss anything 1940 hold my beer your new helmet design is superb what was the song in the outro the only thing i like about devon is his helmet you really fck it up in the last 8 laps how do you see your speed trap nowadays you can only adjust differential front wing or brake bias now isnt that right renault this career is the most wrong thing to ever happen kmag winning said enough its time for short qualifying because of the glitch anybody else hate this team change who else read that title with sebs voice tricky race at bahrain but you did your best since when is there drs after turn 3 can someone explain his brakes pedal wasnt calibrated properly nicebut its not kiviyatits kvyat 036 dont forget australia gp with hrt in 2011 or the hungarian with the williams only legends remember go to merc in the next or 5th season money on monaco win whoud you go for mercs at the last 23 seasons of career mode to made a road to glory with em the puncture didnt change anything lol you bottled it again its george rusell for good measure whats the best setup in the rain anyone you can use one brand new engine every race from now i imagine that might close the gap a little bit you could drop the difficulty a little just until you can get a more competitive car why not start on hards and go to softs for the second stint that was just a natural move from a mercedes hey he brake checked me what the is going on i reckon hes going to bring in amazing performances that will promote him to red bull inevitably making him lucass teammate 647 kimi had the drink but then why you join toro rosso instead mercedes when you said on video well i was getting more into this one and then fail and i felt miserable i suppose it can only improve normally i didnt watched the highlights at the end of the video but with the music now damn its so good why would they even fire driver who finished 2nd and was one of the best last season why wouldnt anyone get such driver bens videos get more likes than views because subscribers already liking before even watching ai is apsolutely ridiculousthey are just moving out of the way in every corner every yeareveryone praising them when new game come outthis year they are much more agressivemuch better then last year game bullshitsame game every year with better graphics team performance orderwhen you start the game is just all over the place but this year you get to paid more for 2 extra drivers legend edition on modern tracks until you stop paying for every crap they serve youand you keep praising the game every yearnothing will change and why would they change it when they can make money every year on the same game whats the point of doing career mode like this make the ultimate weight redi upgrade less overundersteer 647 kimi would never do that ben i really hope you will read this message ill try to keep it as short as i can i keep trying to understand why you constantly feel the need to start in the shittiest conditions possible you already tortured yourself at renault in f1 2019 im not even gonna count your other roads to glory cause im watching your videos since f1 2016 and its painful you call it road to glory but when you reach the stage where you can win a wc you switch to other shitty team so its much more a road than glory this season was the perfect opportunity to show us that you can beat lh in the same car judging by how last season ended you cant or at least its not easy how about you do a max verstappen type of career start from a weak team promote after 56 races and then go to a ferrari mercedes redbull and just smash the field 15 wins a season for 3 seasons do you think its easy to do such a challenge its just not realistic for a 1 time wc and once runner up to go to t do u comontate when u race or do it after i think doing it while racing will feel like its live love the vids keep it up ben cant wait for the next one mate your voice is so depressed that it seems ure so not looking forward to the race lol just curious when will you start league racing again clicked faster than your toro rosso im a ferrari fan but i hope mercedes or redbull give you a contract to fight of the top teams sorry but this is bs why go to ferrari build them up and then leave after just one season thats one sweaty aussie ben are you going to do any league racing always loved a watching those and it made me start to compete in some leagues as well i think this has been asked a lot but is youtuber championship making a return in this or next game definitely missed it so much 637 strange close 640 everybody has the same height ben i think because kmag still has the haas helmetno pun intended they should have a default helmet for each team for if they swap teams but if its the original team they should have their natural helmet u replaced albon in f2 and you replaced him in f1 do league racing not career no one watches it a feeling of vettel in the title unlucky race today but keep up the fight mate he was just calibrating his brakes ben you will still win this championship believe oh henlo early birds not first i guess he was trying to calibrate his brakes edit 504 lukas did a 123 i am seeing that lap about 3 seconds faster than the most notorious corner cutter in the history of f1 no one absolutely no one literally not a single soul youtube 0 views 13 likes please more 6 time world champion in a ferrari battles hard against a toro rosso only in f1 2019 how is this guy so bad and so popular the title is such a click bait 200 iq nope zero iq from the ai so bad how the ai reacts to the blue flag like that from leclerc ridicilous just lift of a bit lol you are in a race do not park your car turn 1 easnt that hard for tires here just get a smooth line also i believe this year in my season i did a 2 stop as well i do that more often kinda always when the projected times are within a few seconds allows you to punch so much more and make up time so easily that lines of rbr and alfa lol in developing 0757 what a joke that you even thought about not giving at least one of those places back and then u crash into sainz because why not you are so unsportsmanlike man ben nico roseberg exploitment everywhere nico rosberg na that was for hamiltons career ben can you do a challenge where you use only lean mixture with no ers against 0 ai awesome race and vid btw i made you another montage just this time its only a tiametmarduk montage and its on my channel so if you could check it out again i say would really appreciate it dude 74 episodes in and i am still watching amazing seires last lap the tyres are dead bono seeing bens career with toro rosso rn is like looking at williams for the last 2 seasons gaps reducing but nevertheless still at the back of the grid where is f2 yeah need more career mode really enjoy it cheers did anyone else see xmattyg at the back of the red bull garage at the end how can i not be enjoying the daly content hahahahahaha you do realize this guy is taking content from aavarva he is the original youtube from this gameplay loving daily uploads mate keep up the career mode tho you absolutely destroyed those ferraris last season poor lewis and devon make more career mode imagine if mercedes only have 1 point this is getting pretty boring 1235 grosjean and bottas incident obviously ive missed career mode but i think your other uploads have been great 753 the fuck was that ben that was frickin illegal but u are all the same with aarava you cant lose can you no you cant like a roller coaster round and around are you sure you dont mean up and down side to side finaly whats the hold up man is ben dalys career over could u please share ur camera settings in f1 it looks awesome if you stop this career mode i fly around the world ring at every house find you and upload it by myself can you get promoted to red bull itd be fun to see you go for the championship again please keep the series until f1 2020 i watch every episode and it is intense and fun to watch ben dont speed time through qualifying the ai seem to set lightning times when time is sped up ben your career isnt ending its aarava career that has ended in the williams a toro rosso vs hamilton drag race to the finish seems familiar except its not for p2 this time but rather p12 lol when you said after your pitstop that the guys with the hard tyres will only go faster as the race goes on no its you with your old soft that will go slower does anyone know if the hori apex racing wheel supports f1 2019 on steering mode thank you im on my 7th season and the 6th was the first time i could properly challenge for the title and then i moved to a top team who became backmarkers after regulation changes and im loving how much im getting out of this career mode on this game get your ride height up you are scraping way too much ive been waiting for long time to watch this episode mate youve gained under 1k subs youre at 399 for at least 1 week now youre under 399 you did manage to fuck it up somehow promote to redbull please started to get boring will u do league racing again i enjoyed watching that the toro rosso is not the bottom car why is ben so slow he needs to up his game yo this aint ben the is a robot talking why do you breat so havy around 400 pls do more career mode everyone loves it and you almost nevere upload it 2051 is that aarava good race at germany 38th comment i would love to see the rest of the f2 career mode please iq scores can only go to 130 tho finally carrer again d 425 youre going up and down side to side like a rollercoaster if im not wrong grid 2 background music love it at least red bull isnt going to become any faster and it also seems like alpha romeo has maxed its upgrades that rd chartthis car is shocking you should start focusing at career mode let the athers games to wait 1847 thats what she said your are really good men continue now you all can shut up about ben avoiding career tiametmarduk you should do a camera settings video and your helmet design also i think your a great driver and you should be a formula 1 esports player 627 you really went there didnt you hehehehe if vettel was watching this video blue flag song intensifies early squad first to be the 157th view i was the only one a minute ago distant

game hasnt updated yet wtf i still dont have the update on xbox like wtf i want to change my multiplayer car chassis yay no transfers d it seems like codemasters actually listens to their audience and i know it still isnt perfect but its better than they just release a game maybe a release a patch or two to fight the bugs and thats it i really hope for the coming years codemasters keep the licence and they can build on what they have created and how long the pilots will ride with their old helmets after changing teams im on xbox n the patch is not here for me love your videos and content all of it but f me you talk way too fast bro take a breath how can make a good start while flooring gas pedal but rich energy is still in haas drs third zone marina bay drs third zone mexico city haas sponsorship withdrawal safety car entry at the right times correction of times when eliminated in q1 when qualifying ends times are very high in q3 and normally done for cars that are slower with this new update the game keeps crashing after every session still no car updates sheesh anyone on xbox that knows when this patch will launch on the xbox stop rushing your outro bro just take a few more seconds to speak properly in f1 2016 they swapped verstappen and kvyat but i think that was already in the game when it released brilliant patch now the game crashes even during races xbox hasnt got this update yet ree lots of changes idc i was waiting for this patch ima go get the game now it is already on ps4 lol what are your camera settings it looks realy good gasly wow im so excited to be in redbull a few months later gasly noooo 133 what are you on about anyone with basic knowledge of how code works would be able to figure out how to set the seat switch between gasly and albon mid season like it happened in real life codemasters probably thought that it wasnt necessary wish they updated the f1 car skins they still need to fix the safty car mine has not updated yet new haas livery new mclaren livery car performance upgrade safty car fix this a troll or at 042 i see racing point are there more safety cars now they take too long for the patches man smh 0042 ah the accidental reveal of arravs seat for his new season if that wasnt the only offer im dissapointed whens it coming out on x box when will it be on console finally but in wet conditions i think the ia is still op my starts are good because i do the formation lap im definitely getting that pumpkin helmet you do know you need to have your throttle at the optimal point instead of just flooring it for the starts aarava do a realism mod with the pumpkin helmet yes aa and pg but no safety car fix what about the safetycarlogic its a step forward still could be more problems that they need to fix surprised they didnt do anything to f2 cars did they really nail it first time round i am waiting for the patch to come out on xbox question how do you start an f1 career without f2 the new starts seem finally balanced pleeeeaaaaase fix the sc codies then im completely fine spoileralert next season he will drive in a racing point car look at 042 we also got it today on console just a heads up for your pc gets it first thing im pretty sure console got 110 first aswell i remember playing on 110 when you were on 105 is the safety car fixed racing point bois still waiting on them to allow bite point clutch adjustment with fanatec advanced paddles make the how many times i can get fired video again with this new patch thank you fucking finally why you complain about your bad starts when you dont even bother do them properly it even says reach optimal rpm optimal rpm is around 1030011500 and you just floor it down 12200 rip gasly did they made the 3rd drs zone to singapore and mexico what happens if u get fired from every single team then video idea arrav is hubert still in the game 042 racing point career for ps4 u all gys playing patch i am shit stuck in downloading the game could anyone do a video on how to download f1 2019 have they added drs to singapore yet thanks for test start footage looking forward to console release wait i have version 112 for ps4 but not have that version im czech the gasly and albon swap will not affect my career but they will appear using their new helmets have they fixed the front wheel size they are way to big good video this patch is really good btw i made yesterday my first video and it would be good if you came and say what you think about it i thought they changed red bull mirrors as well but didnt 0042 racing point career looking forward to it lmao have they fixxed the speed of weber wish they updated racing points new wing though its on ps4 now but the rich energy is still on the car lol so annoying they have stopped adding aero updates some cars are still on their australia spec i read racing point f1 team im confused 042 redo the how often you can get fired video sadly no chance to the safty car yes we can chose teammates yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees waited so long for this and once again aarav leaks a season move time to race in pink 115 is better than 110 its out in ps4 why didnt they change all liveries this albons visor is just its out also on ps4 i though the sc glitch was gonna be fixxed this game was already the best f1 game in a long time and its really cool that it keeps getting better and better do a formula nascar championship with safety cars if this comment gets 500 likes it has to be done another game idea is when u retire from f1 u should hv the choice to go to fe oof the update for console is out gotta go fast in my career save kvyat replaced me at red bull and i replaced gasly before they protec they attac but most importantly they put gasly bac redo can you get fired with this new patch did they update the liveries finally lol 1100 would be an interesting visor cam have they fixed the weber effect already im just 5 races in should i start a new career career racing point i liked that tou couldnt choose your teammate cause in real life you dont choose your teammate when is the update for ps4 we deffinetly need the 90 years suit and gloves 27th suprised they havent removed rich energy from haas more fired experiments please i can get good starts in classic and with the f2 cars but im horrific with the 2019 f1 cars the starts werent op the player should have reached optimal rpm ah yes pierre galsy not to be mistaken with pierre gasly edit he fixed it i went from 3 to 1 at the start finally good starts talking about the new patch when my game keeps crashing every time i open it hello safety car my old friend ill finally see you again finally only took two months to swap albon and gasly wait i checked like 1 week ago and it was 112 when you beat

red bulls both from haas both alfas i think you should get into league racing who else thinks this last time i was this early adam lz and nicole were still happily married like how ben said we need to have a chat im pretty sure nothing will change ngl lukas weber kinda ruined the career mode dude is just way too op this series is the bright light in the dismal reality of life gotta love the singapore british gp the last few high speed tracks ive noticed you seem to be under powered compared to the ai the last few high speed tracks ive noticed you seem to be under powered compared to the ai i dont care if toro rosso isnt the slowest car on the grid your performance is still well below all the other teams and yes that graph doesnt tell a full story but it tells enough about the story that youre stuck as a backmarker team and kvyats like dont get mad at me our car sucks not me ben the reason the game never you to mediums at the start is because the second strategy was selected not the one you were editing i made that mistake the other day without realising keep that attitude up they will replace you with pierre gasly at least he scored a podium you scored 12th with a brand new engine you know whats really weird you were having slow laps all throughout the second half and the final lap was your fastest when you said you felt like you were lacking something powerwise i believe it had to do with your ers deployment a lot of the time you were running at 25 capacity or less and the battery derates in power when you get that low i started p3 my race leader had a 10 position penalty mexico weridly ben could u put a link to the intro song u use in the comments pls we want daily career mode uploads when ben forgot he was doing an f2 career mode how can you put sponsor on your helmet time for a switch to racing point will the f2 career come back someday i would like that its the same problem im facing aswell kvyat is barely scoring points for the team in my career racing point is the fastest car and i am at redbull do you have the difficulty at 110 then almost 400k subs before 2020 come on ben you can do this good video man i feel like production value is always the highest in your videos compared to other youtubers thanks for making entertainment for us u still have the worst car on the grid so its not kvyats fault d is kvyats career over tiametmarduk could you add anywhere your every track car settings its deflating to see that engine power means everything lately what happened to race results being about the driver and skill the disslikes are kyvat fans xd silverstone is a high tyre deg circuit lewis sets fastest lap on worn hard tyres on the last lap in real life race so ur gonna beat a ferrari with a ford 1633 the red bull strategists are looking at the monaco gp singapore grand prix riccardo in racing point hurts me in my meow meow sundays and formula one so nostalgic watching proper racing on here real racing and skill from big ben compared to the real life turd procession which is easily the worst era of formula one ever amazing video like always keep up the great work last time i was this early youtube rewind was good last time i was this early jules bianchi was still alive what difficulty is this that toro rosso has a gp2 engine if kvyat goes i will jump of a cliff no u need to be fired mega happy that it didnt take a week this time if i had it my way there would be an episode a day ben you have me lured in hey ben you really should bring f1 2006 back one of the best series on your channel at the end the only thing that interests me for the top is which driver is gonna be p3 yay awesome video hay ho q3 glitch needs to be fixed hhamilton moving to tororosso toro rosso bottom of the performance index why is kyvat so slow 357 like bro you have the worse c r on the grid and want the ai to score points wtfff its like asking williams to score points regularly you have to up the difficulty you should be fignthing for p15p16 p13 in qualifying with this car is not normal you make amazing videos a big fan from india cheers i think u meant torpedo you need to turn up the difficulty ben titles kyvat needs to stop arrava titles my engine blew up mid race because i drove to fast no spoiler alert last time i was this earlymaldonado was still crashing in f1 title of the video should be f1 2019 career mode part 73 kvyat needs to be fired again last time i was this early schumacher won his 7th title wow did not expect that do you record this before you make commentary just wondering cuz if i remember in one of your career modes you kinda clapped while you were racing for some reason bens downforce isnt calibrated torpedotitle wow did not expect that petition to bring back f1 youtuber championship back last time i was this early marussia still had their virginity first cant believe you arent black flag for that so dangerous where is part 63 gotta say ferrari kinda screwed over ben they bring hamilton onto the team on the later half of the seasonliterally throwing a wrench into his championship fight and then they fire himbecause he failed to win the championship well youll show them when you bring toro rosso to the front of the field love the content keep up the great work road to glory put this video in the career mode playlist hey ben this episode is not in the career mode playlist it jumps from the finale to abu dhabi i dont get how butler is still in f1 3 seasons of no wins a couple poduoms and like 1 pole in a red bull trash driver still same things no one absolutely no one tiametmarduk best team in formula 1 to worst team how to make a good first impression on a new team p ben this episode is not in the f1 2019 playlist s4 starts with the bahrain gp i get going for a slower nondominant car but the worst team on the grid ben what were you thinking has me worried you will get bored and give up on f1 2019 if you know your just slow put the medium tyre on always qualifying is hopeless for you thumbs up for choosing toro rosso please stay there because the dirty fight in the lower midfield is sometimes more entertaining than the fight at the front finnally toro ben has signed with toyota oh wait nice to see kvyat put you out of your misery i couldnt stand to watch not going in for softs hell even a fresh pack of inters would be better meanwhile in my career mode toro rosso is a front row team weird you should have take red bull ben and staying out way too long name a better duo come on another team change what about us perfectionists that want to see a car that is better than all the other teams being honest grosjeans ai isnt great yes i know he does some silly things in reallife but he shouldnt sometimes be like a second off me this series became so unrealistic that im not gonna watch it anymore sry ben and good luck ben fails to qualify jeff well done good race ben you may think that this was a real struggle of a race for you in the backmarker car but i promise you that the long grind from the bottom up will be worth it in the long run tom97 is already working his way up the order in his career mode with williams at the moment all you need to do is achieve the team goals drive to the best of your ability on track and stay out of any ai drama or anything like that sometimes its more surviving the race when things get chaotic like at monaco or japan where the ai crash a lot best of luck this season and i bet the results will come soon nice to see your blow in half way through a season and win the title teammate hamilton had your back too yeah cheers lewisby the way i always thought your hair and your earrings made you look like a ponce ben is that map of the track in the bottom left corner an option that even i can turn it on or is it a mod honestly this strategy of holding the inters for 80 of the race until 100 deg just to put softs at the end of the race rarely pays off and you insist on it can someone help me plz im with ferrari and in my 1st season iv got good set ups well there ok i got them from internet cus im not that good when it comes to setting up my own anyway i seem to be sliding all over the place its like im on ice and its really annoying i do rnd and that dont seem to help it seem to be on every track so if you can help me please do im on ps4 and psn is curly2112 im even willing to do request to watch and the shareing thing lol so someone plz plz plz help wow ben substituting ferrari for a much slower team thats a new one both ferrari and mercedes have higher cealings 210 renault allmost last they diped down since ypu became champion with them so red bull next emma kickstarting vettel ricciardo and sainz me where is verstappen emma hey mate consider buying a new micro correction its shatter 3 im so use to hearing davidae s voice lol i thought he maxed out the ferrari danyl had nothing to do with that abysmal track blocking you told force india do 100 race at monaco atleast we now have proof for why kvyat is called the torpedo as soon as u start a season with a wet race i do the sqme its looks like youre in alpha tauri now i feel like ferrari management screwed you over the last season love the career you doin its very cool yesssss thank you so much for continuing this series benny boy and were back safety car no safety car should of come out after your teamate hit you lol big mistake for not going into the pits a lot sooner you could have boxt like 1 or 2 laps earlier on the dry tires its weird to see ricciardo in pink his helmet is literally pink tho honestly you should have just stayed in renault i think ben will go red bull in mid season start a new season ben foreshadowing a red bull promotion maybe halfway into the season to be with weber why the hell do you have 438 laps left of fuel left wtf use the fuel you call this career mode 50 race distance and outside cockpit view thats just intense arcade driving i want to see you doing 100 race distance and inside cockpit view instead at laaaast so happy to see a new season please change team asap this was painful to watch its china s1 all over again why not take some new components whilst youre qualifying speed is lacking im still not over you bottling the s3 finale p i was hoping you were going to go to toro roso or merc thanks this will be a good season this is what i waited for how come you got kicked out ben you might as well take this opportunity to take loads of new engine parts which will help you eventually in the second half of the season youll end up very low down in the field at least for the first few races anyways i love your thumbnails they are very beautifull i was saying hed do mclaren but hmmm why toro rosso we now have depressed ben love the new season ben keep up the great career mode episodes my dude do mid season switch to red bull just like alex albon irl please finally ive been waiting for another season of f1 good to see you brought it back keep up the f2 series tho also enjoying that as well rip daly i finished last place jeff the engineer awesome that is a great result for the team me huh bout time mclaren is consistent man restart the save and do road to glory with williams gets second in championship due to a glitch and he gets fired sounds like me in 2018 i got 2nd in a red bull after 3 seasons and got fired i was also 1st driver lol i ended up going to haas which was the worst car but about half way in i built it back to a midfield car haha comes in last great result jeff showing up to the paddock drunk after that performance the only excuse i have for him saying that jeff has a really low bar this season what a great race benji failed becoming the champion knows his place and goes to the back aww i wanted you to be in mercedes facking finally benny next team for you should be red bull can anyone match weber lets get out of this hell hole bens thinking when he left australia we look like a bunch of wankers ferrari gave you a raw deal mate i look forward to you climbing the ladder again and making them wish they never fired you mission spinnow shout out to all those that remember the 2013 alpha tauri toro roso career mode shenanigans at toro rosso called it why torro rosso finally a honda to kick ferrari ben hint for s4 we are going to a car a little slower me yes alfa haas or rb career mode ben goes for the worst team those f1 2013 memories like f1 and f2 career mods keep this up move mid season to racing point or williams or even mercedes or mclaren jeff had a few too many drinks last night i think look at it this way ben you could have finished in 20th place yaaas road to glory benjamin move to toro rosso me ill never see him a career mode in racing point worse career mode episode yet no enjoyment what so ever imagine if ben got moved to another team after this race well done picking the worst team takes balls tony ferguson the type of guy to box and change his own tires this is not career mo oh it is my bad that came out of nowhere finaly bring toro rosso to 45th car of the grid an then switch teams ferrari has the highest ceiling in the game not red bull easy prediction red bull makes supernatural rd gains and wins championship with weber should have pitted on lap 20 next it will be red bull like f1 2015 pro career mode your decicion on taking toro rosso screams looooooooooool cyka blyat gee i wonder how long into season 4 will ben lose interest in f1 2019 after driving with a backmarker team ive seen this cough 2016 one many times cough 2018 that engine is worse than on season 1 of f1 2017 miss new zealand ryan ben you should find a online league racing were you legitimately let go from ferrari or did you leave im absolutely floored if thats the case after the season you had toro rossos my goto team in f1 though so im looking forward to seeing how far you can take them ahh rip really woulda loved a mercedes back to glory series but toro rosso looks like it can be a lot of fun as well p im sorry but this episode was so hard to watch you stayed with your old inters like a lot of time and you were complaining about the car your tires were at 80 why did you not enter for drys when the track was almost ready you were losing a loooot of time every lap i know you probably know a lot more than i do but sometimes i cant understand your decisions on the pit stops penalties dont count if you are lapped in this game about time you did a career mode again what a surprise you bottled it 518 more weight distribution less of that 1213 and that 1238 and that 1254 and that 1259 and that 1315 and that 1329 and that 1345 and that 1400 and that 1507 and that 1552 and that 1611 and that but nah the weight reditribution upgrades are worthless mate dont touch them magnussen was last season driving as of this season xd i wanted mclaren but i fine with toro rosso great start i know ferrari have been screwed by your lack of adaptation of their parts lukas weber is my teammate in toro rosso did not know that could happen claire aski g that was some great overtaking from your former teammate claire he is my current teammate finally f1 coz that f2 rubbish was boring as hell take engine penalties while your already at the back of the field finishes last place jeff awesome result mate were very happy if you upgrade the engine and drag it is a monster on the straights but while be a bit unstable on the rear end and has high tire wear at higher levels 3100 wtf is going on with the front wing stupid driving the tires to 100 youve been watching to much aarava content sadly i got to dislike a ben vid and its sad you are fired after first race ben grosjean looking threatening as ever grosjean releases a cook book keeping it fresh is it me or did they make ricciardos ai really bad in this game lol in all of my seasons hes been horrible and then in my current season hes been dropped to williams who remains the worst team in my game codemasters arent a fan of him i guess helmut marko signed another redbull junior benjamin daly patrica oward has bin let go just like me in my career mode went from a championship winning car to a back marker except i went to williams ben is having the fernando alonso experience too much fuel again should have lower fuel maybe that the difference on tire and the strategy will work ben i heard if you switch to rich mix in 2nd and 3rd gear off the start it helps ben you waited too long 1930 gasly he turned switch teams wow grosjean back at renault thats kind of unrealisticbut im still hyped these australians with their shock downgrade moves ben what difficulty are u running like you said youve done torro rosso before so now its time to make it even more dramatic truth be told you got torpedoed i already knew who you picked toro rosso because you spoiled it in your road to master rank series in soviet australia torpedoes get torpedoed try to get fired from this team so you can go to another team it is hard to win the championship with toro rosso maximum upgrade not too good quite bad choices in choosing this team in my opinion have i ever press video open this quick o man i wished you picked mercedes ah yes the torpedo always nice to see him i bet youll get promoted to red bull mid season who thinks ben should do rtg with williams well you werent kicked out you just misread the email again cos thats what ya do yeah i said it 1 21 chapter 2 this is not fortnite drake started from the bottom now were here ben season 3 to 4 ended nearly at the top now were here this could be fun bored there are drivers transfers from f2 2019 to f1 rich and hotlap on the start in this conditionsits one of those myisteries why you dont have good start i guess well never know didnt lukas weber win the title last season 2559 fernando alonso driving for mclaren honda looking like amateur 2015 colourised we have just started a new series called the f1 meme world championship where we rank the best memes from each race to see who the best meme account is wed really appreciate it if you could check it out i am willing to watch even 3 seasons of ben in toro rosso as soon as he wins the championship on it please go to racing point wow you and aarava both in toro roso this is way better than f2 career ben the toro rosso when maxxed iut is the best in the grid it stays super balanced and grippy all the time the driveablity of it makes it faster and easier to push hard in the races than even redbull and mercs im still hoping ben to win championship for ferrari only i getting annoyed the fact that the engineer on the grid before the start sahking hand with the driver with his left hand and this is the same mistake in the f1 2018 game not first but ye so happy its back why not just stick with one team i cant believe that after 4 seasons lando norris and carlos sainz is still in mclaren dedicated milk man and smoooooth operation blessed man kicked ben out for the loyal puppet devon butler blessed man doing all in his powers to win another championship including sucking dicks and persuading the higherups to sack competitive teammates chocosenna is turning out to be a nice villain for this saga the comeback will be really sweet i just started f1 2019 i chose tr for s1 i have azerbaijan next oh yeah and lukas weber is in an alfa please send help lets get this torro rosso to the front of the field grosjean overtakes well toro rosso is going to be alpha tauri i think or something like that i dont get how you can go from last season nearly winning the championship to being demoted to this level of crap i love to watch your videos but at the same time what the hell screw you ferrari 1340 who is saying grosjean there unlucky race but the season is not over good luck with road to glory the struggle of being a backmarker racing point is the best car in my career and have dominated most of the season but their reliability is awful i just rewatched the first season of the 2017 career mode with mclaren honda were u had complaints about the engine every episode and here we are in a honda powered car with to less horsepower i cant believe it you have been demoted to toro rosso you have been pierre gaslyed flashback to china season 1 smash the liek i thought i was gonna watch aarava carrer mode video yay career mode is back how the fuck did you get fired if toro rosso fired daly williams always welcome you starting from the bottom nice challenge i hope the best and keep up the good content fucking finally ive been waiting for like forever for season 4 of career mode great work ben its amazing how well youve been doing and it amazing to see how much youve progressed keep up the good work yessssssssssssss we will see the comeback of vettel wining monza 2013 well that didnt go to fucking well did it bens copied fortnite chapter 2 in the way that this career mode has twisted oh no 8th is my prediction since you are now racing for toro rosso gonna watch it now p show your setup next time 2222 damn dude you gotta stop jumpscaring people finally quicker than notification squad chapter 2 my guy copied fortnite awww yeah this brings back f1 2013 memories good times cant wait to see how you do this time ben is such a masochists this whole career mode is building a team up and then going to a shit team breaking news ben has been fired from ferrari after losing the title battle and joined the red bull program with the backmaker toro rosso do you like my breaking news way with the tier thing because your toro rosso is a backmarker lol torro rosso the worst team in f1 2019 by far they always seem to be at rock bottom of the rd charts i thought we get f2 first done xd anyway lets go torpedo and ben i hope you carry on the career mode unfortunate about the wallabies losing thanks ben for uploading ben you just gave lukas a psychological advantage by saying that youre a backmarker finally no this isnt happening brooo you suprise me every time where you are going you also like a challenge keep the content up i am hyped for this season finally11 yes the toro rosso torpedo mode at the ready captain kvyat great vid hey whats your fps is like in this ver 112 sure ure on 2080 ti 1440p can u get over 80fps totally love and enjoy this channel much love from south africa where is the logic tho what hello there music is from f1 2013 i see you are reminding yourself of the sepang race the marshals are drinking beer wheeeey the music is the f1 2012 game main theme music f1 2012 ben so well finish this lap and fast forward to the end of the session comments so you have chosendeath the music was project cars 2 basically the stewards were on cocaine again like in canada you are a goof with this setup you need high downforce here in the rain what a goomba music from f1 2013 easy for me because i played a lot back then but i havent played any f1 game since unfortunately great work by the way benjamin enjoying your career a lot we were purple in the first two sectors no you werent you had a hamilton style german gp oof look at the german race man is it me or is the game bias in favour worse now talk about blatant f1 2012 7 different winners first 7 races what an epic year that was so i link this music is with it and always remember it is it f1 2011 or 2012 codemasters really need to fix the q3 issue 718 oh past ben you have no idea 2010 or 2012 from f1 2012 the music f1 2012 theme of course my childhood game even tough i was shite wow raining in the german gp lando norris out of the session virtual sf stupid penalties this is lookin a lot like the actual real life german gp hahahahaa just thought id say when the vsc comes out you dry well below that delta time try and stay around the time maybe if you didnt slow right down coming into the pits you might not have ever gotten the illegal overtake penalty ive had this happen a few times on previous games such a stupid penalty what a fucking race its f1 2012 cause i used to play it a lot is it 2012 or 2013 my first f1 game was f1 2012 and that is the music this rain will show max is the best i had my hands in my head to be honest ben daly 2019 music from f1 2012 u legend merc and hamilton saw your race and thought yes lets try that for hockenheim in the race f1 2012 main menu looking at the mclaren project cars 1 f1 2012 the music is from f1 2012 it is the best music ever can you please make it into q3 so this stupid bug didnt appear f1 2012 ofcourse f1 2012 music the one i have played for hours on end one of the 4 f1 games i have played 2009 2010 2012 2019 and i only stopped playing 2012 becasue f1 2019 got released 2012 f1 game music hey ben can you give us an insight on how many if any flashback you normally use during a race maybe ill feel slightly better about my own usage of it the music is from f1 2013 for once this season the real life race was more exciting than one of bens race enough about jeff is no one going to talk about the guy simply standing on a lift during the rain 30 up on the front straight f1 2012 i play it on my laptop at school because it is newest f1 game that my laptop can handle music is f1 2012 first f1 game i ever played when the game says fu mate and gives you 5 sec penalty for no reason f1 2013 music france season 1 was your worst race if only the game simulated how slippery the drag track is is the music from f1 2012 thats better than the real reno you cant pit your team mate is in team mate rejoins 15s in front of him watching this after watching the craziest race of the year at the german grand prix in real life music is from f1 2012 switch to short qualifying to keep the pecking order can williams paint their cars silver f1 2012 music the best watching this after the actual german gp im still in shock i love driver transfers in f1 2019 i have the game and not to be funny but i went to merc with lewis and in spa hulkenberg went to haas and bottas went to renault grosjean let go notalie wow nobody is spinning in corner 16 ben worst penalty in history hamilton at germany hold my steering wheel ben your game is the crystal ball a wet german gp on yours and the real life 2019 german grand prix make a reaction video about the race if possible just like baku 2017 f1 2013 music at the start wet tires are designed too have a lower optimum temp then dry tires when a dryish line starts too form its easy too overheat in real racing the way too deal with this is obiously not to stress the tires during acceleration but also try and find wet parts on the straits in order too cool down the surface of the tires dont know if it works in f1 2019 but worth a try maybe perhaps a video with a test someone know if he changed something in camera settings f1 2012 intro music worst game for me wheater like in real life i really hoping charles can win the race i kept on getting this bug and it really pissed me off watching this one after the race i am so sad about leclerc todays german gp was proberbly the best f1 race ive ever seen its f1 2012 garage theme similiar conditions to the real german gp whos here after watching the german grand prix f1 2012 main theme basically hamilton irl ben after moncao i need to work on the gearbox also ben well i could get even more major downforce upgrades 2012 i think its the only game music i havent turned off just finished watching the german gp and wow was it a chaotic but action pack full grand prix and congrats to vettel for doing a 20th to 2nd hes driver of the day for me i just watched the race and it was absolute mayhem if thats how you spell it im dutch so im thrilled seeing max win but i doubt anyone could say it wasnt an interesting race i feel bad for charles your race was just like ferraris race weekend f1 2012 is my guess watching the hockenheim gp really fast before the hockenheim gp starts this music sound is from f1 2012 ofcourse my first game that i played theme is from f1 2012 best theme people have skin cars dont vettle has been passed by 2 williams in real life at his home grand prix why are mercedes good on track when their car on paper is like fifth best song is f1 2012 my favourite old f1 game i got a safety car in my first race in f1 2019 in my career in f1 2019 in hungary it was heavy rain the whole time that music is from f1 2012 f1 2012 main theme isnt it f1 2012 theme 2012 main theme ben was playing it on my 360 2 days ago the music is from f1 2012 i think ben the ads are getting too much man it makes me wanna stop watching your videos 3 is enough i think music from f1 2012 its the main theme from f1 2012 turn the saftey car on in the settings turn the saftey car on in the settings turn the saftey car on in the settings turn the saftey car on in the settings music f1 2012 f1 2012 throwbacks the music is from 2012 f1 2012 i think that track was outrageously good the irony of you complaining about the closeness of p8p13 being 03 sec in the game then in real life the gap from p8p13 was actually 0033 sec i think codies need to fix the overheating on the full wet tyres it happens to me all the time and becomes impossible to keep up with the ai check torro rosso development its so sad it is the f1 2012 music ben its the back when f1 was good theme first 24 wings at germany are you drunk hahaha hey tiametmarduk just wondering how often you do a race lower the ai difficulty a bit in the wet races only f1 2012 players can like this a really fun game and my first f1 game f1 2012 i wouldve preferred you didnt upload this video you shouldve restarted the entire weekend after that penalty f1 2012 loved that game music is from f1 2012 played the game for over 100 hours i could never fail f1 2012 f1 2012 also you should have just restarted cuz of the penalty music is from f1 2012 song from f1 2013 racing point firing ocon means that our cars will not ram into each other f1 2019 well yes but actually 933 i thought id seen you change engine components after quali before but you definitely did for this race isnt this against the parcferme rules bug f1 2012 into music i think still got that game on my pc just for buddh international circuit f1 2012 or 2011 i couldve swear that music was from 2011 good vid its from f1 2012 isnt the music from f1 2013 music from my favorite game f1 2012 the music is from the g f1 2012 the music is from f1 2019 sees title this isnt canada lol i noticed some tracks ya can see the helicopter buzz around like thier flies or bumblebees the music is from 2012 f1 game and i still play it last episode now we can fight me after watching this episode well that certainly didnt age well that penalty wasis complete bs thankful i didnt buy this game same issues as previous season absolutely pathetic they should refund peoples money who cares about f2 or shinny tyres enough to pay that much for a joke of a program music is from 2012 first game i got loved a bit of kers on the back straight at india f1 2012 its the only f1 game i played yet so happy to hear that again f1 2012 really enjoying this series you planning on staying with renault another season i mean i think that race was a pretty acceptable one to just restart dont ya think the music is f1 2013 you cant fool me mr daly f1 2013 title screen music is from f1 2012 is that the ferrari challenges main song such memories why is there a drs zone on the start finish straight that music is from f1 2012 codemasters ia in a nutshell come on man the team at codemasters are bitches its the f1 2012 theme song i know it ben reply ben when you get to singapore start saving resource points for the winter break eyyyyy its the f1 2012 game i still play that game with my friends because we all have crap pcs 2 williams better than vettel they are improving its like codemasters just turned up the ai in the wet without testing them its so dumb how i know how to turn the difficulty down every time its wet race and even on lower difficulties the ai get insane traction out of every corner f1 2012 was just a beauty of a game hearing that music brings a nostalgia that cant be recreated f1 games need a new penalty system like project cars 2 when it comes to corner cutting and track extending on f1 2018 i had a spectacular tyre failure in the just after the monaco tunnel and cut the entire chicane spinning i got 10 second penalty for corner cutting when i was facing backwards after the corner in pc2 if you slow down enough you dont get a penalty that should be how the corner cutting penalty system works for f1 2020 f1 2012 i played it like 5 mins ago is it just me or on console with a pad in the wet with traction control on is it just impossible to compete with the ai in the wet every exit of each corner i get overtaken by about 2 cars codemonkeys spaghetti code in action they have to get rid of the drs zone on the pit straight f1 2012 main theme xd shootout please shouldve gone for a high downforce setup if you knew the race was going to be wet f1 2013 my first f1gameeee thats the music the music is from f1 2012 also it seems that the so called bottas 20 has entered my career mode he completely outsmarted everyone by staying out on inters when almost everyone including me pitted for full wet tyres and denied me my first career mode win on hockenheim and in my most recent race in hungary he won from 16th on the grid do i guess he added some secret ingredients to his porridge or something it was heartbraking to see vettels reaction today the music is from f1 2012 i could never forget this theme f1 2012 was the first f1 i played 459 wasnt he red to the first and green to the second out of interest does anyone seem to find that they either go forward or just backwards with no middle ground in this years game stupidest penalty i ever got was being disqualified when i was almost a lap down on the leaders and not being able to catch when the sc came and i was in p3 that was either f1 2017 or 2018 music f1 2012 this music is from f1 2012 game you should do that race again because of the penalty misc from f1 2013 the music is from the awesome f1 2012 game f1 2012 without a doubt its the game by which i found your channel so yeah p this video proves what kimi said that f1 2019 is a bad game 2011 or 2012 music youre telling me to shoot myself in the foot again why did you choose confirm change then f1 2012 the one i played the most 4 years the music is from f1 2012 menu screen trl limitless just made a vid on 110 ai around this track and also found that the ai get a monster 3rd sector time purple in the first two sectors a tenth down in the first sector music from f1 2012 i think you should get some subs to be your pit crew f1 2012 was the first f1 game that i played and i loved it to heaven and back theres no way that i wouldnt recognise that a case of the vettels for this race its the f1 2012 game main menu and track introduction music a case of the vettels for this race a case of the vettels for this race 1400 aarava is proud of you this game is shit period ur set up seems weird why did u go for such low wings in a twisty track should of underfueled the car 2012 music right this is the 3rd game in a row where mercades dont upgrade the car in the second season lol thats awkward ferrari aint doing nothing this weekend f1 2012 thats the only f1 game i have edit i want f1 2019 i want to do an rd tree maldonado spun in australia in my career mode in front of meh eyes as a force india f1 2012 theme easily one of the best f1 games ever i still play it almost everyday song is f1 2012 backround track if im right roses are red lapis is blue my prediction is haas 12 again the music is from f1 2012 main menu i can see perez on podium tommorrow f1 2012 music thumb up q2 either im seeing things or there was no purple at all on that second lap music was f1 2012 menu music f1 2012 main theme boys the great f1 2012 music f1 2012 that was the greatest soundtrack to any f1 game to date u just fell for the fia trap hey ben next time if you dont make it in to q3 it would be nice if you showed the results anyway so we can see who qualified where f1 2012 theme great retro f1 game that was you were drifting in pretty much every corner ofc your tires are overheating music f1 2012 before f1 2019 the last f1 game i played was 2012 so brings back memories i finished season 2 of my career mode is that f1 2012 music note sure as i havnt heard it in ages music is from 2012 codemaster have broken the game since the update i have massive flickering textures ever since the patch happend to me as well yellow flag bottas behind me and i get a illegal overtake f1 2012 was when i started playing f1 games f1 2012 the best game on the old platform music is f1 2012 f1 2012 theme 2012 what a game and my first f1 game 3 bad luck ben but i think you didnt react strongly enough with your setup change youve had a lot of experience in lower downforce setups at this track which likely would have been ideal for the dry but you really should have gone with a higher downforce setup because of how monumentally slow you were in s3 and the weather forecast also keep in mind youre driving the career mode car with various upgrades that have the car be faster in different ways when youre beating everyone at the speed traps why not add more downforce thatmusic is from f1 2012 2012 recognised it straight away f1 2012 music we need ian livingstone back what did you do to perez man hes been fucking with you the whole career series the music is from f1 2013 ben the overheating issue i think is because of the new update since the update my tires are also always overheating not only in wet but also in dry i believe it is the main theme tune from the 2012 f1 game revenge for canada the 1 point for fastest lap is only for the top 10 music is from 2011 or 2012 what have the fia been taking what drugs are the on what glasses arent they wearing unlucky race there ben nothing went your way today also the music was from either f1 2012 or 2013 i believe ben the full wet tires are made to drive in the rain so if you follow the racing line of all the cares you overheat them by driving on a slightly dryer surface f12012 bois those og days has best engine runs 35 wings in a circuit with a technical third sector is surprised when his teammate doesnt do the same and gains 7 tenths in said sector well i guess that happened please tiametmarduk use this music in every episode i love the f1 2012 music it was the first f1 game i got as a kid why does your car spark so much really bothers me go on with engine codemasters doing the usual all the things went bad with me too but tomorrow is other day f1 20122013 great music and even better nostalgia they were my only f1 games until 2019 the music is from f1 2012 last episode now we can fight this episode now lets screw up the qualifying have terriblle pace in the rain mess up the pitstops get an unfair penalty and almost finish in last place 759 typical ben xd ben just change the video title to f1 2019 bruh well done for seeing it through to the end others wouldnt of or just restarted the race proud of you for these fantastic videos keep it up why buy a game thats not made properly lol why cant we wait and if the game still have problems then dont buy there next game until they redeem themselfs we are to busy caring more for feelings over truth you kept a cooler head than i wouldve my pc wouldve been out the window if i had been given that penalty ai in every circuit are always op at sector 3 you let a williams by 5 second time penalty music is from 2012 music is from f1 2012 post qualirace screen keep it going from the land of down under support from your fellow aussie the music is from f1 2012 the first f1 game ive played in an competitive way music is from f1 2012 and also used in 2013 music from f1 2012 f1 2012 music the best of all the f1 games f1 2012 theme first f1 game ive ever played ferrari letting golden balls hamilton away with it again feel really sorry for le clerc he deserves a win so much the music is from f1 2012 sad times this is the newest f1 game i can run on my laptop 2012 music i think music f1 2012 2013 f1 season music i think music is from f1 2013 game the music is f1 2013 i owned the game so i would know music at the begginning is from 2012 my first f1 game ive 2012 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 what a yoke the 5 second penalty a yoke because its dramatic im gonna guess f1 2012 i did see on a couple of other videos that 2012 had some epic menu music so thats the reasoning behind my guess f1 2012 game theme loved it 3 3 its not you all ai drivers have been turned into rainmasters after the last patch turn on fookin subtitles mod the game turn on extreme damage and then go complain the ai is so overpowered in the wet f1 2012 what a game where is the special mercedes livery what a travisty have to laugh at the quali times the ai are over 2 seconds faster than hamiltons fastest time in qualifying today codemasters are so shit they have overpowered the ai in wets fucking idiots f1 2012 i have over 350h on that music is f1 2012 nostalgia of that music f1 2012 what a fucking game 317 why hte heli travels with over 200miles p f1 2012 who doesnt knows that is not a truth fan of f1 f1 2012 main theme so something really funny happened to me while playing my career i played my first year driving for renault then switched to mercedes midway through my 2nd year ended my 2nd year as the world champion but ferrari took home the constructors i decided to go to mclaren for year three when the season started i look at who im sitting across and see that lewis hamilton followed me to mclaren it was just really funny emma are we playing bumper cars or something the music is from f1 2012 why haas is that good and still not win everyrace i jinxed it havent i oh no ben my bad with full werd you have to drive to standing water i think its the 2102 f1 theme song if i do belive in myself damn this video pretty much puts the nail in the coffin for me buying this game if you pause at 1410 the penalty timer changes from perez to daly thats just ridiculous and a shame i really wanted to buy this game but im glad i stuck with 2018 instead f1 2012 had the best theme song tho 2012 4 the music 2012 i belive it is f12012 its 2012 or 2013 music 2013 music i think music is from 2012 right and come on codemasters fix the penalty system no worries mate 2020 is only 11 months away can emma be less of a bitch bitch please i have the same problem when is rains commenting this at 0028 the music is from f1 2012 f1 2012 my first ever f1 game loved it played it for 4 years you deserved the penalty even if not for the illegal overtake you corner cut the first corner almost every single lap and 17 often aswell 2012 theme i think the music is from 2011 or 2012 f1 2012 theme f1 2012 anyway really good videos ben keep up the good work ben you should really do some discounts i still cant understand how the fuck does f1 2019 has the same stupid bug of reseting the performance of the cars to the base cars if the player gets knocked out of qualifying only thing that works is going on short qualy thats why i hate the full qualy i believe this is f1 2012 main songnot sure thoughtsomeone will correct me if im wrong im sure sorry ben for the raceit happenssad for ferrari in real life f1 2013 what im playing currently finally turned 18 today daly you got 5 second penalty f1 2012 throwback got me straight back to my teens loving it fam loving it last time i was this early seb was still in q1 f1 2012 my first f1 game f1 2012 theme 1226 sets fastest lap of the race ben my pace might not be too great at this point in the race 2011 loading screen music regardless of the penalty just not fast enough in the wet the penalty didnt matter anyway ben are you sure you didnt overheat the engine in qualifying and try making your car set up more balance 50 on everything try 25 brake ballas front and back half tire pressure high fuel mixture since youll be able to have more power for longer periods and do the same with battery deployment im not an expert with set upi dont even have the game so i cant test it and i want to know if the set up work so please try itif the set up ended up costing you the next qualifying or race all the blame is on me i think the music is from f1 2013 f1 2012 or 2013 thats the music honestly i feel a bit of relief seeing you struggling as well against ai on the wet after the update i thought it was my problem with my driving style but you had basically the same problems with tyres overheating and slow pace in general as i do i think codies fucked up again but this time they made the ai too quick and perfect on the wet ben bottles it codemasters hold my code f1 2012 main theme music from f1 2012 f1 2012 duh my favourite f1 game that i have i have 201315161718 and now 19 looked forward to this game coming out and its just broken lol gave up playing it f1 2013 one of the bests seeing how the upgrades are going on i have a feeling that the front downforce upgrade will fail f1 2012 and f1 2013 clearly you dont read your comments because youve been told hundreds of times that the reason your qualifying is bad is because you keep fast forwarding the time if you actually sit out the entire session without skipping or fast forwarding you will notice a massive difference its a glitch which has been in the game for years read your comments ffs f1 2012 my favorite f1 game which had schumacher my favorite f1 driver what does fia stand for ferrari international assistance oh ben oh ben you give me good flashback man f1 2012 chill f1 2012 my main game due to a powerless laptop ferrari what have you done i mean there engines blew up it wasnt a team based problem it is all rng if you have a problem or not both ferraris top 5 tomorrow screenshot it now im seriously starting to think that its the game itself and not tiametmarduk driving or race strategy i say this for a few reasons the first one is pretty obvious because he states it in nearly every race he goes into the ai reverts to their season 1 stats when he simulates that section of the weekend this cant be an intended mechanic it makes no sense to have it as a intended mechanic it has to be a problem with either the new ai code or the code that simulates that section of the raceweekend another one is haus they should be easily getting a podium with every race now and yes i understand that those preformace graph is not accurace of the cars actual preformace but i mean really they are having the stats difference of a mid season 2 car racing against a starting season 1 car this must be a bug in the game maybe whenever they do an upgrade the game is reading or displaying the wrong value and is showing it on the graph so it appears higher then it should sector 3 not calibrated tires not calibrated stewards not calibrated weather not calibrated ai not calibrated what else can go wrong i know that opening music very well its f1 2012 make a video about what happens when you perform poorly in f2 f1 2012 menu theme music 2012 or 2013 i think seems like ferrari at the german gp did get a 12 unfortunately they multiplied the positions by 10 edit yes i do know that was on the qualifying highlights comments on the f1 channel idk what to write so i wrote that i heard f1 2011 theme playing in the video what if you simulate 10 seasons did you put it there or is that song in the game f1 2013 theme who do you think will be i mercedes 2020 ocon or bottas thumbs up for bottas thumbs down for ocon 1409 illegal overtake on daly lmao wtf game its an old f1 game anyway 12 or 13 i believe 5 second penalty for the title its so similar to the f1 2013 music when the gearbox make problems again it will cost you more time as when the engergie store looses performance especially when you go to hungry now with 52 already also later in singapur f1 2012 shit i played that game a lot fortnite is it fortnite music sadly no proof but i just started a new career and got on my first lap real vc xd i was just playing f1 2012 saw a notification for this video stopped and babam here we are with f1 2012 music insert calibration jokes here f1 2012 music keep up the good work ben ben do a last to first challenge as vettel like aarav before the race tomorrow the only one that could overheat tires on a wet ravr what heppens when butler or webber wins the titel when the race forecast calls for 100 rain you really should set up accordingly the f classic f1 2012 the best game for me well i mean you do it most days so like you should underfuel the car 144p gang where u at f1 2012 loved that menu music ben nice vsc now i dive into the pits and get an advantage by losing less time into the pits fia no you dont try running just a hair bit more downforce the ai runs more downforce than you from 2012 one i watch areas and your vids and like them the music is from f1 2012 5 seconds is a joke a yoke another great video im also racing with renault but really struggling with gearbox wear i have a 100 durability but my gearbox isnt lasting more than 4 races any tips never had any problems on previous games also im playing on the pad does that make a difference on f1 2019 damn ur career mode is really close in my career mode im in season 2 china and mercedes is about 15 seconds faster than everyone else in quali and finishes around 30 seconds behind the mercs in races why in gods name did codemasters think making your manager a total bitch after a bad race was a good idea i never heard this song in f1 2012 such a beauty song its the f1 2012 main theme its also in 2013 f1 2013 loved it first f1 game i played also the game did not give you the point for the fastest lap alonsowhat a joke the 5 seconds good work ben on jinxing ferrari haha tires are overheated because to much down force the patch made the game worse the ai is op in the rain now f1 2012 never going to forget that young drivers test the music is from f1 2012 went back and played it yesterday its from f1 2013 classic cars mode its the formule 1 2012 theme and its just so epici love it codemaster master pice maybe the safty car isnt on have a look next episode you should get to redo this race on account of this being complete bs i hate the glitch that if u dont make q3 the top 3 teams qualify in the top 6 spots like real life it almost makes ai development pointless f1 2012 the og game i really enjoy the career mode series i think the music is from f1 2012 f1 2012 theme f1 2012 the best soundtrack in a f1 game ever fia in real life f1 2012 ai traction and yet another glitch f1 2013 theme music you know you are a skilled player even the great legends have had rough races that everything seemed to go wrong you will have plenty of much better races ahead 5 second is a yoke if im correct the music is from f1 2013 edit 2013 is my favorite career mode from you tiametmardukben plus i was wrong with 2013 its 2012 i realise bad in the twisty bits ben you gotta start upgrading the actual chassis the renault is far far behind music is f1 2012 right worst race of the season yet f1 2012 main theme good memories ben yp7 forgot to calibrate the fia that emma of f1 needs a slap f1 2012 theme 1815 we will see this again at the end of the real life gp tomorrow f1 2012 menu soundtrack i fucking love it makes me wanna go and play it 2012 menu song i think f1 2019 is such a broken game f1 2012 only f1 game ive ever played 2012 first f1 game i played also introduced me to noel gallagher so yeah remember it well i think complaining about the lack of pace of ais in the wet resulted in something worse is it from f1 2010 1904 and hamilton keeps lucking into it just like real life lol oh my first f1 game f1 2012 thanks for bringing memories back ben just imagine f1 2012 made like f1 201619 where you can develop your car with rd points am i the only one who read hungary in the title everyone hates 5 second time penalties no the worst penalty was 5 second penalty to vettel in canadian gp 2019 im sad for leclerc and vettle they lose their chance to prove what ferrari can do i hope see one good race good luck on everyone what team or driver you support penalty at 1332 thank me later shout out to anyone who can guess it so shoutout to everyone then its the f1 2013 song keep up the good work and thanks for making me enjoy my day f1 2012 ahhh the memories song from f1 2012your haas is bugedbits going to upgrade it to the max i love the vids subtoben f1 2012 music is one of my favs never gets old was the music f1 2012 banger of a game f1 2012 still played it like a week ago lmao typing this with my penis sorry pen im still searching for more calibration jokes gta san andreas music easy thx for spoiling quali the music is from f1 2012 background music f1 2012 lobby music pediction ben absolutely cuts the corner to narnia and says the penalty is the worst in history edit i was wrong is the music from f1 2009 wild guess i have no idea the music in the intro is from the glorious f1 2012 new video from ben carrer mode exists me fuck all ill watch this now im a brazilian fan since 2014 ben send a your channel cap to me why do force india always crash bruh this is 2012 the main menu music is from f1 2012 two rainmasters on the front row for tomorrows race and itll be rainingwe hope we have one heck of a race really loves this series thank you for uploading everyday ben also ben will you be in the same league as tom97 because thatll be really cool f1 2014 music bad year nice music i think the song background is from f1 2012 i guess thanks ben for making temporarily forget the misery of being a ferrari fan also its the f1 2012 main theme 3 the song is from 2011 or 2006 i think both ferraris have engine problems martin brundle ferrari engines are working well 2012 music first also f1 2012 music is the best bro i enjoy watching your videos keep it going from south africa im that early that the 1st comment didnt even load in ben is racing a race in a racing game by racing how quickly they can race nice the music is from f1 2013 looks like the fia was not calibrated the music is from f1 2012 music is from f1 2012 i believe bold statement i remain cautious love the series i am a simple man i see a new career mode video i stop what i was doing and watch technically first loved your helmet 1302 that crash was at the same corner where he got crashed by valtteri in season 1 of f1 2018 career mode to bo honest that happens to me a lot its like ai drives without noticing you i got bulldozed through corners by ai quite alot who else thought for a moment is this qualifying lap or race at 345 lol this 3rd corner ends like this almost every time when going side to side with ai xd realistic damage spun out into a concrete wall at speed tiny bit of rear wing damage go figure good work codemasters wow 3 wing changes in 1 race you sir had a really bad day good to finally see hulkenburg getting podiums guys when perez took ben our who remembers that the exact same thing happened on his f1 2018 career mode why does sergio perez always move to williams in career mode honest opinion the quality of your content has dropped considerably the last week or so which is really disappointing as i am a loyal supporter i hope this is jsut a short term thing what is his outro song please oh ben how how did this race go so wrong xd can you maybe play update these a bit quicker really loving this season so far sergio is and will always be stupid its a fact that bomb by perez was baffling not only for its audacity but also its stupidityat that angle hed have never been able to make the second half of the chicane and was almost guaranteed to plow right into the wall anyway the ai in this game is generally pretty great in my experience which makes moves like that even more infuriating you got to love the stewards in f1 games steward seb what happened at the castle section vettel guessing daniil crashed in front of me theres nowhere to go no chance to avoid it then lukas ran into the back of my car steward ok thatll be a 5 place grid penalty for you letting lukas crash into you i dont find the castle section hard whatsoever and it is my favourite bit of the map but the beginning of the main straight where it is bendy is the worst thing on earth not sure if ben knows what perish means i think the reason for your puncture was actually your end plate falling off not the wall which song is it thats why perez is starting from the pits mate i would just give up and retire change to a top team plz did you accidentally switch the ai difficulty to haas drivers ai red bull give you wings comment on this comment if you watched the late late toy show and if u do i will tell u something im sorry ben but aarava can score points in a 2019 williams season 1 and 2 song at the end 1524 and the beta test advantage do you have a mod or something for those crashes why were you trying to get past that ferrari yeah he drove into the wall because a slow car was dicking around under blue flags bring back f1 yt championship about the same as my luck that race wasnt ur fault i blame 100 devon butler and perez not knowing how to drive on that race for you ben kept saying things couldnt keep getting worse i was sure it would bite him in the butt by toro rosso firing him am i the only one who is waiting for f1 driver to wear this helmet what a fking idiot the sergio thing seems to happen to me all the time does anyone know if it is actually possible to play as a real driver like leclerc or something in career mode perez spins the fuck out of ben in the sf straight kinks codemasters penalty for ben classic 2017 checo is back pumpkin helmet anyone else notice it stop saying kyvyat instead of kvyat if i were helmut marko you wouldve been fired anthony who would you nominate for todays pelican of the race well it has to be sergio perez i wouldve retired from the race after the perez crashknow when to hold em and know when to fold em wow thats the unluckiest race ive ever seen such tragedy what a fucking disaster and now im miserable or at least i would be if failrace hadnt released a survive the hunt video the reason you never get safety cars is because you go in replay cam after a yellow flag it cancels the chance of a safety car perez did exactly the same what bottas did to you on f1 2018 in reality or game vettel sometimes is unlucky should go back to the open lobbies other drivers seem to hit a lot less there perez again man you need to play with the code and remove him he always tangle with him add a public comment this is motivating me to go buy this game worth it how hard is it to play you bottled it again again why did you do the extra lap after perez hit you should have pitted straight away that was a mistake benjamin daly presenting the yuji ide experience i wouldve waited for perez to come around then introduce him to the wall got to hand it to u ben u showed us how leclerc did it there in baku d i think what gave you the puncture was your debrief that slight touch with the wall wont give you the puncture it has to be your front wing debrief which getting under of your rear tyre hey ben i dont know its me problem or not but do you feel f1 2019 is more understeery than f1 2018 would you mind to show us your settings page of steering saturation please considering what happened this race at least you kept going a lot of people would rage quit into the wall no penalty for perez im new to f1 can someone explain how perez didnt get a penalty for the crash and ricciardos overtake seemed ilegal great video ben so is verstappen the best ai in the game verstappen was absolutely dominating butler when they were team mates now with hamilton beings his teammate theyre basically equal hamilton and butler can i just ask what are some of the best steering wheels for ps4 wait a minute didnt this happen in f1 2018 career mode hmm something feels familiar about that craah what is the music at the start of the video i was asking myself if there were ever retirements in the qualifying in these games i have been answered 2030 options a retire to save components b slow drive the track till prez comes around and wipe him out childish but worthy you were robbed sergio perez the mexican heat seeking missile should have gone to racing point not sure if that helmet is helping from an aerodynamic point of view but i like it anyway aarava got p6 on road to glory with the worst car like its garbage its the pumpkins fault anyone else notice the jackolantern helmet your crash is similar to the 2018 career mode where bottas did the same thing and turned into the saturn v rocket i think u drove over your frontwing endplate disaster race but still very entertaining please keep it up like for that voice bumper cars just throw that toro rosso out of the window and go to a better team 1215 its all falling apart in this bahrain grand prix torro rosso have broken ben so much he doesnt even know where he is racing anymore kv yat not ky vi yat this is not aston martin red bull racing how do other drivers crash it never happens on my copy i think the puncture was caused by you running over your own endplate it looked like it on the replay finallyyyyy career mode transfer to racing point it will be way better and the car will be more competitive for points and maybe even a podium been waiting for this vid for moons worth the wait 1350 we did it once again guys once again pls go to a other team i honestly would have just retired or after mid race and saved the engine fair play for trying try moving mid season this whole race was a comedy i am so dead hahaha 1333 you gave him a gap to attempt an overtake lol i was shocked at 1305 you always say kivyat but it is kvyat its like you do it on purpose that helmet is making me lose it ben i think itd be better if you finish a season at the time instead of switching between f1 and f2 every other video breaking news helmut marko has confirmed that benjamin daily will be dropped and replaced by alexander albon after getting lapped by his teammate to describe this race i will quote mr alonso its a yoke a yoke whats the outro song clearly the voice break wasnt calibrated what is the song at the end 1048 surely thats an illegal overtake isnt that the same corner where bottas crashed into you in f1 2018 1305 what a disaster codemasters hey ben trick or treat ben im out of candies boys codemasters can you please show your camsettings 1714 you got the puncture because you actually ran over your own debris there after hitting the front wing on the wall lmao 513 you were 15th a few seconds later yoz were 14th and its the samr lap time so how is that possible i dont think that the game deletes lap times there should be 4 drivers in the pit lane to start the gp i love that outro ben fucking daly does a daily vid whats the songs name at the end are you already hot for the us gp then watch my last to challenge with seb here httpsyoutubebolcy902t0o best content of racing games please keep it up trying to unlap yourself for no reason not my fault we crashed ok calm down ocon monaco will be part 69 monaco will be part 69 ben i know you wanted a new challenge but unfortunately this is very bad and not entrataining i think this is loud and clear the game is telling you to change team xd ben its pronounced as azerbaijan gotta love a cheeky love tap to the wall let it know you mean something it to it stupid pumpkin helmet was the course of all this sergio perez is the worse driver in f1 in real life and in f12019 s4 is a catastrophic failure at least your voice break wasnt as bad as croftys voice breaks this is the worst f1 career for you ben loved your voice crack btw you have to be alert on street circuit you need to start from 1100011500 to have a good start hey problm is you dont have good cat go to good team why did he call it bahrain i am watching you from namibia in africa just love this series so much keep it up mate gentlemen a short view back to the past thirty years ago niki lauda told us take a trained monkey place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car thirty years later sebastian told us i had to start my car like a computer its very complicated and nico rosberg said err he pressed during the race i dont remember what race the wrong button on the wheel question for you two both is formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel are you too much under effort under pressure what are your wishes for the future concerning technical program errrm during the race less buttons more or less and more communication with your engineers man how many drivers are stupid this episode finally a career mode video on the thumbnail there is a car with only three wheels how if it was leclerc that hit the wall i was gonna put i am stupid i am stupid me reads the title also me oh for god sake here we go again with the last man standing challenge thats unfortunate nice halloween helmet at 003 thoughts on 2021 car legend has it that baku castle is where all the lewis its james commands are stored away bottas has had it under siege for months what is green and not heavy light green ill see myself out 6 comments i am the 7th clicked faster than hamiltons hotlap first first boom 8 seconds ago first this time to win make a safety car come out pit for the hards

the strategy nobody ben blontchimonnt i need to crash to win renault at 2008 singapore yes because of you arravva and few more dickheads and cook suckers this game s getting bad day by day english cook sucker someones been watching super gt eh would love to see some gt sport here ben in the mfd you can just chose to swith your front wing instead of chrashing does tiametmarduk have a regular job or is he a full time gamer my frame rate is dropping watches aus v pak with 10 fps i must have stolen bens computer why no more f2 carrer try updating your drivers decreasing graphics settings or changing some nvidia settings these seem to fix stuttering issues in racing games i dont think its your internet because you would still hold stable fps other drivers would be lagging around if you had bad internet connection what internet provider are you with and whats your expected mbps 301 ben its like cricket everyone in the us 50 over what the fuuuuu ah the having to crash on purpose into a barrier for the front wing to be changed in order to claw back a good result in the race i believe tom97 had a similar thing happen to him in one of his career mode races one time gran turismo yes please id like to see you drive the super formula cars as well welcome to the uk were all internet providers are shit more cricket and f1 content please since when was tiametmarduk into cricket the music of the game at the beginning of the video is the real music of the game i dont have f1 2019 its the same music of f1 2012 so i dont play online but you seem to like it i think i might do it i dont like dirty drivers ppl who dont play the way your supposed to an idea for future f1 game be able to run an illegal car and risk getting caught and having points taken off or disqualified like an oil feed into engine for more power or running the car under weight drinking game drink every time he says like in the first 25 second of the video bringing in gt sport sounds like a great idea maybe you could do some content with steve like open lobbies or endurance races etc your fps issues could be overheating check the temps of your computer while gaming ben that mercedes is a bit slow martin brundle is that glock the true crashgate funky fuhrer that pronounciation killed m xddddd please continue on the pathway i was hooked on your league racing series guys is playing f1 with a controller nice i want to buy it but im broke too broke to buy a steer lemme know oh man if that wing had broken on the first attempt and you didnt need to back up to hit it again that would have been victory isnt there a setting on the mfd for auto repair wings hey your wifi is a bit funny looks like you need some of that spicy free wifi great video as always mate 1038 did anyone else notice the plane flying overhead what is the music at 900 last time someone crashed out to win it was a certain french team in singapore and it didnt go so well for them that old video remember me the good times of

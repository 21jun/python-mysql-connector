day at anime world im gonna go and hang out at the arcade 2225 and that is why when you say i love you to a stranger you dont yell em by the cashier lesson learned lmao how the fuck did this blow up did he really say enyoy or misfortune has haunted me you know i forgot that despite how retarded or at least bizarre kios adventure was it had a ton of disturbing gore when you die and get a game over oo i can only imagine what horrors are in here despite sounding ridiculous too also i wonder if anyone else by this creator doesnt exist lol xd 13 months why did manly make all the wrong choices from the start lmao sirius is that you thats my right hand so manly you know why 18 years of being single try 29 years damn this shits relatable yo is no one going to question the fact that there are 13 options for months for the date of birth i love gohard foreverrrrrr he was up in a reasonable hour 010 for realism wait he just assumed that if meis photo isnt real shed actually be an ugly girl instead of a guy trying to catfish him oh this innocent soul 2450 that is black jack xd wtf the ending hahaha i would like to watch this video but let me turn off the air conditioner first why are there 13 months the best character in this game is narration narration is a verb not a subject yet narration can do narration while breaking the universal law of english grammar catgun got hurt by hearts manlyoh god hearts kill me i gotta avoid their love manly switch to loveless mode notmanly a memory card for psx it contains memories of my childhood mesobbing internally for my broken lost psx memory cards that contains memories of my childhood then stop sobbing because i remember i have psx emulators in my pc 18 year old notmanly why should i be single for 18 years dude all babies toddlers and children are forever single unless some sick creatures force their way to them actually the girl with the voice not speak japanese lol oh oh god its a minigame xd fking killed me no ones going to question why theres a 13th month this game clearly was not originally written in english 1331 i have to i just have to do it flowers are blooming how to we can download this game for android this is pretty accurate we all do manly we all do saw the description that this was from the kio creators and that got me startled does horror await me up there in the video oo this game this game how awkward and dumb yet funny wait month 13 that waiter looks like yoshikage kira the food in that place must be an explosion of flavor ill walk myself out i already like this game lol i wonder if the protagonist is actually getting catfished though creators of kios adventure there is no redemption for you people 058 turn on caption im happy these game still have fantastic english was that blackjack reference lol this game is like slapstick comedy thats my birthday you put in i felt weird about it 2423 that is actually young black jack 1242 congrats on finally getting head manly fake number that sounds cool pleased birthday noises is this in chinese lol 1007 is that how guys really pee if kios adventure is the one with the tentacle sex monster amputee shit i can only imagine what this will be i dont know if its the editing but the way the credits roll after a joke ending reminds me of nier automata dam never knew a gay ending could happen that first ending caught me off guard lmao the style reminds me of those 2000s flash games with bad grammar its nostalgic didnt expect the characters actually speaks cantonese d i am in love with this game keep playing plz wtf is this game xd wow i think the guy needs either an eye doctor or one that checks further south manlysenpai is the aniki that will outmatch milos when manly thought about making his bday 911 but decided against it lol i envy your succ at girl manly why does this hurt cause i too am a lonely guy looking for love now im scared a single god will come after me too t a t im pleasantly surprised at the arcade girl speaking cantonese i never hear it anymore when love comes you cant stop it wise words indeed perhaps our otaku will learn through his bizarre adventures that this love of his comes far more fluidly with gruff men than anime girls undoubtedly the store keeper ending is the optimal one though id imagine hes rather laden with pending lawsuits and fines given how his store appears to be quite frequently stocked with freshly dead bodies needless to say im looking forward to witnessing more suave successful dating techniques from our dear protagonist sees chat log yeah this wont end well oh who am i kidding that was obvious from the start the real question is how old the dude hes meeting up with is 40 50 70 i cant wait to see more of this game pretty tame for an otaku he looks fine his room is clean nothing seems to be wrong with him dudes lookin fresh though manly is a bottom confirmed otakus adventure leaving the room too beat the game xd want see more xd 2427 well that sucksfor her good thing you just stood there and watched pls upload a video of this series every day first time watching your content loved it so far also watched kios adventure i tried to give this game a go but i couldnt get over the translation issues ended up getting a refund this is actually funny when will u do 2nd part me while almost every segment of this video hey im eating manly and i were born in the same daymonth 3 yays forever i read every line by the girl in the gollum voice xd its a low bar to clear but i like this more than kios adventure so far looks like it has a huge amount of endings but thankfully all the routes seem short waiter be lookin at him like oh youre waiting for someone a 24hour nurse perhaps xd table for one sir preferably in the back 1504 next scene how can she slap meeee how can she slap 1502 xd it was at this point manly knew subway molester events possible date with pretty girl socially inept wimpy anime guy is this netorare xd omg yeah sure thats totally clean wipes off piss with a tissue and doesnt wash with soap or lysol xd also totally demonitized kazune moko the musicalien ah so manly gets a game that fits him almost completely we tend to call people who are single as single dog as a form of mockery not sure if other countries do the same which is why the mc turned into a doggo at the end god i hate it when im looking for a girlfriend and i end up doing anal with a shopkeeper relatable what is the 13th month i ask this is already bizzare adventure already and he is probavly going to die after he become a singular god i dont really like the toilet scene ahhhhh 1025 manly senpai doesnt flush the toilet disgusting nobody can beat me at this game im a professional pong player manlys uncontrollable hog spraying all over that poor toilet tub secured the bloodborne great one ending to become the most omnipotent single being 413 that is most likely an kios adventure refrence i pray this ones not quite as much a halfassed mess as kios turned out to be every time i see anything kio related i hear the smooth voice of manly saying not good hm is it just me or were those light tryna isekai him can you believe it 18 aaand singlllle wonder why oh god i think her name is mei mei because its meant to be a play off of meme oh no a main character with no eyes 1006 uhhh thats a medical condition right there wow another bizarre adventure hehehe oh my godddd this totally reminds me of a friend i had who practically looks like the most stereotypical otaku ever lmao when he graduated high school he got certified for being the most single student in his grade you know like how in yearbooks they nominate whos the class clownmost likely to succeed he got the most likely to stay single lmao this reminds me of another game called kusoge so much lmao thats hot your first mistake was the mapo tofu shoulda woulda coulda ordered that beef dim sum every girl likes beef better this game its translation are hilarious so far glad you are playing it whoa she speaking cantonese this is going to turn 360 reallll quick oh boi on a side note im actually sicken that he didnt complete his gunpla slight rage manly you should try do you copy it really good indie this was a weird game but like it bark god this second hand cringe always kills me is it just me or do plots and mcs like this hurt on a personal level the fact manly uses more masculine voice for twin tail girl is amazing in cantonese a sad single person is called a single dog ehehehe when youre so lonely you ascended plane of existence relatable isnt this one of those dang ol newgrounds flash games you should have picked the 13th month as your date of birth 18 years amateur end of the game everyone just dies dying at the bathroom part who uses the bathroom like that lol cringy but understandable weve all made the mistake of bringing up a dorky pastime to the wrong person at least once intentions matter here have a free marvel pun what do you call it when doctor octopus wraps spiderman in his own threads world wide webtentacledmummycom the text scrolling noise is a bit obnoxious i clicked 1009 to see what im getting into theres voice acting out of the blue lmao was made by the same person who did kyos adventure what game was that again oh dis gun be gud after watching this video ive discovered the other of the infamous truckkun from a certain isekai anime i didnt think itll be it but the truth is something that you guess last the other of truckkun is lampkun how did we all not see it coming an adventure as an otaku is that even possible i remember the last game the dev made oh boy i wonder how could anything possibly go wrong i like escape rooms kinda suits this otaku shopkeeper ending was pretty good such a misfortunate series of events so bizarre story of my life those texts with mei mei rniceguys the cantonese caught me offguard ah great the perfect video for my birthday manly please play layer of fear 2 here early for once try 24 you missed the opportunity for 420 this game is made for me really i am online dating a girl haha need to meet her someday at japan iwant to be loved disgustingsuch a weak otaku theres going to come a point when manlys future girlfriendwife inevitably discovers manlys entire cornucopia of weeb videos in the cyberspace escape room type of game makes sense for an otaku also the music is soooo nice it makes me happy ooh looks interesting manly you play the games that are awesome and hilarious and super dark sometimes i wonder what happens if your birthday is in the thirteenth month decembruary otakus adventure dont you usually have to leave the house for an adventure so my life that boss reminds me of kios adventure so happy gohard got revived woooooooo while i did find this game great to follow i think i wouldnt have been able to play it i really hate bad translation so i would have given up quite early xd much better to follow with someone to read it and make jokes about it even tho as the game is good i wouldnt mind to help the dev translating it better well not really translating but at least making it readable while trying to keep most of what is here already in term of aspect and such great serie anyway thanks for it good playthrough and good girl choices i agree 3 go hard for gohard thanks for the lp manly you rock mehnot bad though i cant say i enjoyed the game or liked it the comedy was quite stale and absurd nature neer felt natural to me still if you discount the bad translations it was not that badcharacters could have been more fleshed out plot could have been much better but as i said the game still is not bad in the end i guess the starting sucked though did not expect a face cam omg lmao nooooo gohard was the best c wait why does she tell me to close my eyes will she kill me otakus adventure a true quest for the weebs of the world to finally have a girlfriend 3 routes 3 girls omg this is a w o o s o m e i love this game wtf really good i really enjoy it also i love manlys lets play always a joy to watch 3 hmm id say is actually the best i liked gohard really much but i just felt something towards id rank her first with gohard second thank you for the fun content i think this game is a huge step up compared to kios adventure i am actually looking forward to their future projects if there are gonna be any these games are funny and have that unique charm what a your are a weaboo i see that manly is also a fate fan nice yume nikki homage there an unexpected face reveal hi manly i found ur channel for this game hahaha i like ur videos play marks life available for android the game shows the 13 days of a guy suffering with depression if i had that much luck than that otaku it would be the heaven i mean on the gohard route my favorite ending was the convinince store employee ending i dont need you to use kind of explosive contract to lock my heart mbh you kinda do actually d i think the last contract with shobon was gonna be a kiss not an explosive implant then again she didnt wait around for hundreds of years to let her hero get away so easily its one of those take them out once every 6 months wish you could make them come true fantasies of every girl and probably many men as well this was a genuinely cute funny game in addition to the unintentional humor because of the bad translation it had a lot of variation a lot of affection for the otaku tropes really good commentary excellent playing no have anothers endings for the game this is really a good one and entertaining and its nice to see your face at least this game didnt become a bad ending like kios story thanks for the full playthrough that was super entertaining soo in the finale you appear holy thats you d this was a great play through i enjoyed your commentary throughout it i really liked this think the only real issue i have with it is translation issues but its a minor thing and some of those translation issues where kinda funny so its not that much of a negative that would make me not want to buy it this was seriously a bizarre adventure dont know if a better translation would make this better or worse lol i just finished kios adventure yesterday since this creator was in mind and i hope they have more content eventually manly i hope that sometime youll play yono and the celestial elephants its a really cute game id think youd like it i love this game the start was slow in the protags house but once the outdoor activities started the ball was rolling i love all the different mechanics of the game like only being able to do certain things with the items bought from the shop and how each girls route was a certain type of game style too the bad endings were amusing and the humor was pretty spot on at times too and even though the protag was an otaku and all he was shown to be a legit competent guy along with being an otaku in some of the routes which was nice instead of him just being shown as useless the whole way through or something sometimes main characters are bland in dating sims but he had personality which was cool and the girls are rather interesting too i like how wifu was nice but then was revealed to be like evilff xd only thing i didnt like was how she was mean to protag at the end of the truegood ending of her route i get why shes like thatbut it felt sour of an ending a bit so each of the menu start options has an image taken from the game artwork throughout the gameplay right does anyone know the artwork for the gallery the girl sitting on the chair greatmanlybadasshero new title get i hope there will be more games made by them sooooo there is no route for the first thot what is the ending song the best part of the video is manlys face awww im actually going to miss this game it had a surprising amount of personality emoji girls route was fun in the end but gohards was easily the best the fighting mechanic the general vibe and gohard herself were all quite fun as someone who really disliked kios adventure i can honestly say that i liked this game leagues better for me why does the final boss look like korosensei one of the best game this year for me haha i want the dev to explain his lovehate relationship with graphic cards though im glad you included the bat queen in the final ranking ahah okay but the best girl is stupid fucking hamster face also fuck micheal for asking the mc to fix the machine then calling the cops when asking someone without the skills instead of a paid professional comes back to bite him in the ass well i started watching this youtuber more when he started playing this game and i think about watching more of his videos now and so the game ends t t whahahaha tt too much tears get dehydration ending if you think gohard is best girl think about this its about when the protag turns into a slime if the astronaut tricks you and he is the one who turns back gohard simply gives up on searching for the protag and that was after a confession on the other hand never do similar thing she goes straight back to the forest to wait for the protag she accepts him no matter what after he proved himself so i claim as best waifu she even better than waifu thank you for listening to my ted talk maybe she actually wait for a hundred years trees color changed and why do you think she want to made that contract just make sure manly wont be gone for another one hundred year or longer loved the whole series your broken english useless and other quirks was fun that room has my dreams in it i am pretty sure is lying since the color of the tree in the background look darker well at least the rpg world has ac comedy gold i feel conflicted when it started and it was pointed out this was made by the same guys who made kios adventure my first thought was wait what was that again i looked it up and started watching that again and the next nearly immediate thought was oh yeah this a glorious obnoxious shitshow but at least one that didnt overstay its welcome otakus adventure feels like more of the same but keeps on going and going and going and going im not sure if its because it felt at least a bit more polished and fleshed out but for as bad as i think it was i dont hate it theres still this weird but infuriating charm i cant quite put my finger on and maybe its saving grace really is that it clearly doesnt take itself seriously hey manly there is a weird but interesting rpg game called mario the music box arc it would be cool if you give it a chance i wont lie i actually liked this game a lot even though gohard is the only voiced character and the rather limited resources the devs were working with they truly managed to create a lot of content out of not much besides also making an interesting story also am i the only one that liked the soundtrack and still i cant find it anywhere this was a pretty good game minus the bad translation thanks for playing this for us manly this route was okay but shes a little too possessive for my liking and also best girl dies in this one i definitely wasnt expecting this to be some expansive story about an otaku trying to find a girlfriend across all space and time but this was a pleasant surprise finally its over i feel like i was getting dumber every moment i watched this and this game is very interesting and also everyone just seems to die in this game and mean how many times have people died in this game this game is quite a charming gem especially the hilarious engrish translation imo the best ending is gohard route where the otaku and gohard goes in a date visiting animegame convention exposing the baldiness of a woman thief and having a punchalienquest in space then get home happily in spaceship as a couple meanwhile waifu dies as usual to either karmalamp or righteous bullet of mib and owo waits forever for her hero while imagining exploding menscrotchballs in her solitude this game looks super duper fun and very varied what was the engine for this game i will say that the game has big virity but it still lack content because if i was to play the game now i know everything that will happen so this is bacily a one way story finally its over so overall for the routes gohard is when the otaku and her slowly grow in love through their hardship waifu been using otaku until otaku want to be used himself in the end she might or might not even be in love with him and believed in predetermined destiny but also sort of control freak with the contract but eventually otaku grew to love her for real yes 325th comment hey we never find out about the secret letter that cost 999 in the convenience store dlc im always suprised how many fun games you seem to find lol cant wait for the next one also i heard there is a new paranoiac remake i dunno if it adds anything new or not wow no dislikes im impressed this is fun and all but his house is still burning down in the real world sega dreamcast the 2d dude can only perceive you at intervals when hes 2d i imagined when the whole ordeal with going back to the world the chemist is standing there cringely listen to those two lovey dovey overdramatic moment lol also i just realized all the ending has the same bgm it just suit the waifu ending better with the world end thing does manly play games lile cry of fear in his channel actually has he played this its a free horror fps from steam story driven with multiple endings and your typical horror action game puzzles gohard best girl nuff said she doesnt blow up your crotch doesnt require you to pull off a genocide is a gamer girl what is that contract hmm lenny face overall this game was very weird and i absolutely hated when the protag did something utterly ridiculous like accidentally pushing a button for the escape pod the rpg was my favourite route tbh cuz it went balls to the wall with craziness and it kinda made sense lol also ya boi manly rockin that beard it suits you very well for me that contract is a baby it s so obvious aaaa im such a sucker for rpg adventure despite this being very comedic i really love this ending it so cute 3 dare i even say romantic sooo what happend to that fat guy anyway and here i go waiting this channel to upload latest otakus adventure gameplay well everything must comes to an end and here we goprobably a fun journey with a gag that make me laugh and fill my boring day its great that youtube showed me this reccomendation i wondered if there was an ending where you can become the bat prince if you dont agree to w 1st contract if there is will you upload that ending please awww its over i really enjoyed that thank you this is sort of a bad ending because if any girl of any type kiss you like a female dog then you die when its not in love wiyh you that way she think did waited him for 100 yearsbut she lied to him cause she loves him 2042look at her face when he got back 2219 im honestly surprised that no one has posted the ost of the game and manly have their happy end i really enjoyed this game it had charm variety and laughs it was a good surprise i really loved this ending it was sweet and heart warming gohard is best girl though glad she lived love the witchs design and waifu was just a surprising waifu all in all this game was a nice surprise manly with that beard tho awooo im expecting the witch to do smt about the evil eye lmao but hey its a fun game uwu admittedly at the introduction of our sequestered lonely protagonist i was a bit concerned that the parodic elements would staunchly fixate on his archetypical characterization as an otaku whereby the humor would be entirely derived from his humiliating social ineptitude and the inexperienced creepy and often disrespectful behavior he would demonstrate towards the target women i was therefore rather glad that this game instead explored variable avenues of comedy and the quirky outlandish antics and unexpected silly situations that manly and his dates were suddenly thrust into were wonderfully creative humorous and effective in maintaining consistent interest in the wild errant direction our otakus story would take for a decently long visual novel and parody of dating sims the avoidance of repetitious or stale plots and jokes is definitely a rather laudable achievement additionally the expansive routes narrative subversions and various facets to the gameplay cert can you revive the dinosaur sooo i guess waifu is unanimously the worst um waifu in the whole game im pretty sure the pun is intended here gohard is far and away still 1 btw otaku hugs her covered head to toe in feces and shes still interested bad ending not withstanding thats a keeper right there i wonder what it will be the next game something similar or something completely different only the time will tell oh and yeah this game is in my point of view something new but also something that is not new like an combination of old school with different game styles well that was it this game was more enjoyable then i thot it will be so thanks manly for showing us this kind of games ps i new here i discovered your channel when i was looking thru my recommendation section and i saw your content i subscribed imediatly so thanks i really was looking for something new for some one that is doing videos on games that i really dont see them that much pps yes the gohard route is the most i like this one too but not that much i could do without the bad translation but this dating sim actually had alot of creative and interesting routes and gmaeplay features not to menton the girls a pretty cool too i personally dont care for twintell randomly agressive tsunderes but i had fun joining this playthrough a bizzare jogo if you will translation is just getting worse and worse over time or is it getting better gratz to the developer you made a funny and cool game a lot of details variation and humor was put into this project i really like it and its always fun seeing manly play such games oh wow we killed him without the power of money we need mei mei route and bat girl route o this is a very awesome and unique game too bad theres no killed by bobo for ruining his life ending after all lol what a adventure manly the speed at which manly goes through his save files gives me whiplash the sad feeling when the female girl was waiting over hundred years but turns out she didnt waited that long lol a funny joke i love it make you exact something but betrayed what you were thinking remember you ate your friends fish and possibly ruined his job prospects hero neat i just got done with the last episode wow punchout it was basically punchout honestly this game was funny and just unique and loved your reactions as well and i kinda wish there was more routes to italso i wonder why the apartment got on fire and if manlys friend got the job lol this game has me interested in the company so time to watch your kios adventure playthrough now lol ok megumin enough with the explosion anyways this series is epic style finally a isekai show and the character doesnt go back to their past world witch is practically unlikable your crocodile tears wont fool me is kind of a yandere or is it just me having to choose between gohard and this one its difficult best waifu is between gohard and the witch here we go again xd idk why but anime chars with an eyepatch annoy me xd dat game was weird this game was really fun random anime time i loved it this game has a lot of content for what it offers i dont even mind the poor translations as it really adds to the game the creativity the devs used for their game goes way beyond what the resources allowed overall its a great overlooked gem i hope the devs made enough money to hang in there and make the next game a true killer ah yes more thats was fast 2 in one day ye i love this game 7 comment 140 th view i miss you when u play some rpg marker game love your content so much manly yay another one i love when he does games like this youre all free now i need help how is the best form of get money fast or is just fight and fight please tell me if it is a fast form you need a level 5 chemist then you can kill her in one hit how to take the third cassette you paid 1000 coins for putting tapes on your flashlight how to unblock the vampire girl i didnt know you had to use the poison ive been stumped for a while thanks and witch is the best girl somebody claimed that the witch actually did wait for hundreds of years because trees in the background had grown taller than before she just doesnt want you to feel sad and guilty nice job buddy you should do another part about the ending with gohard can you explain howd you end up with that girl story good player wait btw in ur game review the guitar artifact is a reference to the guitar u use in guitar hero i think this game has alot of references btw you are the best new sub pd sub number 101 is enter the gungeon good first 100 sub you are gaining subs fast pleb because of this game 1339 its a trap space punz voice crack manly is godly nah he be okay he can use the space duck to get back 2915 is that a mf jojo reference 2915 nobody me is that a jojos reference who knew getting a girlfriend was so easy you only need to get kidnapped by aliens typo accident is still bother me xx oh my god i just realized the one eyed alien couldnt pin point the attack on gohard because hes not two eyed 336 manly earth sucks its full of anime xd deedee stop pressing the red button i swear if i was in that situation i would literally say that didnt happen right or did it oh gosh it actually happened didnt it in a calm irritated voice in the spaceship part i would be like do you by any chance know how to pilot this thing no alright ill just flip some switches press some buttons and then the big red one we will either get exploded or get back to earth and i would follow that altitude till the end also i watch criken2 so yeah everytime they said nonsense i screamed fish outside 837 that worm is straight up mood and gohard continues to be best girl that alien reminds me of an odd mix of picolo and saitama dont ask edit alian space toilets 1040 this fist is the fist that will knockdown the heavens man you doing all the voicelines even when they arent properly translated or have spelling errors in them is just hilarious it strangely fits so well with the game too dang he almost had it gamers oh my god i seriously was waiting for the xenomorph ending and just lol nope your cute girlfriend is dead now as soon as things are going well i play too much horror games why cant the guy ever be happy no one manly oh oh oh can some one please explain if hes having a boner or that the noise he makes when hes flustered dark deception reborn chapter 4 for clarity the one eyed monster couldnt hit you because of depth perception i think it couldnt hit you unless you made some movement to gauge the hit range perspective that ending you know the other girls are gonna have to do a looooot to have routes or attitude this good xd cant wait for part 5 xd can someone tell me gohard voice actor i fall in love with her voice this game reminds me of troll levels in super mario maker xd ok now that was clever 2829 snatching defeat from the jaws of victory10 i triggered about the ending is stool fragrant manly yes of course i love the smell of shit okai i am deeply invested in the plot now oo this game is so weird do you want to be my boyfriend this is not a drill i repeat this is not a drill abandon ship drop all work and get off you you you you you what did you say lol after a long story finnaly get a gf and then another problem come god wow this is a bizarre adventure fist of the ufo star lets see weve got one cantonese voice actorthat counts as an entire cast right rockem sockem gohard boxing aliens absurd complications to launching a ship and an actual sweet moment great episode even if the last minute sort of spoiled the mood this game is good for quite a few laughs even if the translation is terrible the power of situational humor and timing im in love with that game xd now i could say for sure your waifu got ntred period cuddling in a spaceship with a stunning view of the earth and stars soon to be followed by video games and food truly sounds quite heavenly a date like that might be worth suffering tempestuous digestive issues and getting punched in the face by various alians i suppose i should have anticipated the impermanence of this romantic scenario as our addlepated otaku cant seem to help ejecting himself from the company of attractive anime girls ah what is love without beating aliens after being launched into space by a toilet the aliens wanted the power if anime gotta say been loving the art style i thought gurren lagan when i saw the thumbnail lol gotta say i got a soft spot for gohard this has been an interesting date it really got to a sweet point then ofcourse the otaku messes up now what bizarre scenario will we find ourselves in soooo close so sad now 4ever alone in space best reply would you like to pass the time by chatting we could make out gohard is best girl she makes me gohard doyou thinklove can bloom even on a battlefield yeah ido i believe at any time any place peoplecanfall inlovewith each other snake poor manly xd elon musk is investing into space travel by toilet i wouldnt even bat an eyelid if he tweeted that kinda thing out tomorrow thats just normal elonk musk 1708 you can see gohard feet at the last cell next episode would be more interesting if u dont think twice for a native cantonese speaker hearing cantonese in cute girl anime tone is hilarious cause nobody speaks like this xd i like her nonetheless manly fucked it up xd ps waiting for part 5 2550 obiwan kenobi i understand you are quite a pilot yourself piloting and navigation arent hereditary but a number of the things that can combine to make a good smallship pilot are those you may have inherited still even a duck has to be taught to swim luke skywalker whats a duck obiwan kenobi never mind star wars the original novelization 1976 you could say the got abduckted man this protagonist if it wasnt for manly here id never watch this gohard the best waifu character artist so how many character designs do you want fam game maker yes 2916 me is that a jojos reference also me could i shut up its just 3 words the modern way of selling languages tm the gamer girl really reminds me of my girlfriend she does

series of unfortunate events and i thought i had it bad 3417 when something good actually happens to your life for once but your clumsiness decides to kick in at the worst time possiblecomment f to pay respect to manly so basically best girl with gorgeous cg and bittersweet personality this game likes its dead ends lol ah i like this canto voice acting anyone knows the names of the voice actor gohard still the best manly youve got the silhouette of an optimus prime and the body of a stand this is the definition of a good animecartoon crossover why when i see those aliens it reminds me of anal probing first so in the ending they win all the ailens and he confess to her they would go home probably in that ending the spaceship was broken or not i hope they can go back to home happily with their normal spaceship gohard is so amazing i love her so much 3 pardon the interruption we seem to be having some tentacle difficulties you should have fought the monster with the suit xd i am not sure what ntr is lol edit ooooooooh yikes when m playing the spaceship crashed to that tentacle monster and broked so she used to capsule to go back earth there is no other choices why this

wrong but before the battle of all the monsters like now yes date and bla bla bla before manley if she want a baby she was like no ugh but after was date and she says maybe we can have a baby all is like wtf dude resume girl i love u after was a prank xd but after date no babys but after baby yes all is bipolar a good way to start a video a bad ending nice v 2230 really caught you off guard didnt it fun factshe was he in my opinion the best ending in the entire game 2351 and 2014 maked me cry fun fact this was the best route for 60 of the players of otakus adventure including me this is very entertaining and the story is good gohard best girl ofc 3212 what a ahole move he did 2916 gohard aaaarghhghghg you are so stinking get out of me the garbage ending is pretty sad manly considers himself rubbish and he thinks the universe will be cleaner if hes dead 2144 manly finally confessed his love to gohard right in the middle of alien corpses and questionable liquids and tentacles what a lovely ending 2230 nsfw 837 manly a slime go hard to pretend to be a rock so that he can get gohard 421 manly i dont know some girls like slimes bought the game myself and finished all the endings its honestly an amazing experience with gohard being the clear best waifu obviously the problem with the other two girls is that one doesnt like you but is willing to spend her last moments with you so you dont really know her that well and the other one literally just wants to get married to the hero and barely shows any personality heck her ultimate ability shows more personality than the self she presents to the protagonist so thats saying something also gohard is the only one that has partial voice acting cantonese voice acting and an epilogue i never knew how much i need cantonese voice acting in my games until now ah please make another game already dev youre legend to me already gohardin fact it is ok to start from making baby meim out its cantonese shes speaking i just noticed but gohard is talking chinese isnt she in the she goes home ending even if manly never gets to go home he could still kiss the slime and have a gay happy ending manly vs instinct a saga can someone tell me gohard voice actor spoilers warning 3208 i feel like this is the canon manly route game is refreshing an old concept in a very nice way i like it that was fun gohard is awesome i was expecting her to just be an abusive arrogant one at first but she turned out to be totally adorable also the punching game turned out to look pretty fun im gonna pick this up thanks absolutely loved this route the language gohard is speaking in is cantonese and the voice acting was great really played out her character so well and made her super charming and lovable vanillad is justice change my mind after thinking about it if one of them transformed into a slime they could have had enough room in the escape pod bruh this game goes hard i cant get over her name this quirkiness of this game is so fun to watch you play really enjoying watching this series and the interactions between gohard and mc as well as the humorous endings and simple yet charming art style really reminds me of those old flash games id love to see you play a new horror point and click game translated by vgperson your turn to die ive just started playing it its pretty good and im invested so far it takes some gameplay and art style elements from some popular games looking forward to the full game look like someone gonna go hard tonight then he find the i go home happily ending xd 3248 im not sure if this is a grammtical mistake or not but i love that he said drink cola to eat potato chips punching rocks ntr and tentacles this game continues to surprise me im actually happy there was a genuine good ending with gohard though that was a hell of a first date i guess you could say gohard is kind of manly where is the special thanks to you manly i didnt see yr name lol ntr tentacles slimes and fisting this hentai really has it all ntr ending would just end with the hot dude just basically betraying gohard good ending route he wouldnt know how to use the arms bad ending he probably do what manly did the first time so the way i interpreted it is looks dont matter and her infatuation would have been lost in 5 mins had the route continued what a adventure i love the song that starts to play when the good ending startsi want to know what it is i am rubbish just like manlys soul jk i like gohard her brashness makes her kind of cute dibs that gohard route wont be toppled i feel like if there isnt an anime with a girl with robot arms and a guy helping her use said arms there definitely should be gohard more like one puuuuuunchh man you bet your ass im gonna draw fanart of this game ps gonna buy this and kios adventure like asap 2004 its like the end to dmc 5 im sorta worrying now that the other routes may not be as feasable as an option now that we know how awesome gohard truly can be an otakus bizzare quest for love i liked this ending gohards pretty moe best girl this was a quirky weird game but i really liked it it was fun to watch the bad endings were hilarious gohard or go home is it just me or did the broken translations just make this more fun that planet is like the worst tags in any doujin only thing missing is the ugly bastard theyre doomed nonetheless in the ntr routes because the asshole doesnt have manlys epic progamer moves to beat the hentai monster gohard is toxic but shes really cutee right the netorare is real waifu get after dying being ntrd twice being felt up by a tentacle monster overcoming your instinct to bash a rock finally manly gets lucky this is actually a fun game lol i wonder what the other routes are truly the best love story of all time i would love to see all the other girls routes too but i personally think gohard is the perfect woman for our protagonist babies arent environmentally responsible so thats a bad ending now getting your waifu stolen by someone whos not covered in space crap id say thats pretty close to a good ending considering the couple apparently seems capable of breathing on this pink planet without noticeable issue perhaps they both should have simply elected to stay there forever in the deadend route even if they must become slimes in order to survive in this scenario they still could have had a wonderful life together beneath the stars spending their days making little goo babies additionally i was actually rather looking forward to seeing some postcredit images following the best ending whereby manly and gohard escort their children through the same anime convention where mommy and daddy had their first date and somehow shat themselves to space it certainly is quite the love story worth regaling to future generations more for the fighting and more for the silly comedic love story wonderful well i came with 0 expectations and left pretty much with what i deserved can you beat lung cancer manly why didnt expect this to be so entertaining xd even with the messy translation work i feel like it adds charm to the game lol the game cant end until we defeat bobo and stop him from becoming the sequel protagonist to bobobobobobobo where was the stick from sowhats ntr i tried googling it but came up with nothing gohards name had this song stuck in my head for her route httpsyoutubeyaukceydsdw i can only blame me for not being good at learning i did not expect a relatable qoate from this game cant wait to see waifus route and that other chick she might have a route im surprised they genuinely got a lot of pretty unique ideas out of the punching minigame i didnt expect anything from this game and then im actually enjoying it this is the best game ever xd nice karma you get ntred back lol gohard is just too cute ore sanjou yo my man manly watch kr deno truly a man of culture manly looks like someones going hard tonight 2019 gohard is the best ive been waiting for this just finished the last one i cant wait 239 that toy was from kios edventure 3 is there a mei mei ending not even a minute into the video and i feel pointed at 1 more piece in the box of tissue okay what language was this originally 0447 this guy looks like the human version of sonic xs knuckles the story about the sharpest blade sounds like the lore of spectre and phantom assassinss arcana from dota 2 thats one pathetic looking batman dont use serenade when theres only one enemy manly does a serious slash on strong mom she dies instantly apparently manly hates cougars theyre not the waifu material for manly aaa manly the paranoiac remaster is here in english will you do a playthro of it anytime soon are you going to play the remake of paranoiac would love to see that 3033 is it just me or does this guy remind me of manly it broke the 4th wall and showed us what manlywith blue hair looks like when he makes his videos lol max level chemistry manly hes op as sin and the strong independent woman falls lol i heard that this game had a second episode wealth is weak can instakill everything but it cost a lot of golds around 15k17k i guess so many goofy boss fights this route has a lot more going on than i would have guessed it seems weve also got multiple worlds to explore with this game cartridge mechanic surprisingly few bad endings so far though and manly make a great team i gotta say im impressed that they had three different genres for three different routes i really want to see if it all turns out to be in his head or michaels place burning wealth is weak is op as fuck i really like the rpg aspect to this its as you have said before this game did have a lot of effort put into it despite how goofy or how engrishy the game is i must say i really love this rpg part of the game speedy boi physicist and chemist lol this game is so wild and so deep i think its at the end but nope the rabbit hole is apparently never ending i wonder if you have a lvl 5 can can you instantly skip to lvl 5 and get all the abilities along with it maybe its the goofy writing but something odd is happening with eye patch girl she said the friend couldnt pull out the sword but how did he get his cape which she said was the sign of a hero otaku didnt get your cape until after you unsheathed excalibur from the toilet which she said the friend could not and said he wasnt a hero i suppose its entirely possible he got his own cape but of the same color too which he wouldnt have seen before seems suspicious i think youre at the wrong door the leather clubs just two blocks down poke you well poke you leatherman im the boss of this gym yes im the hero manly badass hero it never gets old like comment share subscribe hit dat bell and did you remember i have a patreon omg manly pussing the toilet plug into the bat ass say what you will about the taciturn evil blade saint however the fact that this dour man was afflicted with a curse when wielding the imbued blade indicates that he unlike our otaku still managed to lose his virginity at some point the mechanics of this supposed special blade are a bit interesting as it apparently harbors the magical ability to ascertain the nature of its owners sexual experiences through contact with their dominant hand additionally the blacksmith seems to have prioritized strength at the expense of ductility since this exceptional blade shattered immediately upon use therefore it appears that manlys aptly named plunger sword which he removed from the bowels of the heros throne is evidently far superior especially when our heroes are in need of becoming unstuck from particularly sticky or rancid situations forgive me for the shite puns i wonder if kaiba is the last party member hey wait can you save up money and buy a higher level first and skip a level so he never moved from his room a blade that can cut through anything even a magical contract bless you manly for this upload theres so much content in this route im impressed i thought its just bonus secret route that pads itself with repetitive grinding but theres a lot of location and cgs i hope the ghost good what he wanted wink wink of course the slimefungus creature goes for the female characters first strong mom is dead just now someone becomes an orfan and dosnt know it i actually like the chemist because hes against the stereotypes lmao you should start to buy healing items i hate it when i lead a wave of team killed kinda surprised the fact he defeated the snake without lv 5 chemists sonic entered the chat this game is hilarious strong moms and graphic cards users beware ah shit here we go again did batman deserved to get brutallyplunged like that best lets player alive today yo i just watched this a couple of hours ago and now manly upload it hes fast manly uploads megreat 7w7 mereads title wot ah yes he is fast insert lenny meme this isnt jotakus bizarre adventure isnt it 1541 is is that the same cockadoodledoo as in good morning good morning on sgt pepper im just gonna call her kittyface omg these names istg at least make her name an actual name aoidhiwuafdwf i cant put this fucking chair 100 chinese joker a sword stuck in a rock a sword stuck in a shit poke youwell no comment i broke my fcking keyboard in anger cause i couldnt fcking put the ladder down its fcking shit my name is insert long pause eh 3517 that was so cheesy manly can i use it michael was there less than 10 minutes ago maybe just a few moments before manly went to find him already a better rpg than yiik p purple cloak william aftons gonna want that back and he always comes back a heap of burning otakus with gohard dead beside them this is heartbreaking please reset the game her name is nyoron gohards route is looking better better waifus cute but sociopath im assume the girl is named denko because of the creepy pasta or something how could you kill the best girl will you play kimi to kanojo to kanojo no koi once it releases this summer in english gohardto heaven t t i though her name is uwu she is bun bun in the final form 1031 its sho like show boh like ball n poor manly is going to grind for money a long time 749 ill be a really shitty hero pun of the year im kinda disappointed that mei mei wasnt an actual character she was actually kinda cute no dating sims anime girls man i dont think i can stand this path if im expected to stick to the one with the major risk of combusting as soon as i glance towards another girl 202 noooooooooooo 1113 not gonna lie id be fine with it shes a big tits onesama and also a witch butbut my sweet gohard noooooooooo why did you have to dieeee ttwtt the rookie could use hadouken shermie is best girl my opinion is now changed the otaku has now found himself in an isekai with a chuuni poor gohard and michael there was a bomb in the trash i doubt otaku would want to come back afterall the final girl is really moe i love dragon warrior still might have the cartridge how can we be sure she is not a he incredible a super noob multiclassed with hobo the game even if you play it doesnt have the happy ending you expect all three girls owo is there even a good ending 1010 lanlan the standalonecpmplex of gameindustri mfg olli would be girls name reference a geno true name of mario rpg not even 2 minutes in and you killed gohard now hey want a spoiler joke got em manly the not so badass hero her name is uwu or is it owo what is this konosuba god has a shitty sense of humor ryo has left the team dragon quest ix was my childhood the bomb in the trash well good luck i love your voice soo much and plus game is awesome as as well this girl making me think shes likely some kind of yandere heck maybe she killed all the villagers i dont like this route v no gohard no fun the plunger of promised toiletry excaliplunge i wish one day we see an anime or manga called i got reincarnated as a truck in another world and it should be set in a world where modern vehicles arent a thing yet and everyone he kills gets sent into his old world so you kill anime girls to get the next anime girl boobs or nerds at an arcade hall tough choice sent to another world as an otaku i can handle this laughs in subaru 2147 2149 manly mushroom mushroom me badger badger badger badger that fire extinguisher at the end lol im looking for a map to your eyes because i get lost in them uhhuh okay what a line d every time i see shobon i remember that story about an op his girl on 2ch wow i dident believe you when you said go hard is the best girl but damn she really was manlys yes when the girl tried to kiss the hero xd 1006 expanding on what manly said the kaomoji japanese emoticon is known as denkoshobon which is a mimeticonomatopoeic word for dejection or downheartedness 2707 like manly said that the character for middle or center in chinese is the red dragon tile in mahjong a chinese game it symbolizes the middle order of life animals which includes humans you play wrong way you go with waifu to have a great adventure and funny whelp the beginning just made me sad manlyshittyhero i love this game lol well turns out this third route is also wait is this mean gohard is the only nonevil sane girl option here starting this route off with gohard was actually a little upsetting still this is fun so far rpg battles for the routes gimmick is surprising the save button looks like a computer from the80s 1430 every 10 minutes is a missed opportunity is that whats implied right now this is amazing the guy who made the game to add this rpg content anime girl says manlys name isnt that of a hero thats where youre wrong kiddo so we have gohard waifu and a literal owo as wife options good game 1010 so you either gets stuck on an alien planet with no wifi destroy the world or be in an isekai im beginning to think getting turned into a dog is the best ending in this game just call her owo oof the anime girl is to oof wrll this is gonna be the longest rought if you gonna grind to be stronger finally manly badass hero can be the hero he was always meant to be the janitor hero 1057 manly aint amused gohard vs lol girl um well i guss the choice is do you like arms or thights how do i keep opening up youtube when you just uploaded a video first 5 minutes reminding me of konosuba yay another one how could you kill best girl isekai oh no i was reincarnated into an otaku wait nice hentai why u let him kill her 2826 maimai jubeat and iidx great chinese game and cantonese voice where is the link game plz why i life this i want not be single anymore i have this level but no gun pink man how to fix what u doing with that figure v chinese va you keep asking for a skip button but you never thought of saving before making your choices awesome gameplay man youre the only walkthrough i can find and the only reason also i got the game lol first i was like damn this looks cheap but then it clearly has a good humor i have done this kawaii route but i choose girl at arcade routefor those who have far therehow to fight alien with 1 eyeits damn hard 2857 here we go again pls just play serious man more plz i love this game 3 play otaku adventure more the steps of medical surgery also make nonsense at all and i laugh so hard to this puns okay i dont know why but the loudencer is the funniest thing in the game to me so far thats like something out of a mel brooks movie i love it manly next time can you not make dumb choices i get that theyre considered endings but its very annoying to me hey do you know that a gun can also be called a silencer i guess im not a real girl because i got the makeup question wrong d use the body it still hot xd 231 wait gohard can speak waifu can blink dafuq everyone here is unique eason sounds like which is mandarin for doctor had me laughing for a sec there xd i shoted waifu in this video manly uses a magical fast forward remote control to get instant silk from a baby silk worm after shooting a shirtless running man with a bad hairstyle to death hey hey its area 51 that remote was made in heaven 1732 introducing medic gun itll take all those wounds away bang i love the way that you say useless 2823 2835 2841 these are making me gohard rn 256 me well the body is still freash we aint gonna talk about how fast those people run also that ending where your nose bled 1134 manly murders an anime girl d nudist colony please play reventure there are like no good lets plays on it id hate to be manlys waifu boy would get me killed so many times out of curiosity and considering how on point his comments line up i think hes an otaku so funny so excited what a great games please play more this game is amazing xd the needle and thread is that a wario ware reference waifu route starting off well we suddenly got a shooting minigame the apocalypse is on the horizon and we got a bad ending for just shooting her that was great great episode what a way to go he popped a boner so hard his brains shot out his nose a true hero is it just me or is calling a little girl waifu kinda messed up my heart sank a little bit when he messed up by shooting one innocent right as he killed the last guy is the corpse party sachikos hysteric birthday playthrough gonna continuedont get me wrong i like this one as well but just wondering how to remove a bullet shoot the person with a bullet in their body yep seems fixed to me xd waifu out here looking like the female mc for pokemon sword and shield with silver hair good to see manly with an infinite ammo gun firing at matrix baddies while naked men runs around the street the mini game remind me with rail shooting game i feel nostalgic 1730 me she looks in painful what we can do about it manly guns gunshots me well i think guns is not the solution we are looking lmao time to win the heart of waifu poor waifu kept dying but shes pretty hard core i was wondering if the otaku would bleed out like that lets see what twists and turns we see now gohard or go home youtubers with asmrey voices are all someones waifu sorry manly someone out there has a body pillow wearing a distinctive red scarf you should play katana zero that game is rad as hell oh how nostalgic i remember shooting the trashcan in front of the store or something to get ammo and then pick the one route to chase the truck while shooting like manly badass hero the true horror is nearly naked people quite the fan service route eh i dont believe that man has ever been to medical school this series is mega sugoi new i want more i like that i wonder if you can use that remote on waifu to trigger another ending why is blood keep coming out of my nose is it because of the weather spits flaming moe onto ufo operating device brass restoration playthrough when that was my first vn back in the day lesson learned do not give manly a gun manly senpai are you going to play search party looks right up your alley also love this game still so silly i only have one question how much ammo does that pink gun have ky cafe hm does it stand for kill yourself cafe v just a thingbut arent patients files be confidential even if the thing is abandoned thats a huge lawsuit if i ever see one im gonna use that excuse later the funny thing is i am one bruh pour one out for waifuand another oneand another oneand another oneanotherall the cases the forest critters are getting crunk tonight oh shes an alien for sure oh god the shooting minigame gave me flashbacks to the point blank game what a trip down memory lane so this happens when you sleep early enough or how did you get here so gohards route has a cool fighting game and waifus has a shooter i wonder what the last route will have also i wonder what will be unique about the 3rd girl since people have already said and noticed gohard talks and waifu blinks waifu is not real go hard all the way 2310 i had the same problem and i was stuck before knowing the game wants me to put the lifting jack at a specific place under the rock god dammit if you think about it the game is tematic you have to beat go hard to win in a game of reflex and then confront several reflex base games without failing you save waifus live and then you confront several bloodie endings that guy pulled a agent smith now is the time to run theres so many ways to be a lousy husbando in this route i notice gohard talks and waifu can blink wonder why they have that unique things going for them noodist city is the best city where the party never ends and the love never stop you had bad hair anyway sounds legit and it wouldnt be an otaku story without pantsu d ive been waiting for this i was just waiting for it im a girl ok thenwhats your name manly bad ends music started playing id hate to be manlys waifu manly have you tried the game tsioque yet i think its one you might enjoy ah yes the manlyest girl hmmm so tryhard make you feel being safe with her waifu make you proteccc her man so hard to choose between these two cute and beauty especially after hearing waifus moan v agent smith was in this wut journeys i guess this is the lets see how many ways you can get someone killed portion of the game shes not your waifu she is waifu get it right manly finally manly upload i love your video yeah yeah waifu route is okay but when you gonna do the big tiddy first date girl not even 3 minutes in and you got waifu killed hey manilybadasshero could you play unturned cant wait for fanart mana layers of fearnya life is strange bang itu street fighter versi waifu 911 ada tissue cough spoiler hehealert waifu itu mau ngancurin dunia she is el weebs adventure the lord wibu bill fiatussalam first first third first its magician well someone played the house of the dead terrible ending terrible terrible terrible she deserved every single death that happened to her le sigh gohard is still the best by far o no contest you pull your urine and take care of your own respect uh bburn wow she is batshit crazy girl wtf it is actually dark magician of house of the dead dont yall think this route is tryna tell us something like how anyone would do anything for their waifu remembers that yandere incident in japan where dumb people actually want the crazy girl to get out of jail its the house of the dead its the magician from the house of the dead ah i see you are a man of culture as well it is always the way that young people with old people coloured hair are evil 2407 mankind nooooo some stupid person gave in to his waifu 2801 unlimited manly works i honestly thought this game wouldnt last pass 5 eps but hmm lucky day how to change to chinese version where is the mmm what you said jokes the best part of this is manly just trying to put leaves into a hole and wondering why that isnt the solution that feeling i dont know what to say except from inhibition the game is quite interesting i used to play should i believe women thank you for reviewing the game i love this route what is love we all know the answer anyone else catch the akbar and jeff reference play your turn to die please is this is the end or some more routs manly havent explored yet there is another ending in the arcade room with the machine screws you dont die but you meet another girl what is love baby dont hurt me no more i watch so calm then i turn my eyes to my potato and hear a gunshot dammit mainly i cant get enough of manlys humor and i love the way he emphasizes useless thank you for all the laughs i thaught that the other route of this will be by helping the boss and then going on a date whit him like a bromance like the one whit the waiter the first girl maybe mei mei remember kids this is why you dont given to what your waifu wants he can just kiss her and go back in time with her just to annoy her lol id do that the the final boss well that was dark w yo manly try this game if you havent already im certain it will fit your palette httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp520910 plot twist the girl that doesnt seem like a villian is the villian oh wait now im getting deathmark flashbacks as the saying goes choose the wrong waifu and it may ruin your laifu or at least those of everyone else on the planet some menjust want to watch world burn im assuming this game is translated from cantonese since gohard was speaking cantonese btw old bean lou dao means daddy in cantonese lmao moral lesson waifu will destroy your world first minute of the video manly shoots waifu me for gods sake i get it now this is what they mean when they say your waifu is trash ive learned so much today gohard is better than waifu i guess waifuroth has her charm but for me its either gohard or go home alone little did everyone know this is manlys favorite ending due to the end of taxes and taxes thanks for giving me the image of sephiroth as a short haired girl i am both laughing and terrified at the same time lol at the names in the ending credits not even one minute in and you already killed waifu twice your voice like a robot is this game basically saying otakusgamers can find love only with other otakusgamers so ends the otakus bizzare quest for love it totally was sephiroth i had a sneaky suspicion it would go that way old bean really was a more suckier version of the magician my mind immediately went to that we least we now know why we have the option to kill her on one hand being forever alone to save the world or the other where we get a kiss from our waifu as the world burns she was totally warming up to the otaku damn waifu is a psycho oh well we got a kiss so worth it oh i see her having so many death scenes was just karma never trust a waifu for ur own laifu there is a part when waifu get hit by lamp you met the doctor and you need to choose which i forgot to lead you with that doctor 2403 and 2810 were a little funny to me not gonna lie this game is so weird but so fun to watch looking forward to seeing who the last girl is i think waifu route seem hard other than gohard isekai world am i the only one who can hear the reload noise lol i am sad that too little of the people i know get it when i say useless they have no idea why i saw it the way i do manlykill waifu every time when there is a chance waifu i feel very safe when i am with you i suppose making compromises for the sake of love is quite common though i suspect most people have certain delineated limitations to what theyre willing to endure or sacrifice for a potential partner manly seems to be woefully deprived of such standards or rather any standards at all beyond physical beauty and for his evidently misanthropic waifu has willingly assented to indiscriminate murder the destruction of humanity and shooting mr bean in the genitals thus preventing the exposed man from birthing further baby clones of himself out of his penis our otaku has never exactly been a bastion of morality as evidenced by his decision to allow the rapidly aged waifu to bleed out and die simply because he was no longer attracted to her so it appears his prioritization of momentary romantic or sexual gratification over the lives of billions is considered justifiable in his sad creepy mind considering waifu also despises and desires the death of all animals on earth wh hotd dayum so thats why the gun pink colored and have unlimited ammo a charming heroine with a twisted intention and world end ending oh hello again senri akane it has been a long time that aside the ending music is actually pretty good not special or anything but it stand out from the rest of the bgm so far its not the same bgm from gohard route right remember kid never trust people who had a evil plan to do manlys new upload get i think new route appears if u fix the arcade machine nice romantic apocalypse hey at he got a kiss waifus route was funny but i still prefer gohards 436 your inventory is unlocked during this i wonder if you can use the gun while you guys are having this moment together xd you were supposed to teach waifu to love humanity so she wouldnt stab you in the back that or dig in her innards to find the fifth element and stop the metoers but whatever free oxytocin maybe other ending from the first girl that leave otaku the best part is kill waifu everytime great now prepare for the route the longest route in the whole game because of the amount of farming required by the way is there actually way to pronounce i read it as nyan because it reminds me of cat mario help some stupid person gave in to his waifu i thought that was very common these days this game is hilarious all i could think seeing this was the ending episode for waifu route was that was really fast i forgot about the whole meteorite thing initially the final boss battle remind se me of the nude beach guys from kill la kill didnt realise this was the long awaited house of the dead remake sees blood on the bed anime mindset takes over nevermind waifu being injured performing surgery on her all the nosebleeds a romantic moment commentary like that is gold but this game on its own is hilarious i crack up every time mbh says what 2525 this may change after meeting the last girl but until then waifu is worst girl well look like shooting wafiu was actually a good ending all the logic of this world is just grand now if only destroying the world was so easy nice unlimited blade works reference p plot twist its a male alien character for the final cgs gohard still best waifu this is nice but everyone remember that the witches heart multiending release is looming over us 2402 bells frog big cherries peter pan magic cheese waifu also i cant believe the sephiroth joke paid off that well p so as it turns out choosing gohard route indeed did not cause letting earth get crashed by meteorite so glad to know lol also love the sonic movie logic here fast enough to dodge bullets not to small rock aware enough to dodge bullets from a distance not to have your shoes and socks removed point blank wonder if those endings of otaku suddenly shooting waifu was a zero time moment of him saving the universe without him knowing i think the last girl is the one you met at the very beginning that you went on a date with maybe or maybe it aint a waifu and its your best friends route forgot his name already edit apparently its blonde chick not mei mei top 10 anime betrayals i chose the nice girl thx gosh i didnt bother with this waifu knew she was a thot when we met happily chose gohard competitive strong unreliable and she goes hard too hard best part of this route is 1 kill waifu everytime 2 useless how to play a visual novel if presented the opportunity during a romantic moment gun down the girl you are going for it is a great way of completing the route wow mind of steel ending and heaven feels vibes here lol finally damn that guards feet are nasty also damn gohard route is still the best at least you dont have to commit global genocide to be with her that fate reference tho lol waifu dont give up until the last minute manly dont worry theres plenty of moments to shoot you this girls in the game is dummy thicc mm broken english to make a romantic moment that much better i want that pink gun unlimited ammo authentic look so pretty much waifus only existence is to die over and over again finally i was waiting for it man i am team gohard but waifu is pretty cute and interesting too my original theory was that waifu was actually mei and the ending where the protagonist is waiting happens after the lamp falls on her and she dies it would also be a good twist i dont know if this theory will be true i doubt it edit nah that was fast loud gunshot see the time where you killed her was the true ending lmao man im loving this youtube channel nice work romantic music playing there she is immediately shoots and kills i like to say the witches name as owo hey i think first hero would be a great money grinding bcuz with chemist op skill wealth is weak its power depends on your money saving if chest 2k of your money it can deal 10k damge so after killing him youll get 5k using the revivel bottle u can keep doing this everyday and i think the bucket full of revivel bottle is unlimited useful advice right the start to the 2 spirit fight was pretty creative ngl just throw money at it its a good thing you always get plenty of loot anyway but there never was a truer solution to a problem or battle 2606 fun fact hei wu chang and bai wu chang are a pair of gods in chinese folk religion who bring the spirits of the dead to the underworld together they are refered to as heibai wuchang or the black and white spirits of impermanence 3652 money is too strong no mere otaku can be the power of money thats a line sirius would say p i think the guitars are a flcl reference when manly got excited by that magic fire tho just like real life money is power so this is monei power this game is amazing are you a wimp do you feel that youre rich but arent strong well no problem just throw 2000 coins at your enemy and they take over 10000 damage and die instantly xd manly went into bat queen route at 1241 in this inverted castle manbat serves as the alfredbutlerelevator service bat queen wanna stay here and be a prince manlybadasshero saves progress ok now im actually in love with that bat girl shes super cute she can bite me any day seriously though the original hero is basically the protag but fat lol chemist strong bad end marrying an extreme chuuni btw this fight lasted around 11 minutes screw the boss i have money not the most original commentbut eh know i get itmoney its really strong calling it fire extinguisher is for the lava rip was wrong i didnt want to hold off on watching this episode i was busy manlys musical instrument is the bass fish my little witch stupid fucking hamster face oneshot him with money getting more money from battle reward ressurect money oneshot again this is truely a cruel farming technique to torture someone with lol this game is running in circles chasing its own tail at this point chemist op lol poor vampire queen you just arent an option in this game its nice to see this game recognizes just how powerful money is though considering you can oneshot what i would assume is the strongest enemy in the game with it bat girl is best girl but sadly therere no route about her i guess the revive barrel could be used for the people in the arcade 3626 this game is a gem watches omg can you go with the queen watches yes awesome watches oh damnit i somehow forgot about my exploding crotch throwing money in this game is broken the weight of coin is something to fear i suppose behold the power of money i really like this route too bad gohard was the only one who had voice acting it was cute i really the chemist has some interesting attack the vampire queen was moe there hasnt been many weird bad ends this route but its been fun i wonder if his crotch will explode if he leaves this world with out the witch i like how the money attack was so overpowered and one shoted the first hero but it was hilarious on how you could essentially kill him over and over poor rotting ghost dude tho i honestly thought this game wouldnt be as long as it is or so diverse rather color me impressed cant wait to see the ending oh boy easy grind option need very very seriously slash ahahaha witch girl is worst girl smh shouldve let you get the cute vampire big tiddy goth gf throw money around all your problems uses 2000 money and receive 5000 noice looks like the first hero is to grind money any girl makes slight advances towards player character manly going for that 100 run cowabunga it is sirius is now mad at the chemist for blatantly throwing cash around damn chemist is luke from the letter this is so paytowin this chemist to throw so many coins at such great speeds to do five digits of damage definitely did not skip arm day definitely looks like the first hero fight is designed for farming money to quickly closethis portion of the game slam him with 2k gold to oneshot him win 5k gold back revive him with a bucket of practically endless revives then repeat until you can buy everything seriously does this chemist have a shotgun hidden away somewhere money is the real hero pay to win is the secret to true heroism pay your alchemists people if at first you dont resurrect then youre probably not fricking seto kaiba need that vampiregirl route holy snap im early normally its been out for 8 hours before i get to watch it manly uses money fallen hero dies in one shot me are you sirius xd i want a 1 hour video finally this witch is great but i still like gohard more so far she felt more fleshed out as a character somehow 1842 end of bat queen fight for those aimlessly scrolling through comments only 30 views yet man this one is so fresh it certainly wont die until someone throw a battery in their water tank thanks for the great stuff manlybadasshero i think i like this girl more then the others thats probably why they saved her for last shes the best smash bros online can wait quickplay lags anyway when manly uploads i also really like the battle music where can i find this ost hi there manly you have great videos heres a timeline after otaku went on his adventure and saved everyone from death the world becomes an apocalypse world and kio starts her adventure sure is a bad idea to go back to bobos place especially after all that adventuring youve done xd saves the girl girl molester a fireman that sounds like mickey mouse now i will never be able to sleep at night firefighter mickey god that brings back memories i miss magical quest that game was awesome hows everything looking blue whats with this game and kios adventure xd 1952 original meansi eat someone who drink this tea i lost it whe he mirowaved his phone his kitchen look so familiar like kios adventure its so creepy mc entire lines and choice is terrible very natural is the character on the resume supposed to be iumi from love stage httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvk2pvuhupvo it is bobo filipino dictionary bobo noun idiot commonly used to insult a person and is an overused insutlt in most multiplayer games i like how fireman mickeys voice pretty much went through puberty halfway through speaking phone in microwave slayed my sides xd you are so crepy man but i still fucking like you 3 3 just realized that the va spoke chinese every time i hear something about tea i always think about it going to taste like bitter almonds lmao 1325 yeahhh you have the power nintendo powerr 1000 this reminds me of a game or a manga where the heroin insults the mc too much and the mc pushes her onto an incoming train killing her was it one of charons games oh i think i remember now it was a scene from a manga called shikii no juunin by takako shimura shes the hourou musukowandering son author the mc didnt kill the girl nor was she the main heroin he just kicked the girl in the tammy and stopped her from getting on the train which he was on im glad this game exist wait hold every fucking phone bobo we are so boboned speaking chinese this game is pretty quirky im enjoying watching it waiting for corpse party w i actually would not blame bobo for murdering him he destroyed his figurines ate his pet fish and mess up his resume manly is as good as dead when he goes back to his apartment this looks interesting suddenly cantonese spits water what ok cantonese is the last thing i expect in games j u s t d o i t hey if anyone has a link to his kio videos could you please send it to me 2621 the pic on the right is literally tanya degurechaff lol i may have ruined the rest of his life but at least i cleaned his toilet manlybadasshero 2019 im touching your chin but i dont actually touch your chin its only virtual so its ok best quote right here manly has healing saliva add it to the lore lol now i know to never ever let manly get in my house ever against normal pong ai the opponents ball tracking speed doesnt increase and neither does the ball speed there the game is aboutarranging a cornertocorner shot that the ai cant track fast enough to catch as the ball at its peak vertical speed is slightly faster than the ai tracking but this girl tracks the ball faster and faster as the ball speeds up i dont think shes meant to be beatable that one point was just a fluke secret date should be kio aside from starting the video off by dying from waiting so long this route seems to have some potential now we just have to hope bobo doesnt kill you time for more of an otakus bizzare adventure a little bit in and we are starting with death why does everyone think the otaku is creepy i mean there are more creepy options calling herself waifu was so hilarious otaku really must have horrible luck bobos place was really creepy if you time it right you can see right when manlys heart breaks what a horrible friend lol least we got some deepest lore money i see what sirius did with his life after witchs heart im glad i can understand what the red hair girl said 1543 is that a jojo refference any reason why you went mickey mouse for that fireman this guy with glasses look familiar is that guy from the kios series reference dont drink the tea manly this maybe think he has a watermelon look like blood im telling you hey manly can you play layers of fear 2 i really like your playthroughs you molested me really d lol for those who dont know who bobos deep history is from watch kios adventure where the guy makes his big reveal beforehand its one of manlys particular interesting playthroughs 1238 reads pong book girl difficulty has been reduced to 0 me well that was a bonely ending i only shop at money with money because i am rich yknow im supprised that you only have 200k subs your content is god tier more please the mc is such a creep xd idk the option with licking her ankle had me dying cus the face she made lol exactly how i pictured me looking xd that shocking moment when the girl started speaking in cantonese 833 shes talking cantonese for some reason that makes everything she says even funnier i didnt know mickey mouse was in this game nice i am so unused to hearing cantonese ina game especially when she is the only va character the power of manly with hacking game and make girl think you good xd but seriously please fix bobos resume poor guy power to the gamers the bgu is official kio and otaku are gonna team up to defeat anime thanos i like how when bobo showed up manly immediately put mouse over the computer icon to save when she ran out the store he said liar you didnt twist your ankle at all lol that was pretty funny i hope you will beat her legit next time manly why did they put 2 type of screw in the same plate im just thinking of how a girl would respond to hi im manly manly badass hero justice of weeaboo well youre on your way to scoring with not one but two waifus good job i bet going back to bobos house will make us appreciate all other endings prob our head will be in refrigerator next time bobo flashback to kios adventure oh no the ambient music in bobos house sounds so much like planes flying in the distance that i had to pause the video if it actually was just planes i was hearing man i want more of this that cliffhanger omg 238 the fuck are these choices saves girl from dyinggirl immediately assumes you were trying to feel up on heryep this was made in the current year all right it shouldve been called the trials of a cantonese speaking otaku hello i subbed after watching the first ep that got recommended to me a girl ive twisted my ankle what should i do next me watchinglet me take you manlyfirst were gonna make a save were boned andget dump what miserable j honestlyi find bad translations to be hilarious so i enjoy this game lol im actually thinking this game is a sequel to otakus adventure even though kios adventure was made before otakus adventure play enter the gungion new game boi this game pushes levels of demonetization that shouldnt be possible one day you should really play lone survivor is pretty much kios adventure with many gameplay details is short and have tons of different finals wait u can watch the script from another youtubers to know what happens cant wait to meet our lovely friend bobo if you like horror game maybe you should try bendy and the ink machine the tiles will be likeif otaku adventures is made out of ink lol how to profit put otakus adventure in the title hope shit my hope come true in one tick but an otaku also can find some girl cuz otakus are also people who can find some love someday i know i know waifu was a bad girlmore for betray the protagonist but she is so cute and i love that doctor otaku solo waifus sexis xd vicio recordas sword with sauce vicio te sigo desde hace 2 aos y la verdad me haria ilucion que llegaras a 10000000 millones de subs sin vistas 8 likes 1 comentario

i think i lost 0255 her names gohard well at least it matches with manly xd what a weird anime the game was so poorly funded they couldnt even get a american actor heck barely even 5 lines while im getting at that they couldnt even get all the characters voiced they really were bankrupt the voice acting caught me off guard gohard in chinese mean arouse most of the people in this anime fes are uploaders from bilibilicom its like a chinese youtube innocent me thought gohard was a play on being a tryhard was i the only one who thought ntr stood for netorare manly just sit on the toilet when the poo is about to popping i cant believe that the game parodied phoenix wright really well like way too damn well like grotesquely well this is the only part that made me genuinely laugh so far every other laughter for this game was just strained and confused why is the translation so wonky p this reminds me of danganronpa 2837 can you gif my the link in chinese language that boy called hans is called china boy mvv and fiodo are both actual chinese doujinshi artists lol 2805 manly and gohard secretly conspiring to expose the baldiness of a criminal woman what a great 1st date experience and gohards influence instantly transforms manly from shyforeveraloneotaku into phoenix wright its such an inspiration to see manly progressing from getting nearly braindead from having his hand grabbed tightly by his 1st girlfriend into a man savagely tearing a bald womans hair indirectly a wind blew through the head whirring whirring how do you whir i thought when the girl asked manly his phone number manlys gonna answer ive microwaved my phone last night and it exploded 10 million for shit art hmm i see some reality in this whats idubbbz doing in this game its very cringy if you dont understand cantonese wtf gohard manly nice wife ye got ther did the really manage to ryhem most of this game has an awkward english translation gohard sounds like a name a captain of a kings royal guardsmen or some shit would have the most free time in life is just sit on the toilet when the poo is about to popping xd am the only one who think this gameplay made my day xd cc is actual a uploadersame as youtuberfrom bilibilicom and she got 3905000 fans yes 39m subscriber the character who bought the shit picture for 10 000 000 looks like animated manly with inverted colors ah yes a wise man once said the most free time in life is just sit on the toilet when the poo is about to popping 2124 manly i am mvevvwvff looks like team manly is blasting off again manly go hard fun fact as an asian that can speak cantonese her name gohard translate into cantonese actually means erection lmfao kios adventure totally not a jojos bazaar adventure rip off xd 427 what is that gohard what is this dragon ball z give money to the devs speaking only mandarin id guess this is some dialect maybe cantonese tf just happened at the end wheres your waifu did she get ntred recolor cc and youd get manly lol shut up weebo chan holding hands how lllewd manlygohardbadasshero for the record 200 000 hong kong is 26 000 us 22 000 or 20 000 great game cant wait to see more xd oh no she looks like cody is she gonna get burned alive anime girls check manlyest man check a lot of likes no manly never whisper in my ear ever again about handholding death by explosive diarrhea an artist by the name of mvv actually exist i know dont know about fiodo i just started watchung and holy fuck this is cantonese compared to how everything else has gone so far in this game this was actually a fairly successful date with gohard who doesnt want an ace attorney trial on their first date i didnt know they added idubbbz into the game what 3442 that sounded way cooler than it should have weird story but please keep playing manly the adventures of manly gohard and hans well this just keeps getting weirder but hey the otaku got a date with someone at a con so it was a good positive it had so many things cons actually have the translation really tanked in this one guess hans was really tall there werent that many bad ends but it sure did end weirdly enough really loved the phoenix wright lil segment sorta did remind me of the first case it can get any weirder can it creepguys adventure is back wheeee x3 fat fantasy 7 im confident there is a porno called exactly that somewhere on the internet what a day narrowly missing ntr rooms solving mysteries and being rocketed into the sky i thought something might happen like meifirst girl or waifu might be at the convention as writers or cosplaying and were too embarrassed to admit they were weebs at first but no they were too normal i guess demonetized for handholding content fuck they didnt even censor the handholding how in the world is this safe for public viewing your you live a hard life ending made me laugh so hard i hurt my own ears thank you for youre always awesome commentary and uploads manly your you live a hard life ending made me laugh so hard i hurt my own ears thank you for youre always awesome commentary and uploads manly of course your waifu isnt voiced shes not real been waiting for this im playing this game as well but im on a completley different route id rather wait to watch your gameplay than spoil myself by playing ahead on your route manly play battle cats its really good game hand holding in my otaku adventure how scandalous manly green filthy thief a duplicitous man in a terrible tingle cosplay live action phoenix wright roleplaying and people blasting off like team rocket through the combined propulsive power of an earthquake and explosive shite admittedly ive seen some rather ineffable things transpire at conventions but the latter occurrence is surely a new one for me im not quite certain why our protagonist and his date were suddenly subjected to this unfortunate situation but the absurd images detailing it in conjunction with the faulty translation were just a bit much to digest all at once holding hands wait thats lewd i liked the initial part of the game did they actually run out of money for it to turn into this garbage first reaction wat edit wat edit2 after ending wat i just saw your stats at the end of the video and im forced to call a tactical nerf 1833 negamanly appears 2352 how do you prove that you are a boy the game doesnt make it clear but i wonder how the suspect proved that xd 2837 fun fact the protagonist said you are lying in chinese its interesting how the japanesedanganronpa equivalent would be sore wa chigau which literally means that is different now i wonder if the japanese are somewhat less confrontational than the chinese 1847 cancan i call this negamanly instead manly gohard with hans it writes itself honestly 1830 i didnt know a bluethemed manly was going to be in the game smoking is not a moe trait legit someone at my work literally did just that with a cellphone only the phone was visible to the customers so someone said hey thats my phone the real owner was absolutely livid my name is manly manly thats a terrible name noooooooooooooo my name is gohard oh i see we have a similar naming convention here xd the garbled english made me put down kios adventure but seeing this game i might pick it back up oh boi another video rip my sleep schedule 039 manly are you the only voiced person in the world yes yes she is knew you would upload today ohboy hand holding is illegal and youll be punished for your crimes 10 days in owo jail its such a shame that the translations got a lot worse in this part it looks like the creators werent kidding when they mentioned theyre running out of cash i really hope they get out of this tough bind finally a game where you can hurt filthy frank idubbz sure has fallen hard after content cops is over i cant believe he resorted to petty theft in conventions nowadays just a word of caution when you find anything or a lost person and need to broadcast it over the intercom never talk about the content or detailed description of the thing or person let the claimant describe the object or thing themselves there are actually people who tries to steal things this way and the receptionist needs to take every possible caution to return things to their rightful owner manly are you a practitioner of the ntr arts im sure this date will go fiiiiiine i dont know why but cantonese sounds very asmr to me for some reason and before this turns into a crazy murder snuff film the girls name gohard lol the only reason shes voiced is probably because baka waiting for bobo to murder your girl like first i have been waiting all day for this great video okay 2nd acct xd owo first is there a way to fix the the spaceship crashed into a monster ignore this i just need to win against that flying alien and when they return the earth is destroyed by waifu whatthey live in that planet bad ending nice job doing the improv grammar corrections on the fly oof noice views elgin laughingdoge you are the best youre 18 20 years ago sorry for the audio guys accidentally used a wrong mic heh do i have to save the girl or i have to save her and tell her that i will lick her ankle

looks like fun having the old dating sim vibez i need the ost of this game hahaha lol man just when he mc thought he found the ending of his life in the confssion scene life slapped him in the face with an escapepod hahaha nice video man gohards storyline would be more interesting if you understand cantonese her name in the original text is its like a cantonese joke it is a homophone with hard boner in cantonese maybe thats why in they translated to gohard in english thx again who give me info about space alien fightbut now i stuck at octopus boss fight any idea how to defeat iti have smack that 3 octopus arm you should open the vacum part to get the ball of dust after that clean it and you get a key to the locked room ps you should play soul music for the ghost to get best ending if you go to the space with gohard when you face oneeye monster try not to touch the controller at all may be you should try enter the gungeon when you complete this yay more adventures pleb i thik the ost of kio is the music the ghost want there is a ball of dust in the vacum can wait was that a phoenix wright reference i was looking for the one who played this game thank you i dont like where this is

can you play offline i just wanna play as moto3 normally im not a race game kinda guy but more like action shooters im willing to give this game a try though this looks the exact same as 18 i wont be able to play this i would keep thinking of road rash and road redemption when a bike is next to mine is it 60fps or 30fps on consoles hi any news if this can run 60fps to pro or x how smooth the game on 30fps this is ps4 slim or ps4 pro i have ps4 slim can i play the motogp 19 game always the same game since vr46 edition lol only a few more days until my copy arrives pop it into my ps4 pro and let it rip this game must deliver otherwise ill curse your name till eternity all the licensed series racing games are just sell the bikes or cars to rideforzapcarsiracinggt and others it is just so much better have a game with great variety should have shown more karel abraham ka17 motogp wc2019 yessss cool d you english cook suckeryour videos sucks and i hope you leave moto gp gameand doing the same thing as whit f1 game can you create a rider my eyes hurt to see the gameplay in assen they have dainese suit and shark helmet now motogp19 approved noobhhhhhhsorry how does the bike perform thats some accent just a simple question can you make pits stops and is there a safety car hope you can do custom championship so i can swap texas for laguna can wait for that game will there be the split screen multiplayer the customization looks so fuckin sick im so hyped right now how u can get the game how u can get the game does motogp19 run at 60 fps on ps4 pro seems like the helmet editor is similar to ride 3 livery editor yass please make it a series once the game comes out seems cool pre season testing nice touch milestone what would make things even more interesting is if they allowed you to test for teams at pre season while still being a moto 2 and 3 runner how come mm93 look like an arrogant ass in pit box haha no vr who would will be the first custom rider for motogp historical will motoe be in it though also the helmet editor looks sick plz play more of this game you can finally change suits thank god i like all this customization really hyped for this but the game seems a little slower than gp18 any info on how much will it cost im absolutely gonna love this game f1 2019 for sure getting now i have to decide wrc 8 or motogp 19 i love the video oops aarav you arent able to jump straight into motogp class in 18 at least i wasnt able to after red bull rookies cup so nice work otherwise i want to see this editor in f1 2019 helmet editor well sign me the hell up for this game i love the new camera angle i played this game a few days ago with all assists on and its so hard if u think f1 with all assists off is hard this is something different cant wait same shit different year make this the top comment for aarav to make a new noob career lol youre so trash in the game aarav u suck at motogp great video as always tho keep it up wheres motorsport manager exclusive not to sure u understand the word hopefully this years game isnt as buggy and glitchy as last year because motogp is a far better sport than f1 and the game should replicate that araav great content as always since you are testing out f1 2019 you could maybe whisper in the ears of the devs for helmet customisation in f1 might be a bit too late but perhaps as an update idk shark is finally in the game finally some ducati gameplay carrer mod of moto gp 2019 i live near this track my last motogp game was 2009 i remember this looks impressive think i will buy it this year as a long time motogp fan i have confidence that this will be a very promising game 526 shinya nakano actually came second with kawasaki at assen in 2006 not 2005 swear i saw the mugello game play on robo 46s video was this on a base ps4 or ps4 pro how many fps is this years gaming running 30 or 60 did it feel smooth helmet editor wish codemasters put it in f1 now nice new camera make more videos with mtogp 19 what is the name of the track he raced on from like min 300 or just the first track or whatever u guys understand me i bet you drivd the ducatilol cool i might get 2020 game for kymiring all we need is formula e and i can satisfied my game library it says helmet editor im salivating i might get motion sickness from playing that myself but i would really like to see you play this game especially the historical challenges you should play motogp often its a bit strange to see aarava play motogp game is it in 60fps cos the 30 from last year totally fucked with my eyes place your bets on how many times will aarava crash please do the career mode glad you showed the menus aarav no one else from what ive seen has done that seems like we can choose the brand on our leathers now too which is neat nice to see the ducati is still incredibly slow in a straight line in comparison to the yamaha also love that first person camera in the wet definitely getting this game why cant the helmet editor be on f1 bring back ron weasley are we able to play multiplayer with more than 10 ai drivers because this was stupid do a carrer it will be so funny and weird to see you play it again i really like the menus and user interface nice and presentable motogp isnt that anathema for an f1 devotee where is motosport manager you are so bad on this game please bring back the noob career whens the game going

lorenzo first where is motorsport manager episodessss you were as much bad ass like us change this fucking camera jerk despite of not following the line you overtook bikes ai is shit omg yet you suck

to south korea of three key materials used in smartphones displays and semiconductors from july 4 tokyo is aiming straight at koreas mainstay exports japan will stop preferential treatment for the three key materials bound for south korea requiring exporters to seek permission every time they ship items to south korea tokyo has not confirmed the report but its plausibility is high given the

this is my first time watching your channel and i generally expected some good content and to find out what this game was about but instead i just got a bunch of crap and now think this game is trash game or dont game at all 1129 159544 was the fastest time set by jorge lorenzo in fp3 back in malaysia 2015 lmao hey make this video again i think motogp 18 has the better graphics i live the controls too i downloaded this motogp19 for the updated riders and bike colors the way they are bragging about graphics is it really good picks an hjc over avg helmet time to not watch anymore hey does someone know what is the ant post including the colored circle and number on the speedometer under it means sometimes the post just turns red after less than 1 lap and my tyre went all crazy thanks for subscribe ride in cockpit viewyoull be better dirty air is a huuuuge thing in motorbike racing bikes can overheat in the slipstream and you get buffeted behind other bikes and it can affect braking the wings in 2017 actually caused riders behind to lose the front end and crash on corner entry because of what it did to the wind hey i found the whole video really funny i can relate reminds me of my early times playing the series xd nice race tho how to get a good start dont ever do a video like this again thats just advice cuz iv unsubbed and will snub you forever because of this your shit so im a new f1 fan and im getting 2019 any tips for a guy using just a controller it will literally pain you playing forza and then seeing the graphics in this game please continue this series at least until the start of your f1 2019 career mode your ai is trash come on 88k views 23k likes continue please he says its hard to make it around the corner in time but yet they fly around the corners a lot faster than f1 cars btw not happy with amount of effort put into video this is worse than a bad araava video what do ant and post indicate on the hud and i do the same in the spells braking is horrible in this game in motogp i did not have anything like that in motogp 19 its annoying to play like that ive tried all kinds of motorcycle settings but for nothing does anyone know what we can do to have ok brakes in motogp19 youre so bad the game is not bad youre just stupid asf which one is better comparing to ride 3 you shit on motogp but its 10x as exciting to watch as f1 hahah obvious that u are f1 player when i see how late u want to brake d haha 3 625 who remembers youtuber championship monaco series 2 matt really hard ben ready for turn 1 thanks for not just embarrassing yourself but neglecting such a great game theres that much that this game does right and youve just taken the piss out of it a video regarding your hair loss would of been more interesting what i really hate about the motogp 19 is the shifting down i cannot make a quick shifting down like previous version of motogp everytime when im hiting to the corner along to the braking i have to wait to the engine rev going down to the white rev that i could shift the gearbox down f i want to do the sliding into the corner like the motogp 17 but anw the motogp 19 is pretty interesting i can control the bikes lean angle so easy and so smooth and on high speed which is over 300kmh you can feel the bike shaking over the wind so real motogp is way more competitive then f1way more takeovers i love f1 but no one has balls like bikers your effort for this video was lack luster when milestone did such a great job motogp is brilliant what difficulty was your first race on 2017 my first race i played 40 difficulty now i do 110 my fav game i hope i can get this game thanks for all the videos you do i really enjoy them f1 youtubers 2018 doesnt touch anything non f1 f1 youtubers 2019 plays everything nonf1 i know its hard but not that hard your adaptability is terrible stick to carsyou suck at this really really bad what a piece of shitdid you really sayed that contact in motogp doesnt hapenslolgo back to your f1 shit fuckdifficult is what 15lol why are this f1 assholes like you aaaarrraava riotbullshitbox playing motogp 2019 if you dont understand a shit of this sport you guys want money just work fuckers this is my riding style httpsyoutubem8vh41hxla wtf you see contact in all the races so ben does blackpanthaa finally admit its a mouth and not a nose looking for expert opinion in the field here you should get into moto gp crazy close racing shift down i corner ya donkey love this bro great sense of humor this vid got you a sub cover some more motogp when is this game on android 1400 the game gave you those tires tiametmarduk because they were they tires you qualified on sound is kinda cheap but looks alright looks the same as the the one i played last motogp 2004 anyone know how to turn off auto tuck can you do a video on the f1 you tuber squad i changed the controller vibration setting but there is barely noticeable feedback from bike to the controls anybody els who has the same experience another career mode for the scrapheap 2430 the ducati mechanics my friend u brake way too late what a shitty video if you have no interest in the game dont play it more you are not even trying just stop dont upload anything until u start with f1 2019 where u will be complaining all over about everything thank you just try to do something entertaining 044 hmm no sign of hailee steinfelds face rip crutchlow says the guy whos called marduk have you even ever watched an actual motogp race ben im sorry to anyone watching youtube plays ad never play this game again just realized the change of commentators from last years game so glad i ride a bike irl so i know more bakst the physics do more career mode please every track has a different tyre setup if that makes sense circuits like spain you need like a med on the front or something this game is surprisingly great the first motogp that i actually liked f1 needs this winter testing session just keep this as a weekly series or so cause this is awesome i was really sad when you stopped your motogp 2018 series not a moto gp fan better pronounciation then arrava i for one thought this video was hilarious everything is not made to be taken seriously would like to see a bit more but with a more serious approach what happened to career mode on f1 2018 sorry dude may i know you played this game via a pc or ps4 console as another youtuber on here does moto gp it is the easiest game on the planet with no experience with the game easy af love ur vids tho bro great fun powe of pink helmet just stick to f1 u frikin fat ass everyone crying about his effort for the vid should be crying about milestones effort in the game legit felt like you was like meh about this game because of your tone of voice this is miles ahead of 18 such a great game we need more 1641 contact absolutely happens in motorcycling last mugello gp case in point absolute ridiculous player i think you were trying to be funny but it was just cringy all i see in video is ben messing around and having fun but some blokes cant believe how can he not take this seriously and have fun nobody all youtubers motogp 19 career mode i got a notification today vettel p1 before id watched it thanks pal when braking try to feather the brake to do well so sad this series is already over can ben win or will he bottle it sorry ben this is cringy try harder or dont play at all doing yourself and your channel a disservice this might be someones first time watching your video put your best effort youtuber championship on motogp 19 yesterdays f1 video the motogp editor is so much better plays motogp basic customization but you can put generic stickers and emojis on your helmet wtf why cant you do both series variety is the spice of life ben lol no contact in real life you should watch a bit more motogp maybe please play more of this game i would love to see it dont make fun of motogp we can do better and u suck deal with it this video was a joke 2003 mickey mouse that you 1555 absolute pelican xd i am gonna coin that 906 i love everything about this anybody else realize he got 2nd on track anyway lol why do you start these when youll stop next week live stream race aarava and see whos quicker this vid is a mistake do whatever you like and makes you happy its like you give no fucks about it you should make this a series for now ben until the new f1 game comes out try and make it a series maybe you will learn a few things from the game on how to control the bikes you should watch motogp sometimes ben it begins at redbull rookies and you would put effort to climb up the ranks to moto3 moto2 and finally motogp also try and analyze how the riders manage their tyres because they would rather put harder compounds on the rear for a long race durability plus the petronas yamaha srt is just a sister team of the monster yamaha its like red bull and toro rosso you should learn the brake button the start and end moto gp career mode cant say that was impressive such a good video series opportunity neglected please stop playing or play properly this is just painful to watch dude if youre going to put zero effort and make this video all cringy and annoying dont bother your entire 2019 was basically a complimation of you saring hey guys sorry again for the late upload overunder 55 episodes place your bets please its fine i never play f1 and motogp because my pc still pentium its really really low spec maybe underground spec but now i have a laptop with amd ryzen 5 for me its enough for play motogp and f1 i hope so in my pc i just play need for speed carbonunderground 1 and 2 and motogp 2002 motogp 2002 its really different from motogp modern game finally a career which is what we subscribe for no childish online rubbish mile stone the maldonado of moto gp you have to brake before the corner braking restricts turning so brake before turn and feather the throttle the whole turn not like bra braa braaa but like braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap you should be better then the name is stone mile stone if you cut your bad corners we will only see the straight lines sign him for esports cant wait to get 3 episodes of this career mode drive it like a bike ben not as f1 car very fraco get help from tom martinez a bit more seriousness and first person would be cool with this game ben if you can that is maybe try it with a wheel that is supported right imagine winter testing in f1 games god damn hahahaha i remember the valentino rossi motorcycle game lets goooo funny but needs improvement i love your videos ben but you didnt put any effort into this video tbh shouldnt of played it if you didnt want to ill bet 100 dollars this doesnt make it to part 5 its almost like you purposely ignore the braking markers ben you have no idea what your doing do you yuuuus new vid fron my boiii you dont left off gas and stop early enough its hilarious to watch tho lorenzo is embarrassingly bad in real life so the game reflects that rather well why do you even upload a game which you dont really want to play just for the clicks duuude oh sht here we go again jk love the videos great stuff ben thank you always nice to mix it up not long till f1 2019 they need to wall every corner off so u cant cut it the ben and some scrub named valentino rossi moto 3 french gp 2017 almost the whole field crashed in the same corner same lap you should do more of these vids would be really fun to see your progression ben do fp4 because if you do good there you go straight to q2 and fight for pole i wanna see more just cause why are you so late on the brakes at every corner no wonder you run wide lmfao 155 this codemasters this is an editor this is customisation sit down watch and learn depends on how you guys like it press x to doubt please continue the career mode the fitnessgram pacertest is a multistage aerobic capacity test that gradually gets more difficult the longer it progresses lets spam ben to finish this you ever just get bored with four wheels so you get two wheels instead i want big red ball ohh ben another carrer mode you will never finish might aswell rip motogp 19 career mode june 8 2019 june 8 2019 i saw you online playing this engineerkimi you can drive in motogp19 tiametmarduk fing finally early hey stop copying aarav m8 early squad this is copying said this to you on twitter so here you are lol ur coping aarav ill watch later fp3 time im early my guess is 4 episodes the shot of sydney for the phillip island grand prix really says to me that these developers went phillip island its not even in the same state of australia as sydney but who cares gotta get the opera house in there aarava its the game me you are just trage 835 thank me later aarava idk who is my teammates hafiz sharin am i a joke to you somebody really should tell him about the concept of trail braking lol i play f1 19 and motogp 19 when it comes to motorsports i just cant take motogp seriously for some reason i dont know why 548 traction control is a very bad word in the world of motorsports racist you said brown guy without my permission im brown and thats offensive thanks for the video smiles i live in assen a my school is at the circuit shoutout to ellison noob with the comment sub to my chanel a game for tweakers not for players it seems pls switch the emoji to the number how do they do pit stops the fact is he missed all the real numbers are u playing on keyboard or what dont ever buy a real motorcycle jesus christ thats not assen thats amsterdam my lucky is 7 too why assen shows a picture of amsterdam motorcycles going wide since 1885 sees calander look at assen it shows the city its amsterdam lmao hraphics are hsit only 8 midrolls not that bad really the most painful race to watch horrible skills for a someone whos familiar with f1 racing why cant the f1 game be more like this that guided setup thing would be great u play on pc or ps4 bcs the game are btfl this game made me realise how fast f1 cars actually are 832 thank me later choose red bull ktm i really liked this game i was expecting something good but the experience its really good i have this and f1 and im better on this the best bike number ever hey aarava you missed 5 number 7 btw game shows a city 200 km away from the track aarava i love how they show the city not the track how do the bikers not fall of he doesnt know who is jorge lorenzo bruh ktm is shit thats why choose yamahahonda instead its called tech trois he is trash and he is blaming it on the tires try using settings so you can isolate the front break as that may help you get the nose into the corners i like that they show citys shows amsterdam and thinks its assen why r u braking so late i dont remember assen looking like amsterdam last time i checked xd does anyone know if motogp19 have a first person view would this project be lucratif for red bull red bull red bull red bull red bull red bull red bull red bull red bull red bull redbull i have to throw up red bull red bull jc moes 67 lelystad the netherlands how does this game work do you have to tilt your pc left and right to get through the corners do you lean over the computer desk reaching down for a drop knee these games lol always looks like the bike is floating and not on track youve got to turn in and earlier and brake earlier too also do fp3 instead of fp4 so that u can jump straight to q2 play nascar heat haha you need to turn earlier lol you are bad as f have u heard the new guy in moto gp i heard hes gonna be the next best thing his number is tbh i almost stop watching this video but the laughing emoji stop me hahaha ive just wasted 35mins watching this regretting it now that was not a picture of assen it was amsterdam lol do they have the aided handling editor in f1 2019 try out real bike would help as malaysian im so proud to have our own circuit i mean the cornering is shit because you set it up that way the engineer asked how the bike was behaving and you said it was too responsive 9 times advertising always entertaining to watch formula1 players playing motogp games i love the overtake graphic on the left of the hud personally when i do races i like to follow the race as a whole particularly when racing more casually and this kind of feature really helps you are so fucking bad how do you mute his voice and just listen to the bikes engine turn on auto tug in you need to turn in earlier bro to make the corners just a bit of help u have two teammates mate oliveira and syahrin not only oliveira is ur teammate that was a crazy race an aprilia in 5th mir in 6th rabat in 7th rossi in 8 oh wait tito rabat is on p6 that only happens in games those midrolls tho 2903 stop focusing behind you when your cornering tut tut tut loved the video 617 can confirm thats not assen looks more like amsterdam lol aarava could you start from the pits and nice vid i want f1 2019 to have the same customizations helmet number gloves bro its pronounced as hafeez shahrin motogp heaven hahfish sighreenhow you say the riders name the only thing we can say is is it 60fps or 30fps on consoles fuck marquez petrucci for the win love how they show a picture of amsterdam for the assen circuit its hafizh hafiz syahrin shahrin btw and hes malaysianlike me mate when the tyre wear kicks in you have to increase tc engine braking to stop further tyre degradation at an alarming rate in a nutshell you shot the tyres because you cant be bothered to change the setup of the bike please see this career through dear god quick question can you be a manager instead and create your own teambike etc etc wheres motorsport manager skips multiple pages with numbers yeah theres no numbers here go back to the basics slow in fast out super smooth on inputs there are 2 separate brakes front brake will make the bike want to stand up andor make the front tire wash out understeer and is where you have most of your braking pressure brake hard with both front and rear brakes lift off the front brake in corner entrance drag your rear brake slowly easing out allowing for engine braking to slow you down trail braking slowly ease back to the power at or just after apex its similar to f1 but slower through the corners more rolling through with a slight bit of power ride a zx6r in real life i rarely use either of my brakes engine braking is almost as powerful as your front brake if used properly but yeah same mechanics as a car just a little earlier a little slower and a little smoother not easy to do on a game pad some insight the front wheel is actually pointing slightly away from the direction of the clean called countersteering handlebars dont devi thats not assen that picture that will be volendam you need to break and turn in earlier so you can turn in in fp1 2 and 3 go the 10 fastest people to q2 well apparently only me that still stucked in motogp urt 3ah aarava just a tip try to liftoff before hard braking and setup engine braking higher you can have more stability in corner entries and greater speed control mid corner during acceleration just do a favour and stick to f1 no rewinds please f1 2014 whatever game youre playing it wont work you cant defeat me aarava i know but he can motogp 19 i am your reckoning motogp 19 already beats f1s codemonkeys with the customization alone aarava i think ive come a long way from moto gp 2018 me yeah backwords sorry the rider customization is so cool hope f1 game has it as well dont be sorry for rossi he is a prick he knocks riders off and even kicked marquez off his bike in the 2nd last race of the year once aavara oh i think ima make a pa wait no ive run wide aarava your so bad it hurts to watch you yellow line means slow down and red means your going to fast to make the corner you pronouncing dovi as doughvi really got on my nerves for some reason imagine if there was a bike controlling unit like there is for car games like steering wheels and pedals omg its so painful to watch please turn in earlier my dear araav the picture shown at assen wasnt assen its amsterdam xd is this game free this whole serieis about to be a road to glory for aavara not the team watching this after the england game thanks for cheering me up aarav love the vids keep it up mate jeremy clarkson is not happy i hope we can get the same custamization in f1 19 f1 needs to get this kind of customisation aarava you need to stop looking behind you stop trying to be a spectator and concentrate on getting thru and finishing the race dread it run from it destiny still arrives f1 2014 do fp3 instead cause the top10 go through the q2 tutorial on how to avoid f1 2014 miguel oliveira the future of motogp hey arrava you probably want to do fp3 instead of fp4 cause in fp3 you can make it into q2 but fp4 is just a session for info and stuff aarava were gonna be more serious this time aarava 1 min later so lets put a laughing emoji as our number also chose fp3 as that is the fp session that allows you to get straight to q2 i used to run front hard for stability while braking and rear medium because of tyre wear why dont these content creators actually learn the game before shitting out a bunch of videos and dont you need some help from a real life rider assen is your nightmare on straights you should lean thank think you do angles forward please stop rewinding miss every corner and still get p1 whith 1 sec then you know your a pro wink wink turn on tcs try to play moto gp on a wheel son of a bitch its about assen north of holland and they show pictures of amsterdam why did they do a photo of amsterdam at assen play whit first person it is esyer i really like you playing motogp 19 hope you continue the career aarav i love how they show the city not the circuit motogp shows a city 200km away from the circuit wow the menus are waaaay better than in f1 do the full series aarav please keep up this series i think its great youre gonna get better but love the video today aarava try first person on this game its pretty epic love those series eventhough i dont know shit about moto gp id like you to change the number i hope the costmaizaiton in f1 2019 will be like this you need to steer in earlier i notice youre not tuck in man maybe you can switch on the auto tuck in 119 motogp wants kimi to join the chat hey my lucky number is also 7 they didnt show the city what you said was assen is amsterdam irl this team finishes 1218 usually i think you must play moto3 or moto2 for adaptation watch this feels like watching madden player play fifa well that definitely isnt assen i live there and its not amsterdam they shoould have put a picture of bartje in its place not amsterdam early at 709 the text says we are in jerez spain instead of sepang lol this video literally motivated me to install motogp13 again lol you play with a controler or a steering wheel i miss the manager series im from assen and that is not assen its fricking amsterdam the netherlands is more than fricking amsterdam thats what i like in this game will play it after exams would love to see pre season testing in f1 regardless of the game aarav will find a way to pull of the signature switchback yes love the game a wise man once said i dont do bike racing codemasters you see this will you get to play f1 2019 before release date well hello everyone have a nice day noob career is back we love you keep up the vids still more grip the the williams first your ai was doing 218 in moto 3 mine does 211wtf i qualified last with a 2153 what controller youre using that just though it is offline guys comments me plzzzz i always loved the motogp series but after watching this i realize just how good ride 3 is lol ha ha ha thats the usual kind of riding from binder a genious game played on x box one x the finest of racing adrenaline pumping unreal engine doing an amazing job play with semiautomatic gear and brake the same button and helmet view no other helpers then you are there like in real life and not too difficult but dear milestone please make an update it is totally redicoulous to add the posibillity of choosing a female player they sometimes look better and then out comes a wide shouldered person with no hips and breasts the commentator even say now he goes to the track come on milestone woman and girls in racing is a possibilty when u say a you also have to say b a breast hips and she update as soon as possible problem with milestone games is that the speed doesnt look as fast as it is it constantly looks like the bikes are barely pushing 50 when they are at 90 just bought it for the first time and its so insanely hard to play xd all the bikes are literally nearly the same the honda and ktm are the two manufacturers and both are 250 single cyclone era honda are leading the championship and that petronas is a honda im installing moto gp 19 rn more light rays reflection rays and motionblur on the lights sweet gameplay nice dude on the mic d greetings from germany y oh god it sound like an angry mosquito haha wtf is this game xd srsly moto3 should stick together because of the slipstreaming not happening in the game a shark helmet can make custom livery for the helmet sold beautiful race sub long races are really cool to watch if you fightin for place with someone is it me or is the sound not that good sounds boring we dont need to hear you so much its annoying youre excellent on this game omg 620 woah it looks like the bike is literally hovering over the tarmac looks like its not touching the ground at all looks pretty horrible really how the fuck do you run a 216 with automatic transmission i tried for 2 hours last night and could barely do a 219 did i just join the wrong team i skipped moto2 because the sound of the bikes is so shit currently playing motogp18 on my switch got it cheap and im loving the career hey there thanks for the video may i ask a silly question how do you simplay motogp games are you using joystick gamepad or a normal wheel thanks in advance how do you tuck in looks like the bike is ridiing in the air when you look at the rear tire p haha that sound d cant buy from this company any more they release a game never fix any issue even if they try they either make them worse or lie about fixing them case and point ride 3 oh weve fixed the first gear bug no milestone you have not its still there and no one wants yar bs dlcs what a jump whats with the audio diff in the beginning of the vid some pilots get the flying as a nickname but binder got it literaly yeah i made those smooth oh and a quick tip make use of practice sessions although you already know the circuits its the only way you can score development points in the game with a few training programs to run through to progress your bike seems like you have a pretty good understanding of what is going on with the bike you know the difference between front and back wheels although you forgot to check before your first race i only know my backwheel is going off quicker so i use a harder compound for that p is there a possibility that you make a basic tutorial video about this game in terms of bike behaviour manage the breaks and tires that sort of stuff i have yet to find such a tutorial and a bit more indepth knowledge would come in handy wtf where is motoe thy forgot it complete first motogp19 video ive watched on yt with someone that can actually play motorbike games 1010 would sub again i am new to this but really enjoyed the second race in argentina first of all i was already about to type a comment complaining about the ai dont seem to make mistakes on their own again got my mind changed 6 seconds later by binder acting like a new airbus model im so happy to finally found someone who can drive in this game im from germany and like every german youtuber who plays this game just sucks very very bad almost ejaculated seeing how you took turn 9 in the first lap of the argentinian gp we need all of these features in milestones mxgp and monster energy supercross games started a pro career moto 3 second turn in qatar i get taken outnot a good start they always said derren isnt afraid to throw it up the inside nice vid new subscriber amazing first race victory it was a little bit too easy so increase the difficulty is it 60fps or 30fps on consoles also why do they always have to be wobbling on every straight that does not happen in real life they have over done it lol in real life boothamos is a back marker basically love the video but i feel like with the ai from what im seeing in your video is that theyre quite easy to catch up to but when you do catch up to them they fight so its hard to get the move done darren binder got airborne lol that was awesome how has dovi got 41 points after 1 race hi dudeis it true that in this game it has some winter tests good motogp 19 this good games ia seems really slow and wtf boothamos who are very fast on the game but who are one of the last rider in real life try pro career plsss can you change your rider heightweight and size please show as everything about rider customization finally i always support you from indonesia hey pls make motogp19 all cameras i want to know booth amos is overrated change my mind great bud anyone else playing on ps4 pro and having frame rate stutters play some historical i hope yes 410 earrape i think you dont need to play qualifications why the hell do i have two teammates in career mode neural ai is the same as motogp 18 only now zigzags without any senseshameful more fast upload this series please love u from indonesia that darryn binder crash scared me there nice gameplay bro and this is the best motogp game is console 60 fps or what u started from moto3 seriously boringggggg thats keith huewen in the background and i am loving this new motogp game and grapthics rugbymadfan is there bike and leather damage when you fall off this time round or is this still missing that one of theslowest bike is actually in the front of the midpack runners have you seen john mcphee he got a win with the one of the slowest bike although of course im saying this is happening in real life they should make it more realistic like i know its neural ai but mate our boy tom boothamos fighting for the lead while fenati and canet falling behind edited out masia loved it pc is 60 fps you are at the maximum level of ai neural ai in their natural habitat so does anyone know if you start in the redbull rookies cup you have to gain like experience or so to have a change on getting an good moto3 offer so what i mean is that if you win all races you can directly go to the better bikes in moto3 but if you are like midfield you have like the slower bikes after the rbrc season boothamos 2nd darryn binder brads brother i am really exited for this game but there is a couple of disappointments no ai lowsides highsides ect just glitchy crashes having preset butt patches and numbers is a shame also i think there is still a problem with the difficulty good vid though mate enjoy your commentary this is the best motogp game so far i am so pumped for this new game im from the indonesia do you think its worth buying just check on ma channel i play as well as him buat android itu gamenya onlineoffline boy bang motogp bisa multiplayer offline split screen ga i dont know why but i like this suzuki over other factory bikes in this years motogp game seems like suzuki is the most balanced bike very stable and predictable

redbullrokkiescup bang first yes first coment the tiniest things anoy me in this game most of these tracks are used as a race track for cars as well so why isnt there car skid marks are u able to remap the controls for xbox i want throttlebrake to be left stick updown and steering to be right stick leftright motogp 2 on original xbox is still the best thats so weird been thinking about buying the game but this graphicsdoesnt look good i think i wish the throttle was dangerous like a real motorcycle what i didnt like about motogp 18 is you didnt get a sense of speed going down a straight at 200mph just felt like you were going at 60 nice to finally see a reviewer of this game stayingracing on the track whats the point in uploading a video where your off the track most of the race so well done and thank you for a great video robo46 been having a blast onlinebut what sucks is that there is nothing to earn when you play online nothing to work towardsnot even some kind of points an excellent and best attempt at motogp still miles off with gameplay with traction control off either wobble or highside there is no spinning up of the rear after getting kicked in the balls you maybe should of waited a few seconds before starting the video recording from moto gp 17 motogp going down thats my opinion 1985 hang on have better graphics im sticking with nintendo nes cockpit cam looks awesome thats the way im gonna attempt to play it i love the game its not perfect but the realism is really fun how your bike responds during breaking as well as corning is anyone else experiencing fire eyes during podium celebration or appearing thru helmet nice i hope the physics are good this year ive taken a few years off of these titles because the physics engine wasnt to my liking the insane level of braking you can pull off mid corner even on advanced always turned me off basically i want this game to have a pibosos gp bikes mode haha better off picking up a cheap used 600 and some leathers and riding a local track imo lol bike on track looks better thoughscenery not quite as up to scratch of the bike though petruccis hat looked wierd on the intro part gear change up shift is totally wrong how do they screw up such a simple thing this is laughable the graphics are awful when did the midgets start riding motogp bikes great stuff youre pretty good in helmet cam listen but only controller xbox can use im have controller extreme the no go please reply me im have game but no can play are you using a wheel or controller i just like to play with the third camera the other ones i think are horrible im just quick with it love this game but there is no one online on console ps4 so no r for me 2 buy this game hey man i have it for pc im not that good at the game got it for fun since had the previous versions and i use the assisted physics with auto and joint breaks on but they dont work on multiplayer why is that it working when i play career more and single player in general can u help me out it seems like a major bug but cant reach mile stone or moto gp support on this is this game broken already robo46 i cant seem to add ai to online multiplayer matches private or public my custom helmet wont pull into online races even when i select custom rider and there is no full gp or championship option for online play otherwise a fantastic game with great physics and the track real time feel is incredible lets hope these are just teething problems enchanted vs x box one std need to use cockpit view chase view is trash i have brought moto gp 19 yet but i loving this video rugbymadfan the graphics and movement of the rider and motorcycle is great but the environment tf is that pubg lite does the game run at 30fps on the one x thanks to your video ill be purchasing this game on my xbox motogp 18 was crap to me this one looks okay thanks man helmet cam would be incredible in vr dont blame understeer on lack of trailbraking graphics look amazingnice to have proper kit as welli missed out on motogp18give them time to work the kinks outlook forward to more content robo please do a review of the new ai i like the camera position hey guys does somebody know why ps store says that my credit car is invalid when i want to buy motogp 19 when i tried to buy the motogp 19 theme it worked is it 60fps or 30fps on consoles hows the braking ive never liked the way you can apply 100 brakes and the wheels dont lock up you absolutely need to get a pop filter for your mic good motogp game the games physics are more realistic than last year you really have to break before corners and cornering is much more realistic than in previous games imo if you brake too late you really break too late and cant keep the bike on the track racing line is more important also if yo brake and go into a corner graphics are horrible very accurate ai rossi was slow and crashed out at mugello i also love how they have included uccio being a glorified ipad stand and getting in the way when rossi is trying to talk to his engineer pc has more better graphics just set the fastest on the leader boards in austria im sure it wont last long but i was happy such a huge improvement with 19 im addicted right now lol yeah theyre trying to get more realistic but the riders are still downshifting with their left leg out so different with pc version models dont look real they should invest in some likeness of drivers wheres the mission winnow logo gotta love those 1998 nintendo 64 skyboxes beautiful work milestone also the ducati sounds like it could put a mean edge on my front lawn ill pick this one up in the discount bin at the grocery store as long as it comes with a free chocolate bar i love play moto gp 06 xbox 360 the best i used to be ranked 31 in the world out of more than a million people in lap times that was way back on moto gp on the original xbox it was like 2004 i havent played one since so i am wondering if they have the same online play and if its still fun hey robo46 which analog controller gives you the best response in terms of controlling the bike in pro settings would it be ps4 controller or xbox one x is it one x enhanced 60fps or not some people say it looks better on ps4 pro will buy when they patch it to run at 60fps i hope the online side of things are good too if only the isle of man tt game had these physics great video mate audio out of sync mate what capture card you using i been having probs too as for the game it looks like a slight fisheye lens has been applied am i way off there looking forward to your footage on this mate ps helmet cam looks awesome better than last year takes some gettin used to eh did they remove manual tuckin cant find it downshifts are sluggish in motogp19 not smooth at all doesnt respond well to the button input am i only experiencing this is it 60fps on the x how do i tuck in why is there such a gap in revsdisengage between gear shifts the real ducati seamless box just shifts well seamlessly hows the frame rate is it stable or still drops during races is the multiplayer working can anyone tell me if there is a forum or community i can join to interact play online get tips and share bike setups things like that thanks whats the day 1 patch like file size wise been playing for an hour good game but upshift sounds like it doesnt have quickshifter i like the speed sense especially gp18 upshift sounds way better nice game other than that how is the ai are they aware of you or just stick to their line and run in you if they have to never played the recent motogp games but i like the feature while racing that it looks like when youre off racing line little black rubber bits start flying up thats a very realistic feature imo and adds to the game letting the rider know they arent on racing line ill be playing in about 6 hours gotta work first lol looks amazing though known2dip downshift while leg wave what is tcs aw and eb i dont really understand it but i use tcs up to 2 in motogp games i prefer the shifting sound from motogp18 to 19 other wise big improvement imma chill till they get out a ride 4 tbh if they patch it out to reach 60 with lower graphics im thinking of grabbing it for cheap later on 30frames for any game without the option to lower the graphics a bit to reach at least a respectable 50 is unacceptable considering these games cater to consoles playerbase and not pc playerbase the ducati is a pleasure for the eyes anyway guys thoughts about the new ai thing he is one of the best looking man in this game other riders arenot bad anyone know what its like on standard xbox please help where abouts is auto and manual lean you do get some big wobbles thats one thing i notice hey robo46 little question the feelings and the way of driving the bikes are they clearly different between the different team ducati yam honda i have to wait till they deliver it tomorrow is it me or does the enginegearbox not sound seamless i want this the bike detection is it good you should get the pc version it looks and feels way better the gear changes are so slow my 10 r quick shifter changes quicker than that not talking about the ratio im talking about the quickness it changes a gear it needs patching they run seemless gearboxes there should be little to no lag in between changes hey man watch your videos whenever a new bike game comes out one question can you lose the front on the brakes like you used to be able to or is it simply mash the brakes and hit the apex no problem like gp18 etc great video edit and 100th like by me please do a tribute series by playing as a historical riders trust me it will be awesome understeeryfinally someone said it as someone who does track days every sunday 18 was completely screwing up my braking distance prediction thanks to its understeering physicsneeded a lot of trail braking in the game as well and mid corner braking and throttle to maintain the linewhich is rather opposite of real life where you arent supposed to mess with the brakes or throttle in between a cornerhope they sorted that one out i like the new physics and the game in general but it feels like a lot of trail braking going on i dont get the bike to stop under hard braking as i want damn i sound like rossi lol start career mode today cant wait to pick it up my last moto gp game is 17even tho im recently playing 08 cause i bought it for less than 5 euros lol just played few races in rb racing carrer man the bugs are real i got 1 major question for you if you wer still playing gp 18 and have not finished a gp career champshp but do have titles from moto 2 and 3 would you quite gp18 and start 19 instead cause i do agree with u bout the bikes on gp18 extremely understeering thers weeknds it toke me for ever to set the bike to steer faster and hold its line then looking at the set up it looks totaly wack ride height just radical to get steer fast what does ant and post represent mean on the hud looking forward to your career walkthrough in fp1 fp2 and fp3 i realized that the ai is going even faster than the fp1 and fp2 lap time does this happens to anyone else ive been playing motogp 19 for a few hours now at first the bikes feel a bit bad if your used to the older games but after a few laps you start getting into rythem with the bikes just thought id say it still says ant and post which means front and rear in italian language anteriorposterior wtf is wrong with milestone they released game with half english and half italian elements from other gameplays i saw some more menus are on italian despite game is set on english they made great game much better then motogp 18 but they fucd it up with same crash animations spawning idiotic loading on garage entering that destroyed whole game for me what does aw and eb on the hud mean im addicted to playing it right now and i really cant wait now for the championship that your hosting i have literally been waiting for your first video on this personally i think you give the best reviews and you actually know what your talking about rossi comes with an excuse making function only 30 fps on x im not buying a racing game like that milestone really should step up their game now did you review it and how much graphics is better on ps4 pro vs ps4 if anyone know ill appreciate it your right robo i was wrong about that what i sad i mist a couple of things to adjust the bike etc like steering adjustments it feels good so i take my words back how will be the graphics on xbox one s and i whas first vieuwer finally got some quality clean ride gameplay i was waiting for your video very eagerly secondly please change your intro its not that good i need money for the game yalp me plss playing it almost 5 hourscurrently at mugelo circuit championshipreally tough tho its here ive been playing it all day its such a big improvement havent even watched the whole but i already know its gonna be a great video so excited for this second view how you can podium without anti whellie good debut with the petronas bike and a brilliant overtake on rossi if you get 30k subs can you do a qna you are still turning in too early tom change breaks bias to front dont use tcs it slows u down they should add rider transfers for motogp make the game more interesting sorry i was talking on the phone wtf 13 comments and 123 likes we want more this should also be the layout for f1 even if the last 2 corners would be easy flateverything is better than that slow chicane the kymiring is joining the motogp calendar as the provisional calendar has been released and also f1 has their provisional calendar f1 2019 has issues moto gp my time has come to strike work on that start you should be good awesome late brake pass into turn one on rossi you did better than i thought you might with the new team great job i was here originally for the f1 hope you get it sorted in the meantime thanks for uploading the motogp going ahead and getting it after watching your presentation we want f1 hi tom genuinely i wasnt into motogp but you tom got me into it so thank you i watched since day one that was a great debut performance in your first moto 3 race in motogp 19 career mode but my have i got some serious catching up to do now im 14 episodes behind on this series plus early f1 2019 content has been released this may take a while to get caught up with this series in particular let alone anything else i need to watch xd i find it odd they have you pick a face for your rider but hes always walking around with his helmet in the pre race aw is antiwheelie really enjoying this and keep up the good work you cant change weather in qatar because the weather is always clear there haha what is with all these players racing from the chase cam its a bike ride it from the on board view you may as well go play a arcade game using this view not very realistic great to see you back tom looking forward to your series on this game got it yesterday and its so beautifully different very nice riding aw is antiwheelie aw is anti wheelie excellent start to the series mate keep up the good material youre the best career mode youtuber there is increase difficulty finally the nonmod version the game and not an imposter version of it my lord the ai are really broken really slow in qualy and then really fast in the race they also dont set times if youre not on track like you pointed out and theres a massive glitch at the starts where a bike can start the race halfway to turn 1 when everyone else is on the grid what a mess you should go to ai difficulity 120 it could be more realistic you know that this game had pre season does the game run 60fps on standard ps4 looking forward to next part tom great work i do love watching your moto gp gameplays too apart from f1 please make more videos i really would like to see you play more tom the ai is still to easy for you your race objective was p15 and you got the pole d great riding but im waiting for f1 2019 d id like to see you do motogp and f1 2019 at the same time but thats your decision to make always enjoy your motogp content good job by getting two podiums in a row aw is auto wheelie i want this game but with f1 2019 coming out later this month i have to wait loving the helmet editor succes broo from indonesia not a motogp fan but lets see if you make me like your bike races or not hope you use my realistic sponsors mod on f1 2019 weather conditions are probably locked because you are in moto 3 i hope they add that much level of customisation of helmets into f1 2019 prefer this thumbnail over the blurred thumbnail but keep both tom could you do a 2nd channel where you can post videos of moto gp 19 after f1 2019 has come out aw is anti wheelie i think this game actually looks awesome been following u all the way and not going to stop now you post great content and thats all i want from a youtuber next video motogp career season 10 311 bagnaia vinales crash 20 336 fabio dovi crash 20 wow crazy crashes compilation love this videos mate 3 hey icerami do you think its exciting motogp era without electronics or the electronic era like now amazing crashes bro keep it up first like first comment icerami they need to improve on the looks of the grid girls or umbrella girls most of them are dog looking while the girls on the motogp circuit are hot as fuck i have ps4 slim can i play the motogp 19 game looks graphically pretty good the speed just is a tad off for myself dont know if high wind vibration fx would possibly help the old thq ones although very dated they had a real sense of speed if this had the speed and kicking and bucking like a real motogp bike everyone would play it i raced supersport so ive some idea of what a bike should feel if they could implement counter steering somehow and mad rush acceleration dont ask me how lol but im sure if a big developer company was involved we would have such details these bikes should be short shifting because of nasty power and hooking up the corners instead of this slightly sluggish cornering im seeing i will still get as im a fan and just hope it sucks me in and somewhat have to eat words please motogp crash complation i lovr you milestone even when people throws shit at you all the times ride 3 is sick looks exactly like motogp 18 switching over to unreal 4 but not even using 10 of it such a shame most devs are just lazy af nowadays are the bikes reminiscent of their real life counterparts ie factory ducati good on straights suzuki and ducati fast out corners yamaha high performance throughout the race etc its funny that they dont have the thought of putting the marks on the knee sliders this is shit compare go f1 2019 how to download motogp19 to android phone plz tell just went from pepsiman game video on ps1 to this i love simpler graphics kind of games but i will forever appreciate the evolution of technology that we went through some of u guys love older some newer but i love both both eras are amazing in their own ways i believe most of u guys agree with this how to blend in bikes with the environment i have no idea but maybe 2029 will give me answers but in 19 the bikes are floating above the road fo su rr wish i can lean and flick into corners like that irl im always almost fall off the bike when flick the bike even in game rossi still cannot beat marc marquez hahahharelax just joke motogp has 6 gears not only five in the straight the yamaha reach 300 kmph in 5th gear thats quite strange also he does the correntaio and the bucine last corner in the 1st gear the riders look realistic but the environment is mediocre f1 2019s graphic and sound looks way better than this imo its a shame that little details are still being missed 035 037 downshifting whilst the left foot is off the peg i know its a minor thing but its about time things like this arent overlooked fingers crossed its something that can be fixed i play this track on forza 7marenello the only thing here is bad sound they need to work on better sounds for the bikes more sound more motivation to give every lap im pushing like hell you know its fake when m1 reaching 345kmh go vale always on the yellow side what seemed very odd was how the riders leg actually moves when a gear shift is done in motogp 14 but not in this game the sound still sucks the player was so bad and beginer are you playing against the real people what platform is this for cant wait my farts sound better than this shitty sound looks like the handling has finally improved liking the collision avoidance one of my biggest problems with the previous versions you know its fake when vinales is in 3rd position game is actually very realistic karel abraham overtook lorenzo for p11 cool you just copy the video from milestone graphics design budget 700k sound effects budget 350 amazing game can i get this motogp mobile game in playstore i have been looking in along time for this game have you guys ever played superbike 2001 in almost 2 decades we apparently havent come very far these games embarrass me every time they show gameplay as if we are supposed to be wowed by this garbage even worse they show 3rd person looks like absolute f2p garbage and the audio is atrocious i cant imagine this company ever making something that feels even remotely realistic or fun to play for that matter does anyone notice that theres no mission winnow sponsor on ducati well this looks disappointing all these years and they cant get the basics right mugello is such a wonderful track oh look the yamaha has rear traction out of the corners thats amazing actually looks good movements seem natural that bike sound is awful though give give it to me now looks better but does sounds needs some work for the immersion to be complete its so smooth and realistic but game smooth like this is only playable with joystick or something like that keyboard zero excellent game im a fan of the serie most realistic game since moto gp 06 every motorcycle game has shitty engine sounds wanted to see clipping contact as a real rider boots dont go through other riders like 18 showed its real so it isnt 60 fps in ps4 finally the motogp game that i wanted to buy not mission winnow fake maximum speed yamaha not really v great work graphics and animations look better than 18 new ai with an actual neural network exciting for the future of game design and the physics dont look bad and great graphics maybe this year we will finally get a good motogp game hopefully the ai will be better and not suicidal as before that game looks very challenging for once the riders and physical movement of the bike look realistic why does rossi stick his leg out milestone in the right direction looks good it doesnt sound bad and the most important ai make the corners hi can you tell me if the accelerator and brake it works with right analogue thank you really nice fake marquez needs to be buffed when its a gameplay with marquez he got that stanky leg 012 this game or ride 3 what i dont understand is why no one is saying anything about the biggest fix if one wants to use the helmet view which is to stop the insane tilt going around corners the horizon now remains horizontal and the game is much easier to play again if one uses helmet view i have heard no one remark on it but oh man what a difference it makes even motogp 18 had the tilt going around corners is there splitscreen multiplayer you are an excellent youtuber man great racing commentary the only disappointment for me is the fact its still running at 30fps but i have heard milestone will be releasing a performance patch for the pro and the one x excited to be grabbing this game next week squint and the replay looks almost real love your channel kpg watch everyday one thing though mate i know little about race craft and such but ive noticed that you often dont take the widest entry into corners is that a conscious decision to take those lines wouldnt you cut some time by rounding out your corners a little more at times youve prolly forgotten more about this stuff than ill ever know so dont take this as a criticism just wondering cheers from downunder kpg ride on bro shit you sound like a tv commentator i like just had my first play on motogp 19 and its a massive improvement on the last game however i still think its missing the atmosphere of a proper gpwhere are the distant noise of air horns from the crowd as the bikes bundle into the first corner even 18 had the coloured flares in the crowds and 19 is even missing that these little details make and complete the experience very excited to see your journey in this game i dont know what to make of it yet but im poised to trade in 18 and ride 3 for this out of interest what capture card do you use mate this game looks absolutely amazing love the customization options since valentino rossi the game never bought a new motogp game was considdering buying the new one this year but chose to go with f1 2019 hi kpg just been playing this on my pcstarted a grand prix weekend riding as marquez the race began with mugello in the pouring rain great graphics and handling extremely unforgiving i must have restarted a dozen times and just could not gain any pace in the wetgave up in the end and popped onto youtube rossi the best next video try racing with the helmet cam it was rather difficult but feels more realistic anyone knows how to manage tyre management properly livestream for malaysiangp today or some special video for it i hope rossi races like that in real life right now hes been strugglin lately in terms of dealing with the wheelie you need to manually change gears yourself if youre on the first gear you need to switch to second before the bike itself does so i usually do so just after i notice the front end coming up this ensures you maintain good speed as both wheels remain grounded it is something that bothered me until i figured this out now i never have any problems starting accelerating hard out of a corner accelerating for a straight etc its all about gear management as bizarre as that sounds try it out on a few practice laps out of career mode and youll see what i mean remember just manually shift gear earlier as soon as the bike begins to raise usually itll stop on gear 2 whilst sometimes you need to do it twice ending up on gear 3 i hope this helps vale is the best vr46 love the video 120 ai do indeed look incredible a lot more challenging than motogp 18 they need a 150 ai for you lot and maybe they should just call it 100 is it video compression or the downshift sounds have digital sampling distortion it sounds like it was stretched and there are samples missing i wonder why the ai doesnt use soft tyres in quali can you show motogp standings before your end the video tom great video btw do you think mugello would be a good f1 test circuit or nah personally think it would be because of the fact that it is narrow with some tight corners and some long ones what do you think all that awesome qualifying for a 3 lap race lol love the motogp vids keep up the good work i love how boothamos in your save file is a top moto 3 contender when in real life he lingers at the bottom of the timesheets and has not scored a single point this year very interesting like i said yesterday you too goodvery entertaining gameplay by the way and i appriciate the fact that you drive very smoothely it s pleasing to watch turn tcs and aw and eb offmoto3 bikes are not that powerful so you wont have problems coming out of cornersand it will also improve lap times how you can make the thumbnailsplease answer you play on ps 4 or pc yay you are playing at my country thank you this announce an amazing season with ducati riotbox either change the colour of your number to blue or white same for your gloves and boots because the yellow does not fut at all with the ducati red unlike how it was perfect for the black and blue yamaha preferably change it to white because dovi already has the blue boots and gloves change ur helmetits not match with ur red white suit select new helmet which matches with your leathers this should be a tasty season u always say something that makes sense the mic quality isnt the best or is it me i wish there were custom celebrations over the line would add some realism all black helmet gloves and boot for the season on ducati this game is so damn easy yet you use automatic gears less than 120 difficulty and whats most important you always blame the bike when something goes wrong you are a total nonce only 200 kmh for ducati i thought i almost 400 kmh hmm what is the problem pls shout me out still wait for wheelie after race hope you have a good season with ducati we miss you daijiro i missed some apexes but got the job done you were going for it every lap this race against rins the eb acts as rear brake thats why if you have eb on 4 you can easily crash if you then apply more rear brake try putting eb on 1 you can trail brake with the rear brake on all the way to the apex its faster and much more consistent doing 1445s in the race with mh tires on the factory ducati with those settings you may regret switching to the satellite yamaha its way underpowered compared to pramac ducati hope you get that win soon though italy is my favourite contry and i am franco ontarian but i am good in english when f1 career will begin i would have switched teams also tommygo yamaha try suzuki their bike has better speed and the handling is as good as yamaha i have no good way to play this on pc so it would be ps4 which i only have a standard controllernot exactly optimum either this win is coming i can feel it hi tom when will a new f1 video come why cant i change my tyres to wets in red bull rookies championshiptwice ive got pole position on a dry saturday only for it to be heavy rain on race day yet it only gives me medium compound tyresis this a glitch please ducati dovi too much look at the gap between him and the rest of the field 13 seconds its not awful for the championship but you have to resist go to repsol honda its a lot better then the yamaha how did dovi maintain that pace on soft soft tyres good battle for second though looking forward to the last 2 races good luck the acceleration and top speed of the ducati is crazy good 2nd place how dovi was going so quick or maybe it was just you being inconsistent on the throttle join in honda repsol work on throttle control what is the dificult if you hold rb on xbox i dont know what it is on ps4 but it controls your wheelie your clutch thank you very good love your vids jay watched since episode one and enjoyed all of them this game looks so unrealistic you really need to improve cutting corners every round bumping onto ai not really fun anymore i watch every episode of yours but you need to provide us with clean and exciting races when he cant get close to someone he cuts the corner and then when he hits someone he says he blocked us then blames the wheeling and doesnt upgrade anti wheelie fake you this is fake u should make ur number 1 its like 3rd time i told you to use medium front soft rear just for once if there are no wheelie he will be flyyyyingg cheeky suggestion when youre popping a wheelie on hard accel quick shift up a gear feel like it works better for me not 100 sure tho love every episode class race also i reckon rossi will be a great contender for the title in 2020 also who is your favourite rider good video man really enjoyed watching it wish my start of the lights was as rapid for some reason i loos a lot just of the lights def will check more videos for some off the lights tops ps am i the only muppet on gp series running first person camera seems that the race starts are getting better lately with them upgrades and the ai seem stronger at assen compared to last season as well tom can you give a tips on how to do perfect start when starting the race i am still in moto3 season but i have no clue how to make a good start i am always slow as fuck what am i doing wrong just stumbled across this series out of curiosity and quite enjoy the vids doing a good job of them cheers anybody use simulator handlebars for these kinds of games tom please dont let the moto gp series die when formula 1 comes out the views and likes are better with moto gp the people have spoken tom why do the ai use hard mediums for the qualifying session do the developers know the glitch if it is one also to make qualifying more competitive why dont you match the ai and qualify on hard mediums as well i really need to see your controller cam bro hahaha we love your bike series videos better than f1 in my opinion keep it up tom tom teach aarava to play motogphe is the worst funny thow thank you tom for the series i love it nice video keep up the great work so nearly two wins nice one hello tom97 good luck and never give up tom next time can you do the indianapolis gp for the formula 1 come back with assetto corsa you are lucky to finish 2nd with your crash but in this game they have to do something for the start because bikers on the back of the grid can gain 20 places and bikers on the front of the grid can lose 20 positions and even can crash like rossi in this video what ai difficulty what on the slider are you using for this career use scott reddings 45 look mint if you change go for shoei or agvbut this shark matches your leathers use medium front soft rear for better launch and stability i think you should change your boots so its same with the bike like you do with your helmet ps i like ur new helmet what in the world ducati top speed only 200 kmh what just happened to this game i like the helmet but add more black line on the helmet plus in real life when you launch you never launch whisky redlining always before it red lines on superbikes about 10k revs your revs are too high during acceleration thats why it does wheelies change gear before it red lines plus dont let it over rev otherwise all superbikes power wheelie it really does help if you ride motorbikes in real life so you know how they behave especially 600cc plus ive ridden both 600s and 1000ccs people literally complaining about a fictional helmet when you corner do not willyyou get out of balance yea ure not supposed to ride over the kerbs so u wont go anywhere fast if u do also use lean forward to counter wheelies marc vds was better than this fool aprilia please use racing line motogp real life u need to develop the bike and do anti wheelie upgrades only way to control wheelieing you need some training for the motogp bro itll be stress but you should try develop the aprilia to the most i would like to watch your video like this fpq1q2race and try not to crash the other rider so it would be better how do make all the breaking points and not have the front fold or just miss the corner im really struggling even with the racing line on is it worth getting this year has anyone got it i can get it for 35 so just wondering if worth it havent had motogp game since 17 fuck me that helmet is killing me change the helmet it looks gash i dont know how it doesnt bother you haha i like your helmet forever never change the biggest topic of all comments section this season would be diffucult but also very interesting i hope you will get first points in motogp in next race maybe you will make new helmet in motogp btw great episode as always d i tried to warn you about earlier braketime oh by the way you lost a huge thing by not trying pack 3 oh and get that pink helmet d so people will appreciate your helmet you got now d so after this first impression about your moto gp 1 break earlier and accelerate faster after you took corner 2 dont use outside part of the track the curbs and the grass is lava 3 get every practice till you accommodate with the bike then you can find your own style and own lines again d or in other words i know its a race but ride with more care and you will be faster those slips costed you around 25 seconds a lap oh and just another reminder get your helmet ready for motogp im joking with it being pink but it would actually make my day if you did it ddd feel sad for you getting aprilia contract man change that ugly ass helmet do updates on this bike and chance your helm as someone else said your rear had no heat in it mate aprilla has got problem of wheele it is too unstable youll like that bike i think your rear was losing it a lot as it was too cold in the bottom right it was below 110 degrees most the race even though softs would have lost grip quicker theyd have kept temperature can you change your helmet love the video iv been watching all of them hei bro can u download some helmet cus it might be interesting to see some new look you need to take time out to practice throttle control just go easy at first youre too rough i dont know if this would work on this version of motogp but on the previous ones i would always do short shift up to 2nd and 3rd gears after the lights went out it did eliminate wheelie at the start u keep wheeling cause u hold the gas button down at the beginning when u get out tap it couple times then hold it am gonna be honest i would have tried all three packs that feeling when riotbox uploads another episode of career mode change the damn helmet buy me the game if you love your channel finally motogp debut crash gp 2020 do you have a motogp 2016 game first i couldnt make it to moto2 i even finished moto 3and couldnt move on how did you chance from moto3 to moto2 great moto 2 debut definitely a harder bike than moto 3 was theres two 97 i think option b too because i also think its aggressive and you know it looks lik u will play like a beauty because you do alec are you using custom set up or standard one if you lower 1st gear it will help with your starts could you up the number of laps maybe shorten your qualifying and prolong your racing hey tom i play this game a lot and youre right the moto3 bikes and moto2 are almost opposite in the way you ride them then premier class just feels like a really really fast moto2 bike with better brakes loving the vids mate never been a moto gp guy up until this career mode but youve got me hooked great video once again option b for the helmet when you do the last aw upgrade it literally removes all wheelie though you can use the rear break but only when you are entering the coners it gives you great steering in the coners you also may have noticed the huge sliding when straight line braking haha not okay the wheelies occur mainly because of the slow straight acceleration on this track this video was so relatable edit you can try to use the 200 rear brake disk in bike settings are you getting f1 2019 early like for the thicc boi bikes does the new game have any noticeable differences compared to last years game is it worth buying option b all the way also keep up these uploads man enjoying it way too much im not a motogp fan or anything but this series has really got me in the game your my benchmark to beat aha you didnt take assists off for usa they both look good but id say a blue yellow helmet would look better with the bike i feel not a moto gp fan or anything like that but im enjoying this series gloves and boots red collor the helmet b is awesome use it on this season oh shit i didnt get notification its not problem man keep it up you are doing a great job honestly this is shit gamedo like f1 2019 mode option b go to manual bike configgo to gear ratio reduce 2nd and 3r to the minimum then when exiting the first turn double shift gear you ride well and have a great aproach to the game go on tom nice vid what do you like more f1 or motogp waiting for your f2 debut u have the same numbah as vierge ive recently started to get interested in motogp and i really want to get this game but i want to buy f1 2019 and a thrustmaster tmx pro wheel first please in the next transfers if u get marc vds offer take it join with marquez n vierge anyway you have a same number with vierge helmet absolutly b have you had the patch today any good is it possible for ai drivers to go up from moto 3 to 2 to gp as well silly tom forgetting to put a poll you can already install f1 2019 on steam im so hype for this will tom make it to motogp how will he place this season find out next time on dragonbal i mean tom97 first ones to watchcouldnt wait any longerwhen is the next one coming mate i really enjoy these videosi do but youve got to just narrow down the race a bit so two races can fit in one video try cutting races to some key moments and little extras qualifiers as well cheers and whats up with the tyres where should i select the compound what does the percentage indicate a small part of the percentage bar became red i dont know why also how do you determine the corner entry speed and maintain the lean smooth throughout the corner my bike wobbles when i go hard on the corner please answer my questions man it will really help dude i just started playing this game and im really bad at this make a video on how to for this game why you cant win amazing domination for suzuki at home gp all the way to ducati good gp season mate bro do all the development tests to gain more rd to upgrade the bike you dont do this but you keep complaining about the bikes performance as a short term fix for the wheelie you could change your gear ratio and in the long run will give you better chances i think suzuki dominated the motegi what a race can you change the suit and the helmet by the way love the series 552 pauze and the indicator middle left says riotbox twice ducati factory all the way i think suzuki just good in corner not in straight line and what a pole great to see you on form maybe a secret love for the suzuki after all pick honda bro ok so it was unrideable yesterday and suddenly youre dominating i call bs better learn to player this game properly mate change your helmet please first first keep it up the vids why i cant change my number at career mode there is no option to customize number can you explain another solid set of performances this episode still a long way to go before im caught up yet though can u show the setup for the circuit of the americas im also racing against 120 ai but cant get the setup right to fight for a top 10 position youre the best player ive seen so far great riding what is ai did u do all your customisations on the controller it could be calculatom i think you need to remove those capslock on your abbreviation it would be interesting if aarava and ben and yourself online in this do a tutorial video please on how to design your own helmet i need it so much do you have like a supporting crew for your channel if you dont how do you upload so often more frequent than tseries keep it up new helmet and number look awesome love the nickname and the helmet awesome colors its a shame that the ai suck in qualy but i have to say the feeling of the bikes is brilliant i could do time trial around mugello all day nice video im hoping milestone update the ai soon as in my career all the times are broken lol hey tom nice vid as always did you check aaravas video it was very funny but one thing thats very interesting is that motogp series do winter testing thats amazing from this game i hope f1 does this someday edit tom please leave 120 ai because your bike should be battling for top15 so p8 in quali is really a great result in the bike youre riding nice video but i beleive your voice is out of sync i thought sometimes that your commentating came to early then wat was displayed on the screen you seriously need to put a tutorial on youtube on how you created your number and helmet nice new livery and number mate although gold was a better fit for you tom love this career mode i hope you wont change team and stay in for whole season to be more realistic even in this motogp game youre already a pro you did a great job on the helmet number and rider sticker change u ridding style please keep 120 please much better racing ais when you passed fenati i thought he was gonna pull your brake 120 ai is much more fun to watch you should do pro career man i think the rider sticker is cool just need to make it a tad bit bigger o think aw is anti wheelie are all the drivers playable what settings are you playing this

this subject and please like this is munch better then f1 this game is crack u beat others by 07s ata extreme difficulty and in f1 1056 is hard going to british gp 2019 cool tom great race tom and a shame that ending i won yesterday at argentina in moto2 d but i chose soft front medium rear and i had like 6 second gap but by the lap 6 my rear tire was gone and start losing pace it was really hard they improved the physics model a lot at the end i won but just by 0090 after having 6 to 8 secs gap im playing no assist pro physics but the ai only 85 but coming from my start on this game having assist and 60 i have been improving hahaa anyways great video tom i love your motogp content its really good and lets hope you recover your savefile for f1 2019 tom all right lets play some f12019 codies i am about to end this whole mans career petition to rename this series what if quartararo drove for pramac is there any rnd in motogp im new so yeah up the difficulty as suzukis shouldnt be doing that good for malaysian and valencia take good choice for tyres upgrade the engine it make you faster if you want is it just me or do all your videos have an audio delay u get bumped then theres a reaction 3 secs later nice that you are uploading more motogp 19 could we play some multiplayer together a co video for your channel maybe messing around on multiplayer a sudden change to agv the devils number when the season end i think pick whatever team you want but i think you need pick ducati for qatarargentinaand usa circuit its false motogp 18 best review and best serious video overall ive watched in ages thanks man great review youre hilarious and passionate i love it do ai riders actually have dnfs when they throw it down the road if i had more time and not so many unfinished or brand new games id have bought this 100 cause you really convinced me xd looks awesome and as weve been talking once i think moto gp games are much better than f1 games at the moment career mode looks amazing one of the best that ive ever seen on a sport game probably at the same level as the nba 2k franchise i used to play moto gp games on ps3 a lot much more than f1s unfortunately i dont see myself now getting involved in a game like the one you are showing us by the way amazing video so many improvements molto bravo ace ps still waiting for mgs gameplay pt2 though love the vid looks a great game sir gg a toi too much stuff what console do you use ps4 or ps4 pro galax reprend f1 stp jo f1 2019 cool test truck racing championship lets play please fais un lets play sur death standring likez bikes sucksthey are totally unrideable u r playing on xbox and u have written ps4 pc suzuki on the game keep your brake assist to lowit will help you while braking into cornershope this help you picked up the game today not happy with handling much respect to you for not tuning the bike look at some set ups on testing mate sort the bias out and look at downforce etc can someone teach me how to break like do you guys break with the front and back everyone notice at 001 no anti wheelie thats why every time at the pole position he will wheelie thats hard to control you cant get podium easily fck this shit im not watching this again u just crashed why not carry on wtffff u cheater please make scedule for upload ur vid join in honda fully upgrade the anti wheelie that helps a lot you djould have stuck with pramac im still baffled as to why you left to join suzuki when you literally had an offer from suzuki previously but chose to join pramac you are just wasting rd points by changing bikes every single window the first team that approached me for motogp was honda cals team and that bike is unridable its rubbish whats wrong with you mate come on be the winner ill be support you always after update this game doesnt run smoothly you should restart the lap when you exceed the track limits i think it would make it more realistic youre great keep doing what you do glad im not the only one who gets wheelies im also on the suzuki doesnt do all development tests to earn rd points to upgrade the bike complains how milestone ruined the game with wheelies 001 riotbox you got no anti wheelie dont blame the suzuki no antiwheelie will do nothing p f1 motogp content by the way riotbox to stop willys you should go to steering adjustment and add steering head inclination and trail because they lengthen the bike which makes the bike less willy happy your welcome do more of that practice session honda for next season you have to upgrade the antiwheelie for it to work the first upgrade helps but the final really does the job unrideable maybe its just you being terrible at the game huh dont blame the game when youre at fault riotbox turn that joint braking off my boy your better then that the title of the video is like alonso in 2017 except the f1 version i now have a lot to catch up on your motogp 19 career mode its been a while since the last episode of this series back in moto 2 good opening race how you can make the brand new bike without the upgrading and then the bike didnt wheele after exit of the corner finally thank goodness tom is the reason why i love motogp now is this on controller ive never played a motogp seems like a good game for when f1 2019 gets boring good ride as well hi tom i see you dont toggle the control electronic options like the aw eb and traction control dont even know what the first 2 do is it possible that you can make a video bout it if it is appicable pramac is an italian team then you can say at the end of the race grazie ragazzi forza pramac i love when you speack italian at last a motogp19 gameplay been waiting for so long show the pre season please since i couldnt send this on twitter ill sens it here hope u see this i have a suggesting and its a big if and you probably wont notice this but if u cant get your career mode save back which i bet you will but if you dont are you willing to restart and go to red bull i havent seen anyone do red bull yet yes its backkk finally motogp career great to see you back in gp tommy good opener going to british gp this weekend was there a podium in moto 3 andor moto 2 or just moto gp ive only watched moto gp once german gp but then i watched 5 laps or something but when you upload moto gp content i always watch it i saw on twitter you lost your career mode save hope you get it back finally some moto gp action tom what a season opener my friend i think the package you chose is heavy on tire wear but have much more horse power i just debuted on moto 2 yesterday d finish season with pramac dont move to a different team in the transfer window in the description hi says its qatar but its malaysia 1513 so the patch erased the team selection yet didnt fix the ai forgetting warm up laps were a thing the developers are on something motogp has testing in their games take notes f1 hope youll get back your f1 2019 career mode save i dont want it is ending toms rocking on twitter hi tom i have watched every motogp video from you and love it great tv replay race hello icerami in 31 minuts my new movie will be back stop this background music that was great race today what happend with maverick cool race ir incredible battle for dovi and marq happy eid al adha icerami great race again ice like hei ice look at highlights

quartararo 3 andrea dovizioso at least 3 likes your choice the last digit of likes on this comment so that is your prediction to win at austriangp first hey ice i uploaded a new video on my channel it would help me out if you check it out and give me your opinion d you really had to fight hard for the victory in both these races with the super aggressive ai please continue this series crazy bro austria is a strong track for u on f1 but achillies heel on motogp i played motogp 2017 and i had a really great time in the lower divisions i dunno if it was moto 3 or 2 when in the last race i entered on equal points and in qualifying we set the same lap times i got pole though because i was first to do it and in the race we crashed on the last lap when battling for 1st and i only beat him by 1 point to the finish engine breaking is not really an assist though is it tom you should consider doing 1 race in helmet cam the sense of speed its really great and maybe its a better challenge for you because you are op in this game hahaha d hi tom when can you the new f1 game upload thanks for change the ridding style buddy be the champions of moto3 and then u jump into moto2 choose big team in moto2 more fast upload this series love u video finally 1080p stay in moto3 for the rest of the season tom just move to gp2 then moto gp because your pace is strong love this video and the game first not going to lie im the type of person to stay with a rubbish team and build them up to be as good as the elite teams never switch that much who else hates the bikes respawn so quickly 828 u crashed again and cutted the video rins cheating 644 rins cheats do you use semi auto gear changes or manual riotbox agresif you can tell usare you afraid of the apex alex rins cheats 501 what a crash rins wiped every one out and the main reason for that is you race like a normal real race bruh u r not riding legit u just hit and overtake people u caused the crash not petrux ai still dont know how to warmup lap pretty much better game than motogp 18 yamaha next season love the home gp am i the only indian viewing this channel daily next season move to yamaha alex mad rins d thats my guy its a me no more moto gp been a couple weeks since last upload tom when does motogp return to the channel and so the moto 2 season comes to an end with three great races in a row cant wait for motogp wow suzuki took you for moto gp so already in a bike that can win races i think youll have this championship in the bag d sorry if already asked and answered but are you using wheel or controller or mk for motoracing do two motogp seasons schrotter in the second race wanted to take u out ahahahahaha wanted to take u out to be in the video ahahahaha motogp here tom goes no f1 gameplay today look at the tyres the ai use in practice and use those tyres in the race good luck tom97 maybe u can world champion with suzuki just one season im new to this series do you have like a real setup for motogp either the ai have been massively improved in a patch or that petronas bike is struggling for stability still good ride do you have it on pro or standard if you have standard what level do you it at the way you use the chicane your bike is not an f1 you know you should do a setup video for this game yo why did you switch teams when you knew the bike would be much slower moto gp is a good game but where is f1 where is f1 2019 seems like this is sort of motogp road to glory series this yamaha both satellite and factory just like irl so badly lacks top speed and power needs all the development to really be challenging for the title i actually really wish someone other than milestone got the rights to the motogp games there work over the last couple of games jas just been unacceptable someone with more talent really needs this title can you imgaine how polished the product would be if codemasters were behind it they do an excellent job on the f1 games i mean every other racing game is miles better than motogp there quality is just to low compared to other titles its been a tough season but youll get by man you may find it easier if you run tcs on 2 you will get more bike response as well as more reactive throttle application and stop worrying about oversteer i think you will find that the more you move around and keep getting kicks the faster you will go i can do low 30s to mid 29s all the time around here the bike setup also has a big effect too well that was disappointed race but i am sure you gave everything dont worry next race you will be strongerkeep pushing are you getting enough power out of this bike tommy but your hanging in thereexciting career mode tom its the top 10 on fp combined table that go straight to q2 so watch the gap to 10th place not 12th mad respect for getting that bike with zero upgrades into p5 in qualifying this bike doesnt sound nearly as good as the ducati did p im enjoying the series so much as much as i love f1 2019 im actually really enjoying this series i dont even watch moto gp so im lost so moto2 bike is a step above moto3 i thought it went rbr moto2 moto3 motogp another question i won the red bull rookie championship thought i was on moto2 and was winning them all offered moto3 ride before i won the moto2 championship i went i have won 3 straight seasons of moto3 and cannot move up to motogp i am lost help lol every second episode is dissapointmentwhy that putting a rider way out front was the same glitch that was in mgp 16 the feedback in the controller reminds me of sbk 2000 when you could injury your rider i did just that when i felt the back end start to slip it then tossed haga off ruining the rest of my season that was the same glitch that was in mgp 16 this game honestly sucks ass no way is it worth 40 the rider that you were battling other than marquez is pronounced leckawona name is lecuona championship objective xd team just be in top 20 and we are happy riotbox are you kidding lets win this championship why use a gp thumbnail if youre racing in moto2 these are great watches tho i like you make this with qualification will you do gp class 1 race per episodein each episode do all the sessions like in moto3 first race first pole but not first podium because of your bad exit in the last corner and not first win if you want development pointyou should play fp3and play data test firstafter finishing all data target go to track how you get to moto2 matei already finished moto3 but no offer from moto2 change helmets please nice video too amazing fight with schrotter nice video but you need to change your helmet lower the difficulty hey can any of you guys download helmets designs on ps4 yet up your difficulty you should be in the midfield with that bike yeah navarro fernandez bulega and bastianini are horrible in this game come on they are good riders and schrotter is the best who prepared that category the ai only does well in qualifying when ur on the track what difficulty are you on seems like your quali laps arent perfect but u still get pole try to gently press rt instead of revving the bike through the corners youll get much more grip i miss booth amos do a first person race please upgrade the bikes bro i am in moto2 now as well and its munch different then moto 3 i wrote this on a previous video your start is really really slow because you are full gas before the race starts try to reach the spot between the end of the white area and the begin of the red area of the rpms when the lights go off you can accelerate with full gas hope it helps new vidio if you turn the manual start on your get better starts maybe make the good helmet pliss first i got a 5 second penalty for commenting first the game original must will be

moto gp games awesome racing if you ever have trouble qualifying wait until under 2 minutes to end the grip is amazing i like your riding styleyou are trying to clean pass your opponents not like other pushing themgood race you make the game look way too easy what a battle this looks good who thinks they are gonna get this game for new ill probably keep playing f1 until i maybe get it tv replay again hey and ice if you could check out my new video i am finishing editing of my another video vrtg alex marquez championship ice dovi has lost his memory a moment and rins just got a 2 wins since americasgp better than real event excellent battle irl rins and marc mm93 fan but happy for 42 what do u think ice also a big crash for dovi and fabio poor dovi in real race and what a race for rins heiice rins is so dangerous in last lap and win 1stand marquez 2nd what a race 351 give oliveira penalty great race im sad for the crash you is a champions gg icerami dont forget watch motogp silverztone 2019 next race you will back and stronger i believe in you great battles dovizioso and marquez like in real life and so sad for you ice with cal huge crash why crashed halllo icerami how are you 4 for c yanti i thinked about rossi he created best qualification in this year i hope this review will help any of you mx and sx fans out there that might want to check out motogp 19 lets hope some of the features make their way into mxgp 19 and the next supercross game have you played any of the ride games two was my favorite but three is solid too thanks for covering the games that matter two us two wheel enthusiasts thanks for the review glad to say i purchased motogp 19 usually a 4 wheel gamer but lately i find myself reaching for the controller instead of plugging in my wheel also bought mxgp pro and looking at one of the me games next i guess me2 would be the obvious choice i must give the bikes a run in dakar 18 for all its flaws it does offer something different in terms of game play nice job with the channel plenty of variety and entertaining information here great idea for mxgp 2019 lets hope milestone take note of all the feed back hope they do nice video hes only gone and done it in his first season of the game already d moto 3 world champion just a few races left to finish the season hi tom do you play controller does anyone know the vid is behind the sound it hasnt synced congratulations world champion tom just letting u know that the sound and vid are slightly off for me might be on my part but its off sound is too early 144 couldve been possible in qualifying but you got pole so theres no reason to complain dont use soft soft tyres in quali as the ai dont and use the same tyres as them is motogp2019 easy as well tom how do i decide what tires to use in what conditions hey can any of you guys download helmets on ps4 yet dat helmet tho how tf do you you make this game looks easy hahaha ive been playing this game whole day and i cant even follow the racing line with all the assist on do you think the ai is too easy on this game i find them ridiculously slow on the wet and think they should go up to atleast 130 just to cover the faster players why are you driving with only 3 laps youre running at 115 while aarav is running 40 thailand and japan look so damn good in 360p also champions baby hoping for the constructors championship too next time this post was made by 360p gang great end to a great debut season in your motogp 19 career mode hopefully moto 2 will be the next step did u watch last nights game of motogp do other riders get promoted to moto 2 eg javi garcia well congratulations to the real boothamos who scored his first points today in a really crazy moto 3race o wow tom very nice video but dont you think boothamos and garcia in the front is bug if you watch them in real races they dont go very well lol use the new patch the ai are much stronger please bring us some action on moto 2 you really shouldnt have started last in the races knowing you couldve won the constructors can you actually crash out of the race i dont like how you go down and then just respawn like nothing happened kinda hope they fix or make the ai better looks a very good game but f1 2019 will arrive so i wont play it that much if i bought it and there are exams right now unfortunately next up moto2 best series of moto gp on youtube congratz mate why dont you switch teams mid season in moto 2 i think u dont have any good offer bcs poor 3 race in this episode hope u get good offer in the next transfers yes thank you i love this

dovizioso 316 pts we will see last race great episode shame you took a break on this series for a while as it was getting interesting in the championship however i see that i caught up at the absolute perfect time can you use a wheel for this game this is very shame you should complete moto2 season first then f1 im only fine with temporarily losing this series since it means more f1 videos nobody navarro i am fast as fuck boy cant wait for f1 2019 most for f2 what team you will choose couldve done the contract offers before in case you got a motogp offer and could end on a cliffhanger navarro probably got nerfed in the update because they made the rider performance more like real life loving the motogp series tom great work looking forward to the f12019 series keep up the great work mate ill probably miss this career mode a lot as it has been the only good content in motorsport gaming apart from aarava if f1 2019s career mode is as good as hyped then ill be very happy with the break hope the red beast gives you good luck in the next career mode this is a real shame u have been my favourite motogp19 career mode by far can you do a road to glory just like aarava im sure well all love watching it just like aarava keeping it all light hearted not too serious and jokes everywhere possible i bought motogp 19 so its ok with me that your going to play the game you want tom nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah hey hey hey goodbye motogp content for now tomorrow starts f2 with tom what a great day to start d sadly i dont have the money right now to buy it and start on 27 c hope i can get it unliked unsuscribed dont like youtubers that dont finish what they start 159 were gonna finish f2 and head into motogp nice vid you can see that your video has very good quality and therefore i love to look at this channel go get that 30k tom i dont know why they always go hards hards in qualifying that was some monsoon at aragon which really made you have to defend from your rivals and an insane recovery drive from garcia at misano as well from outside the top ten i absolutely love this series and an upload every day you got yourself a new sub do you hyped of the new f1 2019 game new subscriber here love your video mate you are driving 115 ai not 120 tom more fast upload this series bro why is ai driving the quali with hard tyres tom just as a side note once you go up into moto 2 first the ai will get more difficult and second and this was my experience so far is that the starts will be really difficult to get right so better watch out anyway great video as always and keep up the good work do i get a reply for being second yes early upload can you show us your driver aids watch robo46 much more exciting hey next is ausrian not british you always going wide what about suzuki no track limit your set up for this race was terrible really enjoying your videos thanks this new helmet is beautiful pls use nolanxlite u definetely crashed when u cut the video just admit it hy can you get a different brand of helmet can you do a special helmet design for your home gpsilverstone love your videos keep it up bro maybe add riotbox of the back of rider how do u control a gp bike so well take ducati factory team next transfer window maybe you should change your glove and boots colour im back is the best when going into straight why your top speed cant reach 300kmh can you please play cricket 19 livestream for thaigp this weekend you dont know how to play it always out of the track can you not wily please riotbox why you dont use medium front and soft rear get well soon buddy glad that youre back uploading i really like ur motogp vids keep up the good work roitbox can you try the fia truck racing game and the nascar heat 4 on your channel or even cricket 19 love you so much keep making great content aswell jee your back love your vids i am your greatest fan interesting episode due to the tyres making an impact on both races there u absolute mercedes liar saying pole and the race will be difficult takes pole by 12 seconds i would love a game on console with wec cars and so on i think would be a good change tom im not gonna lie the first race really has convinced me to buy the game now this is the racing experience i need awesome race in mugello you had your high gears set pretty good but i would put 1st all the way to the right for max acceleration for the start last race at mugello final lap turn final corner into straight line nice battle hahaha awesome stuff man also im impressed you can actually pronounce navarro xd i still dont understand how to take good starts in this game use the same tyres as the ai in quali why do you only use front brake idk about in game but irl all the ktms are at the bottom of moto2 and ktm tech 3 are junior to ktm just an opinion though this was a super episode great fun to watch my god that race at le mans was top notch waiting for the 1 hour video superb race so much battle i love it hey tom how are you how does the new ai work you find them better i saw that in helmet cam now we can see tyre temps thats awesome but i didnt do any race yet with the improved ai systems your helmet looks like simonchellis from the back great race bro i really enjoyed this series so far great job awesome video love this series and channel tom please tom pretty please change your number because xavi vierge i think have the same numbers as you make a home race helmet like how motogp riders and f1 drivers doit will look awesome in f1 2019 in f2 in what team can i start i heart something i will have 3 options start for russel norris or albon and 3 races in f2 and then f1 just realized that theres another rider with 97 as their number just like you im surprised thats allowed in the game so for moto2 and the motogp game as a whole are you automatically promoted to the next division of racing regardless of placement or performance in the previous season or is it more of a contract system where you can be held back based on team performance i love your videos and i cant wait for the f1 2019 series and im loving the motogp series so far how much time does it take to go to hd quality love the vids good luck tom97 first to watch can you take techn3 for the new season weve already seen suzuki pick lcr or ktm or aprilia again what a difficult end but you are a triple world champion maybe i make a mistake i dare ya to win the championship with ktm tech3 d poor performance bruh go with alex rins stay at honda or make a return for yamaha thats the best options i would say ktm for next season if not lcr ktm next season increase the difficulty level in next season i too keep different bike setups for brno and valencia how to earn development points in moto gp 19 how to do quick lap simulation riotbox please help first comment bro a genious game played on x box one x the finest of racing adrenaline pumping unreal engine doing an amazing job play with semiautomatic gear and brake the same button and helmet view no other helpers then you are there like in real life and not too difficult but dear milestone please make an update it is totally redicoulous to add the posibillity of choosing a female player they sometimes look better and then out comes a wide shouldered person with no hips and breasts the commentator even say now he goes to the track come on milestone woman and girls in racing is a possibilty when u say a you also have to say b a breast hips and she update as soon as possible bro how to earn development points in moto gp 19 the third lap was your lap you overtook all the field in front of you rossi rins marquez and dovi but you couldnt finish ahead of dovi and indeed what a save whats ur difficulty should have upgraded the antiwheelie rather than engine braking i might start my own chanel but i dont know how havent you already done suzuki remember you said it was unrideable alongside can you upload f1 19 too on alternate days motogp and f1days or episodes as you like to do im on a moto2 ktm because my ps4 reset and i lost all my progress my vote go back to aprila love it mate and for ur team next season i would say ktm or lcr could be good urrr up the difficulty plz part 76 wow i just started watching you yesterday im on part 11 so far to go great content dude you do know theres an add on for this game that allows you double the development points you can get 120 points if you do all three stack your bike up quick do your anti wheelie first or tap the throttle a bit coming out of the corner upload fast we need these go to ktm im on one as well lets go champ d this is my last video before my summer break 78 days i have a vacation next week so guys next video will be on 29 or 30 july what that is you my name in this game is wartegkonspirasi
